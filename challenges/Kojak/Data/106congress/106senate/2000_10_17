Mr. President, I appreciate the Chaplain of the Senate \nopening today's session in prayer for Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan \nand for his son, Randy Carnahan, and for Chris Sifford, all of whom \nwere tragically killed last night in a plane crash in Missouri.\n  Mel Carnahan and his wife Jean were good friends of mine and my wife \nJanet. We got to know them through the Governors' Association--a \nwonderful man, wonderful family man, one of the finest human beings I \nhave ever met. From a personal point of view, my sympathy goes out to \nJean, his wife, and to the rest of his family and to the citizens of \nMissouri. This country lost a great leader.\n  On behalf of the entire Senate, I express our deepest sympathies to \nGovernor Carnahan's wife Jean and to their sons, Russ, Robin, and Tom, \nand to their grandchildren, Andrew and Austin. They have lost a father, \nhusband, grandfather, son, a brother, and an uncle. This is a terrible \nburden to carry, and we wish them God's strength and courage in so \ndoing.\n  The entire Senate joins me in expressing condolences to the citizens \nof Missouri who have lost the Governor\nN O T I C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2001, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $393 per year or $197 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased for $4.00 per copy.

We also extend our \nsympathies to the family of Chris Sifford.\n  All of us involved in statewide public office know the dangers of \nflying across our States for different events. So when a tragedy such \nas this occurs, it hits especially hard. When I woke up at 6 o'clock \nthis morning to the public radio saying Mel Carnahan and his son were \nkilled, it reminded me how fragile life is and how so often we take \nlife for granted. It also reminded me that each day we live, we should \nthank God for it and let the people with whom we come in contact know \nthat we love them.\n  This is a sad day for our country. As I said, Mel Carnahan was truly \na great leader and made a great contribution also to the National \nGovernors' Association.\n  Many Senators knew Governor Carnahan and will be making remarks today \nand in the next few days.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I received a phone call early this morning \nfrom my personal assistant, Janice Shelton, who indicated to me that \nGovernor Carnahan was dead, having been killed in a tragic plane crash \nwith his son, Randy.\n  I have watched very closely Governor Carnahan for the last 18 months, \nas we have watched the most noted Senate race in America this year \nbetween two very fine men, Senator Ashcroft, formerly the Governor of \nMissouri, and Governor Carnahan. It was a great race to watch because \nthey were so devoted to their different causes. There was distinction \nbetween the campaign philosophies. It was a race where the numbers \nnever changed more than a point or two: For 18 months, back and forth, \none ahead by a point, the other ahead by a point.\n  At this time, we realize that those numbers don't mean a great deal, \nthat races in which we are engaged involve good people. Governor \nCarnahan, what a wonderful man. I got to know him very well, and his \nwife attended many functions in which I was in attendance. He dedicated \nhis life to public service. The State of Missouri and the country will \nbe less as a result of losing this fine man.\n  As has been indicated by Governor Voinovich, Senator Voinovich, our \nhearts go out to the entire family and the people of Missouri. Also, as \nSenator Voinovich and I were talking before the Senate convened, we \nhave a great amount of sadness for Senator Ashcroft, who is going \nthrough a difficult time now as a result of this, always wondering, \nhaving flown around the State himself, as we all have, trying to \nunderstand this life that we lead. So not only do I extend my sympathy \nto the Carnahan family, but also to Governor Ashcroft, and the fact \nthat in this country we can have people who have strong beliefs, \ndiffering beliefs, yet people of great moral certitude who believe very \nstrongly in their causes. That is what makes this country as great as \nit is.\n  It is with a great deal of sadness that I came to work today. It is \nwith a great deal of sadness I am with the Dean of the Senate and \nSenator Voinovich who is opening the Senate today. This will have an \nimpact on my life, always, having known him and suddenly his life is \nsnuffed out. I am a better person for having known Governor Carnahan. \nThe people of Missouri are better off as a result of his service. I \nwish Godspeed to the people of Missouri and the Carnahan family.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not also \nmention that I was asked by Senator Kit Bond and Senator Ashcroft to \nalso publicly express their sympathies to the people of Missouri on the \ndeath of Mel Carnahan. Both Senator Ashcroft and Senator Bond served as \nGovernors of the State of Missouri and knew Mel Carnahan quite well. We \nknow there was a campaign going on, and I am sure this is also very \nheavy on John Ashcroft.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to make a comment about the tragic \ndeath last evening of Governor Carnahan of Missouri. Governor Carnahan, \nof course, was also a candidate for the Senate, a Governor of Missouri, \nLieutenant Governor, and a distinguished officeholder for many years in \nthe State of Missouri. His tragic death last evening is something that \nobviously allows all to say to his family, his widow, and the folks who \nwere his friends and relatives, that our thoughts and prayers are with \nthem. It is a difficult time, I know. This is a man who gave so much \nservice to his country and such distinguished service to our country.\n  My thoughts are with him and his family this morning.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I extend my deepest personal sympathies to \nMel Carnahan's family. He was tragically killed in a plane crash last \nnight. All Members want to serve our country as well as we possibly \ncan. We go the extra mile to serve our people. We all know the dangers \ninherent with flying in small aircraft to try to attend political \nevents and try to make meetings on schedules that are very uncertain.\n  All in the Senate are particularly grieved in this tragedy. We extend \nour most heartfelt sympathies to the Governor's wife, his family, to \nhis campaign team, and all who were involved. It is difficult to \nexplain how deeply we feel about this.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to urge that Congress enact the \nRetirement Security and Savings Act, which has passed the House and \nbeen reported unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee. This is a \nbalanced, bipartisan bill. It will encourage people to set their own \nmoney aside for retirement, by reforming the private pension rules and \nincreasing the amount that people can put in an individual retirement \naccount. It also will create two important new savings incentives. One \nis a tax credit for small businesses that set up pension programs for \ntheir employees. The other is a tax credit for low and middle income \npeople who save for their own retirement. If, before adjourning, we can \nfind a way to enact this bill, it will be a significant addition to the \nrecord of the 106th Congress. Let me explain why.\n  The American people have many wonderful qualities. But, these days, \nunfortunately, thrift is not one of them. During the last 20 years, \npersonal savings rates have consistently declined, from 9 percent of \nGDP in the 1970s to less than 1 percent now. In fact, the preliminary \nnet personal savings rate for August is the lowest rate since the \nCommerce Department began keeping records in 1959. So what? Why does \nthis matter?\n  In the first place, a low savings rate means that less capital is \navailable for new investments. Perhaps that is not a pressing issue \nright now, with a booming economy. But it should be. Over\n\n[[Page S10607]]\n\nthe long run, a low cost of capital is essential to our international \ncompetitiveness. On top of that, a low savings rate means that people \naren't putting their own money away for retirement. That makes them \nmore dependent on Social Security. In fact, 16 percent of today's \nretirees depend exclusively on Social Security for their retirement \nincome, and two-thirds depend on it as their primary source of \nretirement income.\n  We need to protect Social Security. But that is not enough. After \nall, Social Security only replaces about 40 percent of the income \nearned during our working years. If retirees continue to rely so \nheavily on Social Security, there will still be far too many Americans \nspending their retirement years one step away from poverty. We need to \nsupplement Social Security, by encouraging more Americans to save for \ntheir retirement. And we can start by passing the Retirement Security \nand Savings Act, as reported by the Senate Finance Committee.\n  As a threshold matter, the bill does two important things. First, it \nreforms the tax rules for pension plans. It makes pensions more \nportable. It strengthens pension security and enforcement. It expands \ncoverage for small businesses. It enhances pension fairness for women. \nAnd it encourages retirement education. Second, the bill increases the \ncontribution limits for individual retirement accounts. IRAs have \nproven to be a very popular way for millions of workers to save for \nretirement, particularly for those who do not have pension plans \navailable through their employers. The IRA limits have not been \nincreased since they were created almost two decades ago. An increase \nis long overdue. These are positive changes. However, by and large, \nthey reinforce the conventional approach to retirement incentives. That \napproach can best be described as a ``top down'' approach. We create \nincentives for people with higher incomes, hoping that the so-called \nnondiscrimination rules will give the higher paid folks an incentive to \nencourage more participation by others, such as through employer \nmatching programs. I do not have a problem with this approach, as far \nas it goes. But it does not do enough to reach out to middle and lower \nincome workers.\n  That is why I am particularly pleased that the bill goes further, by \ncreating two new savings incentives. One creates a new incentive to \nencourage small businesses to establish pension plans for their \nemployees. The other creates a new matching program to help workers \nsave their own money for retirement. Let me discuss each in turn.\n  First, the incentives for small businesses. Unlike larger companies, \nmost small business owners do not offer pension plans. While three out \nof every four workers at large companies are participating in some form \nof pension plan, only one out of every three employees of small \nbusinesses have pensions. This leaves over 30 million workers without a \npension plan. It is not that small businesses do not want to provide \npension plans. They simply cannot afford to. Record-keeping \nrequirements are too complex and expensive. The bill addresses this, by \ncreating two new tax credits.\n  The first is a tax credit of up to $500 to help defray the \nadministrative costs of starting a new plan. The second is a tax credit \nto help employers contribute to a new plan on behalf of their lower \npaid employees. In effect, it is a match of amounts employers in small \nfirms put into new retirement plans for their employees--up to a limit \nof 3 percent of the salaries of these workers. Taken together, these \nnew incentives will make it easier for small businesses to reach out to \ntheir employees and provide them with a pension. In addition, the bill \ncreates a new tax credit that is aimed primarily at workers who do not \nhave a pension plan available to them, to encourage them to save for \nthemselves.\n  Only one-third of families with incomes under $25,000 are saving for \nretirement either through a pension plan or in an IRA. This compares \nwith 85 percent of families with incomes over $50,000 who are saving \nfor retirement. We clearly need to provide an incentive for those \nfamilies who are not saving right now, and the individual savings \ncredit included in the Finance Committee bill will provide that \nincentive.\n  Here is how it works. A couple with a joint income of $20,000 is \neligible for a 50 percent tax credit for the amount that they save each \nyear, for savings of up to $2,000. People with higher incomes get a \nsmaller match, up to a joint income of $50,000. According to the Joint \nTax Committee, almost 10 million families will be eligible for the \nindividual savings credit. This will provide a strong incentive for \nthese families to begin setting aside money for their retirement. That, \nin a nutshell, is how the credits work. Let me respond to the common \ncriticisms of the proposal.\n  One is that the tax credit for low and moderate income workers is not \nrefundable and therefore will not benefit lower income families that \nhave no tax liability. All that I can say, in response, is that I am a \nrealist. I agree that the credit should be refundable. But, this year, \na refundable credit is not in the cards, because it generates strong \nopposition from the majority. Another criticism, from a different \ndirection, is that the credit is targeted to a specific income class, \nand provides taxpayers in that income class with too much of a benefit. \nI disagree. This is not a novel approach. Many provisions of the tax \ncode are phased out at higher income levels, as a way of targeting \nbenefits and reducing the revenue loss.\n  Another thing. By targeting lower and moderate income workers, the \ncredit provides balance. The benefits of the other provisions of the \nbill go primarily to higher-paid workers. After all, if we increase the \namount that can be deferred in a 401(k) plan more from $10,000 to \n$15,000 a year, we are only benefiting folks who can afford to make \nthat much of a contribution. So a credit targeted to low and moderate \nincome workers provides the overall bill with balance.\n  In conclusion, I urge the leadership, on the tax-writing committees, \nin the Senate, in the House, and in the administration, to work \ntogether to secure passage of this important legislation. We continue \nto have a rip-roaring national economy. But many people have been left \nbehind, good people, who are working hard to make ends meet. Let us \nreach out to them. Let us make an effort to give every working person \nin this country a real stake in the American dream. Maybe some young \nworker will see this tax credit and start to put away a little money \nthat he or she otherwise would have spent. That money will compound, \nand so will the virtue of thrift. And that, Mr. President, will be good \nfor all of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is with a sad heart that I speak this \nmorning. We now all know that we have lost the Governor of the State of \nMissouri. Gov. Mel Carnahan was killed in a plane crash last night. \nLike another man from Missouri, Harry Truman, Mel Carnahan was a man of \nplain speech and enormous political courage. I believe he would have \nbeen a great United States Senator, just as he was a great Governor. \nHis death is a loss to the people of Missouri and to all Americans.\n  Mel Carnahan spent his life in public service. In this time of \nskepticism and cynicism about politics and politicians, it is worth \nnoting that Mel Carnahan could have done anything with his life and \nbeen a success. His intelligence, his drive, his dedication, his hard \nwork, would have landed him at the top of just about anything he chose \nto pursue. But Mel Carnahan made a choice early in his life that he \nwould enter public service and that he would use his enormous talents \nto help people, and that is what he did.\n  In the State legislature, as State treasurer, as Lieutenant Governor, \nand during his two terms as Governor, he worked to help people, to make \ngovernment efficient, and to use the tools at his disposal to make a \ndifference to people's lives.\n\n  Whether it was improving public schools, expanding health insurance \nfor children, stricter safety standards for nursing homes to protect \nseniors, or passing some of the toughest anti-crime measures in the \nnation to make communities safer, he made a difference.\n\n[[Page S10608]]\n\n  When Governor Carnahan raised taxes in 1993 to improve Missouri \nschools, it was an act of political courage that he said was part of \nhis job. ``It was the right thing to do,'' he said later. It was the \nright thing to do. If one principle could sum up Mel Carnahan's entire \npolitical career of public service, it would be just that--he saw what \nneeded to be done, and he did the right thing, regardless of political \nconsequences.\n  He saw what needed to be done, and using that strong inner compass of \nright and wrong that steered him through his entire life, he made his \ndecisions--not based on polls or focus groups or other political \nconsiderations, but on what was the right thing to do.\n  Last night, we lost a true public servant--the kind whose service on \nbehalf of people brings honor to all of us who have chosen a similar \npath for our lives. The fact that his son Randy was with him makes the \npersonal tragedy suffered by the Carnahan family all the more crushing. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with Jean Carnahan, and the Carnahan and \nSifford families in this time of sadness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is a vote on the Agriculture appropriations bill \nconference report.\n  I am a member of the subcommittee dealing with Agriculture \nappropriations in the Senate. We have had a lengthy conference with the \nHouse of Representatives and have reported out a piece of legislation. \nWhile I am critical of the farm bill we have in this country because I \nbelieve it does not work, I do not want to start with criticism of \nanything or anybody. Rather, I want to start with compliments.\n  I compliment Senator Thad Cochran who is the chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. He does just an excellent job. \nI appreciate very much the work he does.\n  I compliment Senator Herb Kohl who is the ranking member on that \nsubcommittee.\n  I thank Galen Fountain, our minority clerk on the subcommittee, who \ndoes a lot of work with us, and good work; Rebecca Davies, Martha \nScott-Poindexter, Les Spivey, Hunt Shipman--staff people who have done \na great deal of work to put this legislation together.\n  On my staff, Dale Thorenson and Nicole Kroetsch, Brian Moran, and \nStephanie Mohl, who worked on parts of this. Thanks to all those \npeople.\n  When we bring a piece of legislation to the floor of the Senate after \nit has gone through conference, it has gone through a long, tortured \nprocess. It is not an easy thing to put together. It represents a lot \nof work and compromise. Thanks to all the people I have mentioned.\n  I will try to, for a moment, describe why all of this is important to \nme. There are a lot of things in this legislation dealing with \nresearch, agricultural research, food research, Food for Peace--you \nname it, there is a whole range of programs that deal with very \nimportant and serious issues. But I want to focus on one thing, and \nthat is family farming.\n  I come from a State that is largely an agricultural State. The fact \nis, our family farmers in this country are in deep trouble. Some people \nprobably couldn't care less. They get their butter from a carton, they \nget their eggs from a carton, they buy their milk in a bottle, they get \ntheir pasta in a package, and they couldn't care less what is happening \nto family farmers.\n  Those who think a lot about it understand the importance of farmers \nwho are out there with their families living on the farm, with the yard \nlight that illuminates their place at night. They understand its \nculture, and understand its contribution to our country. Those who \nthink about it understand the importance of broad-based economic \nownership in our country's food production.\n  I want to read a couple of letters because we are in a situation \nwhere commodity prices have collapsed, the grain prices are rock \nbottom, and our farmers are in desperate trouble. They are losing their \nlivelihood, losing their farms, having to quit. This is a letter I \nreceived a couple of days ago from a woman named Lois. I will not read \nher last name. I do not know if she has indicated she would want me to \nread this on the floor of the Senate. This is a family farm in North \nDakota. Lois and her husband run a family farm. The letter says:\n\n       Dear Byron, it's 6 a.m. I woke up [this morning] and feel \n     compelled to write, as I feel farmers here are now at rock \n     bottom.\n       Right now as we harvest a worthless crop, pay huge \n     prices for our oil products, face winter and bills to pay, \n     we find the [crops sprout damaged and injured] by rain. \n     Harvest brings more stress and fears to all of us. I'm \n     afraid for us. I'm afraid for my neighbors and others like \n     us who can't make a profit thru no fault of our own. We . \n     . . have other jobs, but we can't keep farming. . . . I am \n     taking time off these days (from my work) to drive a grain \n     truck. I'm hauling grain that is below $1 a bushel. . . . \n     We need a price that is more than cost. It's called \n     profit. I don't have a lot of answers. We've attended many \n     meetings. . . . We can feed the world . . . we should feel \n     pride in that.\n\n  But what's wrong? There's something not connecting here.\n  She, like so many others, is trying to make a living on a family \nfarm, and they are going broke.\n  A farm family--a man and his wife--wrote to me about a week ago and \nsaid:\n\n       It is with tears in my eyes that I find myself writing to \n     you today. After I have been assisting in what should be a \n     joyous time, it just couldn't be further from that. So for \n     the first time, I am taking steps to try and find help, for \n     not only ourselves, but all of those who are worse off around \n     us. Somebody has to help us now. . . . My husband and I \n     farm--near a small community in the northwest corner of North \n     Dakota.\n       We are blessed with some of the greatest soil and we felt \n     very fortunate until now that it has helped to provide us \n     with thousands of bushels of grain, plus cattle. In fact, up \n     until recently, we had thought we were very fortunate. We \n     couldn't have been more wrong, however.\n       We are facing the worst times our 3rd generation farm has \n     ever seen since its existence began in 1914. As combines are \n     cutting our fields, the last thing I would normally be doing \n     right now is writing a letter, but we have no choice. \n     Something has to be done and people need to know what kind of \n     devastation is [occurring] in our economy.\n       It was just this morning that we were told that our very \n     rare and beautifully colored, disease free durum wheat is now \n     only worth 80 cents a bushel. Our neighbors were not so \n     ``lucky.'' There is no market for theirs as it was not close \n     to perfect.\n       Our banks will not collect on their loans, young people \n     like ourselves are going to just pack up and leave. . . \n     . There is just no reason for us to continually be abused. \n     . . .\n\n  She raises the questions, as other farmers do, about everyone else \nmaking record profits that handle their grain. The grain elevators, \nrailroads, and the grain trade all make record profits.\n  She says:\n\n       We are one of the very few young farmers left in our \n     community and after this harvest there will be many more \n     forced to leave. There just will be no alternative.\n\n  Another letter from another family farm in North Dakota. A farmer \nwrites:\n\n       So why do I write? Simply to encourage you to continue the \n     battle, to be a voice alerting the nation to the financial, \n     cultural and social devastation that is taking place in rural \n     America. As a seventy two year old lifetime farmer, now \n     retired, I am a witness to farm after farm being \n     discontinued. The immediate community in which I live vastly \n     changed and changing. Good young family farmers are quitting \n     one after the other, some forced out financially, others \n     giving up before complete financial ruin. There is no profit \n     incentive, the gamble is too great, the fight against \n     weather, disease, regulations and prices too heavy a burden \n     to bear.\n\n  This farmer writes:\n\n       Personally, I have a son now forty five, who has farmed \n     since graduating from the University of North Dakota. His \n     hope is fading. He talks of farming one more year and [then \n     giving up]. He is a fourth generation farmer ready to give \n     up. His son now seven never to continue into the fifth \n     generation [on the family farm].\n\n  He says:\n\n       My concern is for my family, my community, the nation.\n\n  I will not read any more. I have so many letters from farmers. They \nare out there wondering what is wrong with an economic system which \nrewards everyone except those who produce the crops.\n  Some say: The ``family farm,'' that is kind of like the little old \ndiner that\n\n[[Page S10609]]\n\ngets left behind when the interstate comes through. It was a great old \nplace once, but it is irrelevant now because the interstate moves \npeople past that diner. They say that is what the family farm is like. \nThey couldn't be more wrong.\n  I have indicated before, go to Europe, if you wonder what an economy \nought to be with respect to rural values. Europe was hungry at one \npoint so it decided never to be hungry again. One part of national \nsecurity is to make sure you have a network of producers, a network of \nfamily farms producing your food. That way you will not have \nconcentration; you will have broad-based economic ownership, and you \nwill provide national security with respect to food. Europe has a \nhealthy agricultural base. Europe has family farmers who are making \nmoney and small towns that have life on their main streets. Why? \nBecause Europe has chosen an economic model that says they intend to \nkeep their family farmers on the farm.\n  Our country ought to do the same, for a whole series of reasons, some \neconomic, some cultural, some social. But family farms contribute more \nthan just grain. They contribute families, yes; they contribute \ncommunity; they contribute a culture that is very important to this \ncountry.\n  A wonderful author named Critchfield used to write about the \nnurturing of family values in this country. He said family values have \nalways started, in the two centuries of America, on its family farms, \nand rolled to its small towns and to its cities. The refreshment and \nnurturing of family values has always come from the seedbed of family \nvalues; and that is our family farms.\n  If one wonders what kind of cultural devastation occurs or what kind \nof cultural changes will occur in this country if we lose our family \nfarms, our rural economy, and turn into a country in which corporations \nfarm all of America from coast to coast--one can see that model in a \nnumber of other areas. It is not something that advances our country's \ninterests. Rather, it retards our country's interests.\n\n  So I do not come here making excuses in support of family farms. I \ncome saying that the support of family farms is essential for the long \nterm well-being of this country.\n  How do we support family farms? Well, we have a farm bill that is a \ndisaster called Freedom to Farm. We gave farmers so-called freedom to \nfarm, but not freedom to sell. So farmers are prevented from selling \ninto certain markets. The freedom to farm is a presumption that \nindividual family farmers have the economic clout in which to deal with \neveryone else with whom they have to deal.\n  Does a family farmer have a chance when complaining about railroad \nrates? I do not think so. Ask the folks in Montana who filed a \ncomplaint against the railroad rates. Ask them if they got a fair shake \nwhen it took 16 years to get the complaint processed down through the \nICC.\n  Who wins when the family farmer is overcharged by a railroad for \nhauling grain? The railroad wins.\n  Who wins when the food manufacturers or the grain trade takes a \nkernel of wheat, moves it somewhere down the line on the railroad and \ninto a plant, puffs it up, puts it on a grocery store, and calls it \npuffed wheat? Who wins when they take produce from farmers and give \nthem a pittance for it, and then charge a fortune for it on the grocery \nstore shelf? It is the same kernel of wheat, only it has had a puff \nadded to it. The puff is worth more than the wheat. The people selling \nthe puffed wheat are making a fortune, and the family farmers are going \nbroke.\n  Is that an economic model that has any justice in it at all? The \nanswer is no. So we ought to have a farm program that works. And we do \nnot. Next year we ought to commit ourselves to repealing Freedom to \nFarm, and rewriting a bill that works for family farmers, that provides \na safety net for family farms in the country. This is not rocket \nscience. They do it in Europe. We ought to be able to do it in our \ncountry.\n  Let me describe, just for a moment, what we have in this \nappropriations bill. We have disaster assistance in this appropriations \nbill.\n  I want to show a couple of charts that talk about what happened in \nNorth Dakota in the spring of this year after the crops were planted. \nThis chart happens to show a grain field. It does not look like it, but \nit is a grain field. From the evening of June 12 until the morning of \nJune 14--a day and a half--a stalled thunderstorm system--actually \nseveral thunderstorms converging together--dumped as much as 18 inches \nof rain in the Red River Valley, near Grand Forks, ND.\n  North Dakota is a state that usually gets 15 to 17 inches of rain a \nyear. We are a semiarid state which averages 15 to 17 inches of \nrainfall a year. From June 12 through June 14, in some of these areas, \nwe had 18 inches in 36 hours.\n  A few days later on the evening of June 19, around 7 o'clock in the \nevening, flash flooding and severe thunderstorms hit the Fargo-Morehead \narea about 80 miles south of the first set of storms in the Red River \nValley. By 11 p.m. that evening, more than 4 inches of rain had fallen, \nand it looked as if maybe the worst had passed. But thundershower after \nthundershower pummeled the area after midnight, dropping an additional \n2 inches of rain in 90 minutes. So, this area ended up with a total of \n6 inches of rain in a very short period. This is a totally flat \nterrain. It caused massive sheet flooding. Throughout the area around \nFargo, seven to 9 inches of rain in total fell in the timespan of 6 \nhours.\n  This chart shows what a grain field looked like the day after. Here \nis another picture of grain fields. As you can see, there is no grain \nthere. This is a lake. In fact, this area used to be Lake Agassiz long \nbefore any of us were around. But you can see what this does if you are \na family farmer and you have been out in the spring planting grain. We \nnow have a flood.\n\n  The floods in North Dakota, the drought in Texas, the drought in \nGeorgia, the drought in Mississippi, and other parts of our country, \nthe disasters in Montana, all persuaded this Agriculture appropriations \nsubcommittee to add more funding for disaster aid. We originally added \n$450 million for Crop Loss Assistance due to weather disasters when the \nbill was in the Senate--an amendment I offered on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  When it went to conference, the need was obvious, so we added more. \nIt went to $1.1 billion for disaster aid because we had had continued \ndisasters in Texas and in the Deep South. In fact, look at Georgia \nhere. The weekend before we lost our late colleague, Senator \nCoverdell--who was a distinguished Senator and one I deeply admired--\nthe weekend before we tragically lost our colleague, I had spoken to \nhim about what was happening in Georgia. He said that he was going to \ncosponsor with me a disaster piece that would provide assistance for \nfarmers in that area of the country. We had need--because of the \nfloods--in our area as well.\n  We have had drought in the Deep South. As shown on this chart, we can \nsee these red areas. We have had flooding in other areas. We have had a \npretty difficult time this year in many areas of the country.\n  So this piece of legislation adds $1.1 billion for disaster \nassistance. This help allows farmers who have been struck by natural \ndisasters to be able to claim some help for crops that they were not \nable to harvest.\n  In addition to that, we had folks up in this part of North Dakota \nthat harvested a crop--a crop that looked great--but they had a \ndisaster when they delivered that crop to the grain elevator. They took \na durum crop from the field--a 45-bushel-to-the-acre crop, which is a \npretty good crop--only to discover that when they got it to the grain \nelevator it was full of disease and sprout damage. They found out that \ngrain they thought was going to be worth a decent price was now valued \nby the grain trade at only 80 cents a bushel.\n  The cost of producing this grain is probably $4 to $4.50 a bushel. \nSo, they had a field waving in the wind, getting ripe and ready to be \nharvested. They got the combine out, took the grain off, and then \ndiscovered what cost them $4.50 a bushel to produce was now worth 80 \ncents. To make matters worse, they also found out that the crop \ninsurance they had taken out to insure their crop does not provide help \nfor them to cover the quality loss.\n  That is called a quality loss adjustment. Actually a better word for \nit is a\n\n[[Page S10610]]\n\ncatastrophe. If you have a product that you have produced, and it turns \nout to be worth almost nothing, that is a catastrophe.\n  Here is what has happened to our farmers. You can see, going back to \n1996, wheat prices were very high. That is when Congress passed Freedom \nto Farm. Many of us stood on the floor of the Senate warning, at that \npoint, this isn't going to continue. But Freedom to Farm provided \nspecific payments over a period of time after which there would be a \nphaseout of the program altogether. You can see what has happened to \nprices. You can see with prices at rock bottom, having collapsed and \nstayed down for some while, that the quality loss adjustments mean that \nfarmers are getting pennies for their crop.\n  This disaster is not a natural disaster, but rather it has resulted \nin quality loss adjustments by the grain trade that had to be addressed \nin this bill. For the first time, this legislation will provide $500 \nmillion for quality loss adjustments. I will talk through that for a \nmoment so people understand why this is in the bill and why it was \nnecessary.\n  These farmers haven't caused the problem. These are good family \nfarmers who have discovered that their crop, especially in our part of \nthe country up in North Dakota, with the worst crop disease in a \ncentury, these are farmers who have discovered that they have produced \na rather bountiful crop that is worth nothing when they take it to the \ngrain elevator. Without the quality loss assistance, we would have had \na wholesale migration from our family farms. We are going to have a lot \nof migration anyway by family farmers who simply can't make it. But the \ndisaster aid and the quality loss adjustment is going to be a step in \nthe right direction by at least extending a hand to say until we change \nthis farm bill, here is some help.\n  I pushed very hard on quality loss assistance. I know I might have \nbruised some feelings here and there, but I just didn't think we had \nany choice. We can't say to family farmers, when their prices are \ncollapsed, that it doesn't matter. We can't say to family farmers who \nare out there struggling: When your crop is hit by disease, it doesn't \nmatter; when your crop insurance doesn't pay off, it doesn't matter; if \nyou are hit 6 or 7 years in a row by natural disaster, as has been the \ncase with many counties in North Dakota, it doesn't matter.\n  We have a responsibility to define the kind of economy we want in \nthis country. The kind of economy I want is an economy that values that \nwhich is produced on our family farms. Our farm program needs changing \ndesperately. We have not been able to get that done this year. In the \nmeantime, this piece of legislation, this Agriculture appropriations \nbill, does provide some fill so that with respect to disaster and \nquality loss adjustments, we are able to provide some short-term, \ninterim help to family farmers.\n  I say to Senator Cochran, Senator Kohl, and others who were willing \nto allow me to press as hard as I did to put this in the bill, I \nappreciate--and the family farmers in my State will appreciate--the \nopportunity to continue to try to make that family farm work and to \nmake a living.\n  I say, again, that we have a responsibility to decide as a Congress \nwhether we want family farms in our future. For those who don't, let's \njust keep doing what we are doing and that is where we will end up. We \nwill eventually not have any family farmers left in this country. But \nfor those who, like me, believe that a network of family farms is \nessential to this country, to its culture and its economy, then we \nbetter wake up and work together and write a farm bill that works and \ngives farmers some hope. We better do that, not 2 years from now, not 3 \nyears from now. We better do that now.\n  We are about ready to adjourn, I suppose, at the end of this week or \nthe end of next week, and we will reconvene as a Congress, the 107th \nCongress, in January. My hope is one of the first items of business is \nfor us to understand that rural America has not shared in this \nbountiful prosperity of our country. It is not just that food has no \nvalue. You look around the world at night on your television screen, \nyou will discover that there are people who are hungry, there are \nchildren who are going to bed with an ache in their belly in every \ncorner of the globe. Food does have value. But the food that is \nproduced in this country, regrettably, has value only for established \nmonopolistic interests, those who have become big enough to flex their \neconomic muscle at the expense of those who produce the food.\n\n  Everyone who touches a bushel of grain produced by a family farmer \nseems to be making record profits. Every enterprise that touches it \nseems to be doing well. The railroads, the grain trade, the grocery \nmanufacturers, they are all doing well. In fact, they are doing so \nwell, they are marrying each other. Every day you read about another \nmerger. They want to get hitched. They have so much money, they are all \nrolling in cash. It is the folks out here who took all the risks and \nplowed the ground and seeded the ground and harvested the crop. They \nare the ones who can't make a living. There is something disconnected \nabout that kind of economic circumstance.\n  We can have the kind of economy we choose to have. It is within our \nability to define the kind of economy we want for this country. I hope, \nbeginning next year, we will decide that there is a different way, a \nbetter way to extend the help for family farmers with a farm program \nthat really works during tough times and a farm program that we would \nnot need during better economic times when grain prices reflected the \nreal value of the grain produced by family farms.\n  We have made some progress in the Agriculture appropriations bill \ndealing with sanctions. It is not the best, but we have made some \nprogress. Many of us in the Senate, many in the Congress, have believed \nthat it is relatively foolish for our farmers to bear the brunt of \nnational security interests by having sanctions against other countries \nthat say you can't ship food or medicine to certain countries because \nwe are angry with their leaders. That has never made any sense to me.\n  We can be as angry as we like with the country of Iran or Libya or \nCuba or Iraq, but refusing to ship food to those countries doesn't hurt \nSaddam Hussein or Fidel Castro. All that does is hurt hungry, sick, and \npoor children. It hurts hungry people, sick people, and poor people in \ncountries to which we are not allowed to ship food and medicine. Talk \nabout shooting yourself in the foot, our public policy has been to say \nready, aim, fire, and we shoot ourselves right smack in the foot on the \nissue of sanctions.\n  I don't have a quarrel with those who want to strap economic \nsanctions on the country of Iraq. That is fine with me. But sanctions \nshould not include food. We have tried mightily to get rid of the \nsanctions with respect to a range of countries with whom we now prevent \nthe shipment of food and medicine. This legislation marginally moves in \nthat direction. It includes some elements of the amendment I put in the \nappropriations bill as it went through the Senate. But, once again, it \nis reactionary with respect to Cuba. There is going to be no grain sold \nto Cuba because of restrictions put in here by a few people who were \ntrying to hijack this debate in the conference. The result is it \ntightens up on travel restrictions to Cuba, and virtually means there \nwill be no food sold in Cuba. In my judgment, that is very foolish, but \nwe will live to fight another day on that issue. At least part of what \nis done in this legislation dealing with sanctions on agricultural \nshipments is a step in the right direction.\n  There is much more to talk about in this legislation. Let me end by \nmentioning my thanks to the people who helped put this legislation \ntogether. It is not easy to do. On balance, while there are some things \nI don't agree with--I have not described what those are--I think it is \na good piece of legislation and a pretty good appropriations bill. It \nought to be a precursor for all of us who support family farmers to \nunderstand that year after year, when you have to add a disaster piece \nand emergency pieces to deal with the failure of a farm program, it is \ntime to rewrite the farm program from the start.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10611]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10611-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMPLETING THE WORK OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I understand we are about to recess for \nthe day. I want to discuss for just a moment, if I may, my observations \nabout the week and the lack of any activity or communication with the \nDemocratic caucus. I am told that the majority leader has indicated to \nhis caucus members that there won't be a vote tomorrow and that the \nvote will be postponed on the Agriculture appropriations bill until \nThursday.\n  I am surprised by that announcement, first, because I had not been \nforewarned or informed in any way that this would be the schedule for \nthe week. I also am disappointed because I have indicated to a lot of \npeople that they needed to ensure they would be here tomorrow at 11:30. \nThey have all made plans accordingly. A lot of people have arranged \ntheir entire week around the fact that tomorrow at 11:30 there would be \na vote. I am told that our Republican colleagues may simply go into a \nquorum call at some point and force the Senate into a vote on Thursday, \nwhich is, of course, their right. We will insist on a vote on \nadjournment tomorrow. There will be a vote tomorrow.\n  We think we ought to be here, working, resolving the outstanding \ndifferences. The longer we are gone, the less likely it is we will \nfinish our work. It is that simple. How many days do we have to go with \nabsolutely no business on the Senate floor? We could be taking up an \narray of issues. We could be taking up unfinished business that begs \nour consideration. Yet we sit day after day holding hands and wondering \nwhen, if ever, we will adjourn sine die. This isn't the way to run the \nSenate.\n  At the very least, there ought to be a minimum amount of \ncommunication between Republicans and Democrats with regard to the \nschedule. To read an announcement that there will be a vote \npostponement and not to give forewarning to all of our colleagues who \nare making travel plans is, again, just another departure from what I \nconsider to be good will and common sense.\n  We will delay the vote at least until 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon \nbecause of the Cole funeral. We understand there will be Members who \nneed to travel to Virginia for that very important matter. We will \ndelay the vote until at least after 4 o'clock. I want colleagues to \nknow there will be a vote tomorrow and we will force that vote. We will \ncontinue to force votes to keep people here to do what they are \nsupposed to do.\n  I have also just been in consultation with a number of our colleagues \nfrom the White House, and they have indicated they will begin insisting \non much shorter continuing resolutions, 2 or 3 days at the maximum. I \nhope the President will veto anything longer than a 3-day CR. Why? \nBecause it is ridiculous to be taking 7-day CRs, leaving 5 days for \ncampaigning and 2 days for work--if that. We should be working 7 days \nwith a 7-day CR. We should be finishing the Nation's business with the \nCR. To give every single candidate, whoever it is, the opportunity to \ncampaign while leaving the people's business for whenever they can get \naround to it and delay it to another occasion when it is more \nconvenient for them to come back is unacceptable, inexcusable, and will \nnot be tolerated.\n  I put our colleagues on notice that in whatever limited way we can \ninfluence the schedule, we intend to do so. That will at least require \nperhaps a little more consultation but, at the very least, a little \nmore forewarning to all colleagues with regard to the schedule and what \nit is we are supposed to be doing here.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Democratic leader if he has ever seen in his many \nyears in the Congress, both the House and the Senate, the casual \nattitude, with so few appropriations bills having been passed? We have \nless than 3 weeks left until the elections of this cycle, and we are \nhere doing nothing. Has the Senator ever experienced anything such as \nthis?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have seen recesses that are more productive than what \nwe have experienced since we started passing CRs. These recesses, as I \nlike to call them--7 days of continuation of a resolution, and then 2 \ndays, if that, of work, maybe 1 day of work--are mind boggling.\n  There ought to be some urgency here. We ought to express the same \nlevel of urgency that a continuing resolution implies. But I don't see \nany urgency. I see no sense of determination to try to finish our work. \nIf we take a poll of where our colleagues are today, they are cast out \nover all 50 States, with very little appreciation of the need to finish \nour work, to come back and do what we are supposed to do.\n  (Mr. ROBERTS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I know the Presiding Officer is required to move on and \nis being replaced again by a very distinguished Presiding Officer from \nKansas, our colleague, Pat Roberts, but I appreciate very much the \nquestion posed by the distinguished assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask the Senator one more question; that is, I \ndon't know what will happen this weekend, but I can only speak for \nmyself and a number of other Senators with whom I have had the \nopportunity to speak on the phone and in person today. We should be \nworking this weekend. For us now to not have votes until late Wednesday \nor maybe even Thursday, and to take Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and maybe \nMonday off? I want the leader to know that there are a number of us on \nthis side who feel the urgency is here; we should press forward and \nwork through the weekend.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me respond to the distinguished Senator from Nevada. \nFirst, I would like to see if we could work on Tuesday. I would like to \nsee us work on Wednesday. But as he has noted, given the urgency of \ncompleting our work, Saturday and perhaps even Sunday would be a real \ndeparture from current practice.

Mr. President, Americans are rightfully horrified and \nalarmed at the news reports and stories about so-called ``child \nsoldiers'' pressed into service in paramilitary armies around the \nworld. In Cambodia, the Sudan, Lebanon, and elsewhere, we gaze into the \nhard-eyed stares of barefoot ten-year-olds cradling well-worn rifles \nand machine guns. These children have known nothing but violence. It is \nhard to imagine how they will ever be able to move beyond such \nviolence, should peace ever be established in their homelands. They do \nnot know how to live under the rule of law, only under the rule of \nmight makes right. They have a very casual attitude about killing other \nhuman beings.\n  We certainly would not want our own children to experience such a \nlife, and we would not want such a generation of casual killers to grow \nup amongst us. Yet, in the midst of all of our affluence, we are \nrearing a generation that is appallingly casual about violence, a \ngeneration that is appallingly self-centered about getting--or taking--\nwhat they want. Too many of our children live lives heavily influenced \nby a completely unrealistic set of expectations and examples. In the \nmovies, when something bad happens to someone, does he or she turn to \nthe police for help and then retire to the background\n\n[[Page S10612]]\n\nwhile the police deal with the problem? No, of course not. Our hero \ngrabs a gun and gives chase. Bullets fly, explosions and car crashes \nensue, and the audience is treated to every gory detail. There is no \nfading to black anymore to let our imaginations fill in the details. \nNo, our hero leaves a bloody trail of death and destruction in his wake \nand goes home with the girl--and none of those details are left to our \nimagination, either.\n  Now, instead of the aforementioned action-adventure, one could opt \ninstead for some other movie genre but many are worse. Horror movies \nhave taken violence against the innocent to new, ever-more-squeamish \nlows. The realistic and grisly visuals are, no doubt, a tribute to the \ntalents of makeup and special-effects artists, but, nevertheless, I \nremain unconvinced that putting these nightmares on the silver screen \ndoes anything but tarnish the screen and the imaginations of the \nviewers. Some of the subject matter in these films is so misogynistic, \nso filled with contempt for societal order, and so filled with \ninvective and hate, that it should set the alarm bells ringing in \npeaceable folks and incite them to demand greater responsibility from \nthe entertainment industry.\n  I have always instinctively, intuitively felt that people who can \nlook with equanimity on this kind of violence, even on screen or on the \nradio, might themselves be open to such action. In fact, this does seem \nto be the case in practice. We surround our children with these so-\ncalled ``role models,'' and then, for amusement--and I use that term \nlightly--we let our children play games in which they get to act out \nthis lifestyle.\n  What are we doing? We send our children the message that real life is \ndull, and that this is what we do for fun. We allow them to watch so-\ncalled movie stars create mayhem without ever facing the consequences. \nThen we allow our children to listen to music that may also be filled \nwith violent lyrics. Then we let our children amuse themselves by play-\nacting that they are the killers. We allow them to have hours, \nsometimes, of simulated target practice--and we pay for the privilege. \nShould we then be surprised when our children come to believe that \nviolence against others is just one stop along the continuum of \nacceptable behavior?\n  Our children may go to school every day. They may have a roof over \ntheir heads at night. Perhaps they have nice clothes to wear. They may \nhave parents who love them. They may have, in short, everything, but \nthey have, in too many cases, developed the same hard-eyed stare that \nthose Cambodian child soldiers have. They have developed the same \ncasual attitude about violence and in far too many cases, they act out \nthese violent impulses, with tragic results.\n\n  I have long shared the concerns of many parents and grandparents that \nyoung people are being exposed to far too much violence through the \nmedia--through the movies, through television, rock music--if you can \ncall it music--and video games. The entertainment industry, however, \nhas generally rebuffed criticism about the content of its programs and \nproducts, and about concerns that too much exposure to violence is \nharmful to our young people. The industry, in fact, has repeatedly \nclaimed to be making efforts to reduce the exposure of young people to \nviolence, including instituting a system of labeling program content so \nthat parents are supposedly better able to evaluate the programs, and \nvideo games and what goes for music that their children watch and play.\n  Now it seems as though the entertainment industry has been caught \nwith its hand in the cookie jar.\n  Just a few days ago, the Federal Trade Commission--the agency \nresponsible for enforcing consumer protection laws--released a report \nfinding that the entertainment industry aggressively markets violence-\nridden materials directly to young people. This report details how \ncompanies, on the one hand, stamp ``mature audience'' ratings on their \nproducts that contain violent material, while on the other hand, these \nsame companies peddle these ``mature''-rated products to young people.\n  Let me just read a passage of the FTC report: ``Two plans for games \ndeveloped in 1998 described its target audience as `Males 17-34 due to \nM rating. The true target is males 12-34.' '' In other words, not 17 to \n34, but 12 to 34. There it is--in black and white! Video game marketers \nacknowledge that they are giving a quick wink to their own standards \nand then they state their true target. This is especially significant \nsince only the electronic game industry has adopted a rule prohibiting \nits marketers from targeting advertising for games to children below \nthe age designations indicated by their rating. So the FTC has knocked \na huge hole in the industry's pious statements of concern by \nhighlighting its hypocritical marketing practices.\n  You may recall to memory the story of Hansel and Gretel--a story that \nis not without its own share of violence. Just as Hansel and Gretel \nwere enchanted by the evil witch's gingerbread house, our children are \ndazzled by the entertainment industry's lurid images. The industry \nbeckons our children with advertising and once they are in the \nindustry's clutches, the children are fattened up with more violent \nmaterial. Of course, in the story of Hansel and Gretel, the children \nrealize they are about to be cooked and eaten, and they trick the witch \nand shove her into the oven. Would we could do that with the \nentertainment industry. But I am not suggesting that we shove the \nentertainment industry into the oven--but perhaps we do need to turn up \nthe heat!\n  The impact of media violence on our children is of great concern. \nNumerous studies conducted by the nation's top universities in the past \nthree decades have come to the same conclusion: namely, there is at \nleast some demonstrable link between watching violent acts in movies, \ntelevision shows, or video games and acting aggressively in life.\n  As parents, policymakers, and citizens and legislators, we should all \nbe worried about this. The amount of entertainment violence witnessed \nby American children is alarming.\n  Film makers, striving to turn profits in the competitive film \nindustry, display more and more explicit violence, and programmers \ndevise increasingly violent computer and video games that have children \ntake on roles in which they are rewarded for the number of enemies they \nkill. Is it any wonder, then, that children become numb to the horrors \nthey witness daily in their entertainment? Is it a surprise that these \nsame children have a world view that incorporates violence as an \nacceptable means for settling conflict? Of course not.\n  If the industry is unwilling to address the concerns of parents by \ncontinuing to market inappropriate material to children, and then to \nbroadcast that material at times when children are most likely to be \nwatching, then I think it is incumbent upon Congress to act. We cannot \nbe passive about this issue. We cannot say how awful it is--``How \nawful''--but then fail to take action. If the entertainment industry \nwill not act responsibly, if the industry will not work with parents to \ncraft commonsense approaches to curbing inappropriate programming, then \nit will fall to Congress to address the situation. Will it? Reducing \nthe violence placed before America's children in the guise of \nentertainment is an important task. Images seen in childhood help to \nshape attitudes for a lifetime.\n  I know that I am not alone in recognizing the threat to our society \ncreated by producing our own generation of child soldiers, of young \npeople indifferent to the suffering they cause by their violent acts. \nThis FTC report merely provides evidence that, like the tobacco \ncompanies, the violent entertainment industry is targeting our children \nto build a nation, not of addicts, but of indifference to excessive \nviolence. We cannot let this continue. But will we?\n  If the entertainment industry cannot abide by, and will not enforce, \nvoluntary guidelines to regulate media violence, then it is time for \nthe rest of us to insist that those guidelines be enforced.\n  That might be a good question for tonight's debate. I wonder if all \nthe questions have already been determined. Why not some questions of \nthis nature?\n  I realize that legislation to address this issue is unlikely to see \naction in the very few days remaining in this Congress. In fact, I \nwould not like to rush such legislation and risk doing it poorly. Of \ncourse, it will not be done and cannot be done in the few days that \nremain. I would rather finish the\n\n[[Page S10613]]\n\ncritical appropriations work that still remains. But I do hope that \nthis report will not be lost in Olympic and election hoopla. I intend \nto revisit this issue next year, and I hope that other Members will \njoin me in a sincere and bipartisan effort to find a way to protect our \nchildren and our society.\n  It is the same old story, Mr. President, the same old story. We talk \nabout it. We wring our hands. We wail and gnash our teeth and moan and \ngroan about the entertainment industry. But we welcome those \ncontributions from the entertainment industry. They are great. They are \ngreat. But we are paying for it with the denigration of our children.\n  When will America awaken? When will the candidates be asked piercing \nquestions about their stands on matters such as this? I would like to \nhear their answers. Tonight, in that townhall meeting, would be a good \nplace for those, wouldn't it?\n  What are you going to do, Mr. Candidate, about the entertainment \nindustry? How much money have you already accepted? Are you going to \naccept money from the entertainment industry? If you do, then how can \nyou turn around and do something in the interests of our children? A \ngood question.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe pending legislation, which will fund three major Departments in the \nUnited States: The Department of Labor, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, and the Department of Education.\n  I chair the subcommittee in the Senate Appropriations Committee which \nhas the responsibility for this legislation. I am very concerned about \nwhat is happening to our constitutional process. I think it not an \noverstatement to say that we have a constitutional crisis in what is \nhappening with the appropriations process in the relationship between \nthe Congress and the President of the United States.\n  Since the Government was closed in late 1995 and early 1996, there \nhas been created a very significant imbalance between the Congress and \nthe President with what is realistically viewed as practically a \ndictatorial system of the President saying what is acceptable and the \nCongress being held hostage, in effect, concerned about being blamed \nfor shutting down the Government. That is not the way the Constitution \nwas written.\n  The Congress is supposed to present the bills to the President. If \nthe President vetoes, then there are negotiations and discussions as to \nwhat will happen. But the status of events today is that the President \ncalls the tune and the Congress simply complies.\n  There is also a significant deviation because, contrary to \nconstitutional provision, the President and the President's men and \nwomen participate in the legislative process. The Constitution says \nthat each House shall pass a bill; there will be a conference \ncommittee; they will agree; and each House will then vote on the \nconference report; and, if approved, the bill is submitted to the \nPresident.\n  The constitutional process does not call for the executive branch to \nparticipate in deciding what will be in the bills. But for many years \nnow, representatives from the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, sit \nin on the conferences, are a party to the process, and seek to \ndetermine in advance what will be acceptable to the executive branch, \ncontrary to the constitutional setup where Congress is supposed to pass \nthe bills and submit them to the President.\n  We have had a very difficult time in the last 3 years with what has \nhappened with the appropriations bill covering Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education. I spoke at some length about this problem on \nOctober 14, 1998, as we worked for the appropriations bill which turned \nout to be an omnibus bill. I was so concerned about the process that I \nvoted against that bill. That was a tough vote to make since there were \nso many items on financing education which were very important and with \nwhich I agreed, and on financing Health and Human Services, again, \nwhich were important and with which I agreed, and on financing the \nDepartment of Labor, again, which were important and with which I \nagreed; but I felt so strongly that I voted against the bill and spoke \nat some length, as the Congressional Record will reflect on page \nS12536, on October 14th of 1998.\n  Then on November 9, 1999, I again expressed my concerns about what \nthe appropriations process comprehended as set forth in some detail on \nS14340 of the Congressional Record.\n  This year, again, I am very concerned about where we are headed. The \nPresident submitted requests for these Departments for $106.2 billion. \nThe Senate bill has provided the total amount which the President \nrequested, but we have established some different priorities. That, \nunder the Constitution, is the congressional prerogative. The \nConstitution calls for the Congress to control the purse strings and to \nestablish the priorities. Of course, the President has to approve. But \nhere again, the Constitution does not make the President the dominant \nplayer in this process; the Congress is supposed to traditionally \ncontrol the purse strings.\n  Working collaboratively with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Tom Harkin, we produced a bipartisan bill. I learned a long \ntime ago that if you want to get something done in Washington, you have \nto be willing to cross party lines. Senator Harkin and I have done \nthat. When the Democrats controlled the Senate, he chaired and I was \nranking member; and with Republican control, I have the privilege, \nhonor, to chair, and he is the ranking member. We have taken a very \nstrong stand on appropriations for the National Institutes of Health, \nwhich I believe are the crown jewel of the Federal Government, maybe \nthe only jewel of the Federal Government. This year we have increased \nfunding for NIH by $2.7 billion, which is $1.7 billion more than the \nPresident's priority. Last year we appropriated $2.3 billion on an \nincrease which, with an across-the-board cut, was reduced to $2.2 \nbillion. The year before, it was a billion, and the year before that, \nalmost a billion. So that we have added some--it is $2.7 billion this \nyear, 2.2 last year, 2.0 the year before, a billion the year before \nthat, and almost a billion the year before that. So that we have added \n$8 billion. I think it adds up to $8 billion; when you deal with all \nthese zeros, sometimes they are not too easy to add up in your head.\n  The Senate approved that, and the House approved that. We think with \nthe enormous progress made on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and cancer \nand heart disease, and so many others, that is where the priorities \nshould be. We also put in $1 billion more on special education than the \nPresident had in his budget, a matter of some concern to many in the \nSenate. With the leadership of the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, who is now presiding, we put extra funding there because we \nthink that is where the priorities ought to be. Then the President made \na request for $2.7 billion for school construction and new teachers. \nThere is a lot of controversy in the Republican-controlled Senate about \nwhether these are appropriate Federal functions, but we ended up, in a \ncarefully crafted bill, giving the President his priorities, with an \naddendum that if the local school district decided they did not need \nthe money for construction, that the local school districts could \nallocate it to local needs. And if the local school districts decided \nthey did not need the money for teachers, they would give it to local \nneeds.\n  The President has resisted this. This is a very fundamental \ndifference in governmental philosophy, a Washington, DC, bureaucratic \nstraitjacket versus local control--according to the President, the \nfirst call for his own programs on construction of schools and on more \nteachers.\n  We worked very hard this year and the Senate returned a bill which \nwas passed on June 30, which tied a record going back to June 30, 1976, \nwhen the fiscal year 1977 appropriations bill was passed. Then we \ncompleted the conference with the House, where we had it all set on \nJuly 27, which I think may have established a new record. I am not sure \nabout that. And we did not add the final signature to the conference \nreport\n\n[[Page S10614]]\n\nbecause we didn't want to be in a position where the bill was sent to \nthe President in August and held up there, but we finished all of our \nwork.\n\n  Regrettably, this bill has not been presented to the President \nbecause of the efforts on negotiations with the White House to try to \nget a bill which the President could sign. I repeat, I think it is a \nmistake, constitutionally and procedurally, to do that. We ought to \nsend the President the bill.\n  There have been, candidly, concerns within the Republican leadership \nwhere we have had bicameral meetings between the House and the Senate, \nthe leadership, on precisely what should be done. It is my urging to my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the House that we should stand by our bill \nof $106.2 billion, which is as much as the President asked for, and we \nshould stand by our priorities, which give $600 million more to \neducation. There is no higher priority in America than education. And \nwe should stand by our priority of according $1.7 billion more to the \nNational Institutes of Health. We should stand by our approach of \ngiving the President what he asked for on teachers and school \nconstruction, subject to local determination if the local boards decide \nthey do not want it for those purposes. But we ought not to buy our way \nout of town and to knuckle to the President and cave to the President. \nWe ought to assert our legislative institutional standing.\n  This bill could have been presented to the White House in early \nSeptember. This Senator has pressed consistently in leadership meetings \nto present the bill to the President. It is my hope we will do that.\n  I am not unaware of the fact that this is October 17 and that the \nPresidential election will be held 3 weeks from today. But I think we \nare dealing with values and principles here, constitutional principles \nwhich are paramount, and we ought to assert our legislative \nprerogatives and submit the bill to the President. There might be an \nopportunity for a national debate on this subject. Certainly it is \nworth an effort.\n  There is no doubt that the President has the so-called bully pulpit, \nbut there is a lot of concern in America on what the funding is going \nto be for the Departments involved here, not only the Department of \nLabor but certainly the Department of Education and certainly the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. We ought to lay down a marker. \nWe ought to lay down the gauntlet, and we ought to ask America to join \nin a debate to see where America's priorities lie.\n  My own instinct is that we have the high ground here and we have the \nbetter case. So I hope the Congress will submit this bill to the \nPresident, will engage in that debate, and will assert our \nconstitutional prerogatives to legislate. I think we have a good chance \nto have this bill finally enacted into law, or if it is vetoed, with \nsome national debate, something very close to it.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to clarify the history \nand intent of section 14 of the Transportation Recall Enhancement, \nAccountability, and Documentation Act, which passed the Senate on \nWednesday. This section of the legislation is based on the Child \nPassenger Protection Act of 2000, which I introduced on February 10, \n2000 with my colleague from Arkansas, Blanche Lincoln, and my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum.\n  The purpose of the Child Passenger Protection Act of 2000 is to \nenhance children's safety in motor vehicles. It calls for the adoption \nof improved child restraint safety performance standards and testing \nrequirements, and it requires the Secretary of Transportation to \nprovide parents with better consumer information about child \nrestraints.\n  Child deaths in motor vehicle crashes in the United States have \ndeclined some since 1975, but significant work remains to be done in \nthe area of child passenger safety. Motor vehicle crashes are the \nsingle leading cause of death and serious injury for young children in \nthe United States.\n  Each year, up to 600 children under the age of five die in car \ncrashes, and up to 70,000 are injured as occupants in motor vehicle \ncrashes. Motor vehicle crashes cause about one of every three injury \ndeaths among children 12 and younger in this country.\n  A child restraint that is installed and used correctly can prevent \nmany injuries and deaths. The failure of some consumers to use age- and \nweight-appropriate child restraints has been well documented. Many \nconsumers who purchase and use child restraints have little guidance or \ninformation with which to distinguish among the broad array of models, \nsizes, shapes and features of child restraints that are being sold in \nretail stores.\n  A child restraint that is well designed can prevent still more child \ninjuries and deaths. The former top safety official at the National \nHighway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA), Dr. Ricardo \nMartinez, stated, in a letter dated September 14, 1999 to all \nmanufacturers of child restraints sold in the United States: ``[m]any \nrestraints have been engineered to barely comply with some of the most \nsafety-critical requirements of the [Federal] standard.'' NHTSA also \nhas questioned the efforts of some child restraint manufacturers to \nhave child restraint defects characterized as ``inconsequential'' to \navoid recall campaigns, and the agency recently suggested that child \nrestraints be assigned safety ratings.\n  NHTSA is the agency within the United States Department of \nTransportation that monitors the safety of child restraints. NHTSA's \nprimary method for verifying that a child restraint is designed to meet \nFederal safety standards is its compliance testing program. In \ncompliance tests, Federal regulators subject the child restraint to a \nsled test that simulates a frontal collision with a stationary object.\n  The sled test used by NHTSA to verify a child restraint's performance \ndoes not consider how that restraint will perform in rear-impact, \nrollover, or side-impact crashes; and the sleds used in government \ncompliance tests bear limited resemblance to the interiors of today's \npassenger vehicles. These sleds feature flat bench seats with lap belts \nthat were common in automobiles of the mid-1970s, but which do not \napply to many of the passenger vehicles that are on our roads these \ndays.\n  Child restraints are too often marketed for children who are heavier \nthan the anthropomorphic test dummies used by NHTSA in these sled \ntests. One private group's testing has shown that child restraints \ntested with a child at the highest weight recommended by the \nmanufacturer have failed. NHTSA should allow child restraints to be \nmarketed for children at specific weights only if the restraint has \nbeen tested at those weights.\n  The current Federal standard for child restraints, known as Federal \nMotor Vehicle Safety Standard 213, is overdue to be upgraded to better \nreflect new developments in technology.\n\n[[Page S10615]]\n\n While the current safety standard for child restraints specifies that \nchild restraints be tested at an impact of 30 mph, tests are regularly \nconducted at speeds as low as 27.6 mph. The Government does not crash \ntest any child restraints in actual motor vehicles; and it has not \nrequired that child restraint manufacturers simplify and standardize \ninstructions for installing and using child restraints.\n  Finally, although head injuries from motor vehicle collisions \nfrequently are the cause of serious injuries or fatalities, many makes \nand models of child restraints do not offer side-impact padding or \nother protection from head injuries in side-impact crashes. The Child \nPassenger Protection Act requires the Secretary of the U.S. Department \nof Transportation (DOT) to initiate a rulemaking that would address \nthese and other deficiencies in our current child restraint system.\n  Under this legislation, DOT will also begin a comprehensive program \nto provide information to consumers for use in making informed \ndecisions in the purchase of child restraints. The Secretary must issue \na notice of proposed rulemaking to establish such a program within 12 \nmonths of the bill's enactment, and it must issue a final rule within \n24 months of the bill's enactment.\n  The Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, Foreign Commerce and Tourism \nheld a field meeting on June 19, 2000 in St. Louis, MO, to discuss the \nChild Passenger Protection Act. My colleague from Missouri, Senator \nJohn Ashcroft, chaired this field meeting, at which the subcommittee \nheard testimony from NHTSA, highway safety advocates, and a pediatric \nsurgeon concerning the current state of child passenger safety and \nadditional ways to improve safety. S. 2070 passed the full Committee on \nCommerce, with a substitute amendment, by voice vote on September 20, \n2000.\n  This committee amendment to S. 2070, which has been incorporated into \nsection 14 of the TREAD Act, also requires a study, within 12 months of \nthe bill's enactment, of automobile booster seat use and effectiveness. \nIn addition, this committee amendment requires DOT to develop a 5-year \nstrategic plan to reduce deaths and injuries caused by the failure to \nuse an appropriate booster seat for children between the ages of 4 and \n8 years. The bill thus focuses more attention on an issue that \nautomobile safety advocates have dubbed the ``forgotten child \nproblem.'' This problem exists for children, usually between the ages \nof four and eight years, who have outgrown their infant child \nrestraints but who do not fit properly in adult seat belts.\n  I want to close by extending my thanks to all who have so strongly \nsupported this legislation, including the American College of Emergency \nPhysicians, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, the Easter Seals \nKARS program, State Farm Insurance, SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A., the National \nSAFE KIDS Campaign, the co-authors of the book Baby Bargains, Consumers \nUnion, and the American Automobile Association. I congratulate my \ncolleague from Illinois, Congressman John Shimkus, who introduced \ncompanion legislation in the House of Representatives, for his fine \nwork on getting this legislation included in the TREAD Act and through \nthe House of Representatives on Tuesday. I am pleased that this \nimportant piece of legislation passed the Senate unanimously last week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10615-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Senate on \nits unanimous passage of the Violence Against Women Act. In particular, \nI would like to commend the members of the conference committee for \nincluding language that establishes a legal definition of dating \nviolence.\n  In domestic violence situations, victims are victims regardless of \ntheir age or legal relationship to the abuser. The seriousness of this \nissue was brought home by a tragic case in Idaho. In December 1999, a \n17-year-old Soda Springs, Idaho, girl, Cassie Dehl, was killed in an \naccident involving her abusive boyfriend. Prior to her death, the \nnumerous attempts by her mother to obtain legal protection for her \ndaughter failed because Idaho's domestic violence laws did not apply to \nteenage dating relationships. Earlier this year, Idaho Governor Dirk \nKempthorne and the Idaho State Legislature enacted legislation, named \nin Cassie's memory, which extended Idaho domestic violence laws to \ndating relationships. I am pleased that Federal law will now also \nprotect teenagers involved in abusive dating relationships.\n\n[[Page S10616]]\n\n  While the reauthorization of VAWA is an important step in protecting \nall victims of domestic violence, our work is not yet done. Under VAWA, \ndating violence has been included in four of the five major domestic \nviolence grant programs. However, one major grant program was left \nbehind. I am committed to working with my colleagues in the next \nCongress to expand dating violence to all domestic violence programs \nunder VAWA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote total be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       U.S. Senate Rollcall Vote\n\n                      (106th Congress, 2d Session)\n\n       Vote Number: 269.\n       Vote Date: October 11, 2000.\n       Title: H.R. 3244 Conference Report.\n       Req. for Majority: \\1/2\\.\n       Bill Number: H.R. 3244.\n       Result: Conference Report Agreed to.\n\n\n                              vote summary\n\n       Yea: 95.\n       Nay: 0.\n       Present: 0.\n       No Vote: 5.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10616-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             IN RECOGNITION OF AMBASSADOR DAVID B. HERMELIN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nachievements of an accomplished businessman, distinguished public \nservant and committed philanthropist from my home state of Michigan, \nAmbassador David B. Hermelin. On October 22 of this year, the ORT \nHermelin College of Engineering will be dedicated in Netanya, Israel. \nThis dedication is a fitting tribute for a man, who along with his wife \nDoreen, has committed himself to his family, nation and charitable \nendeavors throughout the world.\n  Through hard work and an unwavering commitment to the public good, \nDavid's work has made an indelible mark upon countless individuals. His \nkeen intellect, business acumen and heart for others has led him to \npursue a wide array of business and charitable efforts in the United \nStates and abroad.\n  David has been deeply involved with the World ORT, having served as \nthe President of American ORT. Founded in response to a famine in \nRussia in the late 1860s, ORT is a private, non-profit organization \nthat addresses the educational and technical training needs of workers, \nproviding them with the training and self-sufficiency needed to build a \nmeaningful existence. To achieve this goal, ORT builds schools and \ndevelops a curriculum that provides students with vital technical \nskills. ORT has facilities in nearly 60 nations. This year, over \n200,000 students are enrolled in ORT programs.\n  The mission of American ORT is to raise funding necessary to support \nthe efforts of World ORT and administer domestic ORT programs. During \nDavid's tenure as President of this organization, American ORT \nincreased its involvement in the mission of World ORT, and strengthened \nits ties with the larger Jewish community. These strengthened ties were \nevidenced by the fact that the 1999 General Assembly of the United \nJewish Communities of North America was the second consecutive General \nAssembly sponsored by ORT.\n  American ORT administers two post-secondary training institutes and \none college in the United States. These three institutions serve 5,000 \nindividuals annually, many from the former Soviet Union and Newly \nIndependent States (NIS), by providing them with technical training, \nEnglish language assistance and career development skills.\n  David has been involved in many other charitable endeavors as an \nadministrator, contributor and fundraiser. He has served on the Board \nof Directors for many community and national organizations including \nthe Meyer L. Prentis Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n  As a businessman, David has worked as a real estate developer, \nventure capitalist and manager of many interests. Currently, he is the \nco-owner of two of the largest entertainment facilities in the state of \nMichigan--the Palace of Auburn Hills, home of the NBA's Detroit \nPistons, and the Pine Knob Entertainment Centers. In addition, he sits \non the board of several companies including Arbor Drugs Inc., Arena \nAssociates, Village Green Management Company and First America Bank \nCorporation--Detroit.\n  In December 1997, President Clinton recognized David's commitment to \npublic service, and appointed him to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to \nNorway. So extraordinary was his service in this capacity that the \nNorweigian people awarded him the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit, which \nis equivalent to being knighted.\n  David Hermelin has been a community leader for over forty years. As a \nfellow native of Detroit, Michigan, I have known David for over half of \na century. I am pleased to call him an inspiration, a peer and a \nfriend. I am sure that my Senate colleagues will join me in offering my \ncongratulations to David Hermelin for the dedication of the ORT \nHermelin College of Engineering, and in wishing him well in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10616-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10616-S10617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN ROUSH\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good \nfriend, the twentieth President of Centre College in Danville, \nKentucky, John Roush.\n  I want to offer my heartfelt congratulations to John Roush, the \nstudents and faculty at Centre College, and the City of Danville, \nKentucky for their successful bid to host the only vice presidential \ndebate of the 2000 election. Under the leadership of John Roush, the \ncollege and the community worked together to make the debate at Centre \nCollege a reality.\n  By all accounts, the debate in Danville was a success. Even though \nCentre College is the smallest higher-education institution to have \never hosted a presidential or vice presidential debate, they exceeded \nexpectations and pulled-off a top-rate event. The town and college \ncoordinated events throughout the day of the debate to build \nanticipation and provide opportunities for those who did not have \ntickets to participate in the occasion. An outdoor concert, open to the \npublic, was held on Centre's campus and featured Maysville native and \ncelebrity Nick Clooney, gospel singer Larnelle Harris, and the \nOwensboro Symphony Orchestra. Then, attendees were treated to a live, \nbig-screen viewing of the vice presidential debate.\n  President John Roush's fingerprints were all over the events of the \nday; his creativity and ingenuity a benefit to everyone who \nparticipated. Whether you watched the debate from the screen on \nCentre's lawn, the seats of Centre's Norton Center for Fine Arts or on \ntelevision in your home, the professionalism with which John led the \nextensive preparations for the debate were apparent.\n  Just talk to anyone at Centre College, in Danville, or in all of \nKentucky for that matter--they will tell you that in the two years John \nhas served as president at Centre, he has rallied students, faculty, \nand city residents with his passion for excellence. He has been \ndescribed by his peers and co-workers as having an ``infectious \nenthusiasm'' and being ``full of integrity.'' He has been characterized \nas ``energetic'' and ``impressive.'' I know from my own personal \nexperience with and observation of John that all of these descriptions \nare true. I am proud to call him a fellow Kentuckian and friend.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I would like to read into the Record an \nexcerpt from an October 7, 2000, editorial by Washington Post writer \nDavid Von Drehle that ran in the Louisville Courier-Journal, which \nperfectly sums up the atmosphere in Danville, KY, on the day of the \ndebate.\n\n       Centre College hosted the debate. This unlikely setting--\n     far from the nearest airport, in a place without many four-\n     lane roads, in fact--turned out to be one of the best ever. \n     The whole day was a happy pageant of Norman Rockwell meets \n     Alexis de Tocqueville.\n       Tired and jaded political junkies stepped from their cars \n     and buses into an afternoon that was either the very end of \n     summer or the very beginning of fall. Clear sky, warm sun, \n     fresh breeze. Though the trees all appeared to be green, a \n     few golden leaves began to drift toward the grass of the \n     college common as evening approached.\n       On the common, bands played marches and choirs sang gospel \n     hymns. Hours before the debate began, the gently sloping \n     ground filled with grandparents on lawn chairs and moms and \n     dads on blankets and children who twirled and ran and tumbled \n     and plucked\n\n[[Page S10617]]\n\n     leaves from their hair. There were young men in shorts and \n     their sweethearts in sun dresses enjoying the day and \n     preparing to watch the clash on giant screens.\n       Speakers read passages from great documents of American \n     history--the Declaration of Independence, the Gettysburn \n     Address--and an orchestra played the national anthem and ``My \n     Old Kentucky Home.'' Kids waved flags.\n\n  There are no words I can add to more accurately describe the picture-\nperfect day John Roush orchestrated at Centre College on October 5, \n2000.\n  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I \napplaud you, John Roush, for what you have accomplished at Centre \nCollege and thank you for your commitment to higher education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10617-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTELLIGENT CITY OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \nacknowledge LaGrange, Georgia, which was recently named the \n``Intelligent City of the Year for 2000'' by the World Teleport \nAssociation. LaGrange is only the second city to win this award which \ncan be awarded to any city worldwide.\n  LaGrange is deserving of this award, which is in recognition of its \n``Internet For Everyone'' program to provide Internet access to every \nhome in the city with cable access at no additional cost to the \nresident. In the 1990's, LaGrange officials deployed a fiber optic \nnetwork because they recognized this infrastructure need to ensure \ntheir community is adequately prepared for the coming information age, \nand they saw the advantages of such an investment. This foundation led \nto the development of a two-way hybrid fiber coaxial cable network that \nsupports cable modems and Internet access for the 21st Century. All the \ncustomer needs is a television, and the Internet is accessed through a \nset top box and wireless keyboard.\n  This investment in the workforce of tomorrow is one of a kind, and \nanyone who can access the world wide web will now be a recipient of the \nknowledge and information of the citizens of LaGrange. I have pledged \nto work with them to encourage the further development of the Internet \nfor the benefit of users worldwide. In fact, last month, I was in \nLaGrange to celebrate the wiring of the city's government housing \ncommunity. At this event, I was pleased with the amount of knowledge \nthe children already have about the web, its uses, and the potential it \nbrings. They are our future, and they are the people who will benefit \nthe most from LaGrange's farsightedness.\n  As Congress looks for ways to bridge the digital divide, I would like \nto make an example of LaGrange, Georgia, the Intelligent City of the \nYear for 2000. There are many options available for communities around \nthe country. Once we are connected we will truly be able to learn more \nfrom one another about ourselves, our communities, our country, and our \nworld.\n  Again, I congratulate the city of LaGrange, Georgia and Mayor Jeff \nLukken, and I hope that the children and families of LaGrange will take \nfull advantage of this great opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10617-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SALUTE TO CRAIG GLAZER\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, one of Ohio's illustrious public \nservants, Commissioner Craig Glazer, is retiring as a member of the \nPublic Utilities Commission of Ohio after serving successfully under \nthree Ohio governors. I extend to him my sincere congratulations and \nbest wishes.\n  Craig is a man with a love for Ohio. After graduating from Vanderbilt \nUniversity Law School, he went directly to work for Ohio businesses as \nan advocate for industry at the law firm of Hahn Loeser & Parks. He \nworked extensively for utility and consumer interests helping them to \nexpand their operations throughout Ohio.\n  I personally had the opportunity to witness Craig's leadership while \nI was Mayor of Cleveland. Between 1979 and 1985, Craig represented the \npeople of Cleveland before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio \n(PUCO) as the utility rate counsel.\n  During my time as Mayor, I worked with Craig on legislation that was \nultimately passed in the Ohio Legislature as Senate Bill 378. Upon \npassage it reformed the structure of PUCO to ensure its accountability \nto its many constituencies. During this time, he additionally served as \nhouse counsel to the city of Cleveland's utility system and served over \n300,000 customers through their water, sewer and electric utilities.\n  He presently serves on the Board of Directors of the national \nAssociation of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, serves as vice-chair \nof its International Relations Committee and is a member of their \nelectricity committee. He also chairs the National Council on \nCompetition in the Electric Industry, an interagency policy group, and \nis President of Board of Directors of the Ohio Energy Project. He is \nchair of the Ameritech region Regulatory Coordinating Committee and \nserves as a member of the North American Electricity Reliability \nCouncil's Generation Adequacy Committee and Electric Power research \nInstitute's Advisory Council.\n  It is clear from his leadership and many efforts that Craig Glazer \nconsistently works hard for the people of Ohio.\n  I have immense respect for Craig. He is and always has been a true \nprofessional. And although I am sorry to see him retire, I am confident \nthat the citizens of Ohio have not heard the last from him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10617-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10617-S10618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CELEBRATING THE SUCCESS OF WEST VIRGINIA HEALTH RIGHT, INC.\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nsuccess of one of West Virginia's most successful non-profit health \norganizations. It gives me great honor to come to the floor today to be \nable to share with you the remarkable story of West Virginia Health \nRight, Inc.\n  West Virginia Heath Right was the brainchild of a group of dedicated \nvolunteers who recognized a desperate need to provide free, quality \nhealth care to the homeless, the working poor, the un- and \nunderinsured, de-institutionalized mental health patients, and \ncountless others. Their vision was realized when they opened a small, \nmission-driven health clinic in Charleston, West Virginia in 1982. From \nthese modest beginnings, West Virginia Health Right, Inc. grew \ntremendously fast. They soon found that the need in the community was \nfar greater than they had expected and moved from their original \nlocation in a soup kitchen in Kanawha County, to a homeless shelter, \nand finally settled into the third floor of the Charleston Area Medical \nCenter. In 1989, West Virginia Health Right moved to their own clinic \nbuilding supported by funds from the community. In 1999, West Virginia \nHealth Right again appealed to the community for support and found an \noverwhelming reception to their needs. They are now housed in a state \nof the art clinic in Charleston.\n  Modeling the success of the Charleston clinic, other free clinics \nbegan to sprout up in communities throughout the state at the rate of \nabout one every two years. Today, Health Right has eight separate sites \nacross West Virginia, including Charleston, Wheeling, Morgantown, \nClarksburg, Huntington, Parkersburg, Bluefield, and Logan, which serve \nour State's poor and uninsured. Just recently, Health Right announced \nthe opening of a new clinic in Beckley, West Virginia for which I am \nproud to serve as a board member. They will also be opening new \nlocations in Summersville and Weirton. Remarkably, each of these \nfacilities operates with just a small staff of employees, and relies \nentirely on the volunteer services of dedicated physicians and nurse \npractitioners from the area.\n  West Virginia Health Right, Inc. is a living example that just a few \npeople can make a difference. Eighteen years ago, four doctors and a \ndozen volunteers set out with a vision to provide health care to those \nwho needed it most. Today, Health Right is a network of more than 500 \nphysicians and 15,000 volunteers serving 45,000 West Virginians each \nyear. With the uninsured in this nation still at staggering levels, it \ngives me great pleasure to recognize the invaluable work of West \nVirginia Health Right, Inc., a group that rather than simply talking \nabout a problem, is actually working to fill a vital need in our state.\n  Congratulations, West Virginia Health Right, for your success. And \nthank you for your tireless contributions to the state of West \nVirginia.\n\n[[Page S10618]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10617-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10617-S10618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CELEBRATING THE SUCCESS OF WEST VIRGINIA HEALTH RIGHT, INC.\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Remarkably, each of these \nfacilities operates with just a small staff of employees, and relies \nentirely on the volunteer services of dedicated physicians and nurse \npractitioners from the area.\n  West Virginia Health Right, Inc. is a living example that just a few \npeople can make a difference. Eighteen years ago, four doctors and a \ndozen volunteers set out with a vision to provide health care to those \nwho needed it most. Today, Health Right is a network of more than 500 \nphysicians and 15,000 volunteers serving 45,000 West Virginians each \nyear. With the uninsured in this nation still at staggering levels, it \ngives me great pleasure to recognize the invaluable work of West \nVirginia Health Right, Inc., a group that rather than simply talking \nabout a problem, is actually working to fill a vital need in our state.\n  Congratulations, West Virginia Health Right, for your success. And \nthank you for your tireless contributions to the state of West \nVirginia.\n\n[[Page S10618]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10618-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. SAM ROBINSON\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nmy friend Dr. Sam Robinson on the occasion of his retirement as \npresident of the Lincoln Foundation in Louisville, Kentucky.\n  Sam has been a tireless advocate for the Lincoln Foundation in his 26 \nyears as president, making a difference in the lives of countless young \nKentuckians. Sam has worked toward a worthy mission at the Foundation: \nto help underprivileged children get an education so that they can have \na better chance at succeeding in professional life. I applaud your \ncommitment to this cause, Sam, and offer sincere thanks for the good \nwork you have done.\n  One of the projects Sam has been most passionate about during his \ntime at the Lincoln Foundation is the Whitney M. Young Scholars \nProgram. Sam's ingenuity got the ball rolling for this project, which \nis a four-year college scholarship program. Since the program's \ninception, Whitney M. Young scholarships have enabled hundreds of \nbright young people to attend college who could not have otherwise \nafforded the expense of an education.\n  Sam's legacy of service extends far beyond the Lincoln Foundation. \nHis philanthropic and civic actions have resulted in his being honored \nwith the Humanitarian Award from the Louisville Chapter of the National \nConference of Christians and Jews, and being named ``Man of the Year'' \nby Sigma Pi Phi fraternity. Sam also has served on the boards of \nBellarmine University, PNC Bank and the Kentucky State Board of \nElementary and Secondary Education.\n  Dr. Sam Robinson's service to the Lincoln Foundation and the \nthousands of young people he has helped over the years will long be \nremembered and admired. His genuine compassion for underprivileged \nstudents will encourage and inspire Kentuckians for generations to \ncome. Today, I say to Sam: best wishes for many more years of service, \nand know that your efforts to better the lives of others in Louisville \nand throughout Kentucky are recognized and appreciated. On behalf of \nmyself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for \ngiving so much of yourself for so many others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10618-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ABE SCHRADER\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to call attention to the \nlife of a man who so perfectly portrays the success and opportunity \nthis country can provide if one puts in the effort.\n  Abe Schrader will celebrate his 100th birthday on October 15, 2000 \nwith multitudes of friends and family. I am privileged to be included \nas one of those admirers and friends who will join with him that night.\n  Abe's life story is an example of how a belief in self and hard work \ncan lead to success. He started his life in America at the age of 20 \nwhen he immigrated here from Poland. He arrived penniless but with a \ndetermination to succeed in his new homeland. Succeed he did as we can \nsee from the story recently printed in the New York Times. Mr. \nPresident, I ask that the full text of that article be included in the \nRecord.\n  I know Abe Schrader well and spend time with him on occasions. He is \nalert, bright and engaging. He manages his investments personally and \nhas done a superb job with them.\n  I wish all America could meet this congenial, intelligent, caring \nindividual. He is an inspiration for me and I believe could provide \nspirit and encouragement to all who face aging as to what can be with \nthe right kind of effort and determination.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 28, 2000]\n\n       Public Lives; at 99, Man of Fashion Finds Life a Good Fit\n\n                            (By Susan Sachs)\n\n       Clothes make the man, goes the old saw. You would not get \n     an argument from Abe Schrader.\n       The garment business--in his case, manufacturing women's \n     coats and better dresses for more than half a century--made \n     him one of the kings of Seventh Avenue. Even now, gliding \n     gracefully toward his 100th birthday next month, Mr. Schrader \n     still appreciates the value of a well-cut suit of clothes.\n       Sitting yesterday in his apartment overlooking Central \n     Park, reminiscing about the rag trade before it became the \n     more high-hat fashion business, he was impeccably turned out \n     in a blue cashmere jacket, gray slacks, crisp baby-blue shirt \n     and gleaming black shoes. A red silk handkerchief that \n     matched the shade of his tie peeked from his breast pocket.\n       ``All my clothes are made to order,'' Mr. Schrader said, as \n     he flipped open his jacket to show his Italian tailor's \n     label. ``Even when I made $10 a week, I saved up my money all \n     year and bought a custom suit.''\n       This might sound strange coming from a man whose \n     manufacturing company, the Abe Schrader Corporation, once \n     dominated the city's ready-to-wear industry. But Mr. \n     Schrader, a smallish man who once could burn up the dance \n     floor at nightclubs like El Morocco, never found a good fit \n     off the rack.\n       ``I have a lust for life,'' he said, his Polish accent \n     making the words especially rakish. ``And especially on a \n     dance floor, you've got to look good.''\n       Last week, the city celebrated clothes with Fashion Week, \n     an extravaganza of designer fashion shows meant to highlight \n     New York as a fashion center. Mr. Schrader, who persuaded \n     City Hall 35 years ago to name a stretch of Seventh Avenue \n     ``Fashion Avenue,'' followed it from afar.\n       ``Some good, some bad,'' he said, diplomatically, on the \n     spring 2001 styles on display.\n       Mr. Schrader retired from the clothing business 12 years \n     ago, after watching it change from top to bottom.\n       When he started out, in the early 1920's, the industry was \n     big enough to absorb waves of immigrants--Germans and Irish, \n     followed by Eastern European Jews, then Italians. Seventh \n     Avenue was the center of factories where garments were cut \n     and sewn.\n       Now most factories have moved offshore in pursuit of cheap \n     foreign labor. And many of the original independent apparel \n     makers of Seventh Avenue were long ago gobbled up by \n     conglomerates.\n       Mr. Schrader was one of the immigrants who built the \n     business. He arrived in the United States at the age of 20 \n     from Poland. His mother hoped he would continue his religious \n     studies and become a rabbi. But Mr. Schrader had his father's \n     business instincts. He started out as a contractor, hiring \n     people to sew garments for a middleman who got the orders \n     from a retailer.\n       Within a few years, the ambitious Mr. Schrader began his \n     own manufacturing business, complete with a stable of \n     designers, and dealt directly with retail stores. One of his \n     first contracts was with the government for uniforms for the \n     Women's Auxiliary Army Corps.\n       ``I was,'' he recalled with a deadpan look, ``an instant \n     success.''\n       Mr. Schrader's life might appear to mirror the archetypal \n     turn-of-the-century immigrant tale. Think, for example, of \n     the immigrant protagonist in the classic 1917 novel ``The \n     Rise of David Levinsky,'' torn between his rabbinical studies \n     and the lucrative garment business.\n       But Mr. Schrader shrugged off the comparison. Although he \n     can still toss of a Talmudic reference when pressed, he said \n     godliness was not found in ritual or retreat from the world, \n     but in doing good deeds. Besides, he explained: ``Competition \n     is a godsend. If you didn't have it, you'd pay double for \n     your clothes.''\n       For years, Mr. Schrader was also a fixture in the city's \n     high society nightclubs, where he put his love of ballroom \n     dancing on display.\n       That is how Pauline Trigere, the fashion designer whose \n     coats were produced by the Schrader company for several \n     years, first met Mr. Schrader. ``It was on the dance floor at \n     El Morocco,'' she said.\n       Ms. Trigere, who has been in the business almost as long as \n     Mr. Schrader, gave him the supreme compliment from a \n     designer: ``When I made a collection, it was shown the way I \n     made it. He never did something that hurt the garment.''\n       Mr. Schrader retired in 1988, four years after he sold his \n     business to Interco Inc. With time on his hands, he started, \n     for the first time, to feel his age. ``The first year I went \n     from one museum to the other, one library to the other,'' he \n     said. ``Finally my son said to me, `Here, Dad, take my car \n     and chauffeur. Tell me, where would you like to go?' And I \n     said, `Wall Street.' ''\n       Now, snappily dressed and eager as any 24-year-old dot-com \n     millionaire, he goes each day at 1 p.m. to his own private \n     office in the brokerage firm of Bishop, Rosen, where he \n     trades stocks for his own account.\n       It is his joy, like dancing the waltz, although he admitted \n     that ``at 100, I'd be lying to tell you my feet are as good \n     as they used to be.''\n       He stays at his office until about 4:30 p.m., relishing \n     that everyone calls him Abe, like a pal, instead of the \n     stuffier Mr. Schrader.\n       ``They treat me royally over there,'' Mr. Schrader said \n     happily, settling into his car for the daily ride downtown. \n     ``It keeps me young.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10618-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10618-S10619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ROBERT L.

Mr. McCurley retired on \nSeptember 30, 2000 after two terms as the president of Kiwanis \nInternational's charitable arm. I commend him for his commitment to \nhelping the less fortunate throughout the world.\n\n[[Page S10619]]\n\n  Bob McCurley's duties as Kiwanis International Foundation president \nhave taken him around the world in his efforts to improve the lives of \nthe underprivileged. Under his leadership, the foundation has provided \ngrants to meet the needs of children from Bulgaria and Haiti to India \nand Cambodia. In particular, the Kiwanis International Foundation has \nraised millions of dollars to combat iodine deficiency disorders, the \nleading preventable cause of mental retardation in the world today.\n  Mr. McCurley earned degrees in both engineering and law from the \nUniversity of Alabama. He is director of the Alabama Law Institute and \nan adjunct professor at the Alabama School of Law. He has also served \nas a municipal judge and has authored 12 books on law and government.\n  Mr. McCurley has been a member of Kiwanis in Gadsden and Tuscaloosa \nfor more than 30 years. He led the Kiwanis organization in Alabama in \n1983-1984, served as Trustee and then Vice President of Kiwanis \nInternational from 1987-1992, and since 1994 has served the Kiwanis \nInternational Foundation as a Trustee, Treasurer, and President. In \naddition to Kiwanis, he has served his community as a volunteer in \nleadership positions with the March of Dimes, Boys Club, Focus on \nSenior Citizens, and Association for Retarded Children.\n  Robert L. McCurley Jr.'s charitable work has made a difference in \ncountless lives in Alabama and throughout the world. UNICEF estimates \nthat Kiwanis support of iodine deficiency disorder programs is saving \nmore than 8 million children each year from mental and physical \ndisabilities. I would like to congratulate Mr. McCurley on a stellar \nterm as President of the Kiwanis International Foundation, and wish him \nand his family the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10619-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO LAWRENCE AND KIM BUTTERFIELD\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nLawrence and Kim Butterfield for their commitment to higher education, \nand their generosity to the many students who will be able to attend \nSpalding University because of their gift.\n  Spalding University has 2.5 million reasons to be grateful to \nLawrence and Kim Butterfield of Louisville, Kentucky. Their recent $2.5 \nmillion contribution to Spalding University will allow the school to \nexpand their current overseas travel and study programs, and provide \nadditional student scholarships. The Butterfield's kindness and \ngenerosity will ensure that countless students from all backgrounds \nwill receive a quality education and the opportunity to succeed in \nwhatever field of study they choose. Their contribution also will \nenable students to have the incredible experience of traveling and \nstudying abroad. Students who could not otherwise have afforded this \nopportunity will now be able to participate because of Lawrence and \nKim.\n  Spalding University will benefit from the many students who will be \nable to attend classes because of the Butterfield's gift of scholarship \nfunds. The gift of an education is truly the gift that keeps on giving. \nWhen Lawrence and Kim provide a scholarship for a student at Spalding, \nthey give the student a quality education and lifelong career \nopportunities. But the gift goes further than the individual \nrecipient--it also is a gift to the University and to the Louisville \ncommunity.\n  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I \noffer sincere thanks to the Butterfield's for their gift to the \nstudents and faculty at Spalding University, to the Louisville \ncommunity, and to the education of today's youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10619-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/17/senate-section/article/S10619-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT OF THE U.S. RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999--\n     MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED DURING THE RECESS--PM 133\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 1999, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 17, 2000, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received the following message from the President of the \nUnited States, together with accompanying report; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Railroad Retirement \nBoard for Fiscal year 1999, pursuant to the provisions of section \n7(b)(6) of the Railroad Retirement Act and section 12(l) of the \nRailroad Unemployment Insurance Act.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nenhance consumer protection in the purchase of prescription drugs from \ninterstate Internet sellers; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n       internet prescription drug consumer protection act of 2000\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to join with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and House in a bipartisan effort to address \nthe relatively new development of Internet pharmacies. The ever-\nincreasing cost of prescription drugs has led a growing number of \nAmericans to turn to Internet pharmacies to try to find savings. Our \ngoal with the Internet Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act is to \nallow American consumers to place the same confidence and trust in \nInternet pharmacies as they do in traditional brick-and-mortar \npharmacies. The bill we are introducing today is a starting point in \naddressing this issue. If there is not enough time to pass this bill in \nthe remaining days of the session, then I hope to return to this issue \nearly in the next Congress and finish what we have started.\n  We are well aware that the explosion of Internet commerce has put all \nmanner of goods and services literally at our fingertips. In this \nrespect, health care products and prescription drugs are no different \nfrom books, compact disks, or the many other products sold online. But \nthere is a potential for very serious dangers when purchasing \nprescription drugs online. On March 21 of this year, I chaired a \nhearing of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to \nexamine this issue.\n  In the search for lower-priced prescription drugs, American consumers \ncan, unwittingly, order prescription drugs from rogue web sites that \nappear to be American-based companies, but are actually overseas sites \noffering low-priced prescription drugs that are unapproved, \ncounterfeit, contaminated, expired, mislabeled, manufactured in \nunapproved facilities, or not stored or handled in a proper manner.\n  I believe legitimate Internet pharmacies that operate legally and \nethically can offer valuable services to many Americans and have an \nimportant role in E-commerce. But there must be an appropriate \nregulatory system that protects American consumers from illegal and \nunethical behavior which can endanger lives, and which combats any \nrogue Internet operators.\n  Our legislation contains several provisions to protect consumers. But \nthe most important is clearly the one that allows states to obtain \nnationwide injunctive relief against unlawful Internet sellers, as \nrequested by the National Association of Attorneys General. Currently, \nin their efforts to combat illegal actions by a few Internet \npharmacies, several states' Attorneys General have filed suit against \nthe same companies and the same doctors. To simply prevent those bad \nactors from doing business in their state, each Attorney General has to \nfile an action in his or her state court. This duplication of effort \ndrains resources that could be utilized against other offenders. Since \nthe states' primary goal is to prevent rogue sites from harming \ncitizens, nationwide injunctive relief would allow each state to help \nprotect all the citizens of this nation. This power would be directly \nanalogous to the national injunctive relief contained in the federal \ntelemarketing statute.\n  A number of witnesses at our hearing testified that the most \nprominent danger presented to consumers is the rogue pharmacies \noperating in countries other than the United States. In this case, the \nfederal government is clearly the most appropriate entity to deal with \ninternational rogue pharmacists, and this legislation provides \nremedies. Our bill also provides for better coordination between \nfederal and state authorities.\n  Mr. President, this legislation represents a great deal of work by \nSenator Kennedy and myself. Representatives Bliley, Klink, and Upton \nhave worked on this issue as well, and I understand that they are \nintroducing companion legislation in the House. I am pleased that we \nhave been able to work in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion on such a \ncomplicated issue. Any time Congress attempts to respond to emerging \ntechnologies, similar challenges are faced.\n  I recognize that we are introducing this bill late in the session and \nthat several members have expressed concern with certain aspects of our \nproposal. I want to assure my colleagues that this legislation is a \nstarting point. This will provide my colleagues with the opportunity to \nmake comments and suggestions on the different policy areas. We have \nwritten this bill with bipartisan cooperation, and I look forward to \ncontinuing in that spirit as we work to ensure the safety of Internet \npharmacies.\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Internet is transforming all \naspects of our society, including health care. Web-based businesses, \nsuch as Internet pharmacies, can offer convenience and an opportunity \nfor privacy for large numbers of consumers buying online. The Internet \nalso creates opportunities, however, for scam artists and unprincipled \nsuppliers to market contaminated, expired, ineffective, or counterfeit \nmedications to unsuspecting patients. Today, these bad actors can \neasily prey on patients who turn to the Internet for easy access or \nlow-priced medications.\n  Clearly, effective oversight is needed to protect consumers using the \nInternet and root out illegal operators without interfering with \nlegitimate Internet commerce. Americans are entitled to the same \nprotections on the Internet that they enjoy in other commercial \nsettings.\n  So far, existing Federal and State laws have had only limited success \nin protecting consumers from unlawful Internet sellers of prescription \nmedications.\n  Today, some physicians issue prescriptions for patients they have \nnever seen, let alone seriously examined. Patients can purchase \nprescription drugs on the Internet without adequate safeguards that the \ndrugs are appropriate and of high quality. Because web sites can be \neasily created and designed, patients may think they have purchased \ntheir medications from a U.S.-licensed pharmacy when, in fact, they \nhave not. The prescription drugs they receive may be sold out of \nsomeone's garage or from a country with few, if any, standards for \nmanufacturing, storing or shipping these products.\n  Several states and Federal agencies have taken enforcement actions \nagainst unlawful Internet sellers, but with limited results. While the \nnumber of legitimate Internet pharmacies remains small, the number of \nillegal sellers continues to grow. We must do more to protect patients \nwhen they buy prescription drugs online. Patients should have the same \nprotections when purchasing their medications over the Internet as when \nbuying from a ``bricks-and-mortar'' pharmacy.\n  At a hearing on Internet pharmacies by the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee in March, state and Federal regulators \nasked the Committee for additional enforcement tools to combat illegal \nsales of prescription drugs over the Internet. The National Association \nof Attorneys General called for Federal legislation to require Internet \nentities that sell prescription medications to disclose information \nabout their businesses, and to give the states the authority to stop \nillegal sales nationwide, rather than only within their own borders. At \na hearing by the House Commerce Committee in May, the Department of \nJustice asked for authority to freeze domestic assets of illegal \nforeign web sites.\n  The Internet Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act of 2000, which \nSenators Jeffords, Dodd, and I are introducing today, gives these \nneeded tools to federal and state law enforcement officials to protect \nthe public from those who sell prescription drugs illegally on the \nInternet. A companion bill is being introduced by Congressmen Bliley, \nKlink, and Upton in the House, and I commend Congressman Klink in \nparticular for his leadership and guidance on this issue.\n  Today's consumer protection laws were enacted before the development \nof the Internet. This legislation will fill the gaps in current law \nthat permit these illegal sellers to evade prosecution. The bill is \nsupported by the National Association of Attorneys General, the \nAmerican Pharmaceutical Association, the American Society of Health-\nSystem Pharmacists, drugstore.com, and the National Consumers League.\n  Our legislation recognizes that states need additional enforcement \ntools to\n\n[[Page S10621]]\n\ntake effective action against unlawful domestic Internet sellers, and \nFederal agencies need additional enforcement tools to take effective \naction against illegal foreign sellers.\n  First, the Act requires Internet sellers of prescription drugs to \ndisclose on their web sites and to the appropriate state licensing \nboard their street address, telephone number, and states where they are \nlicensed to sell their products. Consumers have a right to know with \nwhom they are dealing on the Internet, just as they do when they walk \ninto their local pharmacy.\n  Second, the bill authorizes a state to go to federal court to obtain \na nationwide injunction against an unlawful Internet seller. Currently, \na state can stop an illegal web site operator from selling drugs to \ncitizens in its state, but the illegal operator is free to sell in the \nother 49 states. For many illegal sellers, the risk of a state \ninjunction is merely a cost of doing business. Under this legislation, \nillegal sellers will be out of business altogether.\n  The Federal Government has little authority to bring criminals in \nother countries to justice. However, it can freeze the U.S. assets of \nforeign sellers if given the proper authority. This legislation gives \nthe Department of Justice the ability to stop illegal foreign operators \nfrom collecting payments from U.S. customers. If they can't turn a \nprofit, they'll stop selling.\n  As electronic commerce evolves, cooperative multinational efforts \nwill be needed to assure adequate protections for consumers. Our \nproposal lays the foundation to achieve this goal. It requires the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to make recommendations to \nCongress for coordinating activities of the federal government with \nthose of other countries to curb illegal Internet sales from abroad.\n  Consumers also have an important role to play. Informed purchasers \nare well prepared to avoid illegal web sites. This legislation requires \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to educate the public about \nthe potential dangers of buying medications online and about effective \npublic and private sector consumer protections.\n  This legislation is an important step toward making medications \nonline a safe purchase for consumers. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to expedite its passage.\n  I ask that a summary of the bill and letters of support for it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The materials follow.\n\n  Internet Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act of 2000: Summary\n\n       Use of the Internet to buy prescription medications is \n     growing rapidly, and many consumers can benefit from the \n     convenience and potential privacy of this new option. \n     Unfortunately, illegitimate sellers threaten patient safety \n     in this quickly evolving environment. Many of these \n     operations are fly-by-night or foreign businesses that easily \n     evade prosecution. Consumers who buy prescription drugs from \n     such web sites can be harmed from inappropriately prescribed \n     medications, dangerous drug interactions, and contaminated \n     drugs. Consumers may also be defrauded by paying money but \n     never receiving the medications they ordered or receiving \n     ineffective or counterfeit drugs. Because today's laws were \n     enacted before the development of the Internet, there are \n     gaps in current law that leave consumers vulnerable to \n     unscrupulous business practices. This bill addresses these \n     deficiencies by providing federal and state law enforcement \n     authorities with the tools they need to adequately protect \n     the public when buying medications online.\n\n\n                         DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT\n\n       Requires interstate Internet sellers of prescription drugs \n     to disclose on their web sites and to the appropriate state \n     licensing board the street address of their place of \n     business, telephone number, and states where they are \n     licensed to sell prescription medications.\n\n\n                   FEDERAL CAUSE OF ACTION FOR STATES\n\n       Authorizes states to go into federal court to obtain a \n     nationwide injunction against an unlawful interstate Internet \n     seller.\n\n\n                        FREEZING FOREIGN ASSETS\n\n       Grants the Department of Justice the authority to stop \n     illegal foreign operators from collecting payments from U.S. \n     customers. The bill also requires the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services to provide recommendations to Congress for \n     coordinating activities of the federal government with those \n     of other countries to curb illegal Internet sales from \n     abroad.\n\n\n                            PUBLIC EDUCATION\n\n       Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     educate the public about the dangers of buying medications \n     online and about effective public and private sector consumer \n     protections.\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                             Attorneys General\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 2000.\n     Hon. Jim M. Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ron Klink,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Re The Internet Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act of \n         2000\n       Dear Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Representative \n     Bliley and Representative Klink: As the chair of the Online \n     Pharmacy Working Group for the National Association of \n     Attorneys General, I wish to express the support of my \n     colleagues for legislation you are introducing to address the \n     proliferation of illegal prescription drug sales over the \n     Internet and for your commitment to this issue as the chairs \n     and ranking members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions Committee, the House Commerce Committee and its \n     Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, respectively.\n       As you know, the states have traditionally regulated the \n     practice of prescribing and dispensing medications through \n     state law and licensure requirements. This statutory and \n     regulatory structure ensures the existence of a valid \n     physician-patient or prescriber-patient relationship, the \n     accuracy of prescriptions, and the quality of \n     pharmaceuticals.\n       The Internet has changed many traditional business \n     practices--including providing new opportunities for \n     consumers to purchase medications from online pharmacies. \n     While the Internet can provide a legitimate, convenient, and \n     effective means for pharmacies to transact business with \n     consumers if operated in full compliance with state laws, it \n     also provides an opportunity for businesses that are not \n     operating in compliance with state laws to reach consumers. \n     Many of these prescribe and sell drugs without a valid \n     examination by a physician, without a review of a patient's \n     medical records for adverse reactions, without valid \n     prescriptions, without compliance with state laws and \n     licensure requirements, without parental consent, etc. These \n     illegal sites can jeopardize the health and safety of \n     consumers.\n       The state Attorneys General believe that online pharmacies \n     should not be treated differently than traditional ``brick \n     and mortar'' pharmacies when it comes to compliance with \n     state laws: if a pharmacy wants to transact business in a \n     certain state, then it should submit to the laws of that \n     state. If the law is broken, the offender should be \n     prosecuted. To date, my state of Kansas and several other \n     states have taken enforcement actions against illegal \n     Internet sites prescribing and/or dispensing prescription \n     drugs to consumers in violation of state law.\n       These cases are not easy ones for the state to bring. \n     Because of the low start-up costs and anonymity associated \n     with the Internet, it is often difficult for the states to \n     locate those responsible for operating an illegal online \n     pharmacy and those who prescribe and dispense the drugs to \n     consumers, hindering effective investigation and prosecution. \n     Likewise the current lack of nationwide injunctive relief \n     requires each state to separately sue a site to obtain an \n     injunction to protect its consumers, wasting valuable \n     resources.\n       The bi-partisan and bi-cameral legislation you have \n     introduced will increase the effectiveness of the states' \n     ability to protect consumers. The Internet Prescription Drug \n     Consumer Protection Act of 2000 clearly provides the states \n     with the authority to obtain nationwide injunctive relief, \n     providing an opportunity for a state to obtain an injunction \n     effective in every state, while preserving the ability of \n     other states to seek restitution for their own consumers and \n     penalties and fees in their own state courts. It also \n     addresses the need to ensure we can locate the companies \n     selling prescription drugs by incorporating disclosure and \n     notification requirements that will require companies to \n     maintain accurate, accessible information about their \n     principals and location.\n       Thank you, again, for your leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely\n                                                Carla, J. Stovall,\n     Attorney General of Kansas.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           American Pharmaceutical\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The American Pharmaceutical \n     Association (APhA), the national professional society of \n     pharmacists, is pleased to support the Internet Prescription \n     Drug Consumer Protection Act of 2000. This proposal is \n     commendable for building on existing State regulation of \n     pharmacy practice and prescription dispensing by other \n     providers, rather than creating a redundant Federal \n     regulation system.\n       This bill is important to pharmacists as it provides our \n     patients better protection against fraudulent Internet \n     sellers. This bill also complements APhA's work to help \n     consumers know what to look for in an Internet pharmacy. I \n     have enclosed a sample of the information APhA has \n     disseminated broadly to assist consumers in choosing an \n     Internet pharmacy. We look forward to working with the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug \n     Administration to\n\n[[Page S10622]]\n\n     educate the public about the dangers of purchasing \n     prescription drugs from unlawful Internet sources.\n       APhA especially supports the provision authorizing \n     injunctions against alienation of property as a preliminary \n     step to address the significant problem of international \n     prescription drug sellers--sellers not bound to the important \n     requirements regulating domestic pharmacies and pharmacists. \n     We strongly support efforts to coordinate Federal agency \n     activity addressing interstate Internet sellers operating \n     from foreign countries. The Association and its members look \n     forward to working with you to refine this approach in \n     certain areas, such as the 75-mile exemption, and to help \n     this proposal become law.\n       The American Pharmaceutical Association is the first \n     established and largest professional association of \n     pharmacists in the United States. APhA's more than 50,000 \n     members include practicing pharmacists (including pharmacists \n     in legitimate Internet pharmacy practices), pharmaceutical \n     scientists, pharmacy students, and others interested in \n     advancing the profession. The Association is a leader in \n     providing professional information and education for \n     pharmacists and an advocate for improved health through the \n     provision of comprehensive pharmaceutical care.\n       Please contact Susan C. Winckler, RPh., APhA's Group \n     Director of Policy and Advocacy or Lisa M. Geiger, APhA's \n     Director of State and Federal Policy, should you or your \n     staff require any assistance from APhA. Thank you for your \n     leadership in addressing this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John A. Gans,\n     PharmD, Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,\n                                    Bethesda, MD, October 6, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the American Society of \n     Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), the 30,000-member national \n     professional association that represents pharmacists who \n     practice in hospitals, health maintenance organizations, \n     long-term care facilities, home care, and other components of \n     health care systems, I am writing to support continued \n     efforts to improve patient safety. Your legislation, the \n     ``Internet Prescription Consumer Protection Act of 2000,'' \n     provides a significant step towards ensuring that medications \n     obtained via the Internet met the same quality and assurance \n     standards as those products obtained through more traditional \n     means.\n       ASHP recognizes that the majority of pharmacies selling \n     prescription drugs over the Internet are legitimate entities \n     that offer important health benefits to the patient, \n     including greater accessibility, convenience and access to \n     information. However, legislation is needed to ensure that \n     rogue sites do not exploit and endanger consumers. Current \n     state and federal regulation of Internet pharmacies, as well \n     as voluntary industry initiatives, are not sufficient to \n     ensure patient safety.\n       The Internet Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act \n     meets ASHP's policy position on regulating online pharmacy. \n     The bill mandates the disclosure of important provider \n     information, works to ensure that a legitimate patient-\n     prescription relationship exists, and enhances state and \n     federal enforcement authority. These important safety \n     measures will foster greater confidence in the quality of the \n     pharmaceutical products reaching the American public.\n       Again, we applaud the introduction of your legislation and \n     hope the Congress will come together in a bipartisan manner \n     to address this important patient safety issue in the \n     remaining days of the 106th Congress. We also look forward to \n     working with you further to address the foreign source aspect \n     of the public health problem. Please feel free to have your \n     staff contact Kathleen M. Cantwell, ASHP's Assistant Director \n     and Counsel for Federal Legislative Affairs (301-657-3000 \n     ext. 1326) if we can be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Henri R. Manasse, Jr., Ph.D., Sc.D.,\n       Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                drugstore.com,\n\n                                   Bellevue, WA, October 12, 2000.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Internet Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act of \n         2000\n       Dear Senator Murray: We understand that legislation will be \n     introduced in the Senate to impose certain requirements on \n     interstate Internet sellers which sell prescription drugs to \n     consumers, and to facilitate legal action against those \n     sellers making illegal sales of prescription drugs over the \n     Internet. We have reviewed a copy of the legislation provided \n     by Senate staff last week. It is our opinion that the \n     legislation does not impose undue burdens on legitimate \n     Internet pharmacies, such as drugstore.com, and that it \n     represents a step forward in providing consumers with \n     information enabling them to distinguish between legitimate \n     pharmacies and rogue operators. The legislation also \n     authorizes additional law enforcement tools to facilitate the \n     prosecution of those rogues.\n       We were pleased to see the legislation's acknowledgement \n     that ``legitimate Internet sellers of prescription drugs can \n     offer substantial benefits to consumers. These potential \n     benefits include convenience, privacy, valuable information, \n     lower prices, and personalized services.'' drugstore.com is \n     proud to be the leading online drugstore. We believe that our \n     success in attracting more than 1.2 million customers is the \n     direct result of our commitment to provide safe, secure, \n     legitimate and innovative pharmacy services. We are using the \n     Internet to help our customers make clear, informed decisions \n     about their health and well-being.\n       As this legislation was being developed, we were concerned \n     that it would impose unreasonable burdens on legitimate \n     online pharmacies, such as drugstore.com, that are already \n     complying with all existing state and federal laws. However, \n     we believe that the Web site disclosure requirements \n     contained in the bill are reasonably circumscribed to avoid \n     such burdens. Such requirements mandate that an interstate \n     Internet seller disclose to consumers such fundamental \n     information as its address and the states in which it is \n     licensed. drugstore.com already discloses that and more on \n     its Web site, and, therefore, does not find such requirements \n     objectionable. We hope that the regulations promulgated by \n     the Department of health and Human Services under the \n     authority of Sec. 3(a)(6) will acknowledge the apparent \n     intent of the bill not to impose unreasonable burdens on \n     legitimate Internet pharmacies. In that regard, drugstore.com \n     enthusiastically supports the National Association of Boards \n     of Pharmacy's VIPPS (Verified Internet Pharmacy Practices \n     Sites) certification program. That's because we believe the \n     VIPPS certification helps consumers distinguish between \n     legitimate Internet pharmacies and illegitimate rogue sites. \n     We, therefore, recommend VIPPS as a model for the purpose of \n     promulgating regulations to implement the disclosure \n     requirements of this bill.\n       We leave to law enforcement authorities the question as to \n     whether the additional enforcement powers authorized by the \n     bill provide sufficient effective mechanisms to investigate \n     and prosecute questionable Internet sites. We take note of \n     the fact that other proposals would have imposed monetary \n     penalties against Internet operators who knowingly dispense a \n     prescription drug without a valid description--a provision \n     missing from this bill. Consistent with drugstore.com's \n     position that rogue sites should be held accountable for \n     their noncompliance with the law, we would have preferred \n     that such penalties be retained as a disincentive to those \n     inclined to violate the law. However, we hope that the \n     enforcement powers included in the bill will be used \n     effectively against illegal operators.\n       One of the greatest dangers posed to Internet consumers and \n     to legitimate Internet pharmacies across the country is the \n     problem of rogue operators domiciled overseas. Again, we \n     reiterate that the Federal government must exert a much \n     greater effort to address this problem, including working \n     with foreign governments and increasing import surveillance, \n     to deny these rogue sites a safe harbor in the United States.\n       Finally, we support and encourage consumer education \n     initiatives regarding the dangers and pitfalls of buying from \n     rogue sites, and are pleased to see that the bill mandates \n     such public education. Recently, we participated with the \n     Food and Drug Administration in the CybeRxSmart coalition \n     that is designed to educate and increase consumer awareness \n     on how to purchase prescription drugs safely and legitimately \n     via the Internet. Given the importance of Internet commerce, \n     both to consumers and the economy, we would have preferred \n     that the bill made mandatory the involvement of private \n     sector Internet health care providers in the development of \n     consumer education programs in order to draw on their \n     extensive expertise and enhance the support of such \n     activities.\n       In summary, we believe that, if sufficient resources are \n     made available to back up the will of Congress as stated in \n     this bill, the Internet Prescription Drug Consumer Protection \n     Act of 2000 can increase consumer awareness of those unsafe \n     Internet sites and enforce federal and state laws against \n     interstate Internet sellers which mislead, and jeopardize the \n     health and safety of, consumers.\n       We appreciate your attention to this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Peter M. Neupert,\n     CEO and President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    National Consumers League,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The National Consumers League, \n     America's oldest nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, is \n     pleased to support the Internet Prescription Drug Consumer \n     Protection Act of 2000. With the increasing use of the \n     Internet to purchase prescription drugs, consumers need \n     adequate protection and information when purchasing \n     medications online. Unfortunately, there are numerous \n     websites that are willing to sell consumers prescription \n     medications without a valid prescription from a licensed \n     provider. These sellers threaten consumer and patient safety \n     and stigmatize the\n\n[[Page S10623]]\n\n     universe of Internet pharmacies, many of which comply with \n     state and federal regulations governing the prescribing and \n     dispensing of medications.\n       This legislation will provide valuable protections for \n     consumers by addressing the deficiencies that currently exist \n     for state and federal law enforcement agencies to take action \n     against illegitimate sellers. By requiring all Internet \n     pharmacy websites to be licensed in any state that they sell \n     or ship prescription drugs, consumers will have the \n     confidence that their health and safety are being protected \n     and the purchases they make will be legitimate.\n       Further, we commend the requirement of a consumer education \n     component in this legislation. Without adequate public \n     education consumers would still remain vulnerable to \n     unscrupulous Internet sites despite the enhanced enforcement \n     tools provided in the legislation.\n       The National Consumers League supports this important piece \n     of legislation and commends you and the other Members of \n     Congress for helping to improve patient safety and enhance \n     consumer protections online. We look forward to working with \n     you on this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Linda F. Golodner,\n\n                                                President.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Kennedy and \nJeffords in introducing the ``Internet Prescription Drug Consumer \nProtection Act of 2000,'' legislation that offers much-needed \nsafeguards for consumers who purchase prescription drugs over the \nInternet. This legislation will, for the first time, require online \nsellers of pharmaceuticals to comply with the same basic standards as \ntraditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies and will create additional \nenforcement tools so that states and federal agencies can take \neffective action against online pharmacies that endanger the public \nsafety.\n  As with most of the recent advances in technology over the past \ndecade, the ability to shop over the Internet has brought with it new \nbenefits, as well as new worries. While many of us applaud the \nadvantages that e-commerce has provided, when it comes to the purchase \nof products with a direct and immediate impact on health and safety--\nsuch as prescription drugs--we must seriously consider the risks that \ncome with convenience.\n  While some online pharmacies have adopted all the safeguards of \ntraditional pharmacies, such as hiring licensed pharmacists and \nrequiring valid prescriptions before dispensing drugs, increasingly, \nunscrupulous companies have used the anonymity of cyberspace to hide \nfrom federal and state safety regulations, placing the health of their \ncustomers at serious risk. These unethical companies can easily take \nadvantage of the fact that, as consumers, we may leave our common sense \nbehind when we turn on our computers. Too often, we assume that simply \nbecause a business has a website, it must be legitimate.\n  Consequently, we've received hundreds of reports of Internet \npharmacies selling powerful prescription drugs to consumers simply on \nthe basis of answers to a health questionnaire--without the patient \never setting foot in a doctor's office. This practice, which has been \ncondemned as unethical by the American Medical Association, places \npatients at serious risk for misdiagnoses and dangerous drug \ninteractions. Perhaps even more frightening is that some Internet \nsellers are dispensing contaminated or counterfeit drugs to their \nunsuspecting customers. And, unfortunately, the ease with which \nwebsites can be created and removed and the difficulty regulators have \nin determining the identity of the corporations behind the websites \ncreate obstacles to states and federal agencies trying to shut down \nunlawful sellers.\n  This legislation would require online sellers of prescription drugs \nto dispense medications only with valid prescriptions, to notify state \nboards of pharmacy in each state in which they operate of the \nestablishment of their service, and to provide full disclosure of the \naddress and telephone number of the business's headquarters on their \nwebsite. Under this bill, Internet sellers who do not adhere to these \nbasic standards will risk serious legal sanctions, including permanent \nprohibition from conducting further business and the freezing of \nassets.\n  While we should ensure that legitimate pharmacies can continue to \nserve their customers on the information superhighway, we need to act \nimmediately to derail those who would use the Internet in unsafe or \nillicit ways. The legislation we introduce today will give state and \nfederal agencies the appropriate authority to protect American \nconsumers from unscrupulous Internet sellers. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join us as cosponsors of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Lieberman (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Biden, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \n        Roth, and Mr. L. Chafee)):\n  S. 3209. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to carry out \na resource study of the approximately 600-mile route through the States \nof Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New \nYork, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia, used by George \nWashington and General Rochambeau during the Revolutionary War; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n\nwashington-rochambeau revolutionary route national heritage act of 2000\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, 219 years ago this month, a \nsmall army camped at the gates of a small port in Virginia. And turned \nthe world upside down. This collection of often poorly fed, poorly \npaid, and poorly armed men made a sacrifice from which we all benefit \ntoday. In October 1781, a few thousand American and French soldiers \nlaid siege to Yorktown, forced the surrender of Cornwallis and his \nBritish regulars, and won American independence.\n  Although we often remember the victory at Yorktown, too often we lose \nsight of the heroic efforts that made it possible. Too often we forget \nthat this victory was the culmination of a miraculous campaign--when \ntwo nations, two armies, and two great men put aside their differences \nand worked together for a common purpose.\n  It is my opinion that no single monument or battlefield would do \njustice to the scope of this event. That is why I, along with my \ncolleagues, Senators Dodd, Kerry, Biden, Roth, Schumer, Moynihan, \nSarbanes, and Chafee, am privileged to call for a national \ncommemoration of the events leading to our victory at Yorktown and the \nend of the American Revolution. We have been strongly supported in this \neffort by the work of dedicated volunteers across the country--members \nof the Sons of the American Revolution in all of our states. I would \nespecially like to acknowledge the help of Albert McJoynt and Win \nCarroll, for their work with my staff on this important project.\n  The Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Road is 600 miles of history, \nwinding from Providence, Rhode Island to Yorktown, Virginia. In the \nopinion of my colleagues and I, it is well worthy of designation as a \nNational Historic Trail. Let us document the events in the cities and \ntowns all along the road to Yorktown and the birth of this great nation \nof ours. Let us celebrate the unprecedented Franco-American alliance \nand the superhuman efforts of Generals George Washington and Jean \nBaptiste Donatien de Vimeur, Comte de Rochambeau to preserve that \nalliance in the face of seemingly unsurmountable odds. Let us create a \nNational Historic Trail along whose course we can pause and remember \nthese men and women, their travels, and sacrifices--from the journey's \nbeginning when Rochambeau led the French army out of Newport and \nProvidence, Rhode Island, into New York where he joined Washington's \ntroops, and through a cross section of colonial America to its \nculmination at the gates of Yorktown.\n  The story of the alliance and the march is like many in our history--\nfull of heroic characters, brave deeds, and political intrigue. \nHollywood should take note: it would make for a blockbuster--and \nuplifting--adventure. The story unfolds through seven states and \ncountless towns and stars the men and women of the march who left their \nmark wherever they went.\n  Each of the towns on the trail makes its own unique contribution to \nthe tale of the journey. Hartford and Wethersfield, in my own state of \nConnecticut--where the two generals met and through a translator \nplanned their\n\n[[Page S10624]]\n\nstrategy. In Phillipsburg, New York, the French and American armies \nfirst joined together and faced off against the British in New York \nCity. Here, Washington and Rochambeau planned their high risk \nstrategy--abandoning established positions in the north and racing \nhundreds of miles south to surprise and trap an unsuspecting British \narmy. In Chatham, New Jersey, the French made a show of storing \nsupplies and building bread ovens in order to disguise their march \ntowards Cornwallis in Virginia, to confuse the British. They moved on \nthrough Princeton and Trenton, New Jersey--sites of previous colonial \nvictories against great odds.\n  But the march itself is only part of the story. The unprecedented \nalliance between France and America was cemented during this journey. \nElite troops from one of the great European powers stood with the \nragtag but spirited Continental Army to face and defeat the British \nEmpire. Men who shared no common language and had in many cases been \nenemies in previous wars, shared clothing and food and cultures in \norder to achieve their goal. And as a proud member of the Armed \nServices Committee I am pleased to say this was a successful Joint and \nCoalition operation.\n  The trail goes through Philadelphia, Pennsylvania--then capital of \nthe colonies. Here Washington and Rochambeau stopped their men outside \ntown, had them clean off the dirt of the trail and marched them through \ntown with drums beating and flags unfurled before the Continental \nCongress and the people of Philadelphia. The grandeur of their new \nEuropean ally helped restore the spirit of America during this very \nuncertain time.\n  A few days later in Chester, Pennsylvania, Washington, the normally \nreserved commander-in-chief, literally danced on the dock when he \nlearned the French fleet had arrived in the Chesapeake and trapped the \nBritish at Yorktown. For the first time, it seemed that victory for the \ncolonies was possible. The armies marched on to Wilmington, Delaware \nand Elkton, Maryland, where American troops were finally paid for some \nof their efforts, using money borrowed by the bankrupt Continental Army \nfrom General Rochambeau.\n  There are two central characters to this drama, without whom the \nmarch, siege, and victory would have never happened--Rochambeau and \nWashington. French ministers hand-selected the celebrated and \nexperienced Rochambeau for the unique ``Expedition Particuliere'' \nbecause of his patience and professionalism. Lieutenant General \nRochambeau had a distinguished military career. More importantly, he \nunderstood the need for America to play the leading role in the war. \nWith dignity and respect, he subordinated himself and his men to \nWashington and his patchwork forces. While avoiding intrigue and \nscandal, he overlooked improprieties and affronts, and provided needed \ncounsel, supplies, and money to Washington and his men. He is \nundoubtedly one of the key forces helping Washington to victory at \nYorktown, and has rightly been called ``America's Neglected Founding \nFather.''\n  Our nation's capital region also played its part in this story. \nTroops camped in Baltimore near the site of today's Camden Yards. Some \ncrossed the Potomac near Georgetown, while others camped in Alexandria, \nVirginia. Along the way, General Washington made a triumphal return to \nMount Vernon, and hosted a celebration for his French allies. All along \nthe route, towns were touched and thrilled by the passage of the army \nand events swirling around them. Within this national commemoration, we \nshould let each tell its own story in its own way.\n\n  The force that held it all together throughout the march and on to \nvictory was General Washington. This was not a new role for him. Before \nthe war, Washington was one of the wealthiest men in the colonies and \none of its few military heroes. Only he, with his public standing and \nincredible resolve, could have held together the fledgling Continental \nArmy, the divided loyalties of the American people, a meddling \nCongress, disloyal generals, and an international alliance, for the six \nyears leading up to the Yorktown Campaign. He overcame his own distrust \nand doubt and invited his old enemies, the French--who had held him \nprisoner in an earlier war--to field a European army in the colonies \nwhile he was working with all his energy to evict another one. Over the \nyears, he had used his own money and credit to pay and feed his men. \nAnd he carefully balanced the need to combine his new nation's \nindependence with delicate European sensibilities to forge a winning \nalliance. In these months in 1781, he took a grand risk and won the \nwar. Although the march is not his most famous hour, in many ways it is \nhis finest.\n  The armies marched on through Williamsburg, Virginia until they \nreached positions outside Yorktown in late September. Washington and \nRochambeau and their troops went on to win this battle and the war. The \nrest is history. We should work today to ensure that this history, in \nall its rich detail, is not forgotten. We have the support of many \nstate and local and private and public historic preservation groups in \nour efforts to establish this trail. We should use their momentum and \nenthusiasm to make it a reality. This bill begins that process, by \ndirecting the Secretary of the Interior to perform a resource study on \nthe establishment of this trail, in coordination with their activities \nand other Congressionally mandated programs. In a time when it seems we \nhave few heroes, let us take the time to better remember the heroes of \nour past. Those who sacificed so much for our freedom today deserve no \nless.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. SESSIONS:\n  S. 3210. A bill to amend chapter 1 of title 9, United States Code, to \nprovide for greater fairness in the arbitration process for consumers \nand employees; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          the consumer and employee arbitration bill of rights\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to sent to the desk a bill \nentitled, ``The Consumer and Employee Arbitration Bill of Rights.'' \nThis bill begins the multi-year legislative process necessary to \nimprove the Federal Arbitration Act so that it will be a cost-effective \nmeans of resolving disputes. This bill of rights will provide \nprocedural protections to consumers and employees to ensure that their \nclaims will be resolved under due process of law, in a speedy and cost \neffective manner.\n  Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act in 1925. It has served \nus as well for three-quarters of a century. Under the Act, if the \nparties agree to a contract affecting interstate commerce that contains \na clause requiring arbitration, the clause will be enforceable in \ncourt. In short, the Federal Arbitration Act allows parties to a \ncontract to agree not to take their disputes to court, but to resolve \nany dispute arising from that contract before a neutral decision-maker, \ngenerally selected by a non-profit arbitration organization. The \nparties can generally present evidence and be represented by counsel. \nAnd the decision-makers will apply the relevant state law in resolving \nthe dispute. Arbitration is generally quicker and less expensive than \ngoing to court.\n  In recent years, there have been some cases where the arbitration \nprocess has not worked well, but thousands of disputes have been fairly \nand effectively settled by arbitrators. Such a system is even more \nimportant because of skyrocketing legal costs where attorneys require \nlarge contingent fees. Accordingly, I have opposed piecemeal \nlegislative changes to the act. Instead, I believe the time has come \nfor a comprehensive review of how arbitration works and what we can do \nto enhance its effectiveness.\n  The approach of reforming arbitration, rather than abandoning the \narbitration process provides several benefits. Arbitration is one of \nthe best means of dispute resolution and one that most consumers and \nemployees can afford. Consumers and employees generally cannot afford a \nteam of lawyers to represent them. And their claims are often not big \nenough so that a lawyer would take the case on a 25 percent or even a \n50 percent contingent fee. Thus, the consumer or employee is faced with \nhaving to pay a lawyer's hourly rate for his claim. If he can afford to \npay the hourly rate, he must decide whether it makes financial sense to \npay a lawyer several thousand dollars to litigate a claim in court for \na broken television that cost $700 new. If this is what consumers and \nemployees are left with, many will have no choice but to drop their \nclaim. This is not right. It is not fair.\n\n[[Page S10625]]\n\n  This is where arbitration can give the consumer or employee a cost \neffective forum to assert their claim. Thus, before we make exceptions \nto the Federal Arbitration Act for some of the most well to do \ncorporations in our society, I think it is our duty to consider how we \ncan improve the system for those less financially able.\n  A letter I recently received from the National Arbitration Forum \ncontained some interesting comments about the importance of \narbitration: the ABA has calculated that 100 million Americans are \nlocked out of court by high legal costs, and that most lawyers will not \nbegin a lawsuit worth less than $20,000, while arbitration serves as an \naccessible forum for dispute resolution; consumer class actions \nincreasingly generate little more than coupons for consumers, while \ncontractual arbitration gives a consumer the ability to get his or her \ncase before a neutral party at a reasonable price and in a reasonable \namount of time; a recent Roper Study indicates that 59 percent of \nAmericans would choose arbitration over a lawsuit to resolve a claim \nfor money.\n  Thus, the benefits for customers and employees are readily apparent. \nCan we improve this system? Yes, but we must take a balanced approach.\n  Further, arbitration promotes the freedom of parties to make \ncontracts. I was recently contacted by Professor Stephen Ware of the \nCumberland School of Law, who reminded us that the promotion of \ncontractual freedom regarding arbitration has long been a primary goal \nof the Federal Arbitration Act. In any contract, the parties agree to \nall the terms and clauses included in the contract document. This \nincludes the arbitration clause. This is basic contract law, and the \nbasic principle upon which the Federal Arbitration Act has been \nsupported for 75 years.\n  But this is not always the case. In certain situations, consumers or \nemployees are not treated fairly. That is what the Consumer and \nEmployee Arbitration Bill of Rights is designed to correct.\n  The bill will maintain the cost benefits of binding arbitration, but \nwould grant several specific ``due process'' rights to consumers and \nemployees. The bill is based on the consumer and employee due process \nprotocols of the American Arbitration Association and have broad \nsupport. The bill provides the following rights:\n  No. 1, notice--Under the bill an arbitration clause, to be \nenforceable, would have to have a heading in large, bold print, would \nhave to state whether arbitration is binding or optional, identify a \nsource that the consumer or employee could contact for more \ninformation, and state that a consumer could opt out to small claims \ncourt.\n  This will ensure that consumers who receive credit card notices in \nthe mail will not miss an arbitration clause because it is printed in \nfine print. Further, it will give consumers and employees a means to \nobtain more information on how to resolve any disputes. Finally, the \nclause would explain that if a consumer's claims could otherwise be \nbrought in small claims court, he is free to do so. Small claims court, \nunlike regular trial court, provides another inexpensive and quick \nmeans of dispute resolution.\n  No. 2, independent selection of arbitrators--The bill will grant \nconsumers and employees the right to have potential arbitrators \ndisclose relevant information concerning their business ties and \nemployment. All parties to the arbitration will have an equal voice in \nselecting a neutral arbitrator. This ensures that the large company who \nsold a consumer a product will not select the arbitrator itself, \nbecause the consumer or the employee with a grievance will have the \nright to nominate potential arbitrators too. As a result, the final \narbitrator selected will have to have the explicit approval of both \nparties to the dispute. This means the arbitrator will be a neutral \nparty with no allegiance to either the seller or the consumer.\n  No. 3, choice of law--The bill grants consumers and employees the \nright to have the arbitrator governed by the substantive law that would \napply under conflicts of laws principles applicable in the forum in \nwhich the consumer resided at the time the contract was entered into. \nThis means that the substantive contract law that would apply in a \ncourt where the consumer or employee resides at the time of making the \ncontract will apply in the arbitration. Thus, in a dispute arising from \nthe purchase of a product by an Alabama consumer from an Illinois \ncompany, a court would have to determine whether Alabama or Illinois \nlaw applied by looking to the language of the contract and to the place \nthe contract was entered into. The bill ensures that an arbitrator will \nuse the same conflict of laws principles that a court would in \ndetermining whether Alabama or Illinois law will govern the arbitration \nproceedings.\n  No. 4, representation--The bill grants consumers and employees the \nright to be represented by counsel at his own expense. Thus, if the \nclaim involves complicated legal issues, the consumer or employee is \nfree to have his lawyer represent him in the arbitration. Such \nrepresentation should be substantially less expensive than a trial in \ncourt because of the more abbreviated and expedited process of \narbitration.\n  No. 5, hearing--The bill grants consumers and employees the right to \na fair hearing in a forum that is reasonably convenient to the consumer \nor employee. This would prevent a large company from requiring a \nconsumer or employee to travel across the country to arbitrate his \nclaim and to expend more in travel costs than his claim may be worth.\n\n  No. 6, evidence--The bill grants consumers and employees the right to \nconduct discovery and to present evidence. This ensures that the \narbitrator will have all the facts before him prior to making a \ndecision.\n  No. 7, cross examination--The bill grants consumers and employees the \nright to cross-examine witnesses presented by the other party at the \nhearing. This allows a party to test the statements of the other \nparty's witnesses and be sure that the evidence before the arbitrator \nis correct.\n  No. 8, record--The bill grants consumers and employees the right to \nhire a stenographer or tape record the hearing to produce a record. \nThis right is key to proving later that the arbitration proceeding was \nfair.\n  No. 9, timely resolution--The bill grants consumers and employees the \nright to have an arbitration proceeding to be completed promptly so \nthat they do not have to wait for a year or more to have their claim \nresolved. Under the bill a defendant must file an answer within 30 days \nof the filing of the complaint. The arbitrator has 90 days after the \nanswer to hold a hearing. The arbitrator must render a final decision \nwithin 30 days after the hearing. Extensions are available in \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  No. 10, written decision--The bill grants consumers and employees the \nright to a written decision by the arbitrator explaining the resolution \nof the case and his reasons therefor. If the consumer or employee takes \na claim to arbitration, he deserves to have an explanation of why he \nwon or lost.\n  No. 11, expenses--The bill grants consumers and employees the right \nto have an arbitrator provide for reimbursement of arbitration fees in \nthe interests of justice and the reduction, deferral, or waiver of \narbitration fees in cases of extreme hardship. It does little good to \ntake a claim to arbitration if the consumer or employee cannot even \nafford the arbitration fee. This provision ensures that the arbitrator \ncan waive or reduce the fee or make the company reimburse the consumer \nor employee for a fee if the interests of justice so require.\n  No. 12, small claims opt out--The bill grants consumers and employees \nthe right to opt out of arbitration into small claims court if that \ncourt has jurisdiction over the claim and the claim does not exceed \n$50,000.\n  The bill also provides an effective mechanism for consumers and \nemployees to enforce these rights. At any time, if a consumer or \nemployee believes that the other party violated his rights, he may ask \nand the arbitrator may award a penalty up to the amount of the claim \nplus attorneys fees. For example, if the company fails to provide \ndiscovery to the employee, the employee can make a motion for fees. The \namount of fee award is limited, as it is in court, to the amount of \ncost incurred by the employee in trying to obtain the information from \nthe company. This principle is taken from Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 37.\n  After the decision, if the losing party believes that the rights \ngranted to him\n\n[[Page S10626]]\n\nby the Act have been violated, he may file a petition with the Federal \ndistrict court. If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence \nthat his rights were violated, it may order a new arbitrator appointed. \nThus, if a consumer or employee has an arbitrator that is unfair and \nthis causes him to lose the case, the consumer or employee can obtain \nanother arbitrator.\n  Mr. President, this bill is the first step to creating a constructive \ndialog on arbitration reform. This bill of rights will ensure that \nthose who can least afford to go to court can go to a less expensive \narbitrator and be treated fairly. It will ensure that every arbitration \ncarried out under the Federal Arbitration Act is completed fairly, \npromptly, and economically. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to ensure that consumers and employees who \nagree in a contract to arbitrate their claims will be afforded due \nprocess of law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to provide \ngrants to develop technologies to eliminate functional barriers to full \nindependence for individuals with disabilities, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  THE TECHNOLOGY FOR ALL AMERICANS ACT\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Technology \nfor All Americans Act. This Act will maximize our country's potential \nby helping to close the Digital Divide for people with disabilities. In \ndoing so, it will increase their independence and self-sufficiency and \nfurther strengthen our economy and society by enabling the greatest \npossible number of us to contribute our abilities.\n  As we celebrate the Americans with Disabilities Act's 10th \nAnniversary, we are entering a new millennium; one that will be defined \nby technology. But technology can be a double-edged sword for people \nwith disabilities, who continue to fight for the freedom to live \nindependently.\n  If the Internet and other technologies are accessible, they will \noffer people with disabilities unprecedented opportunities for \nindependence and self-sufficiency. But if they are not accessible, they \nsimply will create new barriers to full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and our economy.\n  Although new technologies have improved the lives of many Americans \nwith disabilities, there remains a significant ``Digital Divide'' \nbetween Americans with and without disabilities. Although people with \ndisabilities are nearly twice as likely as people without disabilities \nto say that the Internet has improved their lives significantly, they \nare barely one-quarter as likely to use the Internet and less than half \nas likely to have access to a computer at home.\n  The Technology for All Americans Act will begin to bridge this gap. \nThe Act provides incentives for public and private researchers to use \nuniversal design and accessibility principles in new technologies, and \nto develop technologies to eliminate functional barriers to full \nindependence for people with disabilities. It will increase public \naccess to technology by providing grants to States to make public \nlibraries, including those in elementary and secondary schools, \ntechnology accessible. It will increase the development and use of \naccessible technology by providing grants to colleges and universities \nto establish model curricula incorporating the design and use of \naccessible technology into academic and professional programs. And it \nwill help children with disabilities maximize their potential in school \nand after graduation by ensuring their access to technology. In a \nnutshell, this Act will help ensure that people with disabilities have \nan equal opportunity to participate in society.\n  But, this act is not just for people with disabilities. It is, as \nit's name says, for all Americans. When people with disabilities \nsucceed in school, join the workforce, and participate in day-to-day \nlife, we all benefit from their abilities.\n  History also demonstrates that research on accessible technology \nbenefits everyone. How many people know that the typewriter was \ninvented for an Italian countess who was blind? In 1990, the Television \nDecoder Circuitry Act, which I introduced, required closed captioning \nfor most television sets so that people who are deaf could watch TV. \nBut today millions of people who are not deaf use closed captioning at \nhome, at work, at gyms, and at sports bars, to name a few. And, \nmillions of people use voice-activated technology at work or in car \nphones and cell phones. That technology also was intended primarily for \npeople with disabilities.\n  This trend will accelerate as the Technology Revolution moves \nforward. The technologies that make things accessible for people with \ndisabilities have applications for all of us.\n  More and more each day, every American's ability to participate in \nsociety is determined by how well they are able to use technology. This \nAct will help us take the greatest advantage of technology for the \nbenefit of the greatest number of Americans. This must be one of our \npriorities as we move into the new millennium.\n  So I ask my colleagues, people with disabilities, educators, \ntechnology experts, and others who are interested to share their ideas \nwith me about this bill and about the issue of making technology \naccessible to every American, so that next Congress we can ensure that \nevery American has access to the tools that will shape our \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url":

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bear Protection Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) all 8 extant species of bear--Asian black bear, brown \n     bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, giant \n     panda, sun bear, and sloth bear--are listed on Appendix I or \n     II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered \n     Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087; TIAS 8249) \n     (referred to in this section as ``CITES'');\n       (2) Article XIV of CITES provides that Parties to CITES may \n     adopt stricter domestic measures regarding the conditions for \n     trade, taking, possession, or transport of species on \n     Appendix I or II, and the Parties to CITES adopted a \n     resolution (Conf. 10.8) urging Parties to take immediate \n     action to demonstrably reduce the illegal trade in bear parts \n     and derivatives;\n       (3) the Asian bear populations have declined significantly \n     in recent years, as a result of habitat loss and poaching due \n     to a strong demand for bear viscera used in traditional \n     medicines and cosmetics;\n       (4) Federal and State undercover operations have revealed \n     that American bears have been poached for their viscera;\n       (5) while most American black bear populations are \n     generally stable or increasing, commercial trade could \n     stimulate poaching and threaten certain populations if the \n     demand for bear viscera increases; and\n       (6) prohibitions against the importation into the United \n     States and exportation from the United States, as well as \n     prohibitions against the interstate trade, of bear viscera \n     and products containing, or labeled or advertised as \n     containing, bear viscera will assist in ensuring that the \n     United States does not contribute to the decline of any bear \n     population as a result of the commercial trade in bear \n     viscera.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term \n     viability of the world's 8 bear species by--\n       (1) prohibiting international trade in bear viscera and \n     products containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, \n     bear viscera;\n       (2) encouraging bilateral and multilateral efforts to \n     eliminate such trade; and\n       (3) ensuring that adequate Federal legislation exists with \n     respect to domestic trade in bear viscera and products \n     containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear \n     viscera.\n\n     SEC. 4.

I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4322) was agreed to, as follows:\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1482, the \nNational Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000. The National Marine \nSanctuary System recognizes the ecological and cultural importance of \nour nation's marine resources. By setting aside these areas for \nprotection above and beyond what is already encompassed in other state \nand federal programs, we are ensuring that the public will benefit from \nthem well into the future.\n  The existing 13 sanctuaries provide more then just protection for the \nmarine resources they encompass. They also provide recreational and \neducational opportunities that might not otherwise exist. For example, \nin the USS Monitor Sanctuary, a sunken Civil War vessel lies off the \ncoast of North Carolina and preserves a piece of our collective \nhistory. And, in the 5,300 square miles of the Monterey Bay Sanctuary, \nthe program protects important kelp forests and one of the deepest \nunderwater canyons on the west coast. This emphasis on complementary \nuses and management is the strength of the sanctuary program.\n  There is much we can do to build upon the successes the sanctuaries \nhave already achieved. By prioritizing our actions over the next few \nyears on making the existing sanctuaries fully operational with \neducation and research programs, a full complement of staff, active \npublic outreach programs, and enforcement we will strengthen the system \nand help it to reach its full potential. At the same time, we are \nincreasing the funding to the system to ensure that these goals can be \nreached. Authorization levels begin at $32 million for fiscal year 2001 \nwith levels increasing by $2 million a year until fiscal year 2005. \nAdditionally, $6 million per year is authorized for construction \nprojects at the sanctuaries.\n  This bill also includes a new initiative to help secure the future of \nmarine resource conservation through the creation of the Dr. Nancy \nFoster Scholarship Program. These graduate scholarships will be funded \nby setting aside 1 percent of the National Marine Sanctuary Program's \nannual appropriated funds in memory of Dr. Nancy Foster, a 23-year NOAA \nemployee who was serving as the Assistant Administrator for Ocean \nServices and Coastal Zone Management at the time of her death in June.\n  I would like to thank Senator Snowe, the sponsor of the legislation, \nand Senators Kerry, Inouye, and Hollings for their bipartisan support \nof and hard work on this bill. I would also like to express my \ngratitude and that of the Commerce Committee to the staff who worked on \nthis bill, including Sloan Rappoport, Stephanie Bailenson, Brooke \nSikora, Rick Kenin and Margaret Spring. In particular I would like to \nthank Emily Lindow, a Sea Grant fellow, whose background and experience \nin coastal management issues helped produce a strong and balanced \nmarine sanctuaries bill.\n  Mr. President, again I urge the Senate to pass S. 1482, the National \nMarine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on S. 1482, \nthe National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000, legislation to \nreauthorize the National Marine Sanctuaries Act.\n  To begin, I want to thank Senator Snowe, our chairman on the Oceans \nand Fisheries Subcommittee on the Commerce Committee, for putting this \nlegislation on the committee agenda this Congress and working \ndiligently for its passage. In addition, passage of this bill would not \nhave been possible without the tireless efforts of the ranking member \nof the subcommittee, Mr. Kerry. I would also like to thank them for \ntheir support and inclusion of the Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program \nin this bill. We were all deeply saddened by Dr. Foster's passing this \nyear, at the height of her career as the head of the National Ocean \nService. I know I speak for all of my colleagues when I say we are only \ntoo pleased to have this opportunity to recognize Dr. Foster's efforts \nto protect, understand, and make the public care about our marine \nenvironment. Dr. Foster was particularly proud of NOAA's Sanctuaries \nProgram and I know she would have appreciated creating this opportunity \nto encourage more women and minorities to become involved in the study \nof the marine environment and conservation of our underwater treasures.\n  When Congress enacted the National Marine Sanctuaries Act in 1972 we \nrecognized that while the Nation had already provided our ``special \nareas'' on land with protections, we had no mechanism to protect those \nareas of the marine environment with unique qualities that are of \nspecial national, and even international, significance. Congress acted \non the need for certain marine areas to be protected from human threats \nand recognized that management of undersea areas posed different \nchallenges than land-based preserves, requiring different expertise and \napproaches. In fact, at the time, the unique character of the marine \nenvironment was the predominant reason for bringing together the \nStratton Commission and the subsequent creation of the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at the Commission's \nrecommendation. Before the creation of NOAA in 1970, the late Senator \nfrom Washington state, Warren Magnuson, noted that twenty-eight \ndifferent departments and agencies dealt with the field of \noceanography. Senator Magnuson concluded, in part because of the lack \nof coordination that we ``know more about the back side of the Moon \nthat we know of three-quarters of the Earth's surface.'' The creation \nof NOAA was the way to go about changing this fact. Since then, \nCongress has consistently endorsed the creation of NOAA 30 years ago as \nthe premier federal agency to manage, study, and protect the marine \nenvironment in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.\n  In much the same way, Congress created the sanctuaries system to \n``provide a coordinated and comprehensive approach to the conservation \nand management of special areas of the marine environment.'' It was the \nclear intent of Congress that a tool was needed to create and protect \nmarine sanctuaries. If the Congress believed that existing laws could \nhave done the job, we would not have created the Sanctuary program. In \nfact, in 1971 we recognized there was a need to create a marine \nsanctuaries program because ``a mechanism for protecting certain \nimportant areas of the coastal zone from intrusive activities by man . \n. . is not met by any legislation now on the books.''\n  Furthermore, the Senate Commerce Committee found that ``the \nestablishment of marine sanctuaries is appropriate where it is \ndesirable to set aside areas of the seabed and the waters above for \nscientific study, to preserve, unique, rare, or characteristic features \nof the oceans, coastal, and other waters, and their total ecosystems.'' \nAs I have said before, it is as clear now as it was then that NOAA is \nthe appropriate\n\n[[Page S10637]]\n\nagency to study and preserve marine ecosystems; the line offices of \nNOAA have expertise in all of the major areas that impact marine \nsanctuaries and the ecosystems on which they depend.\n  Today, nothing has occurred that would change the intent of Congress \nwhen they created the sanctuaries program in 1972--certain areas of the \nmarine environment need special protection and recognition. While that \nprotection has not been as comprehensive as many would like, I know \nthat the program is growing in both energy and focus thanks to a \nconcerted effort from all those who care about our coastal environment. \nThis year marks a great turning point for the program, as a result of \nthe improvements in this legislation, the current five-year review \nprocess, the increased financial commitment by both the Congress and \nthe administration, and the flood of public support for ocean \nconservation. In fact, the exploration and publicity generated by \nNOAA's Sustainable Seas program, in conjunction with the National \nGeographic Society, will help bring a fuller understanding and focus to \neach of our sanctuaries.\n  Now, one of the hallmarks of the Sanctuaries Act is the process that \nCongress established to ensure significant ``up-front'' involvement of \nall constituent groups affected by the designation of a sanctuary. \nAlthough to some this may seem unduly cumbersome, I believe that the \nhistory has shown that this inclusive, open-door process has worked and \nthat the ``behind-closed doors, top-down'' approach creates nothing but \nhavoc and leads to ineffective solutions that lack public support. \nHowever, I am heartened by the fact that President Clinton appears to \nagree with the process Congress created with the sanctuaries program. \nIn Executive Order 13158 on Marine Protected Areas, signed on May 26, \n2000, President Clinton states, ``In carrying out the requirements of . \n. . of this order, [agencies] shall consult with those States that \ncontain portions of the marine environment, the Commonwealth of Puerto \nRico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, Guam, \nand the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, tribes, Regional \nFishery Management Councils, and other entities, as appropriate, to \npromote coordination of Federal, State, territorial, and tribal actions \nto establish and manage MPAs.''\n  I would urge the administration to continue meeting the commitment to \ninvolve the public, the states, and tribes as much as possible up \nfront, particularly with respect to efforts currently underway within \nthe administration to identify and protect the corals and other living \nmarine resources of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Use the \nauthorities and direction contained in the Sanctuaries Act; it is \nflexible, works well with our nearshore analogs, the National Estuarine \nResearch Reserves, and other coastal reserves and parks, and has the \nadded benefit of a well-known process that has worked to ensure lasting \npublic support for protecting the marine environment. In this regard, I \ncommend the cooperative efforts of NOAA, and other federal and state \nagencies, and all the constituent groups in putting together the \nTortugas Ecological Reserve under able leadership of the Florida Keys \nNational Marine Sanctuary.\n  NOAA was established 30 years ago to research, protect, and manage \nour nations oceans and atmosphere. That statement may seem fairly \nobvious, but there are some who may have lost sight of where we've come \nfrom and where we are going. So I thought I would re-state \ncongressional intent for the record: Congress clearly intended that \nNOAA be the lead agency in development of a comprehensive and \ncoordinated ocean and coastal management system, including marine \nprotected areas, under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act and many of \nthe other statutes it implements such as the Coastal Zone Management \nAct and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.\n  In closing, I would like again state my support for the National \nMarine Sanctuaries Amendments Act and to urge its adoption by the \nSenate. This bill takes an important step to further the wise \nstewardship of our marine resources and the protection of areas of \nsignificant ecological, aesthetic, historical and recreational value. \nIt will improve our 13 existing sanctuaries, provide a rational \nframework for the designation of any future marine sanctuaries, and \noffers a sound mechanism for a coordinating a national system of marine \nprotected areas.\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1482, the \nNational Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000. This bill \nrepresents a major breakthrough for the protection of our coastal and \nmarine resources by reauthorizing the marine sanctuary program. It is \nhighly appropriate that we are considering this bill because just last \nweek, on October 7, 2000, we designated our 13th national marine \nsanctuary in Thunder Bay. This is the first sanctuary in the system to \nbe designated in the Great Lakes and serves as a perfect example of the \ntype of federal and state partnerships that have contributed to the \nsuccess of our other sanctuaries.\n  One hundred years after the first national park was created, the \nUnited States made a similar commitment to preserving its valuable \nmarine resources by establishing the National Marine Sanctuary Program \nin 1972. Since then, 13 areas covering a wide range of marine habitats \nhave been designated as national marine sanctuaries in the Atlantic, \nPacific, Great Lakes and Gulf of Mexico. Today, the sanctuaries program \nprotects over 18,000 square miles of our seas. Not only do the \nsanctuaries help protect unique ecosystems, but they also serve as \nmodels for multiple use management in the marine environment. \nAdditionally, the sanctuaries can also function as platforms for better \nocean stewardship, allowing opportunities for research, education, and \noutreach activities.\n  One of the most serious impediments to achieving the original goals \nof the program is the lack of funding. This bill authorizes funds at a \nlevel that we hope will allow full implementation of the sanctuary \nprogram. The bill authorizes $32 million in fiscal year 2001, with \nlevels increasing by $2 million a year until fiscal year 2005. It also \nauthorizes $6 million a year in fiscal years 2001 through 2005 for \nconstruction projects at the sanctuaries.\n  Additionally, we have set the priority for the next few years on \nmaking the existing sanctuaries fully operational before expanding the \nsanctuary system. These marine sanctuaries have tremendous potential \nfor protecting our marine resources and increasing the public's \nawareness of the marine environment. However, lack of funding has \nprevented the sanctuary program from reaching its full potential. By \nincreasing authorization levels and focusing our attention on the \nexisting sanctuaries we can drastically increase the public benefits \nfrom these sanctuaries.\n  There are two exceptions to this limitation. The first is to allow \nfor the completion of the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary \ndesignation. The second is to allow for the development of a sanctuary \nin the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. These unpopulated islands provide \na refuge for marine resources without the typical coastal development \npressures. They are also home to the majority of the United States' \ncoral reefs. The people of Hawaii have strong ties to these islands \nand, in recent years, have been working on a variety of conservation \nstrategies to better manage these valuable resources. One of the \noptions being discussed is a national marine sanctuary. Members of the \nSubcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries want to ensure that this remains \nan option. The full complement of marine conservation and management \nprograms administered by the Department of Commerce will provide for \nmeaningful and lasting protections of these resources.\n  This bill also creates the Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program to \nrecognize outstanding scholarship, particularly by women and \nminorities, in the fields of oceanography, marine biology, or maritime \narcheology. The scholarships will be used to support the graduate \nstudies and research of its recipients. It is being established in \nhonor of Dr. Nancy Foster, a 23-year NOAA employee who was serving as \nthe Assistant Administrator for Ocean Services and Coastal Zone \nManagement at the time of her death in June. The scholarship will be \nfunded by setting aside 1 percent of the National Marine Sanctuary \nProgram's annual appropriated funds. I can think of no better tribute\n\n[[Page S10638]]\n\nto Dr. Foster's long commitment to marine resource conservation and \nmanagement then helping the next generation of scientists and managers \nlaunch their careers.\n  I would like to thank Senator Kerry, the ranking member of the Oceans \nand Fisheries Subcommittee for his hard work and support of this bill. \nI would also like to thank Senator Inouye for his support, particularly \nfor his contributions to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef \nReserve provision. In addition, I would like to thank Senator McCain, \nthe chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator Hollings, the \nranking member of the Committee, for their bipartisan support of this \nmeasure. We have before us an opportunity to significantly improve our \nnation's ability to conserve and manage our marine resources and I urge \nthe Senate to pass S. 1482, as amended.\n\n\n                        marine sanctuary program\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to thank \nSenators Snowe, Kerry and Hollings for their dedicated efforts in \nsupport of this important measure and engage in a discussion of certain \nprovisions of S. 1482, the National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act \nof 2000.\n  Since its creation in 1972, the National Marine Sanctuary Program has \nsuccessfully protected our nation's unique marine resources through a \ndeliberative process that has allowed affected citizens to help shape \nthe future of the protected resources. The Hawaiian Islands Humpback \nWhale National Marine Sanctuary is an excellent example of how \ndivergent interests came together to develop a plan for the protection \nof the unique marine resources of this area.\n  We now have a new opportunity to enhance the protection of another \nunique Hawaiian resource--the coral reef ecosystem surrounding the \nNorthwestern Hawaiian Island (NWHI). In May of this year, President \nClinton expressed his desire to provide strong and lasting protection \nfor the coral reef ecosystem of the NWHI, and directed the Secretaries \nof the Interior and Commerce, in cooperation with the State of Hawaii \nand in consultation with the Western Pacific Regional Fishery \nManagement Council (WESPAC), to develop recommendations for ``a new, \ncoordinated management regime to increase protection for the coral reef \necosystem'' of the NWHI.\n  I agree with the President that there should be strong and lasting \nprotection for the coral reef ecosystem of the NWHI. I also believe \nthat it is critical to ensure meaningful public input on the nature of \nactions to be taken and to foster public support for these lasting \nprotections.\n  Prior to the President's announcement, the Commerce Department \nalready had a solid head start in efforts to identify and evaluate \nactions to protect the resources of the NWHI in developing the first \never ecosystem level fishery management plan. This Coral Reef Ecosystem \nFisheries Management Plan, which identifies a series of actions such as \n``no-take'' closures for coral and monk seal protection, was subject to \nextensive public comment and is now undergoing departmental internal \nreview.\n  To complement this ongoing effort, the sanctuary program is well \nequipped to achieve the President's goals while ensuring meaningful \npublic participation. Accordingly, S. 1482 would trigger an immediate \nprocess for designating a sanctuary in the NWHI. In the interim, to \naccommodate President Clinton's desire to implement protections without \ndelay, S. 1482 would authorize the President, after consulting with the \nGovernor of the State of Hawaii, to designate any coral reef ecosystem \narea in the NWHI as a coral reef reserve, and establish a Coral Reef \nReserve Advisory Council to work with the Secretary of Commerce in \ndeveloping a long-range and lasting plan to protect the living marine \nresources of the NWHI. The Coral Reef Reserve area would ultimately \nbecome part of any sanctuary established in the NWHI.\n  The Dry Tortugas Ecological Reserve and Natural Resource area off the \nFlorida Keys is in many ways similar to what is being proposed for the \nNorthwestern Hawaiians Islands. However, the Dry Tortugas process \nbenefited from an extensive public process which ensured community \nconcerns were heard and addressed. As a result of this process, there \nis now widespread support for this ecological reserve.\n  I am concerned about the administration's interest in immediately \nestablishing, without any public input, areas around the NWHI within \nwhich all activities are permanently prohibited except for Native \nHawaiian access and subsistence. This could mean that all other \nactivities, including commercial and recreational access and possibly \ncertain defense activities, would be prohibited within these areas \nforever. Whatever protections the administration feels are necessary \nshould be subject to review during the course of the sanctuary \ndesignation process. Even the Administration's U.S. Coral Reef Task \nForce contemplated a deliberative process when it recommended the goal \nof achieving at least 20 percent protection by the year 2010.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I agree with my colleague from the great State of \nHawaii. The National Sanctuary Program is an ideal tool for coordinated \nand comprehensive management of the coral reef ecosystem of the NWHI. I \nfurther agree that any closure areas imposed by the President prior to \nthe completion of the sanctuary designation process should be subject \nto public comment and review before it becomes permanently carved in \nstone. Does the Senator envision that the Reserve area would be subject \nto the same 5-year program review that the Sanctuary process provides? \nIn addition to Congressional oversight, such periodic and rigorous \nreview will help ensure the Sanctuary and Reserve are meeting the \nexpectations set by the people of Hawaii, the Sanctuary Advisory \nCouncil, the Secretary of Commerce, and the President.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes, in addition to the evaluation process provided for \nin the designation, the legislation ensures that such a 5-year review \nwould take place. While we know enough about the area to understand the \nneed to protect it, we will know far more about it in 5 years. In \nconjunction with the development of a Sanctuary the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration is already mapping and assessing the \ncoral ecosystem of this area, and evaluating the status of its living \nmarine resources. It will be important to use this information to \nevaluate whether the management of the area under the National Marine \nSanctuaries Act, in conjunction with other marine conservation laws, is \nadequate.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I fully concur with my colleagues that robust public \nparticipation, oversight and review is necessary to ensure long-term \nmeaningful protection of our living marine resources whether in Hawaii \nor in my home state of Maine. While I agree that it is appropriate to \ntake action to protect our precious coral resources, I, to, am greatly \nconcerned about the administration's plans to impose immediate and \npermanent prohibitions in marine areas without providing a meaningful \nopportunity for public comment on the proposal. Both the National \nMarine Sanctuaries Act and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act provide models for such a process. As my esteemed \ncolleague from Hawaii pointed out, WESPAC has gone through an elaborate \npublic process in developing the Coral Reef Ecosystem Fishery \nManagement Plan which identified several potential closed areas. Does \nthe Senator believe the development of this plan provided sufficient \npublic review to support immediate closures under the Magnuson-Stevens \nAct or other marine conservation status implemented by the Secretary?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes I do, and I would support such closures, as well as \ntaking aggressive action to address the terrible problem of marine \ndebris in the NWHI, which is harming both the corals and our endangered \nmonk seals. Furthermore, I believe it may be appropriate to identify \nfurther precautionary actions that our scientists tell us may be \nnecessary to prevent future harm to these resources. However, no action \nshould be taken on these proposals until they can be evaluated publicly \nby the people of Hawaii.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I believe that is a sound plan and I look forward to \nworking with you as we ensure that the NWHI and other important marine \nareas are accorded strong and lasting protections developed through the \nconsensus process. Thank you.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank Senators Snowe and Hollings.\n\n[[Page S10639]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Carbon Cycle and \n     Agricultural Best Practices Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) agricultural producers in the United States--\n       (A) have, in good faith, participated in mandatory and \n     voluntary conservation programs, the successes of which are \n     unseen by the general public, to preserve natural resources; \n     and\n       (B) have a personal stake in ensuring that the air, water, \n     and soil of the United States are productive since \n     agricultural productivity directly affects--\n       (i) the economic success of agricultural producers; and\n       (ii) the production of food and fiber for developing and \n     developed nations;\n       (2) in addition to providing food and fiber, agriculture \n     serves an environmental role by providing benefits to air, \n     soil, and water through agricultural best practices;\n       (3) agricultural best practices include the more efficient \n     use of agriculture inputs and equipment;\n       (4)(A) agricultural best practices accentuate the carbon \n     cycle by increasing the conversion of carbon dioxide from the \n     air into plants that produce grain and forage;\n       (B) at the end of the growing season, plant material \n     decomposes, adding carbon to soil;\n       (C) carbon can persist in soil for hundreds and even \n     thousands of years; and\n       (D) through conservation practices, the additional carbon \n     in soil results in multiple environmental benefits, erosion \n     reduction, moisture retention, water quality improvements, \n     and increased crop yields;\n       (5) according to the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics \n     Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, North American soils, crops, rangelands, and \n     forests absorbed an equivalent quantity of carbon dioxide \n     emitted from fossil fuel combustion as part of the natural \n     carbon cycle from 1988 through 1992;\n       (6) the estimated quantity of carbon stored in world soils \n     is more than twice the carbon in living vegetation or in the \n     atmosphere;\n       (7) agricultural best practices can increase the quantity \n     of carbon stored in farm soils, crops, and rangeland;\n       (8) by increasing use of voluntary agricultural best \n     practices, it is possible to offset carbon dioxide emissions, \n     thereby benefiting the environment, without implementing a \n     United Nations-sponsored climate change protocol or treaty;\n       (9) Federal research is needed to identify--\n       (A) the agricultural best practices that supplement the \n     natural carbon cycle; and\n       (B) Federal conservation programs that can be altered to \n     increase the environmental benefits provided by the natural \n     carbon cycle; and\n       (10) increasing soil organic carbon is widely recognized as \n     a means of increasing agricultural production and meeting the \n     growing domestic and international food consumption needs \n     with a positive environmental benefit.\n\n     SEC. 3. AGRICULTURAL BEST PRACTICES.\n\n       Title XIV of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, \n     and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n       ``Subtitle N--Carbon Cycle and Agricultural Best Practices\n\n     ``SEC. 1490.
