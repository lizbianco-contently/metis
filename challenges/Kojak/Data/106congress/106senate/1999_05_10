Mr. President, last Thursday, I introduced the Biomass \nEnergy Equity Act of 1999. I was pleased to be joined by Senator Boxer, \nmy colleague from California, as an original cosponsor. This \nlegislation makes a common-sense change to the renewable energy \nproduction tax credit by expanding it to include additional types of \nbiomass plants. I would like to take a few minutes now to discuss the \nneed for this important bill and to describe what it would do.\n  Simply put, biomass energy production uses combustion to turn wood \nand organic waste into energy in an environmentally sound process. \nBiomass takes a public liability, organic waste, and converts it into a \npublic asset, energy.\n  The renewable energy production tax credit enacted in 1992 provides \nincentives to the solid-fuel biomass and wind energy industry to \ndevelop economically viable and environmentally responsible renewable \nsources of electricity. In enacting that legislation, Congress \nrecognized that biomass energy offers substantial environmental \nbenefits, specifically a reduced dependence on oil and coal, a \ndesirable alternative to open field burnings and the landfilling of \norganic material, and a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Unfortunately, an error was made that nullified the potential \nsocietal benefits that incentives for biomass energy production offers. \nThe 1992 act narrowly defined an eligible biomass facility as including \nonly so-called closed-loop biomass facilities. Closed-loop biomass is a \nhypothetical form of electricity generation where the fuel is planted, \ngrown, and harvested specifically and solely for the fuel of the power \nplant. Not only does this definition rule out the significant \nenvironmental benefit of disposal of organic waste otherwise destined \nfor a landfill or to be field-burned, but also this scenario is not \nfeasible and therefore remains unused. Since the biomass tax credit was \npassed, no taxpayer, not one, has taken advantage of the tax benefit. \nSimply put, the closed-loop tax credit is not a sufficient incentive to \ndevelop a costly ``fuel plantation,'' which entails large-scale land \npurchases, property taxes, and growing material for the sole purpose of \nburning it. By demanding that newly grown material be used rather than \norganic waste, the closed-loop biomass definition flies in the face of \nthe commonly accepted environmental principle that products should be \nput to as many ``highest value'' uses as possible.\n  Mr. President, several states, including Maine, are deregulating \ntheir energy industries. Starting March 1, 2000, electricity consumers \nin Maine will be\n\n[[Page S4938]]\n\nable to shop for electricity as they now shop for long-distance \ntelephone service.\n  While the specifics remain very much up in the air, the country is \nprogressing toward restructuring electricity generation and \ndistribution. While there are many clear economic benefits to a \nderegulated energy market, without incentives like the one I am \nproposing, green, renewable energy production like biomass is unlikely \nto be able to survive in deregulated market.\n  The legislation that I have introduced would expand the eligibility \nof the biomass tax credit to include conventional biomass plants. This \nlegislation is designed to encourage a source of energy generation that \noffers substantial air quality, waste management, and greenhouse gas \nreduction benefits. The national biomass industry currently uses over \n22,000,000 tons of wood waste a year. The waste the biomass industry \nconverts into energy otherwise would be disposed of in one of three \nways: burned in an open field, which generates pollution not energy; \nlandfilled, where it fills limited landfill space and biodegrades, \nemitting methane, carbon dioxide, and other gases, or left in the woods \nor fields, increasing the risk and severity of forest fires.\n  The air quality benefits of biomass energy are of particular \nimportance. According to the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use \nManagement, an organization of all the Northeastern States Air Quality \nBureaus, biomass energy produces less nitrogen oxide than biomass \nalternatives, and furthermore, it generates virtually no sulfur \ndioxide, particulate matter, or mercury. Biomass energy production also \nresults in a net reduction of greenhouse gases, as I have previously \nstated.\n  In addition to their environmental benefits, biomass plants \ncontribute to the economy of many rural towns throughout America. \nBecause of their dependence on organic waste, biomass facilities are \nusually located in rural areas where they are often important engines \nof economic growth. For example, in the small town of Sherman, ME, a \nbiomass facility provides 56 percent of the property tax base. It also \ndirectly employs 23 individuals and indirectly provides work for \nhundreds of truck drivers, wood operators, mill workers and maintenance \ncontractors.\n  In another small town of Maine, Athens, ME, a biomass facility \nprovides a third of that small town's tax base and directly employs 20 \npeople, while supporting a local wood operator who, in turn, employs 40 \npeople.\n  The point is, the economy in many of the small towns in Maine, in \ntowns such as Livermore, Ashland, Greenville, Fort Fairfield, Stratton \nand West Enfield benefit considerably from these biomass facilities. In \ntotal, there are over 100 biomass facilities in the United States, \nrepresenting an investment in excess of $7 billion. These facilities \ncontribute jobs, property taxes and a disposal point for waste \nproducts. In addition, rural biomass facilities also provide ash for \nuse by local farmers, reducing their purchases of lime. I understand \nthere is regularly more demand for the ash produced by these biomass \nplants than there is supply.\n  With biomass energy production, nothing is wasted. Biomass turns \nwaste products--the byproducts of timber, paper or farming operations--\ninto needed energy, wasting nothing. Even the ash is returned to the \nEarth to grow organic matter yielding both crops and waste to generate \nstill more electricity.\n  We in Congress often discuss ways to help rural America. I know that \nis of great concern to the Presiding Officer. This proposal offers an \nopportunity to do so in a way that not only benefits the economy of \nsmall towns in rural America but also in a way that generates \nconsiderable environmental benefits that we all can enjoy.\n  This measure makes both economic and environmental sense. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation and \nworking for its passage.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4938-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I turn for a few minutes this morning to an \nissue that many Senators may not have heard much about but one that has \ngreat implications for the consumer, for intellectual freedom and the \nquality of life in our communities across the country.\n  The issue I intend to focus on specifically is the proposed \nacquisition by Barnes & Noble of the Ingram book company. The price tag \non this acquisition is $600 million, and it involves the Nation's \nlargest bookstore chain, Barnes & Noble, joining forces with the Ingram \nbook company, the world's largest book distributor.\n  I am concerned that this deal will give Barnes & Noble a competitive \nstranglehold on the bookselling business in America. That is why last \nNovember I asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate this \nproposed acquisition. Based on information I have learned in the last \nfew days, I believe the Federal Trade Commission will soon make a \ndecision on this proposed acquisition. I am very hopeful that when the \nFederal Trade Commission comes down with that decision, they will come \ndown foursquare for the consumer.\n  Right now across this country, thousands and thousands of Americans \nhave stopped at small bookstores to sign petitions urging that this \nproposed acquisition be blocked. In fact, there is a special phone line \nat the Federal Trade Commission because there has been such a tidal \nwave of interest on this specific proposal. I will briefly outline this \nmorning what I find troubling about this proposed deal.\n  For a small bookstore, if this acquisition goes forward, they will \nhave to depend on a megastore for the products they sell. The new \nbookstore colossus, with Barnes & Noble coming together with Ingram, \nwill essentially have a huge competitive advantage that could work to \ncause great hardship for small bookstores in our country. Because the \nIngram Company has information about sales and volume and ordering \nhabits of small bookstores, is the new megastore going to use that \ninformation in a fair way? I am very concerned about it, but I can tell \nyou that small bookstores across this country are very troubled when it \ncomes to getting fair access to the titles they need, when it comes to \nhow that information which Ingram has, that will be part of the new \noperation with Barnes & Noble, is used. I can tell you that small \nbookstores across this country believe this issue is literally one of \nlife and death for them.\n\n  Second, I am concerned about issues relating to intellectual freedom. \nMy concern is that with this deal and the potential that there will be \njust a handful of big bookstores in our country dominating the Nation, \nwhat they will stock are largely the best sellers.\n  I have had some experience with this. My father, who passed away, was \nan author and had a small publishing company. He said there is always \nroom at the big stores in titles involving sex and drugs and rock and \nroll.\n  But I am concerned about what is going to happen when we have just a \nhandful of these megastores, whether we are going to see intellectual \nfreedom prosper and those titles that are not always on the best seller \nlist accessible the way they are today.\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\n  Third, I am concerned about the vitality of our communities. These \nsmall bookstores in so many of our communities do more than just sell \nbooks. Yes, they sell publications and they make it possible for young \npeople in rural America and inner cities and others to have a \ncomfortable place to learn, but they are also a huge addition to Main \nStreet in so many parts of rural Oregon and, I am sure, in Kansas where \nthe Presiding Officer resides. Having been born in Wichita, we have \ntalked before about life in rural America.\n  I do not want to see those small bookstores becoming part of the Main \nStreet of yesteryear in rural America. I am very concerned that if this \nproposed merger goes forward, as it is currently structured, it really \nwill put a hardship on a lot of main streets in rural communities and \nwill diminish the vitality of many of those towns.\n\n  I admit to growing up a bit skeptical of some of these large \nmegastores. As I said, my dad was an author, and I spent a lot of \nSunday afternoons going through some of those megastores with my dad \ntrying to persuade them to put one of his titles that did not fit their \nview of what was popular up close, up close to where the consumers were \nwhen they stopped to browse in the window. My father was concerned \nabout the concentration of economic power in the bookselling business.\n  I tell you, I think this deal, if it goes forward as structured, will \nconfirm a lot of the worries that my dad and others like him have had \nabout our country and where the bookselling business is going.\n  Finally, I think we all understand that the bookselling business has \nchanged certainly on the Internet. The Presiding Officer has worked \nwith me on legislation which has been important to me such as the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act.\n  The Internet has changed the bookselling business. There is no \nquestion about the fact that with Amazon.com and others in the business \nof selling books on line, the business has changed very dramatically. \nBut I do not buy the idea that Barnes & Noble had to merge with Ingram \nin order to take on Amazon. I do not buy that idea at all.\n  I think there is a role in our country for a variety of ways for \nconsumers to order publications. I think there is an important place \nfor the small bookstore, especially because of the contributions they \nmake to main streets in rural communities and inner cities. I certainly \ndo not want to hold back on-line shopping. That is why I was a \nprincipal sponsor in the Senate of the Internet Tax Freedom Act. So I \ndo not take a back seat to anybody in terms of trying to ensure that we \ntake advantage of all the technological innovations that are available \nfor the consumer.\n  What concerns me about this proposal is that a lot of small \nbookstores are not going to be able to survive. A lot of small \nbookstores are going to find it difficult to survive if Barnes & Noble \nhas proprietary information about them, about their volume, about their \nsales practices, about the way they do business, and if that \ninformation is used against small bookstores.\n  So I believe the Federal Trade Commission has in front of it an issue \nof extreme importance, one which will dramatically affect intellectual \nfreedom, one which has great implications for antitrust policy and the \nconsumer, one which will be vital to the well-being of communities and \nmain streets across this country. I believe the Federal Trade \nCommission is going to rule soon on this proposed acquisition. I \nbelieve they are going to act in the interest of the consumer. I \nappreciate the opportunity to bring the Senate up to date on this \nimportant economic matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4939-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4939-S4940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FAMILY FARMERS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor briefly today to talk \nabout two issues. First, tomorrow the appropriations conference begins \nbetween the House and the Senate on the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill. That includes specifically the President's request \nfor emergency appropriations to be made for some agricultural spring \nplanting loans, some emergency appropriations to be made for the \npurpose of helping the victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America, \nand then since that time the President has made new recommendations on \nemergency funding for the Defense Department needs as a result of the \nactions in Kosovo.\n  The House of Representatives took a request by President Clinton for \nnearly $6 billion in added funds for the military especially, but \nincluding some humanitarian relief for the actions in Kosovo, and added \nto that $6 billion of emergency funding nearly $7 billion more, to \nreach a total of close to $13 billion in emergency funding.\n  A number of us believe that, while we are on the subject of \nemergencies and in a supplemental appropriations conference, it would \nbe inappropriate to add $7 billion to the defense budget for emergency \nneeds relating to Kosovo--although some of it has very little \nrelationship to Kosovo, it has a relationship to what is called \n``readiness'' in defense accounts and other things--that it would be \ninappropriate to consider that without considering other emergency \nneeds here at home on the domestic front. One of those is agriculture.\n  The plight of the family farmer in this country has been pretty well \ndescribed by myself and others on the floor of the Senate in recent \nmonths. The Congress did some emergency work last fall to provide some \nincome support to family farmers above and beyond the current farm \nbill. But it is not nearly enough.\n  We now come to May of 1999, at a time in which prices for many \ncommodities in agriculture, in constant dollars, are at Depression \nlevel, and we are going to lose thousands, tens of thousands, perhaps \nhundreds of thousands, of family farmers if we decide to do nothing. \nTomorrow's conference between the House and Senate may be the only \nopportunity that exists this year to provide support for emergency \nfunding, to add some income price support to family farmers, which they \ndesperately need.\n  This chart shows what is happening in rural America. This map shows \ncounties marked in red which are being depopulated in our country. \nThese are counties that have lost at least 10 percent of their \npopulation in the last 18 years. You can see on this map the large red \narea that shows the middle of this country--the farm belt--is being \ndepopulated, people are leaving.\n  Why are people leaving the farm belt in droves, and especially now in \nmore recent years? Why are people leaving their family farms, leaving \nthe farm belt, and leaving rural counties? The answer is, family \nfarmers cannot make a living when they produce grain and then have to \nsell it at a price far below their cost of production. It does not work \nthat way. You go broke. Bad trade agreements, concentration in \nagricultural industries--there are a whole series of reasons--but the \ncentral reason, it seems to me, is low prices. If you do not get a \ndecent price for that which you produce, you are not going to be able \nto make a decent living.\n  The question for this country is, What kind of price supports are \navailable to farmers when market prices collapse? Every one of us in \nthis Chamber would prefer that farmers received their prices from the \nmarketplace. But when the marketplace collapses, farmers load a couple \nhundred bushels of wheat on their trucks, drive to the elevators, are \ntold that wheat has no value, or has very little value, then the \nquestion for Congress is, Do we want family farmers in our future? And, \nif we do, What kind of income support are we willing to offer to create \na bridge over that price valley when prices collapse?\n  The largest enterprises, the big agrifactories, will make it across \nthat valley. They are big enough, strong enough, have the financial \nresources to make it across that price valley. It is the family farmer \nwho will not make it. So the question for the Congress is, Do we care \nabout family farming? And, if we do, what can we do to provide some \nincome support when prices collapse?\n  A number of us will offer, during this deliberation in the conference \nbetween the House and the Senate on emergency needs, a proposal to \nrestore some emergency funding to family farmers. There are lots of \nways of doing that. I have my own feeling about how to do\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\nit. Senator Harkin and I, along with Senator Conrad and others--Senator \nHarkin and I, incidentally, will be in the conference tomorrow, are \nprepared to offer some proposals to deal with emergency needs, it is \nnot just the Defense Department that has emergency needs, family \nfarming is in a full-scale emergency in this country.\n  This Congress must take steps to save it. Tomorrow, again, Senator \nHarkin, myself and some others in the conference on appropriations, of \nwhich Senator Harkin and I are conferees, intend to raise this question \nin a very forceful way and push very aggressively for action on an \nemergency basis with our colleagues.\n  Republican and Democrat colleagues here in this Chamber understand \nthat we face a very serious problem. All of my colleagues who come from \nthe farm belt have said the same thing. Family farmers are in trouble. \nThere is no disagreement about that. There might be some disagreement \nabout the mechanism by which we address this question, but I think \neveryone here, with whom I share the long-term interests of the welfare \nof family farming, believes that we need, during periods of collapsed \nprices, to provide some income price support. The question is how do we \ndo that. My hope is the first step will be tomorrow during the \nconference that we have with the House of Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4940-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4940-S4942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

It doesn't matter, as far as I am concerned, whether it's \npossible to apprehended and arrest him. We have a responsibility in \nthis case, just as I felt we did in the case of Saddam Hussein, to make \nthe case against these leaders for the war crimes they have committed \nand to bring them to trial before an international tribunal, try them, \nand, hopefully, convict them as war criminals. To not do that, it seems \nto me, will be to continue to have to deal with people who have \ncommitted genocide and war crimes that have brought unspeakable horror \nto the people of Kosovo, and to continue to have to deal with them in \nthe future.\n  I know some in this country and elsewhere say the problem is, if you \npush aggressively to try Mr. Milosevic as a war criminal and ultimately \nhave to negotiate with him some sort of negotiated settlement in the \nBalkans, it is very hard to negotiate with someone you have identified \nas a war criminal. That is a lot of psychobabble, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  We have already decided this fellow is a war criminal by virtue of \nour actions in NATO. NATO decided that the genocide and ethnic \ncleansing that were occurring in Kosovo could not be allowed to stand.\n  I think it might be useful to read through a list of some of the \nallegations. By no means is this a definitive list, it is just a small \nsliver: the village of Goden, the execution of 20 men and then the \nburning of the entire village; Malakrusa, 112 men shot and their bodies \nburned; Pastasel, 70 ethnic Albanian bodies discovered; Pec, at least \n50 ethnic Albanians killed and buried in their own yards; Podujevo, the \nexecution of 200 military age men and 90 percent of the village burned \nas well; summary execution; robbery; rape; forced expulsion.\n  We now have seen the march of nearly 1 million people displaced from \ntheir homeland, villages burned, looted, and plundered. One refugee \nsaid, ``16 special policemen appeared shooting their automatic weapons \nin the air. Two families had strayed from the group and the Serbs \nopened fire, killing every member of both families, except for a 2-\nyear-old boy who had been protected by his mother. She hid the baby in \nfront of her and saved him. I saw this with my own eyes,'' this refugee \nsaid, ``maybe 150 feet from me.''\n\n  In 1992, Secretary of State Eagleburger publicly identified Mr. \nMilosevic as a war criminal; 1992, 7 years ago. Mr. Eagleburger is one \nof the most respected foreign policy thinkers in our country. He said \nMr. Milosevic was a war criminal in 1992. What does that mean, to say \nsomeone is a war criminal or for our country to allege someone is a war \ncriminal, if we decide to do nothing about it, if an international \ntribunal exists by which someone can and should be tried but we decide, \nno, we don't really want to do that in the face of mass executions, in \nthe face of ethnic cleansing? We say we really don't want to do that \nbecause we may need to negotiate a settlement to this conflict.\n  It was a mistake not to go to an international tribunal and convict \nSaddam Hussein as a war criminal so that forever after he would be \nbranded a war criminal. He is now, many years later, of course, still \nrunning Iraq. He does not have the stigma of having been convicted in \nabsentia as a war criminal. He should have. The same, in my judgment, \nis true of Mr. Milosevic.\n  To read a paragraph from Mr. Ellis's wonderful piece in the \nWashington Post, he said:\n\n       When I watched the bus loads of new arrivals enter \n     Stenkovec camp, I saw a small girl's face pressed against the \n     window. Her hollow eyes seemed to stare at no one. History \n     was being repeated. In his opening statement at the Nuremberg \n     trials in 1945, U.S. chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson said, \n     ``The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so \n     calculated, so malignant, and so devastating that \n     civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored because it \n     cannot survive their being repeated.'' Jackson was expressing \n     the hope that law would somehow redeem the next generation \n     that similar atrocities would never again be allowed. Today, \n     we must hold personally liable those individuals who commit \n     atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. To negotiate with the \n     perpetrators of these crimes not only demeans the suffering \n     of countless civilian victims, it sends a clear signal that \n     justice is expendable, that war crimes can go unpunished. \n     Inevitably, lasting peace will be linked to justice, and \n     justice will depend on accountability. Failing to indict \n     Milosevic in the hope that he can deliver a negotiated \n     settlement makes a mockery of the words ``Never Again.''\n\n  I am not an expert in this region. I have been to Yugoslavia, when it \nwas Yugoslavia. I sat at an outdoor restaurant on a beautiful evening \nand watched wonderful people, just like my neighbors in Regent, ND, \njust like North Dakotans or Kansans or other folks, and it occurred to \nme that it was a wonderful country with a lot of wonderful people. Of \ncourse, we now know that what has happened as a spark occurs in an \narea, and Mr. Milosevic follows up the spark with ethnic cleansing, \nproducing a calamity. We see the horrors inflicted on people, in some \ncases by their previous neighbors, that you would have thought \nunthinkable. Something is dreadfully wrong when the rest of the world \nallows a dictator like Mr. Milosevic to inflict ethnic cleansing and \nthe kind of horror he has inflicted on the people of Kosovo.\n  That is why NATO and the United States have engaged in airstrikes. It \nis why all of us hope this conflict ends soon and that Kosovars are \nreturned to their homes. Also, Mr. Milosevic, at least from my \nstandpoint, should be brought before an international tribunal and \ntried even in absentia, if necessary, as a war criminal and convicted \nas a war criminal to send a signal to the world that this new world \norder will not allow this to go unpunished.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 9, 1999]\n\n   Non-Negotiable, War Criminals Belong in the Dock, Not at the Table\n\n                           (By Mark S. Ellis)\n\n       Just a few weeks ago, I stood among a sea of 20,000 \n     desperate people on a dirt airfield outside Skopje, \n     Macedonia, listening to one harrowing story after another. I \n     had come to the Stenkovec refugee camp to record those \n     stories and to help set up a system for documenting \n     atrocities in Kosovo.\n       As I collected their accounts of rape, torture and \n     executions at the hands of Serbian troops, I was struck by \n     the refugees' common yearning for justice. They wanted those\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\n     responsible for their suffering to be held accountable. Their \n     anger was not only directed at the people they had watched \n     committing such savagery, but at the Political leaders--and \n     Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in particular--who had \n     orchestrated the misery and continue to act with impunity.\n       The means exist to hold Milosevic and his underlings \n     accountable. In recent weeks, there have been calls from \n     members of Congress for his indictment by the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and \n     Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering has said that the \n     United States is gathering evidence that could lead to his \n     indictment. And there is plenty of evidence. In the Kosovo \n     town of Djakovica, for example, residents carefully \n     documented the Serbian barbarity for investigators, recording \n     the details of each murder, each rape, each act of violence, \n     before they fled the city. The time has come to act on the \n     testimony of these and other witnesses.\n       To do so, of course, flies in the face of last week's much-\n     ballyhooed optimism about reaching a negotiated settlement \n     with Milosevic. However eager the Clinton administration \n     might be to reach a political and diplomatic solution, we \n     should remember that those who have recently suffered under \n     Serbian attacks reject outright the notion that justice must \n     sometimes be forfeited for the sake of diplomatic expediency. \n     During the Bosnian conflict, accountability was sacrificed on \n     the dubious premise that negotiating with someone who is \n     widely regarded as a war criminal is a legitimate exercise in \n     peace-making. We shouldn't make that mistake a second time \n     around. Milosevic's broken promises still echo among the \n     charred ruins and forsaken mass grave sites that defile the \n     landscape of Bonsia.\n       If Milosevic had been indicted for the mass killings and \n     summary executions that the Bosnian Serbs--with backing from \n     Serbia--are accused of carrying out, would he have acted so \n     brazenly to ``cleanse'' Kosovo of its ethnic Albanians? \n     Nobody knows. At the very least an  indictment would probably \n     have deterred him; an apprehension and a trial would have \n     stopped him. But there should be no uncertainty about what \n     occurs when Milosevic is allowed to act unencumbered. The \n     time has come for the international war crimes tribunal to \n     help put an end to that.\n       Inaugurated by the United Nations on May 25, 1993, and \n     based in The Hague, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has, to \n     date, tried just 16 defendants. With a staff of more than 750 \n     and an annual budget of more than $94 million, it has the \n     resources--and the authority--to indict Milosevic. Indeed, \n     failure to indict would reveal the tribunal's impotence in \n     the face of political controversy, and prove that this \n     institution of international law and justice is merely an \n     expensive and irrelevant relic.\n       How difficult would it be to indict Milosevic? Not \n     difficult at all. Under the tribunal's statute, the office of \n     the prosecutor need only determine ``that a prima facie case \n     exists.'' That's to say that the prosecutor must gather \n     evidence sufficient to prove reasonable grounds that \n     Milosevic committed a single crime under the tribunal's \n     extensive jurisdiction.\n       With this in mind, the chances of Milosevic being held \n     accountable increase with the arrival of each new group of \n     refugees driven from their homes in Kosovo. Their remarkably \n     consistent testimony is providing crucial information--now \n     being gathered by representatives of the tribunal as well as \n     by human rights organizations--about what has actually taken \n     place in Kosovo. These firsthand accounts are indispensable \n     in building a case against Milosevic--and the refugees I \n     interviewed during the days I was there are willing to \n     testify about what they saw.\n       But with refugees flooding out of Kosovo and some being \n     relocated in distant countries, the prosecutor's office must \n     ensure that testimony is taken swiftly, legally and \n     professionally. The lack of access to Kosovo by independent \n     journalists and human rights monitors and the extreme \n     instability of refugee life heighten the importance of \n     collecting these accounts while they are still fresh in \n     people's minds. Yet the prosecutor's office was slow to act. \n     A full five weeks went by before the tribunal sent a corps of \n     investigators to the region.\n       What crimes should the Yugloslav president be indicted for? \n     The tribunal's statute provides jurisdiction over ``serious \n     violations of international humanitarian law'' including both \n     ``crimes against humanity'' and ``genocide,'' the most \n     abhorrent of all. Milosevic should be indicted for both.\n       Crimes against humanity are defined as ``systematic and \n     widespread'' and directed at any civilian population; they \n     include murder, extermination, imprisonment, rape and \n     deportation. They are distinguished from other acts of \n     communal violence because civilians are victimized according \n     to a systematic plan that usually emanates from the highest \n     levels of government.\n       In Kosovo, the forced deportation of ethnic Albanians by \n     the Yugoslav army and the Serbian Interior Ministry police \n     force is an obvious manifestation of such crimes. The \n     refugees with whom I spoke described being robbed, beaten, \n     herded together and forced to flee their villages with \n     nothing but the clothes they were wearing. By confiscating \n     all evidence of the ethnic Albanians' identity--passports, \n     birth certificates, employment records, driver's licenses, \n     marriage licenses--the Serbian forces also severed the \n     refugees' links with their communities and land in Kosovo. \n     This attempt to make each ethnic Albanian a non-person is \n     itself a crime against humanity. Emerging evidence of mass \n     killings, summary executions and gang rape lends further \n     credence to the widespread and systematic nature of these \n     crimes.\n       As to the crime of genocide, the tribunal's statute rests \n     on the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \n     Genocide, which defines genocide as ``acts committed with \n     intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, \n     racial or religious group.'' Arising as it did from the \n     extermination of the Jews in Nazi Germany, the convention \n     invites comparison with the Holocaust and is intended to \n     prevent such heinous crimes from happening again. This \n     tragedy has not reached that perverse level of brutality but, \n     like the earlier efforts to eliminate an entire people--\n     whether the Jews, the Armenians or the Tutsis--it should be \n     prosecuted as a crime of genocide.\n       The convention addresses intent, and stipulates that acts \n     designed to eliminate a people--in whole or in part--\n     constitute genocide. Among other acts covered by the \n     convention, crimes of genocide include ``(a) killing members \n     of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to \n     members of the group; (c) deliberately inflicting on the \n     group conditions of life calculated to bring about its \n     physical destruction in whole or in part.''\n       In the former Yugoslavia, acts of genocide have been \n     perpetrated through the abhorrent policy of ethnic \n     cleansing--that is, making areas ethnically homogenous by \n     expelling entire segments of the Kosovar population and \n     destroying the very fabric of a people.\n       Ethnic cleansing does not require the elimination of all \n     ethnic Albanians; it may target specific elements of the \n     community that make the group--as a group--sustainable. The \n     abduction and execution of the intelligentsia, including \n     public officials, lawyers, doctors and political leaders, for \n     example, is part of a pattern of ethnic cleansing and could \n     constitute genocide, as could targeting a particular segment \n     of the population such as young men. It is clear from the \n     refugees who have been interviewed that these acts are being \n     systematically committed in Kosovo.\n       An often overlooked but important element of the 1948 \n     convention is that an individual can be indicted not only for \n     committing genocide, but also for conspiring to commit \n     genocide, inciting the public to commit genocide, attempting \n     to commit genocide, or for complicity in genocide. The point \n     is that criminal responsibility extends far beyond those who \n     actually perform the physical acts resulting in genocide. In \n     short, the political architects such as Milosevic are no less \n     responsible than the forces that carry out this butchery. \n     There is no immunity from genocide.\n       Prosecuting Milosevic will require relying on a legal \n     strategy based on the concept of ``imputed command \n     responsibility.'' Under this theory, Milosevic can be held \n     responsible for crimes committed by his subordinates if he \n     knew or had reason to know that crimes were about to be \n     committed and he failed to take preventive measures or to \n     punish those who had already committed crimes.\n       Since it is unlikely that Milosevic has allowed documentary \n     evidence to be preserved that would link him to atrocities in \n     Kosovo, the prosecutor's office will have to rely heavily on \n     circumstantial evidence to build its case. This means \n     identifying a consistent ``pattern of conduct'' that links \n     Milosevic to similar illegal acts, to the officers and staff \n     involved, or to the logistics involved in carrying out \n     atrocities. The very fact that atrocities have been so \n     widespread, flagrant, grotesque and similar in nature makes \n     it near certain that Milosevic knew of them; despite his \n     recent protestations to the contrary, it defies logic to \n     suggest that he could be unaware of what his forces are \n     doing.\n       What will the consequences be if the Yugoslav president is \n     indicted? First, an indictment would send a clear message \n     that the international community will not negotiate or have \n     contact with a war criminal. It is current U.S. policy not to \n     negotiate with indicted war crimes suspects. And so it should \n     be. Milosevic would be stripped of international stature \n     except as a fugitive from justice. This might, in turn, open \n     an avenue for Serbians to once again distance themselves from \n     their leader's regime. Second, an indictment would likely \n     result in an ex parte hearing in which the prosecutor's \n     office could present its case in open court--without \n     Milosevic being there. By establishing a public record of \n     Milosevic's role in the crimes committed, such a hearing \n     would be cathartic for both victims and witnesses, and also \n     for citizens long denied access to the truth. Finally, the \n     tribunal would issue an international arrest warrant making \n     it unlikely that Milosevic would venture outside his \n     country's borders.\n       When I watched the bus loads of new arrivals enter the \n     Stenkovec camp, I saw a small girl's face pressed against the \n     window. Her hollow eyes seemed to stare at no one. History \n     was being repeated. In his opening statement at the Nuremberg \n     trials in 1945, U.S. chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson said, \n     ``The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so \n     calculated, so malignant, and so devastating that \n     civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it \n     cannot survive their being repeated.'' Jackson was expressing \n     the hope that law would somehow redeem the next generation \n     and that similar atrocities would never\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\n     again be allowed. Today, we must hold personally liable those \n     individuals who commit atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. \n     To negotiate with the perpetrators of these crimes not only \n     demeans the suffering of countless civilian victims, it sends \n     a clear message that justice is expendable, that war crimes \n     can go unpunished. Inevitably, lasting peace will be linked \n     to justice, and justice will depend on accountability. \n     Failing to indict Milosevic in the hope that he can deliver a \n     negotiated settlement makes a mockery of the words ``Never \n     Again.''\n\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to come in this morning when we \nhad a break in regular business to talk about something that is very \nimportant to me and to Wyoming. As a matter of fact, it is also \nimportant in States such as Kansas. I am speaking about promoting \nhealth in rural areas.\n  I am joining with several colleagues in introducing a bill promoting \nhealth in rural areas, a bill designed to increase access to quality \nhealth care services in rural areas. Rural health care has been a \npriority of mine since I have been in the House and Senate. As cochair \nof the Rural Health Care Caucus, I am pleased that health care in rural \nareas is an issue that we can address in a bipartisan way.\n  So I am very pleased to work with colleagues, including the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Roberts; Senator Grassley; Senator Harkin; Senator \nBaucus; Senator Daschle; Senator Conrad, and Senator Collins, to craft \nthis bill. It is always a pleasure to work with people who have similar \nissues, and certainly we do in rural areas.\n  This bill provides some incentives, regulatory relief and Medicare \npayment equity, needed to ensure rural families have access to quality \nhealth care, the kind of health care that they deserve. Those of us who \ncome from low-population areas have unique problems. We talk about \neducation, we talk about schools, and we talk about the delivery of \nhealth care. Quite frankly, it is different in Greybull, WY, than it is \nin Philadelphia. So when we have national programs such as Medicare, it \nis important that we recognize some of the problems that exist in rural \nareas are unique and, indeed, need to be dealt with differently--\nproblems such as the lack of physicians and health care providers in \nrural areas, and the idea that Medicare reimbursement has actually been \nunfair and unequal and not uniform throughout the country.\n\n  I recall last year when we were talking about Medicare payments to \nHMOs, the payments that were available in some places in the east were \n$700 a month. In the Midwest, it was $250 a month under the same kind \nof program. So there is some unfairness there. Certainly, we have \nexperienced limited access to mental health. I think this is \nparticularly true for young people. In rural areas, you simply don't \nhave the kinds of rural health care access that is necessary and should \nbe provided.\n  One of the techniques that will be used increasingly, I am sure, in \nrural health care is telemedicine, where you can go from a family \npractitioner to a specialty on telemedicine and get at least many of \nthe same quality kinds of health care advantages.\n  Many of these problems were explored last summer when we held a forum \nin Casper, WY. We brought in people interested in health care, not only \nproviders and patients but others. Many ideas were talked about there, \nsuch as how we can strengthen health care in Wyoming. We came up with a \nconsensus in a number of these areas, and this bill contains many of \nthose recommendations. I am pleased about that.\n  Here are some of the solutions. One of the things we discovered in \nour health care seminar is that in big cities you have all the \ndifferent kinds of specialists and different techniques for health \ncare, but you don't have them in small towns. So it is necessary, then, \nto have a network so you can tie it in. Small towns aren't often able \nto have a fully qualified hospital that will receive payments for \nMedicare from HCFA. So we had to arrange to have what we call ``acute \ncare hospitals'' that can provide a lesser but equally important \nservice, so that people could have emergency care, for example, and \nthen be transported to another place, or the full service hospital. So \nyou need a network there.\n  We need assistance in recruiting physicians, as you can imagine. It \nis difficult sometimes to bring in doctors--particularly specialists--\nto low-population areas. So these are some of the problems that we \ntalked about.\n  This bill ensures rural health care representation on the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission. There is an advisory commission that has \noversight responsibilities, and there is no assurance that there would \nbe anyone there with a background and experience in a rural area. These \nare the things we have done. Specifically, it increases the \nreimbursement rates for hospitals and clinics.\n  Medicare reimbursement rates have been unfair and inadequate. Health \ncare costs have been undervalued. You should receive the same kind of \nvalue care there as somewhere else. The cost of living is somewhat \nless, perhaps, but not to the extent that the payments have been made \ndifferent.\n  We think one of the results of that, of course, is the difficulty to \nget providers to come there. Their reimbursement is less than it is in \nFlorida or other places for doing the same thing. So we revised the \nrates.\n  The bill increases payments to sole community hospitals and, of \ncourse, that is what we have. My first recollection in talking about \nthis is when the Presiding Officer was in the House and we talked in \nKansas about having a special program for small town hospitals, and \nthat happened and has worked well. Recruiting and maintaining \nproviders, of course, is a problem. In Wyoming, we have 22 underserved \nareas. That means there is less than one primary care physician for \nevery 3,500 people living in those areas. It is also appropriate, of \ncourse, to advocate for other professionals, such as nurse \npractitioners and physician assistants. In many areas, those are the \ntypes of professionals that will be in small towns.\n\n  Telemedicine, of course, can be the salvation of rural America, and \nit is moving quickly.\n  This bill expands the number of telemedicine services reimbursed by \nMedicare, which will be very useful in establishing a well-coordinated \nnetwork of physicians, midlevel practitioners, hospitals and clinics. \nThis is especially important if you have a nurse practitioner or \nphysician assistant, for instance, in a small town and they need advice \nfrom a specialist. They can do that using telemedicine.\n  Mental health. As you can imagine, access to mental health care is \nquite limited in rural areas. So this bill expands and ensures coverage \nby Medicare for mental health types of things. I mentioned the MEDPAC. \nTwo years ago, Congress established the Medical Payment Advisory \nCommission, designed to make policy recommendations in part A and part \nB of Medicare. Unfortunately, on the current 15-member board, only one \nmember is from a rural area. This bill requires that at least two be on \nthe board to give adequate input.\n  In conclusion, I am very pleased with this bill to promote better \nhealth care in rural areas. It provides assistance to many rural \ncommunities that have trouble getting the quality health care that \npeople receive in bigger cities. This is designed to do that. It is \npossible that we can debate it this year. The Rural Health Care Caucus \nwill be working, and perhaps it will be part of a broader health care \neffort. This is a good start, and I am pleased to be a part of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4942-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4942-S4943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ACCIDENTAL BOMBING OF THE CHINESE EMBASSY IN BELGRADE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as chairman of the Subcommittee on the \nEast Asia and Pacific Affairs, I have been very much interested in the \nunfortunate bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade over the \nweekend.\n  Clearly, in my opinion, this was a tragic mistake. It has been \nsuggested by some that it was done on purpose. I don't believe that. I \nthink it was a mistake--one for which there is no excuse.\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\n It boggles the mind to think that someone could make such a mistake. \nIt is my hope that the matter will be thoroughly investigated and that \na proper explanation will be made.\n  It was a mistake for which both the President and the Secretary of \nState have apologized to People's Republic of China. I add my apology \nto theirs. There is no minimizing this unfortunate accident. But I also \nmust say to the Chinese that it would be a mistake to inflame the \nsituation, and to fail to adequately protect our embassies and our \nconsulates in China.\n  The Government there has apparently organized busloads of students to \ntravel to the Embassy in Beijing. By the way, I was there not long ago. \nThis is one of the least protected embassies in our system. It is very \nold, and it is not satisfactory from a safety standpoint.\n  While public security officials in Beijing apparently prevent their \ncitizens from storming the Embassy, they do nothing to prevent the \nthrowing of stones and Molotov cocktails, and people have damaged the \nEmbassy.\n  Our consulate in Chungdu was partially destroyed by fire. The \nGovernment has allowed citizens to effectively hold the Ambassador \nhostage in our Embassy for the past 3 days. The Chinese press has \nfailed to mention, purposefully I suspect, that we and NATO have \napologized for the bombing, nor has the media noted that the bombing \nwas accidental rather than premeditated.\n  We have had and continue to have a strategic relationship with the \nPeople's Republic of China. Certainly we have not agreed on many \nthings. Certainly we have been critical of many things. On the other \nhand, that relationship has grown over the last several years. China \nhas changed substantially. We have a great number of things going on \nbetween our countries. Almost everyone would agree that, assuming we \ncould get over the main obstacles, a relationship between that large \ncountry with 1.2 billion people and our country is something that is \njointly advantageous. We have an economic relationship. We are working \non and I think have been coming rather close to, an agreement on the \nWorld Trade Organization, which I favor. I think we would be much \nbetter off dealing with China within the WTO rather than having to do \nit unilaterally. If we are going to be in the world community, then \nthese are things which I think are particularly important.\n  I suspect that some Chinese are using this incident as a way of \nresponding to some of the criticisms of them and their practices that \nwe have had over time. We have had it on espionage; we have had it on \nhuman rights, and properly so, I suspect. But they are using this, in \nmy view, as a means of responding to some of the criticisms we have \nhad.\n  I think it would be a mistake if we let this unfortunate incident \ninterfere with the opportunity to have a stronger relationship. I think \nit would be a mistake if we let this be an opportunity for Milosevic to \nbegin to do something with his image and come out with a better deal \nthan he deserves. I hope that doesn't happen. We both have--a great \ndeal at risk.\n  Mr. President, I hope, despite all the problems, that we can solve \nthis. I think it would be wrong for either side to use this bombing and \nsubsequent reaction of Chinese citizens to poison the bilateral \nrelationship which we have an opportunity to develop in the future. As \nwe know, there is a great deal at stake in all of our relationships \nthroughout the world.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4943-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4943-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4943-S4945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS \n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated on Thursday, May 6, 1999:\n\n        EC-2914.

A bill to prevent juvenile crime, provide for certain \npunishment of juvenile delinquents, and incapacitate violent juvenile \ncriminals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation on a \nsubject that we will be spending a great deal of time talking about on \nthe floor this week--youth violence. At the outset, I would like to \nmake clear that this bill is not a comprehensive one that addresses \nevery aspect of this complex area. Other of my colleagues already have \nintroduced legislation broadly addressing these issues with many good \nideas that I support.\n  My bill today recognizes the need to get tough on juvenile crime and \nviolence. But this bill goes farther. It also recognizes that the best \nthing the Federal Government can do in dealing with youth crime and \nviolence is to focus on prevention. In other words, it ensures that \nwhat we do about juvenile crime and youth violence is a balanced \napproach. My colleagues and I have heard over and over again from law \nenforcement, prosecutors, and juvenile judges alike that the best way \nto deal on the front lines with juveniles who are committing or are at \nrisk of committing crimes is to implement prevention as well as \nsanctions.\n  What the Federal Government does best in the area of fighting crime--\nand the significant drop in crime as a result of the 1994 crime bill is \nproof of this--is for it to provide local law enforcement, prosecutors, \njuvenile courts, schools, and community-based organizations funds for \nthem to develop creative, comprehensive strategies on juvenile crime \nthat are tailored for their community. It is important to hold kids \naccountable when they commit crimes. But it is equally--if not more--\nimportant to keep kids out of trouble, to keep kids out of the juvenile \njustice system in the first place.\n  Before I get to the specifics of what my bill does, I want to \nhighlight the importance of early prevention in curbing youth violence.\n  To put the youth violence problem in some context, I would like to \nbegin by outlining the specific--and different--\n\n[[Page S4946]]\n\nchallenges we are facing when we discuss ``youth violence.'' \nDistinguishing among these different problems is important because each \ndemands a different response.\n  To be specific--we are really facing three separate issues when we \nconfront youth violence:\n  First, we have some number of children who are tragic cases--so \nviolent that we really have no choice but to get them behind bars and \nkeep them there, for a long time.\n  Second, we have kids who have already started down the crime path. \nThey aren't committing violent crimes, but they are clearly getting \ninto trouble. And, while the evidence is that most will never go on to \ncommit violent crimes, it is clear that we have to reach these kids and \nturn them around.\n  Unlike the first category where public safety requires very severe, \nvery long sentences, the key strategy for turning this second category \nof kids around appears to be certain, graduated punishments, as well as \nanything we can do which lessen the factors which may be pushing them \ndeeper into the crime stream--keeping them away from drugs, away from \nguns and out of gangs.\n  Third, we have a category of children in what the demographers call \nthe ``baby-boomerang.'' In a report I offered in December of 1995, I \ndetailed what inevitably lies ahead--39 million children now younger \nthan age 10. Each of these 39 million children--the children of the \nbaby-boomers--stand on the edge of their teen years, exactly those \nyears when they are most at-risk of turning to drugs and crime.\n  The implications of this demographic inevitability--even if we do \neverything right, and the rate at which kids commit crimes does not \nrise at all, we will have a 20% increase in juvenile murders by 2005, \nwhich will mean an increase in the overall murder toll of about 5%.\n  Clearly, most of these 39 million will never turn to drugs and crime. \nBut, equally clear, we have a rising number of at-risk children--at-\nrisk of turning to drugs, at-risk of being the victim of violence, and \nat-risk of turning to crime.\n  For this third category--the rising number of at-risk children--I \nbelieve we have to incorporate prevention as a key part of our strategy \nto combat youth crime and violence.\n  These three categories--lost, violent kids; kids just falling into \nthe crime stream; and at-risk kids who may be nearing the edge of the \ncrime stream--outline the targets of, and basic strategies for, a \nsuccessful effort against youth violence.\n  As we begin to debate strategies for addressing youth violence, let's \nget at least some idea of the size, the magnitude, of each of these \nthree segments of the youth violence question.\n  Starting in reverse order--with the third category of at-risk kids. \nOf course, all 39 million children in the ``baby-boomerang'' will not \nfall into this at-risk category. But, equally clear, that number of at-\nrisk children will be at least a few million.\n  For the other two categories, the facts are that there are relatively \nfew children in the ``lost'' category and while a significant number \nare in the ``falling into the crime stream'' category--both categories \nare much smaller than the few million in the ``at-risk'' category.\n  The facts for the youngest juveniles: In 1994, 379 juveniles younger \nthan 15 years old were arrested for murder, 39,000 were arrested for a \nviolent crime but more than 260,000 were arrested for a non-violent \nproperty crime.\n  For older teens, the pattern holds: 2,700 juveniles aged 15 to 17 \nwere arrested for murder, 86,000 were arrested for a violent crime, but \nmore than 350,000 were arrested for a non-violent property crime.\n  In sum: About 3,000 kids were arrested for murder--clearly ``lost'' \nchildren;\n  Another 115,000 kids were arrested for a violent crime--all are not \nirretrievable, but plainly all must be subject to serious punishment;\n  About 600,000 kids were arrested for a non-violent property crime--\nnot lost to us yet, but clearly falling deeper into the crime stream; \nand\n  At least a few million children are in the at-risk category.\n  It is my hope that throughout the debate on youth violence that we \nwill not lose sight of these fundamental facts about what we are \ntalking about when we say ``Let's do something about youth violence.'' \nI believe that is the goal we all share, so let's be smart. Let's keep \nour eye on the ball.\n  In short, just as it would be foolish to spend all our efforts and \nmoney on the millions of at-risk kids and do nothing about the lost, \nviolent kids--it would be equally foolish to spend all our efforts and \nmoney on the lost, violent kids and ignore the millions of at-risk \nkids.\n  Local officials throughout the country have looked at the facts, they \nhave been smart, they have used their resources from the 1994 crime \nlaw--and guess what: adult violent crime has plummeted. We now have the \nlowest murder rate since 1971. That says one thing--if we are smart, we \ncan make a difference on a problem everyone thought was unsolvable: \nviolent crime. We ought to be able to do the same when that violent \ncrime is committed by children.\n  We even have real world, working models of how to do so. Look to the \nexperience in Boston--an experience that the judiciary committee \nrecently heard about again in a hearing on juveniles and guns. In \nBoston, a combination of tough enforcement, cracking down on illegal \ngun dealers, focusing the forces of police, prosecutors and probation \nofficers, and comprehensive community-based prevention efforts have \nslashed youth violence.\n  I have outlined the three basis elements of the youth violence \nproblem. So let me turn to the specifics of what I believe we must do \nto address each of these three basic elements.\n  Tough punishment of the first group of kids--the ``Almost lost, \nalready violent kids''--is necessary--for public safety purposes we \nreally must look first to incapacitate very violent criminals, just \ngetting them off the streets.\n  For the second group of kids--the ``just getting into trouble \nkids''--we must provide certain, graduated sanctions--so that instead \nof our current system of not punishing a kid until he has 10, 15 or 20 \narrests, we give the kid at least some sanction from the very first \noffense.\n  And finally, for the third group--the ``baby bomberang kids''--who \nare not getting in trouble yet but are ``at-risk'', we must target the \nfactors which push kids into--or deeper into--the crime stream:\n  Getting kids off drugs and alcohol through drug testing and follow-up \nwith supervision and treatment;\n  Keeping kids out of gangs; and\n  Cracking down on the flow of guns to kids.\n  We must also keep as many at-risks kids as possible from turning to \ndrugs and crime in the first place--in most practical terms, this means \nkeeping kids busy and supervised during the 3:00 to dinnertime hours.\n  Those 3 hours represent about 12% of the day, about 20% of the hours \nwhen kids are awake--but at least 40% of juvenile crime occurs during \nthose hours.\n  Here is what the bill I am introducing today would do:\n  It creates a block grant for use by States and local governments to \ndevelop strategies that are aimed at all three of the categories of \nkids I just described. That block grant does the following:\n\n  First, it gives resources to States and local governments to develop \nmore effective ways to investigate, prosecute, and punish those kids in \nthe first group I described, who are already committing violent crimes.\n  Second, it gives resources to States and local governments to develop \nmore effective ways to ensure accountability through graduated \nsanctions and other means, and to address risk factors such as drug and \nalcohol abuse, truancy, or involvement with gangs.\n  And third, it gives resources to States and local governments to \ndevelop programs targeted for at-risk kids for prevention--to keep \nthese kids out of trouble, out of the juvenile crime system, and \ndiverted from going down the path to becoming a career criminal.\n  To do these three things, my bill authorizes $450 million. Of that \namount--\n  25 percent--$112.5 million--must be spent on prevention and drug and \nalcohol treatment.\n  25 percent--$112.5 million--must be spent on prosecutors and courts.\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\n  The rest--$250 million--can be spent on a variety of uses, including \ngraduated sanctions and prisons.\n  My bill also separately authorizes $50 million to hire, train, and \nfund programs run by prosecutors. We have heard over and over again \nthat prosecutors, who are on the front lines in dealing with juvenile \noffenders, across the country are developing innovative, comprehensive \napproaches to juvenile crime that are resulting in significant drops in \nthe juvenile crime rate.\n  For example, in Jacksonville, Florida, the state prosecutor there has \ndeveloped a multi-tiered approach. Those programs provide schooling and \ncounseling, they intervene with first time juvenile offenders to divert \nthem from the system, they provide prevention programs for at-risk kids \nthat include mentoring and talking to judges and kids already in jail, \nand they fight truancy.\n  It contains a ban on gun ownership by persons who, before their 18th \nbirthday, adults who have been adjudicated to have committed a serious \ndrug offense or violent felony. This provision, popularly known as \n``Juvenile Brady'', is an important step towards keeping guns out of \nthe hands of criminals. Violent juveniles who commit serious crimes \nshould be stopped--early--from getting access to weapons to commit such \ncrimes as adults.\n  Extending the Violent Crime Trust Fund to 2002. The Violent Crime \nTrust Fund--created in the 1994 crime bill--has been the key to our \nsuccessful fight against crime over the past few years. It has been the \nvehicle for providing billions of dollars to State and local \ngovernments to implement a variety of law enforcement and crime-\nfighting--from the Cops Program to the Violence Against Women Act to \nyouth violence initiatives. The Violent Crime Trust Fund is due to \nexpire in fiscal year 2000--my bill extends it to 2002. Without the \ntrust fund, we will fail in the future to replicate and to surpass our \npast successes in combating crime, including juvenile crime, in the \nfuture.\n  We must renew our efforts to save our Nation, our communities and our \nchildren from crime and violence. We must begin by ensuring that our \nchildren are safe--safe from both the temptation of crime and safe from \nthose who commit crime and horrific acts of violence.\n  We must protect our children through meaningful prevention and \nintervention programs, a crackdown on drugs and the violence that \naccompanies them, and we must insure that meaningful, appropriate and \nswift punishment is imposed on all juvenile offenders. I believe that \nthe bill I introduce today, while not a comprehensive answer to every \npart of the juvenile crime problem, will go far in addressing one of \nits key components--prevention.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 993\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 31\n\n       Whereas the Geneva Conventions of 1949 set basic humane \n     standards of behavior during armed conflict, and are the \n     major written source of international humanitarian law;\n       Whereas these Conventions prescribe humane treatment for \n     civilian populations, wounded, sick and shipwrecked military \n     personnel, and prisoners of war during armed conflict;\n       Whereas these Conventions recognize the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross as an independent and neutral \n     organization whose humanitarian mission is to protect and \n     assist civilians, prisoners of war, and other victims of \n     armed conflict;\n       Whereas ``the red cross in a field of white'' is not an \n     ordinary organizational symbol, but one to which the \n     international community has granted the ability to impose \n     restraint during war and to protect human life;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross and its sister national \n     societies are members of a world-wide organization rooted in \n     the provisions of international humanitarian law and \n     dedicated to the promulgation of its principles, among which \n     are the Geneva Conventions of 1949;\n       Whereas the international programs of the American Red \n     Cross bring relief from natural and manmade disasters abroad, \n     contribute to the development of nonprofit relief \n     organizations abroad, and include the teaching of \n     international humanitarian law throughout the United States;\n       Whereas many domestic programs of the Red Cross in health \n     and safety, disaster, blood, youth, and service to the \n     members of the Armed Forces of the United States grew out of \n     a response to armed conflict;\n       Whereas, thanks to the efforts of Clara Barton and \n     Frederick Douglass, the United States ratified in 1882 the \n     first convention for the amelioration of the condition of \n     wounded and sick members of the armed forces in the field;\n       Whereas in 1955 the United States ratified the Geneva \n     Conventions of 1949; and\n       Whereas the Geneva Conventions of 1949 are among the most \n     universally ratified treaties in the world: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       The Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the historic and humanitarian significance \n     of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, and celebrates the 50th \n     anniversary of the signing of these treaties;\n       (2) exhorts combatants everywhere to respect the red cross \n     emblem in order to protect innocent and vulnerable \n     populations on every side of conflicts;\n       (3) commends the International Committee of the Red Cross \n     and the more than 175 national Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     societies, including the American Red Cross, on their \n     continuing work in providing relief and assistance to the \n     victims of war as prescribed by these Conventions;\n       (4) applauds the Promise of Humanity gathering organized by \n     the American Red Cross in 1999 in Washington, D.C., as an \n     important reminder of our responsibilities to educate future \n     generations about the principles of international \n     humanitarian law;\n       (5) commends the efforts of the International Committee of \n     the Red Cross and the more than 175 national Red Cross and \n     Red Crescent societies, including the American Red Cross, for \n     their work in educating the world's citizens about the \n     humanitarian principles of international humanitarian law as \n     embodied in the Geneva Conventions of 1949;\n       (6) invites the American Red Cross during this anniversary \n     year to assist Congress in educating its Members and staff \n     about the Geneva Conventions of 1949;\n       (7) supports the anniversary theme of the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross that ``Even War Has Limits''; and\n       (8) calls upon the President to issue a proclamation \n     recognizing the anniversary of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 \n     and recognizing the Conventions themselves as critically \n     important instruments for protecting human dignity in times \n     of armed conflict and limiting the savagery of war.\n\n     SEC. 2. GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 DEFINED.\n\n       In this concurrent resolution, the term ``Geneva \n     Conventions of 1949'' means the following conventions, done \n     at Geneva in 1949:\n       (1) Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the \n     Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field (6 UST 3114).\n       (2) Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of \n     Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of the Armed Forces at \n     Sea (6 UST 3217).\n       (3) Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of \n     War (6 UST 3316).\n       (4) Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian \n     Persons in Time of War (6 UST 3516).\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nGordon Smith as I submit a concurrent resolution to commemorate the \n50th Anniversary of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Fifty years ago the \nUnited States joined 187 nations in establishing in international law \nthe four articles of the modern Geneva Convention. These articles are \nthe pillars of international law regarding the treatment of uniformed \nsick and wounded, prisoners of war, and civilians in times of armed \nconflict. Their existence serves to constantly remind us of our \nresponsibility to treat all victims of war with the dignity each of us \ndeserves.\n  These Conventions recognize the International Committee of the Red \nCross as an independent and neutral organization whose humanitarian \nmission is to protest and assist the victims of armed conflict. The \nInternational Red Cross is supported, in turn, by national societies \nsuch as the American Red Cross and the many other Red Cross and Red \nCrescent national agencies. Through the years, these organizations have \nworked tirelessly to bring relief to the suffering around the world \nwhether due to natural disaster or human conflict. Their dedication and \ncompassion have touched the lives of millions of people in all \ncountries and are today at work in the Balkans, Africa, South America, \nand, tragically, in our own state of Oklahoma in response to the recent \nmassive tornado.\n  I ask your support for this resolution that commemorates mankind's \nfirst major step to codify into international law the respect and \ndignity that we must foster for each other. The four articles of the \nGeneva Convention and the formation of the organizations flying the Red \nCross and Red Crescent stand as milestones in humanity's progress \ntowards a more civilized world. With this resolution we recognize the \nhistoric and humanitarian significance of the Conventions and commend \nthe Red Cross and Red Crescent agencies worldwide for their unflagging \nefforts to protect the principles of international humanitarian law.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4951-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4951]]\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n          committee on health, education, labor, and pensions\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I want to speak before you today \nabout a critical challenge before this Senate--the challenge of \nreforming the way in which elections are conducted in the United \nStates; the challenge of ending the ``moneyocracy'' that has turned our \nelections into auctions where public office is sold to the highest \nbidder. I want to implore the Congress to take meaningful steps this \nyear to ban soft money, strengthen the Federal Election Commission, \nprovide candidates the opportunity to pay for their campaigns with \nclean money, end the growing trend of dangerous sham issue ads, and \nmeet the ultimate goal of restoring the rights of average Americans to \nhave a stake in their democracy. Today I am proud to join with my \ncolleague from Minnesota, Paul Wellstone, to introduce the ``Clean \nMoney'' bill which I believe will help all of us entrusted to shape \npublic policy to arrive at a point where we can truly say we are \nrebuilding Americans' faith in our democracy.\n  For the last 10 years, I have stood before you to push for \ncomprehensive campaign reform. We have made nips and tucks at the edges \nof the system, but we have always found excuses to hold us back from \nmaking the system work. It's long past time that we act--in a \ncomprehensive way--to curtail the way in which soft money and the big \nspecial interest dollars are crowding ordinary citizens out of this \npolitical system.\n  Today the political system is being corrupted because there is too \nmuch unregulated, misused money circulating in an environment where \ncandidates will do anything to get elected and where, too often, the \nspecial interests set the tone of debate more than the political \nleaders or the American people. Just consider the facts for a moment. \nThe rising cost of seeking political office is outrageous. In 1996, \nHouse and Senate candidates spent more than $765 million, a 76% \nincrease since 1990 and a six fold increase since 1976. Since 1976, the \naverage cost for a winning Senate race went from $600,000 to $3.3 \nmillion, and in the arms race for campaign dollars in 1996 many of us \nwere forced to spend significantly more than that. In constant dollars, \nwe have seen an increase of over 100 percent in the money spent for \nSenatorial races from 1980 to 1994. Today Senators often spend more \ntime on the phone ``dialing for dollars'' than on the Senate floor. The \naverage Senator must raise $12,000 a week for six years to pay for his \nor her re-election campaign.\n  But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The use of soft money has \nexploded. In 1988, Democrats and Republicans raised a combined $45 \nmillion in soft money. In 1992 that number doubled to reach $90 million \nand in 1995-96 that number tripled to $262 million. This trend \ncontinues in this cycle. What's the impact of all that soft money? It \nmeans that the special interests are being heard. They're the ones with \nthe influence. But ordinary citizens can't compete. Fewer than one \nthird of one percent of eligible voters donated more than $250 in the \nelectoral cycle of 1996. They're on the sidelines in what is becoming a \ncoin-operated political system.\n  The American people want us to act today to forge a better system. An \nNBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows that 77% of the public believes that \ncampaign finance reform is needed ``because there is too much money \nbeing spent on political campaigns, which leads to excessive influence \nby special interests and wealthy individuals at the expense of average \npeople.'' Last spring a New York Times found that an astonishing 91% of \nthe public favor a fundamental transformation of this system.\n  Cynics say that the American people don't care about campaign \nfinance. It's not true. Citizens just don't believe we'll have the \ncourage to act--they're fed up with our defense of the status quo. \nThey're disturbed by our fear of moving away from this status quo which \nis destroying our democracy. Soft money, political experts tell us, is \ngood for incumbents, good for those of us within the system already. \nWell, nothing can be good for any elected official that hurts our \ndemocracy, that drives citizens out of the process, and which keeps \npoliticians glued to the phone raising money when they ought to be \ndoing the people's business. Let's put aside the status quo, and let's \nact today to restore our democracy, to make it once more all that the \nfounders promised it could be.\n  Let us pass the Clean Money Bill to restore faith in our government \nin this age when it has been so badly eroded.\n  Let us recognize that the faith in government and in our political \nprocess which leads Americans to go to town hall meetings, or to attend \nlocal caucuses, or even to vote--that faith which makes political \nexpression worthwhile for ordinary working Americans--is being \nthreatened by a political system that appears to reward the special \ninterests that can play the game and the politicians who can game the \nsystem.\n  Each time we have debated campaign finance reform in this Senate, too \nmany of our colleagues have safeguarded the status quo under the guise \nof protecting the political speech of the Fortune 500. But today we \nmust pass campaign finance reform to protect the political voice of the \n250 million ordinary, working Americans without a fortune. It is their \ndwindling faith in our political system that must be restored.\n  Twenty five years ago, I sat before the Foreign Relations Committee, \na young veteran having returned from Vietnam. Behind me sat hundreds of \nveterans committed to ending the war the Vietnam War. Even then we \nquestioned whether ordinary Americans, battle scarred veterans, could \nhave a voice in a political system where the costs of campaigns, the \nprice of elected office seemed prohibitive. Young men who had put their \nlife on the front lines for their country were worried that the wall of \nspecial interests between the people and their government might have \nbeen too thick even then for our voices to be heard in the corridors of \npower in Washington, D.C.\n  But we had a reserve of faith left, some belief in the promise and \nthe influence of political expression for all Americans. That sliver of \nfaith saved lives. Ordinary citizens stopped a war that had taken \n59,000 American lives.\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\n  Every time in the history of this republic when we have faced a moral \nchallenge, there has been enough faith in our democracy to stir the \npassions of ordinary Americans to act--to write to their Members of \nCongress; to come to Washington and speak with us one on one; to walk \ndoor to door on behalf of issues and candidates; and to vote on \nelection day for people they believe will fight for them in Washington.\n  It's the activism of citizens in our democracy that has made the \nAmerican experiment a success. Ordinary citizens--at the most critical \nmoments in our history--were filled with a sense of efficacy. They \nbelieved they had influence in their government.\n  Today those same citizens are turning away from our political system. \nThey believe the only kind of influence left in American politics is \nthe kind you wield with a checkbook. The senior citizen living on a \nsocial security check knows her influence is inconsequential compared \nto the interest group that can saturate a media market with a million \ndollars in ads that play fast and loose with the facts. The mother \nstruggling to find decent health care for her children knows her \ninfluence is trivial compared to the special interests on K Street that \ncan deliver contributions to incumbent politicians struggling to stay \nin office.\n  But I would remind you that whenever our country faces a challenge, \nit is not the special interests, but rather the average citizen, who \nholds the responsibility to protect our nation. The next time our \nnation faces a crisis and the people's voice needs to be heard to turn \nthe tide of history, will the average American believe enough in the \nprocess to give words to the feelings beyond the beltway, the currents \nof public opinion that run beneath the surface of our political \ndialogue?\n  In times of real challenge for our country in the years to come, will \nthe young people speak up once again? Not if we continue to hand over \ncontrol of our political system to the special interests who can infuse \nthe system with soft money and with phony television ads that make a \nmockery of the issues.\n  The children of the generation that fought to lower the voting age to \n18 are abandoning the voting booth themselves. Polls reveal they \nbelieve it is more likely that they'll be abducted by aliens than it is \nthat their vote will make a real difference. For America's young people \nthe MTV Voter Participation Challenge ``Choose or Lose'' has become a \ncynical joke. In their minds, the choice has already been lost--lost to \nthe special interests. That is a loss this Senate should take very \nseriously. That is tremendous damage done to our democracy, damage we \nhave a responsibility in this Senate to repair. Mr. President, with \nthis legislation we are introducing today, we can begin that effort--we \ncan repair and revitalize our political process, and we can guarantee \n``clean elections'' funded by ``clean money,'' elections where our \ncitizens are the ones who make the difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4952-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KEN WHEELER\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncareer and civic contributions of Mr. Ken Wheeler, an industry leader \nand community builder in Paducah, Kentucky. Ken's recent retirement is \nthe culmination of a forty-two year career in the maritime industry \nspanning shipbuilding to inland shipping.\n  Ken earned a degree in mechanical engineering at Southern Methodist \nUniversity and worked for twenty-four years for Ingalls Shipbuilding in \nthe company's nuclear-submarine division. By the time he left Ingalls \nShipbuilding, he was the company's vice-president of submarine \nprograms. Contributions from individuals such as Ken Wheeler helped \nmake our nation's nuclear-submarine fleet the safest, quietest, and \nmost effective in the world. In the early 1980's, Ken and his wife, \nJean, relocated to Paducah following Ken's career move to Midland \nEnterprises, which operates tow boats on the nations inland riverways.\n  Since joining Midland Enterprises, Ken has held various positions \nincluding vice-president of repair and maintenance, Port Allen Marine; \npresident, Walker Boat Yard; vice-president, Harley Marine Corp.; \npresident, R & W Marine, Inc.; and vice-president, maintenance and \nrepair for all the Midland Enterprise companies.\n  Ken has been a key player in establishing Paducah as a national hub \nfor river trade. The city currently boasts about twenty towing \ncompanies, and more than 130 supporting businesses. The towing industry \nin Paducah accounts for approximately 1,300 jobs and a $35,000,000 \nannual payroll. Ken has used his position within the industry as a \n``bully pulpit'' to advocate needed infrastructure improvements on the \nriverways, our nation's internal trade lifeline. From the new Olmsted \nDam on the Ohio River, not far from its confluence with the mighty \nMississippi, to the expanded lock facilities at Kentucky Dam on the \nTennessee River, Ken has worked to make sure that the general public as \nwell as those in government understand the importance of a strong and \nvital river-transportation network. A network which has a great, but \noften unrecognized impact on our American way of life. Ken's goal as we \ncross the threshold into a new millennia has simply been to make \ncertain that America's riverways continue to supply the economical \ntransportation which we have so long enjoyed. As other countries around \nthe world improve their inland transportation networks, we must work to \nensure that increased costs of transportation do not put our exports at \na competitive disadvantage.\n  In other areas of civic concern, Ken has also worked to better \nWestern Kentucky by serving on the boards of Paducah Community College, \nand West Kentucky Technical College. He is a past president of the \nPropeller Club of the United States. Additionally, he chairs the River \nHeritage Center, an exciting new development which will showcase the \nhistory of the inland rivers and their importance.\n  Mr. President, I commend Ken Wheeler for his outstanding service to \nKentucky and the nation. Whether it be building systems that helped win \nthe Cold War, or championing an industry vital to our national \ncommerce, Ken Wheeler's contributions will have long-lasting effect. I \nask that my fellow colleagues join me in recognizing the career of this \noutstanding Kentuckian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4952-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4952-S4953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to offer a few comments \nabout one of the most important issues we have considered as part of \nthe so-called financial modernization debate, namely the Community \nReinvestment Act or CRA. It gives me particular pleasure to discuss CRA \nbecause it was authored by the former Senator from Wisconsin and Senate \nBanking Committee Chair, William Proxmire. CRA is over twenty years old \nnow, and by all accounts it has been a success.\n  Banks have a special role in our free market system; they are the \nrationers of capital. For this reason and others we grant banks a \nnumber of special privileges, such as public charters, taxpayer-backed \ndeposit insurance, and access to the discount window at the Federal \nReserve. CRA is grounded in the philosophy that we grant these \nprivileges in part to assure that banks will serve the public--all of \nthe public in all parts of our communities.\n  In the context of last week's debate over so-called financial \nservices modernization, the concept that we should require banks to \nactively find lending opportunities in communities they serve is all \nthe more appropriate. The globalization of financial services, and the \nnew structures proposed for financial institutions, increasingly means \nlocal institutions have ever expanding and increasingly distant \nopportunities for their loan portfolios. CRA serves as a reminder that \nultimately we grant rights and privileges to banks in part to ensure \nconsumers and businesses in our communities have access to financial \nservices.\n  I have been interested in CRA since the early 1980s when I became \nChair of the Banking Committee in the Wisconsin State Senate, and while \nit is not perfect, CRA has clearly helped give under served communities \nincreased access to financial services. And it has done a great deal to \nfoster economic development, both for individual families, and for \nneighborhoods and communities through home ownership and community \ndevelopment financing.\n  As noted in a recent report by the Wisconsin Rural Development \nCenter,\n\n[[Page S4953]]\n\nfor many low-income and minority groups, home ownership is a way out of \npoverty. Equity built through home ownership can be used to finance a \nstart-up business, pay for a college education, fund a secure \nretirement or consolidate high interest rate debt. The report went on \nto note that home ownership in low-income neighborhoods can provide \nstability, increase pride and property values, and attract new capital.\n  CRA has helped foster access to financial services in each of these \nareas. Commitments by banks to home ownership, small business, and \ncommunity development has increased because of CRA. According to 1997 \nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act data, lending to minority and low income \nborrowers is increasing. Since 1993, the number of home mortgage loans \nto African Americans increased by 58 percent, to Hispanics by 62 \npercent, and to low and moderate income borrowers by 38 percent.\n  In 1997, financial institutions subject to CRA reporting requirements \nmade 2.6 million small business loans for a total of $159 billion, two-\nthirds of small business loans made that year, and more than one-fifth \nof those loans were made to small businesses in low and moderate income \ncommunities.\n  And, in 1997, large commercial banks made $18.6 billion in community \ndevelopment investments.\n  Altogether, nonprofit community organizations estimate that since \n1992 the private sector has pledged over $1 trillion in loans going \nforward for affordable home ownership and community development.\n  I have no doubt that CRA was responsible in great part for this \nrecord. And neither does Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan Greenspan. At \na House Banking Committee hearing earlier this year, Chairman Greenspan \ntestified that CRA has ``very significantly increased the amount of \ncredit in these communities'' and that changes have been ``quite \nprofound.''\n  It is important to note that CRA has succeeded in encouraging banks \nto serve those who have been financially under served without \njeopardizing the safety and soundness of the institution. As Robert \nKuttner has noted, in the decade after CRA, we learned that financial \ninstitutions often make costly mistakes, but lenders faltered in the \n1980s not by being too kind to the inner city, but by making \nspeculative loans in remote locations they knew little about, and by \ncompeting recklessly for market share. By comparison, the local Jimmy \nStewart type loan looked pretty solid.\n  As Chairman Greenspan noted, ``there is little or no evidence that \nbanks' safety and soundness have been compromised by (low- and \nmoderate-income) lending and bankers often report sound business \nopportunities.''\n  In fact, CRA is a tool that can help banks. As former Federal Reserve \nBoard Governor Lawrence Lindsey said, ``CRA-related activities can help \ndevelop new markets, potentially profitable business, and improve a \nbank's public image.''\n  Let me note that there have been some improvements to CRA. In \nresponse to the very real problems facing many smaller community banks, \na streamlined CRA process was approved a few years ago, and I was proud \nto support those changes and I understand the paperwork burden on \nsmaller banks has been reduced as a result. Over 80 percent of banks \ncovered by CRA qualify for the streamlined performance standards for \nsmall banks and thrifts, and I understand that actual time spent in \ncommunity banks on CRA examinations has been reduced by 30 percent.\n  CRA has helped improve financial services for under served \ncommunities, but there is still significant room for improvement.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my \nesteemed colleague, the Senator from Delaware, on his 10,000th vote in \nthe Senate. This is a tremendous milestone which few Senators ever \nreach. For our colleague to reach it at the young age of 56 is even \nmore impressive.\n  I am proud and fortunate to count Senator Biden as one of my best \nfriends. Since he came into the Senate in 1972, we have worked \ntogether, learned from each other, and swapped stories. One story I \nrecall in particular is that Senator Biden used to practice \n``speechifying,'' as some of our predecessors in the Senate would have \nsaid, in front of his classmates to overcome a stuttering problem. \nWell, Mr. President, I think we all will agree that he has overcome \nthat problem quite nicely and has learned to excel at speechifying.\n  One of the most amazing facts of Senator Biden's career is that he \nwas elected to this body at the ripe old age of 29. His 27 year-old \nsister was his campaign manager, and he saved mailing costs by having \nvolunteers hand-deliver campaign literature to every house in the \nstate. Of course, Senator Biden's campaigns are run a little more \nprofessionally now, but he has not lost touch with the people of his \nstate. In fact, the Senator from Delaware has told me stories about \nvirtually every town in his state, no matter how small. He is as \nfamiliar with his constituents and as concerned with their needs as any \nSenator I have known.\n  Of course, his devotion to his constituents has not prevented Senator \nBiden from playing a sometimes crucial role on national stage. As we \nall know, Mr. President, he presided over two of the most controversial \nJudiciary Committee hearings for Supreme Court nominees in American \nhistory: those for Judge Robert Bork and Justice Clarence Thomas.\n  Senator Biden was one of the foremost proponents of expanding the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. Last year, he led the successful \neffort to expand NATO. In 1997, he led the successful effort to ratify \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention. Today, the Senator from Delaware \ncontinues to take an active interest in events in the Balkans, the \nMiddle East, and Asia, and as Ranking Member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, he remains an outspoken voice on foreign policy matters.\n  Senator Biden has been a leader also in the fight to protect women \nfrom violence. He authored the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act, which was signed into law in September 1994. This act, \nwhich included the landmark Violence Against Women Act, was the first \ncomprehensive law to address gender-based crimes. The desire to prevent \ncrime and help crime's victims has long been one of the guiding lights \nof our esteemed colleague's career. In 1984, he co-authored the Victims \nof Crime Act, which provides hundreds of millions of dollars to crime \nvictims each year, paid for by criminals.\n  Senator Biden was the lead sponsor of the Juvenile Justice Prevention \nAct of 1974 and the Juvenile Justice Prevention Amendments of 1992, \nwhich provided states with federal grants for a comprehensive approach \nto preventing juvenile crime and improving the juvenile justice system. \nAnd in 1996, Senator Biden led the floor fight to restore 1996 \nappropriations to fund\n\n[[Page S4954]]\n\ncrime bill initiatives, most notably the Community Oriented Policing \nServices program to help local and state governments hire more police.\n  The Senator from Delaware has long been a leader on Women's Health \nissues. He sponsored the Medicare Mammography Screening Expansion Act, \nwhich became law as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1998. For five \nyears running now, he has authored the annual National Mammography Day. \nAnd, in 1998, the President signed into law a bill co-sponsored by \nSenator Biden, which required the creation of a breast cancer postage \nstamp, with proceeds from the stamp's sale going to breast cancer \nresearch.\n  Like many of his colleagues, the Senator from Delaware has had to \ntriumph over adversity to attain his many professional achievements. \nThe hardships faced and overcome by my dear friend and colleague \ninclude the injury of his sons and the death of his beloved first wife \nand infant daughter in an auto accident shortly after his election to \nthe Senate in 1972, and his own recovery from two operations for a \nnear-fatal brain aneurysm in 1988. Despite this tragedy and adversity, \nSenator Biden has never succumbed to pessimism or forgotten his role as \na public servant. He has never ceased working to serve his state and \nhis nation. He remains optimistic about America's future and his \nability, working within the Senate, to improve his state and nation.\n  The Senator from Delaware has called serving in the Senate the \ngreatest, most privileged post-graduate education in America. I think \nall of us will agree, Mr. President, that he has passed this education \nwith flying colors. There is no more devoted, hard-working member of \nthis body than Senator Biden. He is known for his integrity, bipartisan \ncollegiality, and desire to serve the public good. These qualities will \nalways be cherished in this body, as in all walks of life. For any \nyoung Americans seeking a public figure to emulate, I can think of no \nbetter role model than the Senator from Delaware. And that, Mr. \nPresident, is the greatest compliment I can think to pay my dear \nfriend, Senator Biden. For 27 years, it has been my great honor and \npleasure to serve with him and to count him as a friend. It gives me \ngreat pleasure to know that before he leaves this great institution, \nSenator Biden almost certainly will receive accolades on the casting of \nhis 20,000th vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4954-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMEMORATING CARLOS HATHCOCK II\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man of \nextraordinary courage. A fellow Arkansan. A soldier and a hero. His \nname was Carlos N. Hathcock II.\n  Carlos was born on May 20, 1942, in Little Rock, Arkansas, the son of \na welder. At the age of eight, Carlos saw his first Marine in full \nuniform. The sight left an indelible impression--a mark that would lead \nhim to commit his life to the military. But in the meantime, he had \nsome growing up to do. Carlos spent a great deal of time in the woods \nof North Little Rock, hunting squirrels and rabbits and bringing them \nhome to eat. He had no problem filling the table. It seemed as if he \nwas anticipating his future career.\n  Carlos could hardly wait to start his career in the military. In May \n1959, at the age of seventeen, he signed up with the Marines with the \npermission of his father. The moment he turned eighteen, Carlos went \ninto the Corps. He quickly realized his talent as an effective rifleman \nand began to carve out his niche in the Marines as a sniper. The \nintramurals of the Marine Shooting Team was his first official match, a \nmatch that he won handily. This victory would certainly not be the \nlast. Carlos won many more shooting competitions and rose steadily \nthrough the ranks, with a only a few minor bumps along the way. Indeed, \nthe months and years could be counted by championships and promotions, \nand marked by his marriage to his wife Jo and the birth of his son, \n``Sonny'' Hathcock.\n  But soon enough, the skills of Sergeant Carlos Hathcock II were put \nto use and put to the test. In 1966, the Marines sent him to Vietnam. \nHis tour of duty was no doubt difficult, but Carlos' amazing rifle \nskill made him a valuable asset to the Marines and an opponent to be \ndreaded by the North Vietnamese. For his great service, Carlos was \npresented with the Navy Commendation Medal with combat ``V.''\n  Carlos proved himself again on his fateful second tour of duty in \nVietnam in 1969. By this time, Carlos knew the sweltering jungles of \nVietnam. He could become one with his surroundings. With painstaking \npatience, he crawled and lay in wait--his hands controlled, resisting \nthe urge to scratch or stretch, his body still as death--until that \nmoment when he struck. Carlos was an expert. He even gained a \nreputation among the Viet Cong who dubbed him ``Long Tra'ng,'' or white \nfeather, for the single white feather in his hat. But as precise and \ndeadly as he was, Carlos did not enjoy killing people. In fact, he \nsaved the lives of his comrades in the 7th Marines, 1st Marine \nDivision.\n  On September 16, 1969, the amphibious assault vehicle Carlos was \nriding ran over a landmine and exploded. Carlos, sprayed with burning \ngasoline and his flesh melting away, focused only on helping his \ncomrades. Carlos went back to the vehicle and dragged his companions \naway to safety. He was burned almost beyond recognition.\n  Fortunately, Carlos was able to recover. For his heroism in Vietnam, \nCarlos was awarded a Purple Heart and Gold Star. And with swift \ndedication, Carlos went back to the Marines, serving almost ten more \nyears, retiring on March 1, 1975, after nineteen years, ten months, and \nfive days of service. He had entered the Marines as a callow youth and \nleft a Gunnery Sergeant, a veteran, and a hero.\n  He carried on his patriotism and service to America, speaking at \nmilitary gatherings and teaching his sniper skills to the Virginia \nBeach Police Department. And in 1996, he was again awarded for his \nheroism in Vietnam, this time with a Silver Star.\n  Carlos Hathcock II passed away on February 23, 1999. But he lives on \nin the minds of many. His son, Carlos Hathcock III, is also a gunnery \nsergeant in the Marines. The Marines have a library in Carlos' name and \nan annual award presented to the best marksman in the Marine Corps. \nMarksmanship of legendary proportions will remain synonymous with the \nname Hathcock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4954-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4954-S4955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AGRICULTURE MARKET FAILURE PROTECTION ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 30, \nthe Agricultural Market Failure Protection Act of 1999. The purpose of \nthis bill, of which I am co-sponsor, is to protect farmers against \nincome loss resulting from severe economic downturns and weather-\nrelated crop losses. In my view this legislation is very timely, \nconsidering the current status of our nation's agricultural economy.\n  We have been experiencing alarming economic conditions in the \nagricultural sector for over two years. A combination of declining crop \nprices, reduced yields, and unfavorable export markets have led to a \nsubstantial decrease in overall farm incomes. As a nation, we often \nforget how important it is to protect the vitality of our agricultural \nproducers. We do not want to wait until farms disappear and our \nsupermarkets can no longer stock their shelves to address this \nsituation.\n  Farmers in my own state of Maryland are not immune to the effects of \nthis crisis. Over the past two years, they have been hit hard by low \ncommodity prices and a widespread drought that has destroyed a \nsignificant number of crops. The Maryland Agricultural Statistics \nService reports that total farm income fell $8.2 million last year to \n$265.4 million overall. This was a 3 percent decline. Since 1996, farm \nincomes in Maryland have fallen 26 percent. Prices for grain, corn, \nsoybeans, and hogs are all down, some at 20 to 30 year lows. A recently \npublished article from The Baltimore Sun illustrates the impact of this \ncrisis on the economy of Maryland.\n  In an effort to address this decline, the Agriculture Market Failure \nProtection Act would revise marketing assistance loan rates, authorize \nsix-month loan extensions, and amend the Internal Revenue Code to \ntemporarily increase the number of years permitted for the carry back \nof net operating losses for certain farmers. In short, it would help \nprevent future income loss by giving farmers a chance to run their \noperations without constantly being at\n\n[[Page S4955]]\n\nthe mercy of the market. With these changes to the Agricultural Market \nTransition Act, farmers will be able to spread crop sales throughout \nthe entire season, and subsequently allow them to take advantage of \nhigher prices.\n  The legislation which Senator Daschle has introduced leaves \ncommodities in the hands of farmers, thereby allowing them to make \ntheir own marketing decisions for the future. I commend him for \nintroducing this legislation, and in light of the current state of the \nagricultural economy, I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 30, the \nAgricultural Market Failure Protection Act of 1999.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record the Baltimore Sun article.\n  The article follows.\n\n Md. Farm Income Down 3% in 1998; Grain Growers Suffer Big Losses, But \n                     Poultry, Dairy Farmers Do Well\n\n                            (By Ted Shelsby)\n\n       The extra-fat paychecks of poultry farmers and dairymen \n     last year were not enough to offset big losses by grain \n     growers, and the state ended 1998 with a 3 percent decline in \n     net farm income, according to preliminary estimates released \n     yesterday by the Maryland Agricultural Statistics Service.\n       Total farm income in Maryland fell $8.2 million last year \n     to $265.4 million.\n       It was the second consecutive year that Maryland farmers \n     have been hurt by low commodity prices and drought. Farm \n     income last year was 26 percent lower than in 1996.\n       ``This is going to have a serious impact on our rural \n     economy,'' Maryland Department of Agriculture Secretary Henry \n     A. Virts said.\n       ``The farm equipment dealers are going to suffer. The feed \n     dealers are going to suffer. The truck dealers, restaurants \n     and furniture stores are going to suffer, too. Anybody who \n     serves the farm industry is going to feel the decline.''\n       The drop in farm profit last year was blamed primarily on \n     low commodity prices and a summer drought that destroyed \n     grain crops in Southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore.\n       ``Grain prices were down, down, down last year,'' said Ray \n     Garibay, head of statistics services for the Agriculture \n     Department, in releasing his net income estimate. He added \n     that the prospects for prices are no better for this year as \n     a result of large supplies of grain in storage.\n       But not all segments of agriculture shared in the hard \n     times.\n       Garibay said that 1998 will be remembered fondly by poultry \n     and dairy farmers.\n       ``Last year was our best in the past 10 or 12 years,'' said \n     Lewis R. Riley, an Eastern Shore chicken grower and former \n     state agriculture secretary.\n       ``Poultry prices stayed healthy throughout 1998, and in \n     most case farmers were paid a price bonus by the \n     processors,'' Riley said.\n       He explained that the bonus, which totaled between $5,000 \n     and $6,000 for his farm, is like a profit-sharing plan in \n     which the chicken processors pay farmers above their contract \n     price when wholesale poultry prices rise.\n       ``It's a windfall for good prices,'' Riley said, ``and it \n     made 1998 a very good year for poultry growers.''\n       State dairy farmers also benefited from record milk prices \n     late last year due to a shortage of milk caused by weather \n     problems in Southern California.\n       Ed Fry, who operates a dairy farm near Kennedyville, said \n     farmers profited from a shortage of cheese and butter last \n     year. ``High milk prices, coupled with low grain prices, made \n     for a very good year for the dairy industry in general,'' he \n     said.\n       Fry noted that the good times are coming to a halt. He said \n     the basic formula price of milk set by the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture dropped 37 percent last week, and farmers will \n     feel the bite in their milk checks beginning next month.\n       Grain farmers have been feeling a financial pinch for more \n     than a year.\n       Melvin Baile Jr., past president of the Maryland Grain \n     Producers Association, said corn and soybean growers were \n     lucky to break even last year.\n       ``Prices were off 20 percent for corn and the same for \n     soybean,'' said Baile, who farms 700 acres outside New \n     Windsor in Carroll County.\n       He said the double whammy of low prices and poor yields was \n     particularly hard on Southern Maryland and Eastern Shore \n     farms that experienced the brunt of last year's \n     drought.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4955-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN ROBERT B. SHIELDS, JR., USN\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding Naval Officer, Captain Robert B. Shields, \nJr., as he prepares to retire upon completion of twenty-seven years of \ndistinguished service. It is a privilege for me to honor his many \noutstanding achievements and commend him for his devotion to the Navy \nand our great Nation.\n  A native of Providence, Rhode Island, Captain Shields is a graduate \nof the United States Naval Academy. Upon graduation in 1972, his first \nsea tour was aboard the USS Aylwin (FF-1081) where he served as First \nLieutenant and Anti-Submarine Warfare Officer. His second and third \nshipboard tours were served aboard USS Nicholson (DD-982) and USS \nRichmond K. Turner (CG-20). Captain Shields continued to demonstrate \noutstanding leadership abilities as the Executive Officer of USS \nSterett (CG-31) and was rewarded with command of the destroyer USS \nO'Bannon (DD-987).\n  His most recent sea tour was as Commanding Officer of the cruiser USS \nVicksburg (CG-69). During Captain Shield's tenure, his ship earned the \nBattle Efficiency ``E'' Award, the Ney award, and the Best Ship's Store \nSales and Service Award. Vicksburg distinguished herself as Air Warfare \nCommander for the John F. Kennedy Battlegroup while deployed to the \nMediterranean and Persian Gulf.\n  Captain Shields completed shore assignments at the Navy Postgraduate \nSchool where he earned a Masters of Science Degree in Engineering \nAcoustics; the Royal Navy Staff College in Greenwich, England; and in a \nvariety of assignments in Washington, D.C. In Washington, he was \nassigned to the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations in the Research, \nDevelopment and Acquisition Directorate and then completed a year as a \nFederal Executive Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Captain \nShields first came in contact with our nation's lawmakers when he \nserved as a Congressional Liaison Officer for surface ship programs in \nthe Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. With many successful at-sea \nand shore tours behind him, Captain Shields' was then handpicked to \nserve as Deputy Legislative Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. His current, and last, assignment has been with the \nNavy's Office of Legislative Affairs where he is Deputy Chief.\n  Captain Shields is a dynamic and resourceful naval officer who \nthroughout his tenure has proven to be an indispensable asset. He is a \npassionate advocate of the Sea Services and has been tireless in \nsupporting the needs of the Sailors in the Fleet and their families. He \nunderstands better than anyone that they are truly the backbone of our \nnational defense. His superior contributions and distinguished service \nwill have long-term benefits for both the Navy and the country he so \nproudly served. As Captain Shields enters into his new profession, we \nwill certainly miss him. I am proud to thank him for his service and \nwish him ``fair winds and following seas'' as he concludes his \ndistinguished Naval career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4955-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4955-S4957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO HOWARD SCHNELLENBERGER\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my good \nfriend Howard Schnellenberger for making University of Louisville \nfootball the success that it is, and wish him the best in his latest \nendeavor to build a completely new football program at Florida Atlantic \nUniversity.\n  Howard was the Cardinal's football coach for nine years and, when he \nleft, had re-created the program to be unlike any the University of \nLouisville had ever seen. Howard didn't just talk about what he wanted \nto accomplish at U of L, he delivered. He recruited better players, he \ninitiated plans for a brand new state-of-the-art stadium, and most \nimportantly he inspired a kind of spirit in the Cardinals' faculty, \nfans and players that they had never experienced before. It was this \nwinning spirit that helped Howard lead Cardinals football to its \npresent glory.\n  Howard believed in his team and his school, and set no meager goals \nfor them. He wanted nothing less than to transform them from a team \nthat hadn't had a winning season in years, to a team that would be a \nlegitimate bowl contender. While U of L may still have some progress to \nmake, the Cards have played in, and won, several bowl games in recent \nyears--and for that, Howard is largely responsible.\n  I have no doubt that Howard will have as significant an effect on \nFlorida Atlantic University as he had on U of L. Howard will have a \nchance to build this program from the ground-up--as of yet, FAU doesn't \neven have a team. As FAU's Director of Football Operations, Howard will \nhand-pick the staff and the players and mold the football program in \nthe likeness of his previous\n\n[[Page S4956]]\n\nsuccess stories. With Howard's track record, FAU can expect an exciting \nprogram that will build steadily toward future success.\n  Thank you, Howard, for your nine years of dedicated service to the \nUniversity of Louisville, which resulted in a winning team and a top-\nquality program. Five years after your departure, your spirit continues \nto drive the Cardinals football program toward victory. Best wishes at \nFlorida Atlantic University, and may God bless you and Beverlee in this \nexciting adventure.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a copy of a \nJanuary 1999 article, ``The Louisville Prototype,'' which appeared in \nthe FAU Sports Digest.\n  The article follows.\n\n  The Florida Atlantic Football Program Will Largely be Modeled After \nWhat Howard Schnellenberger Built at Louisville, a Program Which Might \n                 As Well Have Been Started From Scratch\n\n                            (By Ron Steiner)\n\n       Louisville--At Miami, Coach Howard Schnellenberger revived \n     a collegiate football program that was on the verge of \n     extinction and won a national championship. Writers called \n     that effort the ``Miracle of Miami.''\n       At Louisville, his hometown, Schnellenberger was the last \n     hope for a program headed for the scrap heap. He built a team \n     that went on to crush Alabama in the 20th Anniversary Fiesta \n     Bowl, and that inspired construction of the school's first \n     true on-campus stadium, a $68 million structure financed \n     almost entirely by the fans. In Kentucky they call that \n     effort ``The Miracle on Floyd St.''\n       For Howard Schnellenberger, today it is his blueprint.\n       Now, the veteran coach is about to go for the hat trick by \n     building a totally new collegiate football program at Florida \n     Atlantic University in Boca Raton and much of what he does at \n     FAU will be modeled after what was successful at Louisville, \n     a program that might as well have been built from scratch.\n       Based on Schnellenberger's track record, it's a safe bet \n     that he has at least one more miracle tucked away some-where \n     in the pocket of his blazer.\n       Taking Miami to the title game and beating a legendary \n     Nebraska team was improbable. But at least that school had \n     played in big bowl games and had long-aspired to greatness.\n       Tackling the job at Louisville, where basketball had been \n     the only local sports language for decades? That was a \n     massive undertaking the size of which even Schnellenberger \n     had underestimated.\n       After one of his first spring practices at Louisville, held \n     long before the new freshmen could arrive, Schnellenberger \n     called a staff member to his office. The coach was slumped in \n     his chair. He looked tired, disturbed and suddenly very gray.\n       ``Did you see that practice? Did you see that?'' he asked \n     as if he were recounting a nightmare. ``What in the world \n     have we gotten ourselves into here?''\n       There was no answer.\n       No one, not even a veteran coach like Schnellenberger, \n     could have known how hard it was going to be, or how much \n     work there was to be done or even what unexpected \n     obstacles, both seen and unseen, would be thrown into the \n     path of progress.\n       But he pressed on with the same confidence, singleness of \n     purpose and unceasing energy that he's armed with at Florida \n     Atlantic.\n       At Louisville, it was a dream of Top-25 rankings, national \n     television appearances, home sellouts, bowl bids and a new \n     stadium, that kept the Cardinal football family going during \n     the early years.\n       Back in 1985, when the Cards opened their first season \n     under Schnellenberger at West Virginia, the lineup was iffy \n     to say the least.\n       One starting defensive back was a freshman who had played \n     quarterback in high school, and the other corner was a \n     freshman who had played middle guard as a prep player. One of \n     the starting defensive tackles was a freshman who had never \n     lined up in a three-point stance in his life. The Louisville \n     Cardinals were simply outmanned and that was the way things \n     were going to be for a while.\n       Today, thanks largely to Schnellenberger's efforts, the \n     Cards are fresh off their third bowl game in the '90s, and \n     their facilities draw raves from the likes of award-winning \n     quarterback Cade McNown. In town recently to receive the \n     Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award as the nation's top senior \n     quarterback, McNown raved about the new stadium and football \n     complex.\n       ``I only wish we had facilities like these at UCLA,'' \n     McNown said.\n       It wasn't that way when Schnellenberger toiled to jump-\n     start the program.\n       Back then, summer preseason practice sessions were held on \n     the school's suburban campus where grass fields were watered \n     by garden hoses and makeshift, homemade sprinklers. \n     There weren't many players on the team to start with and \n     when some got a close look at the new way of doing things, \n     there were fewer.\n       During the season, seven huge linemen would meet with their \n     assistant coaches in tiny 10-foot offices built for one. Back \n     then, closets were cleaned out and transformed into offices. \n     Walls were knocked down. Pictures and inspirational signs \n     were nailed up. They cried out: ``Be Positive or Be Gone'' \n     and ``It takes everyone to be No. 1'' and ``What have you \n     done today to help Louisville win tomorrow?''\n       Back then, there were three phone lines for a 40-person \n     staff. Coaches making recruiting calls and other staff \n     members handling regular business would wait for a free line, \n     like contestants on a game show. When one of the three lights \n     on the phone set would go dark, they would battle to see who \n     could punch it up first.\n       And back in '85, the foundation for a Top 25 contender was \n     quietly being built in a small brick building on the property \n     of the Kentucky Fairgrounds, among mules and jacks and the \n     largest bulls you've ever seen.\n       The University of Louisville was trying to recruit its \n     stars of the future in the middle of mobile home shows, gun \n     shows, flea markets, ice shows, and appropriately, the \n     circus.\n       As hard as it is to believe since Florida Atlantic doesn't \n     even have a team yet, Schnellenberger will be dealing with a \n     better hand in his role as Director of Football Operations.\n       He'll oversee the construction of on-campus facilities and \n     develop a program with a tremendous population base for \n     recruiting, a great climate and instant visibility in a \n     football-crazy state. There will be tough sledding, \n     nonetheless. But they will be experiences with a blend of \n     familiarity. It goes with the territory of building something \n     that will last.\n       At Louisville, there were plenty of times he would wonder. \n     At times, he would go out on game day knowing as an expert \n     that the other team would have to fumble four times and throw \n     four interceptions if his team was to have a chance to even \n     keep the score close.\n       But the next day he would always return to his office \n     before dawn, whistling, and with a new idea, something that \n     needed fixing, a new phone call to make, something--\n     anything--that would bring progress that day. He hid his \n     doubts very well. He had to. If the head coach didn't \n     believe, then who else would?\n       Back then, like now, there was something else, too. There \n     was something very special that few modern-day teams ever \n     experience. Adventure.\n       There was a clear-cut goal of building a program that would \n     some day challenge the nation's best and compete for a \n     national title one day. And there was something new every \n     day.\n       There was a pioneer spirit that caught on. Recruiting was \n     based on that premise: ``Sure, you can go to the established \n     programs and be just another one of a long list of players at \n     that school. Or you can come with us and make a major \n     difference. You can come with us and help create something. \n     It won't be easy. In fact, we guarantee it will probably be \n     the hardest thing you will ever do. But you will be part of \n     something truly special. Something important. Something \n     lasting.''\n       Back in the early days at Louisville, and it will likely be \n     the same if he chooses to coach at Florida Atlantic, there \n     was little early prestige. But inside themselves, the players \n     and fans who became close to the program began to share a new \n     spirit. The early years were crazy for those close to the \n     Cards. They were frustrating and fulfilling all at the same \n     time, tiring and exhilarating all at once. Breaking down \n     historic walls of resistance and preconceptions took time. \n     Building up the program took strength.\n       Together, new players, students, alumni, fans, staff and \n     friends of the program, all who suffered and yet enjoyed \n     those formative years, were drawn together at Louisville in a \n     state known for basketball, in a stadium built for baseball, \n     to create something new and special for collegiate football. \n     Back then, they shared a dream. And they still do.\n       For example, NFL All Pro defensive tackle Ted Washington of \n     the Buffalo Bills, a Tampa native, recently recalled his \n     playing days at Louisville under Schnellenberger.\n       ``It seemed like every day we would hear the coach say his \n     favorite saying--`To Believe is to be Strong.' At the time I \n     guess I didn't understand what it meant,'' Washington said. \n     ``But I do now, and a day doesn't go by that I don't use the \n     phrase myself in football, in charity work and in working in \n     the community.''\n       Washington is just one of three NFL stars who played at \n     Louisville who have been selected to this year's Pro Bowl. \n     New Orleans defensive end Joe Johnson and the Atlantic \n     Falcons' defensive back Ray Buchanan were Schnellenberger \n     recruits who bought into the dream of building a tough-\n     minded, top-quality program.\n       Perhaps the most dramatic example of the Schnellenberger \n     magic is the sparkling new stadium that stands on the \n     southernmost edge of the campus of the University of \n     Louisville.\n       At first, the idea of building a proud football program at \n     Louisville and then the absolute best stadium in the state \n     was mocked by some local writers who called it simply a pipe \n     dream. After all, the future of Cardinal football was a \n     fragile thing in the late 1980s. Again, there had been talk \n     of de-emphasizing the sport, possibly dropping back to \n     Division I-AA or disbanding completely.\n       But then came Schnellenberger. And then came winning \n     seasons, bowl victories and sellout crowds. If ever \n     Louisville was going to fulfill its football destiny, if ever \n     there was going to be a time to give the program\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\n     a solid foundation for the future, the time had come.\n       Schnellenberger's quiet belief was that once U of L and the \n     Greater Louisville community committed to building a \n     new stadium, and once that stadium was completed, there \n     would be no turning back. Football would suddenly become \n     more important than ever before, and have every possible \n     chance to succeed as never before.\n       From that point on, he reasoned, there would be a financial \n     imperative to aim high and provide fans with quality \n     schedules and competitive teams. Recruiting of coaches and \n     players would be enhanced immediately and for decades to \n     come. And finally, the Louisville football program and its \n     deserving fans would have a first-class home to call their \n     own.\n       Today the stadium that Schnellenberger and his early \n     recruits could only dream about is a reality. It is \n     considered the finest, most fan-friendly college stadium in \n     America today. It has a state-of-the-art playing surface, \n     42,000 chairback seats, a video replay board, corporate \n     suites and a magnificent club level, all of which might make \n     some NFL teams envious.\n       But there's something much more important about the stadium \n     in Louisville they call Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. It's a \n     testimony to the Schnellenberger way of doing things. It's \n     all about vision, hard work, persistence, dreaming and \n     determination.\n       Unlike many of the state of Kentucky's sports facilities, \n     and many others around the nation, Louisville's new stadium \n     is not a gift from the government.\n       Instead it is certainly one of the most remarkable \n     collegiate projects ever built--by and for the people.\n       Schnellenberger had begun lobbying for a new stadium on \n     Dec. 1, 1984, the day he took over the Cardinal program. But \n     it took years to wade through administrative bureaucracies \n     and to build a football team that would energize the \n     community.\n       As the program improved, fan interest grew. New attendance \n     records were set. Top teams like Texas, Texas A, Florida, \n     Florida State, Arizona State and Tennessee were scheduled. \n     Winning seasons turned into near-perfect seasons. And then \n     came decision time.\n       When it became clear that a new stadium at Louisville would \n     have to be built with private funds, skeptics chuckled. After \n     all, no modern-day university had ever achieved such a feat.\n       But on June 2, 1993, the overall plan for fans to fund the \n     new stadium was in place. But no one knew for sure how the \n     fans would react.\n       That warm evening the U of L Athletic Department conducted \n     its most amazing day of fund-raising ever. A kickoff party \n     designed primarily as an information session, turned into a \n     bonanza. Fans began writing checks. Big checks. And it was \n     all the staff could do to keep up with the outpouring of \n     support.\n       On that pivotal day, Cardinal loyalists pledge more than $1 \n     million. And suddenly, the effort had the momentum it needed.\n       ``What happened that day and throughout the stadium \n     campaign, was unprecedented in college sports,'' said Dean \n     Billick, now athletic director at Lamar University in Texas \n     who served as a consultant to the stadium drive for four \n     months.\n       ``The passion the U of L fans had for their program and for \n     that project was remarkable. People were taking out second \n     mortgages on their homes to be able to buy lifetime seats. \n     Some people were making commitments that were probably beyond \n     what they could afford. But their commitment to making the \n     stadium happen is something I will never forget. After years \n     of discussions and studies, the Louisville fans finally got \n     their chance at bat, and they stepped up to the plate and hit \n     a home run. It was simply amazing to see.''\n       In only four months, thousands of Louisville fans came \n     together to commit nearly $15 million to the stadium project. \n     They gave it life.\n       Corporate and political leaders, knowing a winner when they \n     saw one, jumped to the head of the victory parade and began \n     to support the project. Others like Papa John's Pizza founder \n     John Schnatter, saw it as a way for a hometown boy to give \n     back to his community, and he pitched in $5 million.\n       But without the fans some of whom pledged as little as $25 \n     per year, and some who donated up to $25,000 per seat, \n     Louisville's dream would never have happened. Their passion \n     for both the project and the program was founded in being \n     part of the dream from the very beginning.\n       They had been there for those first practices and first \n     games under their new coach. They had shared the tough times \n     and later celebrated the good times together. And they had \n     dared to dream together.\n       As Louisville fans prepared for their bowl trip this year, \n     local country singer Mickey Clark recorded a song to \n     commemorate the Cardinals' successful season. The title? The \n     Dream Lives On. It sure does.\n       And that should be good news for Florida Atlantic fans who \n     are about to embark on a dream of their own.\n       They'll be doing so alongside that fellow named \n     Schnellenberger, who might just make this new story he's \n     working on the best one yet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4957-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4957-S4978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, as amended \nand passed by the Senate on May 6, 1999, is as follows:\n\n                                 S. 900\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (B) in those States that have not yet implemented \n     regulations governing the offer or sale of insurance in \n     connection with the short-term lease or rental of a motor \n     vehicle, a presumption should exist that no insurance license \n     is required in connection with such sales.\n       (2) Exception for certain insurance products.--Subsection \n     (b) does not apply to any person or entity who offers or \n     provides insurance ancillary to a short-term lease or rental \n     transaction of a motor vehicle in a State that does not, by \n     statute, rule, or regulation, impose any licensing, \n     appointment, personal or corporate qualifications, or \n     education requirements on such persons or entities.\n       (3) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to alter the validity or effect of any State law, \n     or the prospective application of any final State statute, \n     rule, or regulation which, by its specific terms, expressly \n     regulates or exempts from regulation any person or entity who \n     offers or provides insurance ancillary to a short-term lease \n     or rental transaction of a motor vehicle.\n       (4) Lease period.--For purposes of this subsection, a \n     person shall be considered to be providing insurance \n     ancillary to a short-term lease or rental transaction of a \n     motor vehicle if the lease or rental transaction is for 60 \n     days or less, and the insurance is provided for a period of \n     consecutive days not exceeding the length of the lease or \n     rental.\n       (5) Effect.--This subsection shall remain in effect during \n     the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and \n     ending 5 years after that date of enactment.\n       (i) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the term ``antitrust laws'' has the same meaning as in \n     subsection (a) of the first section of the Clayton Act, and \n     includes section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (to \n     the extent that such section 5 relates to unfair methods of \n     competition);\n       (2) the term ``insured depository institution'' has the \n     same meaning as in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Act; and\n       (3) the term ``State'' means any State of the United \n     States, the District of Columbia, any territory of the United \n     States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust \n     Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the \n     Northern Mariana Islands.\n     Subtitle B--Streamlining Supervision of Bank Holding Companies\n\n     SEC. 111.

MULTISTATE LICENSING AND INTERSTATE INSURANCE SALES \n                   ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the States regulate the business of insurance, \n     including the licensing of insurance agents and brokers;\n       (2) the current State insurance licensing system requires \n     insurance agents and brokers to obtain licenses on a line-by-\n     line, class-by-class, producer-by-producer, State-by-State \n     basis;\n       (3) in the commercial and industrial insurance arena, this \n     State-based system usually requires a single agent or broker \n     to hold scores of licenses if that agent or broker intends to \n     sell or broker insurance on a nationwide basis;\n       (4) because of the duplicative licensing requirements both \n     within States and from State to State, a single insurance \n     agent or broker must satisfy literally hundreds of \n     administrative filing requirements to become fully licensed \n     to engage in the sale of a full range of insurance products \n     on a nationwide basis;\n       (5) these administrative requirements appear to be \n     essentially unrelated to any requisite standards of \n     professionalism;\n       (6) many States impose certain requirements on insurance \n     agents and brokers that pose an undue, discriminatory burden \n     on nonresident agents, including some States that ban \n     solicitation of insurance clients by nonresident agents and \n     brokers;\n       (7) many States impose anticompetitive post-licensure \n     requirements on nonresident agents and brokers, including \n     countersignature laws that require an agent or broker \n     servicing the needs of an out-of-State client to have any \n     insurance policy that is sold ``countersigned'' by a resident \n     agent;\n       (8) in some cases, such countersignature laws also require \n     a nonresident agent or broker to pay at least half of any \n     commission earned in a State in which the agent or broker is \n     not a resident to a resident agent or broker; and\n       (9) such duplicative and onerous filing requirements and \n     anticompetitive burdens inhibit interstate commerce, \n     constitute unjustifiable trade barriers, greatly undermine \n     the competition that this Act seeks to foster.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) by the end of the 36-month period beginning on the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the States should--\n       (A) implement uniform insurance agent and broker licensing \n     application and qualification requirements that result in a \n     fully reciprocal licensing system; and\n       (B) eliminate any pre- or post-licensure requirements that \n     have the practical effect of discriminating, directly or \n     indirectly, against nonresident insurance agents or brokers;\n       (2) if such actions are not taken, Congress should take \n     steps to directly rectify the problems identified in \n     subsection (a); and\n       (3) any entity established by the Congress to so rectify \n     the problems should be under the supervision and oversight of \n     the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\n     SEC. 312.

Mr. President, I rise today to again talk about the \ncontinuing agriculture crisis that is facing America's farmers. I spent \nthis weekend in North Dakota. I spoke at the annual graduation of the \nNorth Dakota State School of Science and then at North Dakota State \nUniversity's graduation on Saturday morning. On Friday, I went to an \nevent we call Marketplace For Kids, which we hold every year, in which \nchildren from a large part of North Dakota come in and show the things \nthey have been working on--inventions, creative ideas that they have \nhad.\n  In these three sets of events I ran into literally hundreds of North \nDakota farm families. Without exception they told me, Senator, unless \nthere is a Federal response and unless it comes quickly, literally \nthousands of us are going to be forced off the land this spring.\n  This is a crisis as deep and as serious as any I have seen in my 13 \nyears now representing North Dakota in the Senate. We have had quite a \nstring of crises: in 1988-1989, the worst drought since the 1930s; in \n1997, the worst flood in 500 years that devastated the town of Grand \nForks, ND; and now this continuing agriculture crisis, as a result of, \nreally, three factors. One is the collapse of farm prices. The second \nis incredibly bad weather over the last 5 years--overly wet conditions. \nIn fact, as I flew over North Dakota, it looked like Lake Agassiz, \nwhich existed thousands of years ago, was reforming, because everywhere \nI looked, as I flew in a light plane over half of North Dakota, flying \nfrom east to west, all I saw was water everywhere. It was really \nstunning to see it. Then, of course, we have been hit by bad policy: A \nfarm bill that has reductions in support from Government no matter what \nhappens to farm prices, very steep reductions that are included in that \npolicy; and, of course, a trade policy that left us vulnerable to \nincredible increases in imports from Canada traded on an unfair basis.\n\n  This stew that is being cooked is increasingly hard to choke down for \nour farmers. This is a recent headline, April 4, in the Bismarck \nTribune, my hometown newspaper. The headline is: ``Farm Families Forced \nTo Cancel Health Insurance.'' In the story they talk about Clint \nJacobs, a 30-year-old farmer, who raises 200 head of cattle near \nAmidon, ND. That is out in western North Dakota. He and his wife and \ntheir 1\\1/2\\-year-old daughter were paying $550 every 3 months for \nhealth insurance and they had $1,000 deductible. They had to drop their \nhealth insurance.\n  This is a story that is repeated every day across North Dakota, and I \nam sure in other farm belt States as well, as we cope with the lowest \nprices in 52 years--the lowest prices in 52 years. These farm families, \nwith incredibly hard-working, decent, honest people, are having to dump \ntheir health insurance in a bid to survive financially. This really is \nnot right.\n  As I traveled across my State this weekend, farm families came to me, \nbankers came to me with a very consistent message: You have to respond \nand you have to respond quickly, because this is a set of facts that is \ngoing to suck thousands of us down.\n  This article I was referring to says that 26 out of 82 farmers and \nranchers who were surveyed had dropped health insurance to make ends \nmeet. The survey was done by the Lutheran Disaster Response of Lutheran \nSocial Services in North Dakota. As one person said, if you have four \nor five bad years and you tighten the belt every time, health insurance \ngets to be one of the things that is cut.\n  That is what is happening today in my State. Patients are skipping \npreventive care, such as checkups and mammograms. Some doctors and \nother health care providers are not getting paid.\n  In a sidebar story by the Associated Press, their farm writer says: \nFacing a dim agriculture forecast this year, farmers can now prepare \nfor financial cutbacks. A Purdue University extension specialist who \noffers financial advice to struggling farmers in Indiana said families \nmust determine what they can do without.\n  That is exactly what is happening in North Dakota. Maybe there are \nsome who are listening and saying that we have had to do that in our \nlife, we have had to cut back when times are tough, we have had to \nconsider what you can do without; so what.\n  This is not a typical downturn. This goes far beyond what somebody \ncan fairly plan for--the lowest prices in 52 years; 5 years of the \nworst weather on record; as a result, an outbreak of disease \nunprecedented in our State's history.\n  In over 100 years, we have never seen an outbreak of disease like we \nare coping with now. Scab, a fungus that breaks out when there are \noverly wet conditions, dramatically reduced production, with prices, as \nI indicated, the lowest they have been in 52 years. What a double \nwhammy. On top of it, to have a farm bill passed--and it does not \nmatter what farm prices are--that is slashing Government support for \nproducers at the very time our chief competitors are spending more.\n  The Europeans, who are our chief competitors and who we were supposed \nto be convincing to cut their subsidies by cutting ours, did they \ndecide to follow suit? Absolutely not. They have decided to spend more, \nand they are already spending $50 billion a year to support their \nfarmers. We are spending $5 billion. That is not a fair fight.\n  Our farmers are ready to take on anybody anytime anywhere. They are \nready to compete. They are ready to take on the farmers of France and \nGermany and England, and all the rest, but they are not prepared to \ntake on, in addition to the farmers from those countries, the \ngovernments of those countries. They are not prepared to take on the \nFrench Government, the German Government, and the British Government, \nas well as the farmers from those countries. That is not a fair fight.\n  Yet, that is what we have said to our farmers: You go out there and \nyou take on the French farmers and, while you are at it, take on the \nFrench Government as well. You go out there and compete against the \nGerman farmer, and while you are at it, take on the German Government \nas well.\n  That is not a fair fight. We have to put tools in the hands of our \nfarmers so they have a chance to fight back. If we do not, we will wake \nup sometime soon and find that tens of thousands of farm families have \nbeen forced off the land and have been destroyed financially. That is \nwhat is happening in my State each and every day. Good people, honest \npeople are being destroyed. The question is, Are we going to stand and\n\n[[Page S4980]]\n\nhelp them or are we going to stand by and do nothing? That is the \nchoice that is before us. I hope we respond, and I hope we respond \nquickly.\n\n  We need to immediately pass the emergency supplemental that is in the \nconference committee between the House and the Senate tomorrow. We need \nto pass that legislation because it provides an expansion of credit to \nget farmers into the fields, and we need to add to that package. We \nneed to add $1.5 billion to keep the promise that we made last year in \nthe disaster bill. We now know the farmers have signed up for the \nprogram that we have promised. We found we are $1.5 billion short of \nfunding what we promised. We ought to keep the promise, and we ought to \ndo it in this bill.\n  In addition, we ought to provide the same supplemental benefit we \nprovided last year to offset this dramatic decline in prices. That \nwould be an AMTA supplemental, transition payments that were provided \nfor in the last farm bill that are going down each and every year. Last \nyear, because of the crisis, we provided a 50-percent supplement. We \nneed to do that again this year. It will cost $2.8 billion.\n  That is a total package approaching $5 billion. Last year, we passed \na package of $6 billion. I would like to have that amount again this \nyear, but the reality is that we are going to have to make do with the \npackage like the one I have described, at least for now. But it needs \nto happen now. We should not wait because while we are waiting, \nliterally thousands of people are being forced off the land and being \nfinancially destroyed, through no fault of their own, by being caught \nup in a circumstance of bad weather, bad prices, and bad policy. There \nis not much we can do about the prices, there is not much we can do \nabout the weather, but we can do something about the policy. That is \nour responsibility. I hope we meet that responsibility and meet it this \nweek.\n  I want to show, before I leave this subject, some charts that \nappeared in the newspapers back home while I was there. It showed the \nnet return per acre of wheat in North Dakota going back to 1986. You \ncan see the kinds of returns that farmers were seeing per acre for \nplanting wheat. Our State is a major wheat State, really one of the key \nbreadbasket States in the Nation.\n  As you can see, there were positive returns of over $30 an acre in \n1986 and 1987. Then we saw pretty tough times in 1988, 1989, and 1990, \nthe drought years. We saw a substantial improvement in 1991, 1992, and \n1993. In 1994, we saw a steep slide; 1995, further erosion; 1996 was \nabout the same as 1995, and then the bottom fell out in 1997, negative \nreturns per acre approaching a $20 loss per acre. The more you planted, \nthe worse off you were, and the same pattern was repeated in 1998.\n  If we do not act, 1999 is going to be a whole lot worse and, \nliterally, as I have indicated, thousands of farm families are going to \nbe facing auction. I showed a cartoon that was in the biggest paper in \nmy State several weeks ago. It showed a pole, and it had auction signs, \n9 or 10 different auction signs all pointing in different directions. \nSitting on top of the pole was a buzzard. That is kind of the feeling \nin my State right now. The buzzards are swooping overhead waiting for \nanother farm failure, waiting for another auction, waiting to see \nanother farm family sold out, because that is what is happening all too \nfrequently in my State these days.\n\n  If it was not enough to have the dominant crop in negative return \nterritory the last year, this is the pattern of raising cattle. You can \nsee very much a similar pattern, only returns went negative earlier for \ncattle. In 1995 and 1996, they were negative, and they were barely in \nthe black for 1997 and 1998.\n  Two-thirds of the income in my State is crop income. So when crops \nare giving negative returns, and then you face on top of that livestock \ngiving negative returns, it is impossible to make money--impossible to \nmake money--again, not through any fault of these farm families. These \nare the hardest working, most honest people I know, but they are being \ndevastated by events beyond their control.\n  The financial collapse in Asia cost them their biggest customer. The \nfinancial collapse in Russia cost them a very big customer. Those \nevents, working together, have created a nightmare for these farm \nfamilies. Then on top of that, after you stack these natural disasters, \nyou put the final coup de grace--the bad policy coming out of \nWashington--and it is pretty hard for a farm family to make it.\n  It is pretty hard for them to take on the Europeans when those \ncountries have decided that they are going to spend $50 billion a year \nto support their producers and we are spending $5 billion. We are being \noutspent, outgunned, 10-to-1. And why? Because the Europeans decided \nsome time ago that it made sense to their countries to have people out \nacross the land. They did not want to see everybody forced into the \ncity. They did not think that made sense for their society.\n  I hope very soon we will come to a similar conclusion in this country \nand will decide that it makes sense to have people out across the land, \nbecause if we do not respond, there will be precious few people out \nthere; they will all be headed to the cities. The last thing we need in \nthe Washington metroplex is more people: More crowding, more pollution, \nmore hassle. That is exactly what is going to happen unless we respond.\n  This is a good country, a generous country, and one that responds \nwhen people are in crisis. We are going to respond to the disasters in \nOklahoma, in Kansas, in Tennessee, and the other States that have been \naffected. I believe we are going to respond in this crisis, as well, in \nthe farm States of America, because they are on the brink of a total \nfinancial collapse. That is the seriousness of what is happening.\n  Now is the time; this week is the time; on this supplemental is the \ntime to respond, and to respond strongly, to give people the help they \ndesperately need.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/10/senate-section/article/S4980-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
