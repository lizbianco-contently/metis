Mr. President, I observe that for the first time, I \npresume, in history we have just opened the session of the Senate with \nthe Pledge of Allegiance led by our most esteemed President pro \ntempore.\n  I yield for some brief comments on that to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the majority leader for his \ncourtesy.\n  This is a historic day. Ironically, today, the House of \nRepresentatives is scheduled to pass a constitutional amendment \nprotecting our flag from desecration and on this same day we are, for \nthe first time in the history of the Senate, as far as I know, saluting \nthe flag as we begin its proceedings.\n  I thank both leaders, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, for their \nsupport in bringing this resolution to the floor quickly, and also to \nthank Senators McConnell, Helms, Dorgan, Mikulski, Warner, Brownback, \nFeinstein, Robb, Conrad, Thurmond, Murkowski, and Senator Gordon Smith \nfor their cosponsorship and to thank all of my colleagues as we had a \n100-to-0 agreement to do this.\n  I am proud to be the sponsor of this historic resolution. I stand \nhere at a very historic desk, the desk of Daniel Webster, who was here \na few years before me.\n  This is history being made. I want to give credit to the person who \nhelped make this history happen. Oftentimes, we get letters and phone \ncalls from constituents, sometimes with good ideas, sometimes they are \nnot so good. But in this particular case a young woman, who is in the \ngallery today, by the name of Rebecca Stewart, of Enfield, NH, made a \nsimple phone call to my office. She said: Why don't we salute the flag \nbefore the proceedings begin in the Senate?\n  I said: That's a good idea. Why didn't I think of that? But I had \nnot.\n  Thanks to Rebecca, who gave us the idea--and I looked into it with \nthe Rules Committee and everything moved quickly, thanks to both \nleaders--here we are. Today, Rebecca brought with her the flag that was \ndraped over the coffin of her husband's grandfather, who was a World \nWar II vet.\n  I think it is very fitting this morning that a young woman from New \nHampshire, which has the Nation's first primary, was first to see that \nthe flag of the United States will from now on be saluted prior to the \nproceedings in the Senate.\n  I say thank you to Rebecca and to my colleagues for their courtesies \nin making a good idea come to pass.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to express our appreciation to the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, for his effort. The fact is that \nthe Rules Committee moved swiftly on the resolution. I think I should \nnote for the record that the House of Representatives started this \npractice some years ago, and it was instigated by my former colleague \nin the House, Sonny Montgomery. They have been doing it for a number of \nyears, and I think it is most appropriate that we begin to do the same \nthing in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7551-6", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7551-S7552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I think \nit is important that I take a minute to sort of review the bidding as \nto what has been going on. There have been a number of discussions as \nto how to proceed\n\n[[Page S7552]]\n\nwith the pending agriculture appropriations bill, as well as the two \npending Patients' Bill of Rights proposals. Senator Daschle and I \ntalked numerous times throughout the day. At one point, beginning on \nTuesday night, we talked about trying to find a way to take the \nPatients' Bill of Rights issues up and deal with them on Wednesday and \nThursday. We could not quite get that approved.\n  Then a proposal was made to go ahead and go forward with the \nappropriations bills and maybe some other legislative issues that could \nbe cleared and to take up the Patients' Bill of Rights issue on Monday, \nJuly 12, when we come back from the recess, and spend until the close \nof business that week, Thursday, July 15, on the Patients' Bill of \nRights issue. Originally, I was thinking it would just be sort of a \njump ball; we would get started. We would go forward, no limits on \namendments, no limits on time, but understanding everybody had to be \nfair with each other. There should not be an attempt on this side to \nblock a reasonable number of amendments. Neither should there be an \nattempt on the other side to say we have to have 18 or 26 or 35 or any \nrequisite number of amendments but just do like we do legislative \nbills--we take them up and go forward.\n\n  Concerns developed on both sides of the aisle, and we modified that \nproposal two or three times. As of late last night, about 6, we were \nstill exchanging ideas. So we do not have a finalized agreement.\n  I think progress has been made toward finding a way to complete \naction on the pending bill; that is, the underlying bill, the \nappropriations bill, as well as other important appropriation bills. We \nshould be able to find a way to consider the Patients' Bill of Rights \nissue, because there is belief, I think on both sides, that there are \nsome areas that need to be addressed. There are some rights that need \nto be protected. There should be some way to appeal decisions within \nHMOs. Once we make up our minds that we will get together and work \nthrough it, I think we will be able to do that. We can continue trying \nto negotiate, which I am always willing to do, or we can just go ahead \nand go forward and see what happens.\n  Keep in mind that this Patients' Bill of Rights issue, or pieces of \nit, would be on the agriculture appropriations bill, which is not the \nnormal place we would want it. Also, I presume it won't be there when \nthe appropriations bill comes back. So I do not quite understand why we \nwould be doing it this way.\n  To enable us to negotiate, I will ask for a period of morning \nbusiness, but I would like to discuss that momentarily with Senator \nDaschle and leadership on both sides.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7552-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I see the Senator from California back on \nthe floor prepared to offer her amendment on the pending legislation. \nIt is an extremely important amendment.\n  I noted that she was here yesterday morning prepared to offer the \namendment, and then in the midmorning, and then at noontime, and then \nin the early afternoon, midafternoon, and late afternoon.\n  I am very glad we are going to have a brief period of morning \nbusiness. But, as one Senator, I hope this is really the last time we \nare going to have a period of morning business and that we can get on \nto the business and the substance of this legislation.\n  We went through all day yesterday with continuations of morning \nbusiness, and we had some 16 Members--those who are cosponsors of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights--who came to the floor prepared to speak on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, different features of it. Many of them--I \nthink eight of them--are actually prepared to offer amendments but were \nunable to do so because we were in continued morning business. I see \nthat the Senator from California is prepared to move ahead and move \nthis whole process forward.\n  I think the American people want us to move ahead on this. I think it \nis enormously timely that we do, and particularly in the way the \nSenator from California intends to address the Senate. I know she will \nspeak for herself in a few moments.\n  We can see what happened in the last few hours among the doctors in \nthis Nation. The American Medical Association is voting to try to come \ntogether in a way to advance, one, the quality of health care for the \nAmerican consumer; and, two, to be able to deal with these economic \npressures they are under from the HMOs, in order to give assurance to \ntheir patients that they are going to be able to receive the best in \nterms of health care.\n  It just underlines, once again, the importance of Senator Feinstein's \namendment in terms of what is going to be defined as medically \nnecessary. That is at the heart of this whole issue on the Patients' \nBill of Rights. I think we ought to be about the debate on that during \nthe course of the day.\n  This is a very fundamental, basic difference. I have read carefully--\nand it didn't take a great deal of time--the comments of those who \nspoke yesterday in favor of what I call the ``patients' bill of \nwrongs'' being submitted by the other side, which was passed out of our \nHuman Resource Committee. There was no real focus and attention on this \nfundamental and basic issue. We ought to be about it; we ought to \ndebate it and vote on it and move ahead on other pieces of legislation.\n  I find that it appears with the proposal--I see the Senator on her \nfeet at the present time--I listened with great interest to the \nproposal made by the Republican leadership suggesting how we proceed \nnext week on the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The way I looked at their proposal that was going to be offered by \nthe majority leader, it would effectively permit only one Democratic \namendment per day and we would have only 4 days, because under the \nproposal they would have a first-degree amendment, a Republican \namendment, and then you could have a second-degree Democratic amendment \nand a second-degree Republican. That would take 6 hours. Then you would \nhave a first-degree Democrat amendment, a second-degree Republican \namendment, a second-degree Democrat amendment. That is 6 more hours. \nThat is 12 hours with one amendment.\n  That is not the Senate, Mr. President. I don't believe that offer \ndeserves to be accepted. We were tied up in morning business for a full \nday because they did not want to vote on a single proposition of \nwhether the insurance company accountants or the medical profession \nought to make the medical decisions. That is a very basic and \nfundamental one. This body ought to make a judgment and decision on \nthat issue.\n  I see the Senator from California on her feet now, and I hope that \nafter she makes a presentation on this, we will be able to just have \nthe opportunity to commend our colleagues to her position. I have \nreviewed both her statement and her amendment; it is an excellent one. \nWith the acceptance of her amendment, it will mean that every insurance \npolicy in this country, virtually, will establish a higher standard of \ntreatment for the American patients, for every child, for every member \nof a family, and that will be the basic standard that will be used.\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\n  I don't believe that the American families ought to have any less \nthan the best. The Senator from California has an amendment to address \nthat issue. We should listen carefully to it, and then we should move \nto let the Senate make a judgment on this decision. I look forward to \nthe discussion and debate, and hopefully we can have some resolution of \nit.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson).

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his remarks. I don't think anyone in the Senate has ever done more \nto advance the cause of responsible medical reform than Senator Kennedy \nfrom the State of Massachusetts. He also has been here day after day, \nwith comment after comment, in speech after speech, trying to urge this \nbody to act.\n  My general style is probably not as forceful as that of the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts. But about this particular \nissue I am going to be persistent, and I am going to be here for as \nlong as it takes, until there is an opportunity to have a vote on this \namendment.\n  Today, this morning, another arrow in the quiver of reform was played \nout above the fold in the Washington Post--something, as a doctor's \ndaughter and a doctor's wife for many years, I never thought I would \nsee in the United States of America--and that is, the American Medical \nAssociation voting to unionize doctors. The subhead under the headline \nreads: ``Group Acts in Response to Managed Care's Effect on Rights, \nDuties of Physicians.''\n  I want to quote two brief things from the article:\n\n       In setting up what they are calling a ``national \n     negotiating organization,'' AMA officials contended that only \n     through collective bargaining can doctors win back control \n     over which drugs they may prescribe for patients and how much \n     treatment they can provide.\n\n  Mr. President, it is a disturbing day when physicians have to \nunionize to be able to prescribe and treat patients as they see fit. I \ncan't believe that this day has come in the United States of America.\n  Let me end on this subject, with one quote from the AMA president, \nDr. Nancy Dickey. She said:\n\n       Traditional unions are there primarily to care for their \n     employee's needs. We are looking for a vehicle that will \n     allow us to carry out the covenant we have with our patients.\n\n  That is the reason I am proposing this amendment--or hope to propose \nthe amendment. I hope to have an opportunity to offer an amendment that \nrepresents the heart of HMO reform.\n  This amendment will prevent managed care plans from arbitrarily \ninterfering with or altering the physician's decision of what is a \nmedically necessary service. The term medically necessary, or \nappropriate, is defined as ``a service or benefit which is consistent \nwith generally accepted principles of professional medical practice.'' \nThat is something none of us can be opposed to. If this amendment were \nin fact the law, it would not be necessary for the American Medical \nAssociation to vote to unionize physicians. Physicians would have that \nright guaranteed by this amendment. Let me prove that by reading the \nactual wording of the amendment:\n\n       A group health plan, or health insurance issuer, in \n     connection with health insurance coverage, may not \n     arbitrarily interfere with, or alter, the decision of the \n     treating physician regarding the manner or setting in which \n     particular services are delivered if the services are \n     medically necessary or appropriate for treatment or diagnose \n     to the extent that such treatment or diagnosis is otherwise a \n     covered benefit.\n  The amendment is saying that if an individual buys a policy which \nspecifies treatment for certain illnesses, the physician will be free \nto treat that patient as medically appropriate with respect to both the \ntreatment and the setting.\n  That is what physicians at the AMA meeting yesterday just voted, to \nunionize to be able to care for their patients. Why do they need to \nhave a union to achieve something which is self-evident, which is a \npart of medical training, which is the history of medicine in the \nUnited States of America, and has been the history of medicine in this \ncountry, up to the growth of managed care, which again could change and \nalter that history rather dramatically?\n  The terms ``manner'' and ``setting'' mean the location of treatment \nand the duration of treatment. That means, whether the treatment is in \nthe office or the hospital, the physician has the right to determine \nthe type of treatment and the length of, for example, the hospital \nstay. The physician would have the right to determine these things.\n  Physicians today are going to unionize in order to get that basic \nright, a right which we, the Congress, the Senate of the United States, \ncould, if we chose, give them legislatively.\n  The term ``medically necessary or appropriate'' is defined in the \namendment as a service or benefit which is consistent with generally \naccepted medical practice--a very standard definition, a very well-\naccepted definition.\n  This amendment is intended to restore the physician to medical care. \nVery simply stated, I agree with the American College of Surgeons, \nwhich said:\n\n       Any health care system or plan that removes the surgeon [or \n     doctor] and the patient from the medical decision-making \n     process only undermines the quality of the patient's care and \n     his or her health and well-being.\n\n  Our system today has done just that. And the action taken by doctors \nto unionize strongly suggests that.\n  Medical providers today are feeling kicked around, arm twisted, \n``incentivized,'' and compromised when they try to provide good care to \nsick people.\n  I am compelled to offer this amendment because I have no other \nchoice. Yes, I want to pass an agriculture appropriations bill, but I \nhave been trying for almost 3 years now to pass legislation like this \nto restore medical decisionmaking to medical professionals. As Congress \ndawdles, the complaints keep rising, people get poor care, and people \ndie.\n  Let me talk a little bit about managed care.\n  Managed care is a growing form of health insurance in America. I \nsupport managed care. I believe it can in fact be a cost-effective way \nof delivering good health care to large numbers of people. But it can't \ndo that if accountants and the ``green eyeshade'' personnel make the \ndecision for the physician. The physician has to make the decision as \nto what is appropriate medical care.\n  Today over 160 million Americans--or 75 percent of the insured \npopulation--have managed care plans. My State of California--this is \nthe reason I have decided to be so persistent--has the highest \npenetration of managed care of any state. Eighty-five percent of \ninsured Californians are in some form of managed care.\n  As managed care has grown, so have the complaints. There seems to be \na steady stream of them into my offices, and into other Congressional \noffices and in the media.\n  A Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University study found the \nfollowing:\n  First, a majority--actually 59 percent of Americans--say managed care \nplans have made it harder for people who are sick to seek medical \nspecialists.\n  Second, three out of five--61 percent--say managed care has reduced \nthe amount of time doctors can spend with patients.\n  Third, a majority of people in managed care--55 percent--say they are \nworried that if they are sick, their health plan would be more \nconcerned about saving money than about what is the best medical \ntreatment.\n  In Sacramento, a survey of managed care enrollees found that of those \nconsumers experiencing problems, the most common problems were:\n  One, delay, or denial of care, or payment, 42 percent;\n  Two, limited access to physicians, 32 percent, such as difficulty \ngetting an appointment, or limited access to specialists;\n  Three, concerns about quality of care, 11 percent, including \ninappropriate treatment, facilities, or diagnosis.\n  As managed care has grown, the pressures on doctors and other \nprofessionals to control costs have come at the expense of people's \nhealth. In other\n\n[[Page S7554]]\n\nwords, as the plans grow, the pressures on doctors to cut treatment, to \nprescribe cheaper drugs, to cut hospital stays also increase.\n  Doctors report to us that they have to spend hours on the phone with \ninsurance accountants and adjusters justifying medical decisions. That \nshould not happen. They tell me they have to provide mountains of \npaperwork documenting patients' problems. This is a real change.\n  When my father was chief of surgery at the University of California \nMedical Center, he had one secretary. He saw patients in his office at \nthe University of California. He taught surgery in the medical school. \nAnd there was very little paperwork. Today, walk into virtually any \nsurgeon's office, and there is a mound of paper, there are rooms full \nof staff, there are accountants, and there is a huge stream of \npaperwork.\n  Medicine has changed dramatically in the United States. Not all of \nthat is bad. I am the first one to say it. Many people have good \ncoverage. The problem is the cost of that coverage and whether that \ncoverage is providing for timely and appropriate diagnoses and \ntreatments, which are the finest, as Senator Kennedy said, that people \ncan expect.\n  I am also told that physicians are spending increasing time having to \nfight insurance companies that try to impose rules on their medical \npractices--rules that are not considered to be the best medical \npractice or may not even fit an individual's illness. They tell me they \nhave to exaggerate illnesses to get coverage. They tell me they have to \nstruggle to balance medical necessity against insurance company bottom \nlines.\n  One survey of California doctors by the California Medical \nAssociation found that fewer than 10 percent of doctors had good \nexperiences with managed care. That is what is leading to this \nheadline, ``AMA Votes to Unionize.'' That is what this amendment can \nchange.\n  Another study reported in the November 1998 New England Journal of \nMedicine found that 57 percent of primary care doctors in California \nfelt pressure to limit referrals, and 17 percent said that this \nactually compromised the care of their patients.\n  Doctors are trained to diagnose and treat based on the best \nprofessional medical practice. They know that every individual brings \nto their office a unique history, unique biology, and unique \nconditions. And they know that people vary tremendously. What works in \none person may not work in the next.\n  The point I am trying to make is that people vary tremendously. The \ndrug that works in one and has no side effects may work differently in \nanother person. A 70-year-old with the flu or pneumonia is very \ndifferent from a 30-year-old with the flu or pneumonia. A person with \nhigh blood pressure or anemia may need an extra day or two in the \nhospital after surgery.\n  This is why the physician should determine the treatment, the length \nof treatment, the length of hospital stay. That is what my amendment \nattempts to accomplish.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7554-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7554-S7557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS PLUS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

I find it ironic we are trying to get to a very important \nagricultural appropriations bill, and the Democratic side of the aisle \nis preventing the Senate from moving on that. Hopefully we can work out \nan agreement on these health care issues and discuss and debate them \nopenly. I look forward to the debate.\n  I find it humorous when Senator Kennedy calls our bill the ``Patient \nBill of Wrongs''. It seems that if it is not his way, it is the wrong \nway. Our bill is the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, which I think goes \nfurther in trying to encourage people to get health insurance and to \nhave coverage, rather than leading America toward a government-type \nsystem of national health care.\n  I am looking forward to the debate. I hope the agreement can be \nworked out and we can discuss the different views on health care \nreform, listen to Senator Kennedy on his Patients' Bill of Rights, and \nalso to have adequate time to fully debate the Republican plan, Senator \nNickles' bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. I think we must have \ntime to compare and contrast those two plans. I think the American \npeople are going to get a good idea where both parties stand on the \ndirection of health care and health care reform in the near future.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grams pertaining to the introduction of S. 1274 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at the \nconclusion of my remarks that the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nEdwards, be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, once again my Democratic colleagues in \nthe Senate have joined this week in a discussion of the overwhelming \nnational need for reform of managed health care. Once again, Senators \nfrom States across the Nation have shared the experiences of their \nconstituents, the frustrations of their families at being denied the \ntreatment and care through managed care for which they are paying.\n  Once again, it has been a one-sided discussion. We have been talking \nabout the need for reform of managed care while our friends and \ncolleagues across the aisle have been preventing any real debate. The \nAmerican people have waited long enough for a basic and fundamental \nreform of the managed health care system in America. We have allowed \nweeks, months and even years to pass while recognizing American \nfamilies are in jeopardy and not receiving the care they need, deserve, \nor have even paid for. There is simply no further excuse for delay.\n  During this session of the Congress, this Senate has spent 7 days \nconsidering 38 amendments on the relatively simple concept of \neducational flexibility. The Senate had 8 days available for 52 \namendments on juvenile justice; 4 days for 159 amendments on defense \nauthorization; 13 days to consider 51 amendments on the Y2K problem. \nThese were all important issues, all legitimate. But in each and every \ninstance time was not an issue; the available amendments by Members of \nthe Senate were fully considered. On this single issue, which affects \nas many or more Americans than any of these others, the Senate does not \nhave time; it cannot give its attention.\n  Like other Members of the Senate who have come to the floor to \ndiscuss the experiences of their constituencies, I want to share the \nexperience of one of mine: A young woman from Spotswood, NJ, Kristin \nBolinger. Kristin suffers from a unique condition that causes seizures \nand scoliosis, but it can be managed with proper treatment. The genius \nof medical science in America, the care of her doctors, can prevent \nthese seizures that are interrupting her life. Her family is enrolled \nin an HMO. She was denied access to a specialist, the one with the \nknowledge to treat her illness. The procedure was deemed unnecessary. \nShe was denied critical home nursing, denied physical therapy, denied \nreimbursement. The fact of the matter is, the care her parents were \npaying for, she was paying for, the benefit of the genius of American \nmedical science, was denied to her.\n  There are 161 million Americans just like Kristin, covered by managed \ncare, who simply cannot wait any longer for this Senate to find their \nproblems, the tragedies of their families, relevant. In my State, in \nNew Jersey, 3.8 million people who are part of health maintenance \norganizations have no legal protections. Like their fellow citizens \nacross America, they believe it is time for us to act. The American \npeople have been polled and 79 percent are in favor of and demand some \nreform in the management of health care in America. They believe, as I \nbelieve, that doctors, specialists, people trained to care, should be \nmaking these medical judgments; not accountants, not financial \nmanagers. People should be making decisions to provide care who know \nwhat care is required.\n  There is a lot that has changed in American health care through the \nyears. The family doctor who in the middle of the night knocked on your \ndoor to help may be gone. By necessity, it may all have changed. But we \ndo not have to abandon that one principle\n\n[[Page S7555]]\n\nthat has always been at the foundation of private health care in \nAmerica--doctors make health care decisions.\n  Mr. President, 30 percent of the American people, an extraordinary \nnumber, claim they personally know someone who needed health care, who \nhad a problem, and was denied that care although they were enrolled in \nand had paid for a managed care plan.\n\n  Here is the answer. Here is the legislation we would like to bring to \nthe Senate that addresses these problems--it is overwhelmingly \nsupported by the American people--but we are denied the opportunity to \ndo so.\n  No. 1, ensure that doctors, not the HMO, determine what is \n``medically necessary.''\n  No. 2, guarantee access to a qualified specialist for those who need \none, even if that specialist is not part of the HMO.\n  No. 3, ensure independent medical appeals for treatment denied by the \nHMO, so when you are denied treatment, there is someone else to whom \nyou can make your case to get care for yourself, your family, or your \nchild.\n  No. 4, guarantee wherever you are in America, if you need to get \naccess to an emergency room, you can get into that emergency room.\n  In sum, what this would provide is some new sense of security in \nhealth care in American life. Americans with cancer would be guaranteed \naccess to an oncologist, not just a family doctor. If their HMO denied \naccess, they could go on and appeal to ensure the right judgment was \nmade, and the oncologist, not the HMO, would decide their treatment. In \nsubstance that is what this means. This is important for all Americans.\n  Let me conclude by saying there is a category of Americans for whom \nthese reforms are the most important. Mr. President, 75 percent of all \nthe medical decisions in families in America are made by women, for \nthemselves and for their children. One of the things that is required \nin our legislation is that an OB/GYN can be a primary health care \nprovider, can make the necessary judgments on first impression. It is, \nperhaps, one of the most important reforms in the Democratic Patients' \nBill of Rights. It is overwhelmingly supported by American women. But \nwe also prohibit drive-through health procedures like mastectomies and \nguarantee access by children to pediatric specialists.\n  From American children to American women to all American families, \nthere is an overwhelming need to begin these reforms. It can be \npostponed for another year, another few years, maybe another decade. \nThe only thing the Senate guarantees by postponement is that the list \nof millions of Americans who are not getting to specialists, who are \ndenied access to emergency rooms, whose medical doctors are not allowed \nto make the ultimate determinations--that list is growing. It is \ngrowing, and so is the frustration of the American electorate.\n  I hope in this session, in this year, in this Senate, the need for a \nPatients' Bill of Rights finally comes to be recognized and accepted.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I appreciated and enjoyed the remarks of my \ndistinguished colleague from New Jersey. I come again to the Senate \nChamber to talk about what I believe is a crisis in America today, \nwhich is the issue of health care and the desperate need for a \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  If we need more glaring evidence of that, all any American needs to \ndo today is open the front page of their newspaper and find that the \nAmerican Medical Association is supporting doctors being allowed to \nform unions. Nothing can better exemplify the crisis with which we are \nconfronted.\n  Here are medical professionals, the last group anyone would imagine, \nforming a union or finding the need to form a union, who now find, in \norder to do what they believe is right--to make medical decisions about \nthe patients they care so much about, to be allowed the autonomy to \nmake those decisions and not have those decisions made by health \ninsurance bureaucrats sitting behind a computer screen or a desk \nsomewhere--it necessary to talk about the need to form unions.\n  I listened to my colleague from California earlier this morning. I \nagree with everything she said. Only the most skeptical of us would \nhave ever thought this was a possibility. The root cause for the \ndoctors' need to form a union is that they want to make medical \ndecisions about the care of their patients and, more specifically, they \nwant to decide when a procedure is medically necessary and when a \nprocedure is not.\n  If I can use two examples which I think glaringly show the problem \ndoctors in this country and patients are confronted with today, they \nare two I have mentioned before on the floor of the Senate. One \ninvolves a young man named Ethan Bedrick who developed cerebral palsy \nas a young child. One of the problems associated with cerebral palsy is \nthe development of what is called muscle contractures. We have all seen \nadults with cerebral palsy who are all balled up, their arms held up \nagainst their bodies. They have little or no control over their limbs. \nThe reason that happens is because, as children and as young adults, \nthese patients do not receive physical therapy to extend their limbs on \na regular basis to give them their best use.\n  What happened with Ethan Bedrick is every single doctor who was \ntreating him for his cerebral palsy--and there were myriad doctors--\nsaid it was absolutely essential he receive physical therapy. This was \na group of doctors who had seen him every day and was responsible for \nhis care.\n  Then some insurance company doctor, sitting behind the desk looking \nat a piece of paper, who had never seen Ethan Bedrick, never examined \nhim and, I will add, unlike all the doctors who were treating him, had \nabsolutely no expertise in treating kids with cerebral palsy or the \nissue of physical therapy for those kids, made the decision this was \nnot medically necessary. Therefore, the insurance company decided it \nwas not going to pay for any physical therapy for this boy.\n  After some 2 odd years of going to court and going through a lot of \nlitigation procedures which absolutely should never have been \nnecessary, the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals determined the \nobvious, which is that the treating doctors were correct, that Ethan \ndesperately needed this physical therapy for the purpose of keeping him \nfrom becoming like so many adults with cerebral palsy who we have seen \nall balled up and unable to control their limbs in any way.\n\n  They reversed the insurance company decision and said they had to \nprovide this treatment. It took over a year after that decision before \nthe insurance company actually began to do something.\n  It is a perfect example of insurance company bureaucrats and \naccountants making health care decisions. That is the reason doctors \nfeel the need to unionize, so they can make these decisions instead of \ninsurance companies.\n  A second example is a man named Steve Grissom from Cary, NC, who \ndeveloped leukemia as a young man. As a result of his leukemia, he had \na blood transfusion. During the course of his blood transfusion, he \nacquired AIDS. He became sicker and sicker with his AIDS to the point a \npulmonary specialist, a leading authority in the world at Duke \nUniversity Medical Center, prescribed oxygen for him 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week.\n  What happened was during the time he was being treated, his HMO was \nproviding coverage for him because the pulmonary specialist, the real \nexpert, determined it was necessary. Then his employer changed HMOs. \nThe new HMO--again with some person sitting behind a desk somewhere, \nnot a medical doctor--decided based on a chart that he did not quite \nmeet the numbers for oxygen saturation that were necessary and, \ntherefore, cut off all coverage for the oxygen that his world-renowned \nspecialist had ordered for him.\n  Now Steve is working desperately--in fact, he is coming to Washington \nthis week to see me and other Senators--to pay for the oxygen that \nkeeps him alive. It is one of the reasons he is alive and able to be \nwith his family, which he loves and cherishes so much.\n  These are terrific examples of what is fundamentally wrong with our \nhealth care system in this country today. The judgments of what is \nmedically necessary have to be made by people who are trained to do it. \nThey have to be made by doctors who are seeing the patients, who have \nthe clinical judgment to make those determinations.\n\n[[Page S7556]]\n\n  It is critically important for our doctors to do their job. It is \ncritically important for the children, adults, and families they treat. \nIn our Patients' Bill of Rights, we specifically provide that doctors \nmake those decisions. Our opponents' bill does not do that, and that is \nwhy the bills are so dramatically different.\n  One last thing I want to mention is the issue of financial incentives \nthat are sometimes created in HMO contracts either explicitly or \nimplicitly. I know specifically of an example in North Carolina where a \nmother was in labor. The doctor who was responsible for taking care of \nher had too many patients to care for. As a result of complications \nduring labor, she needed her doctor. The nurse called for the doctor. \nThe doctor did not come. She did not understand why.\n  The reason was the doctor had other patients he could not leave. \nInstead of calling for a backup, the doctor continued to allow this \nwoman to labor with her complications without a doctor by her bedside.\n  The result of this was a child born severely brain injured. We later \nlearned the reason this is done, the reason no backup doctor is called \nis because there is enormous pressure, financial and otherwise, put on \nthese physicians by the HMO, by the health insurance company, not to \ncall a backup doctor because it costs them money. It costs the health \ninsurance company and the HMO money, and, further, that they can \nactually receive bonuses if they prescribe the least expensive \ntreatment for patients, no matter what the patient needs, and if they \nfail to call backup doctors even though one may be needed. In other \nwords, the HMOs have been putting doctors in the position of having to \nprovide the cheapest treatment, not call other medical personnel who \nare necessary, solely so they could save a dollar.\n\n  These things are what are fundamentally wrong with the way health \ncare is being conducted in this country today. There is a fundamental \ndifference between our bill and our opponents' bill. Our bill \nspecifically provides that these kinds of financial incentives are \nabsolutely prohibited; they cannot occur. Our opponents' bill is silent \non that issue.\n  We cannot continue to allow the American people to be subjected to \nthis. It is the reason we have this crisis. It has gotten to crisis \nproportions because we have gone this long and done nothing about it. \nMedical care should be about patients and not about profits.\n  I say this, in a most nonpartisan way, to my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, for whom I have tremendous respect and who I know want to \ndo the right thing for the people they represent and the American \npeople.\n  This is not a partisan issue for me. It was an important issue to me \nin being elected to the Senate. It is an issue I want to talk about \nwhile I am here. But I want to talk about it in an ongoing, meaningful \ndialogue. I am not interested in fighting about it. I am not interested \nin political bickering. What I am really interested in is what is done \nin the best interests of the people of North Carolina and what is in \nthe best interests of the people of America.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate on an \nissue regarding an amendment which we have recently passed on this \nfloor: U.S. policy toward India and Pakistan. I want to address the \nSenate on that issue.\n  We passed an amendment on a defense appropriations bill that would \nallow the President to waive certain sanctions we have against India \nand Pakistan and also suspend economic sanctions we have against India \nand Pakistan. That passed this body and has gone over to the House. \nThis is something the House is going to be considering, and it is \nimportant U.S. policy in a number of regards.\n  Our relationship toward India has been one where we have been willing \nto sanction them rapidly and readily, in spite of the fact that they \nare a democracy and we share a number of institutional values and we \nhave worked together sometimes in the past. But it seems as if we are \nvery willing to sanction them. Yet, at the same time, we are willing to \ngo toward China and say: China, you may steal our weapons technology, \nyou may have human rights abuses, you may be shipping weapons of mass \ndestruction to countries that are opposed to our interests; you have \nforced-abortion policies in place. Yet we are going to overlook all of \nthose things because we want to have a good, open relationship with \nyou, a good trade relationship. But, India, you tested here and you \nbroke into these areas, so we are going to put economic sanctions on \nyou, put these other sanctions on you, and we are going to hit you \nhard. It is the same with Pakistan.\n  I think we have the wrong policies in place, and I don't understand \nit. I want to draw that to the attention of my colleagues because it \nappears as if we are putting these on with different balances, that we \nare saying in the case of China we are going to overlook the problems, \noverlook the situation, all these abuses, and with India we are going \nto smack you no matter what you do. They have a democracy, a vibrant \ndemocracy and a free press. The same with Pakistan, as far as their \nissues go, but we are willing to hit them so hard.\n  So I don't understand why we are doing that, why the Clinton \nPresidency looks at the two countries differently, and lets China get \naway with virtually anything, if you look at the record that has built \nup over a period of time. Toward India, we say we are going to smack \nyou.\n  Senator Roberts and I have put forward an amendment that has passed \nthis body and is going to the House. It\n\n[[Page S7558]]\n\nwould suspend these sanctions, the economic sanctions, toward India and \nPakistan.\n  I think it is high time that the United States aggressively build its \nrelationship with India and aggressively build its relationship with \nPakistan. We need to do this. We need to have a broad-based \nrelationship and not one that just has very narrow sanctions associated \nwith it. For instance, as well, the administration is pushing that to \nlift these sanctions on India, they are telling the Indian Government, \nbasically, they have to agree to CTBT, the Conventional Test Ban \nTreaty, in spite of the fact that the Senate may never pick this up. \nThey are saying unless they agree to this, we are not going to lift \nthese sanctions. It is a very narrow discussion point that they have \nwith India, instead of having this broad-based discussion about how can \nwe expand trade relationships, expand diplomatic relationships, and \nwork together on issues of key concern.\n  We should be asking: How can we expand relationships in the broad set \nof fields that we have? Instead, it is they have to agree to the CTBT, \nor we are not going to lift these economic sanctions on them, period. \nThat is too narrow of a relationship for us to build with a great \nnation. India will be the largest nation in the world in the next 10 \nyears, population-wise. It has an extraordinarily large middle class. \nIt has a number of people in a very poor situation, as well, but it has \na large middle class.\n  Look also at Pakistan. It is in the amendment where we suspend \neconomic sanctions for 5 years and have a waiver on others. Pakistan \nsits in a difficult spot, right next to Afghanistan. They have had a \nlot of problems with Afghanistan. Pakistan seeks to be a friend of the \nUnited States. It is partly, obviously, an Islamic country and has been \na key ally of ours in defeating the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. After \nAfghanistan, the Soviets backed off and we pulled out altogether. We \nnot only sanctioned them under the Glenn amendment, we also had the \nPressler amendment that basically removed our relationship with \nPakistan, an Islamic country that seeks to be our friend, and we just \nnail them.\n  It makes no sense to me why we do these sorts of things, and why the \nPresident, the Clinton administration, seeks to sanction a country that \nseeks to work with us, and closely with us, while with China we have \nhad all this theft of technology, shipment of weapons of mass \ndestruction, all the human rights abuses, and we are willing to look \nthe other way.\n\n  I think we ought to have trade relationships with China. I think it \nis important that we have a broad-based relationship with China. But at \nthe same time we need to be expanding our relationships with India and \nPakistan. These are countries--particularly in India's case--that share \na lot of our traditions. I think it is wrong for us to have a double \nstandard, particularly against a country that should be a very valuable \nfuture partner.\n  I chair the Foreign Relations subcommittee that deals with both India \nand Pakistan, and it has been beyond me to understand the difference in \nU.S. policy toward these giant Asian countries. I think it is wrong of \nthe administration to have this different policy. I think we really \nneed to be much more aggressive and engaged and be a vibrant, broad-\nbased partner with India. I think it can be a good future relationship. \nIt is something we can use as an offset toward China, in some respects, \nand our large dependency on China. I think it can be a future growth \nmarket for States such as mine and many others that have agricultural \nand aircraft products that we export. I think it can be a growing, \nvibrant market for us, one that shares a lot of our relationships and \nviews and needs.\n  I wanted to bring to the attention of my colleagues what is really \nhappening in foreign policy. We also had a hearing yesterday on the \nissue of Iraq. I wanted to mention this tangentially because I think it \nis appropriate. We had people testifying from the Iraqi National \nCongress--a representative of the INC, Mr. Chalabi--and we had other \nwitnesses testifying that Saddam Hussein is probably at his weakest \npoint since the United States was engaged with Iraq. They are having \ndaily reports of insurrection in the southern part of Iraq, and the \nnorthern part of the country is no longer in the control of Saddam \nHussein.\n  There are other factions that are controlling much of this Kurdish \nregion. Yet the United States, in the Iraq liberation, provided $97 \nmillion of drawdown authority and support for the opposition movement, \nand all we are giving the opposition movement is file cabinets and fax \nmachines. Why aren't we really supporting this opposition movement that \nseeks to meet inside Iraq to set up more of a civil society in the \nregion that Saddam doesn't control? Why aren't we really supporting \nthese guys?\n  I asked the administration witness yesterday--Under Secretary Beth \nJones, a bright and good person--Do you think Saddam Hussein is going \nto outlast another U.S. President? Is he going to outlast President \nClinton?\n  She says: I really don't know.\n  I said we know how to aggressively push and prosecute these issues in \nKosovo. Why is it that we can't do this in Iraq? Why can't we support \nthe opposition groups and give them lethal and nonlethal assistance \nthat we can find truly necessary? Why can't we help them have a meeting \nof the Iraqi National Congress inside Iraq where they want to meet? It \nwould send a powerful statement across the world that the INC, a \npotential opposition government, is meeting within Iraq.\n  Yet the administration is not willing to step forward and is saying \nthey are not so sure about whether or not we should do this. We are \nwilling to give the opposition file cabinets and fax machines, but we \nwon't give them training and lethal technology or the ability to fight. \nThis is an extraordinary situation. It is one on which the Congress \nneeds to speak out more.\n\n  We need to aggressively move forward now on Saddam Hussein. We need \nto do that by supporting the opposition. This isn't about sending in \nU.S. troops. This is about supporting an opposition that wants to fight \nwith Saddam Hussein, that wants to put the parts together to have a \ndemocratic Iraq, that wants to be an ally--not just that but wants the \nIraqi people to be proud of and pleased with their government, instead \nof constantly harassed and killed by their leadership.\n  Why on earth are we not pushing this and stepping forward and being \nmore aggressive? I fail to get adequate answers from the Clinton \nadministration on why. We know how to push forward aggressively on \nKosovo. Why can't we deal in such a manner with Iraq? We know how to \nbuild a relationship with China. Why can't we build relationships with \nIndia and Pakistan? I really don't understand what is taking place. I \nask these questions, and we are going to continue to hold hearings on \nthese issues. We need to move forward in building a better relationship \nwith India and Pakistan and dealing with the situation in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I am here to take a couple of minutes to\n\n[[Page S7559]]\n\npoint out a success story that appeared in the Lincoln Journal Star.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Lincoln Journal Star, June 23, 1999]\n\n                       Reading Scores Rise Again\n\n                           (By Joanne Young)\n\n       Right before his eyes, Steven Hladik saw his daughter's \n     life change.\n       ``She's just happy. She went from being a sad little girl \n     to totally loving life,'' Hladik said of his third youngest \n     child, Nikyle, 6.\n       He attributes the change to Reading Recovery, one program \n     Lincoln Public Schools has used to improve first-graders' \n     reading skills. A dramatic decline over 15 years in reading \n     scores of elementary- and middle-school students prompted LPS \n     to focus on bringing those scores up.\n       Metropolitan Achievement Test reading scores are up for the \n     second straight year for grades 2-8, according to a report to \n     the Lincoln Board of Education. This snapshot of 1999 \n     achievement showed that since 1997, second-graders have \n     improved 16 percent. Third-graders are up 12 percent, fourth- \n     and fifth-graders up 8 percent. Only ninth-grade scores have \n     held about the same.\n       Math scores, which had declined along with reading scores, \n     are up in all grades, with six of eight grades working at 70 \n     percent or better of their peers nationwide.\n       LPS Associate Superintendent Marilyn Moore delivered the \n     good news Tuesday at a school board meeting.\n       Board member Shirley Doan said the improvements came \n     because of commitment by teachers, principals and students.\n       ``I think we have giants standing on the shoulders of \n     giants here,'' Doan said. ``Can we do it again? It would be \n     very unusual, but I think we can.''\n       About the same number of students were tested in 1998 and \n     1999. More special education and English as a Second Language \n     students were given accommodations this year, such as more \n     test time and help with instructions. But a second analsis of \n     '98 and '99 scores that excluded all special education and \n     ESL students verified that scores improved, Moore said.\n       Leslie Lukin, LPS assessment specialist, pointed to several \n     reasons for the reading improvement: Teachers have changed \n     the way they teach reading in kindergarten through third \n     grade, with different teaching plans for each grade. They \n     also are familiarizing students with the format and type of \n     questions on the achievement tests.\n       But Reading Recovery may have produced the most dramatic \n     results.\n       Aimed at the 20 percent of first graders having the hardest \n     time learning to read, the program offers one-on-one help \n     with letters, sounds, sentence structure and reading methods. \n     Kids spend half an hour a day with Reading Recovery teachers \n     and special books. Then they read at home with parents.\n       Jeanette Tiwarld, the LPS Reading Recovery teacher leader \n     said Reading Recovery builds on children's strengths--what \n     they already know--to accelerate their learning and improve \n     their confidence.\n       The number of children in the program have gone up as more \n     teachers have taken the rigorous Reading Recovery training \n     and more schools have added the curriculum. In the 1994 \n     school year, 78 children passed through the full program. \n     Last year, the number jumped to 527.\n       Questionnaires from parents of this year's Reading Recovery \n     students sang the praises of the program. Their children were \n     much more confident, they said, far happier after catching up \n     with their schoolmates in reading.\n       For Nikyle, it was a godsend.\n       She had changed schools three times in kindergarten, just \n     as she was starting to learn, because her mom and dad were \n     splitting up, her dad said. She started first grade at McPhee \n     Elementary and then when her father got custody of her and \n     three brothers and sisters, she moved to Calvert Elementary.\n       All the while, because of everything going on in his own \n     life, Steven, Hladik didn't realize the effect on Nikyle. She \n     was being in learning, and she was miserable.\n       ``She hated to go to school. It was hard to get her up and \n     make her go,'' her father said. ``She was insecure and really \n     quite.''\n       Now she loves school. And her confidence has soared.\n       Not only has her reading improved so have her math and \n     other subjects, her friendships, her self-esteem.\n       She's making sure what happened to her doesn't happen to \n     her 4-year-old sister, Stephanie.\n       ``Every night she sits and reads books to her,'' her father \n     said.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this is about the success of a Federally \nfunded program that was implemented by heroic people in Lincoln, NE--\nthey include principals, schoolteachers, and the Lincoln school board. \nI am talking about Title I. One of the reasons I talk about it a great \ndeal is that, in Nebraska, there are 17,000 students that are eligible \nfor Title I, but because we don't appropriate enough money, they are \nnot funded. They don't get the benefits of this kind of effort.\n  What this article talks about is a program called Reading Recovery \nthat has been implemented in the Lincoln public school system over the \nlast 3 years--and it's a very rigorous program. The teachers had to \ntrain themselves; they had to make a commitment to acquire the skills \nnecessary to implement this program. The article starts off with a \nparent talking about the exhilaration of seeing his daughter learn how \nto read and make progress--be successful, in other words. What they \nhave done is quite remarkable. It needs to be observed because citizens \nneed to know that success indeed is possible.\n  Second graders have improved their reading scores 16 percent; third \ngraders, 12 percent; fourth and fifth graders are up 8 percent. These \nare dramatic increases. They have achieved the increases by starting at \na very early age, using Title I moneys, using this Reading Recovery \nprogram, and going after young people who are at risk, who are falling \nbehind, who have come into the school system without these reading \nskills.\n  They have said if you want to lift the overall test scores, quite \ncorrectly, you have to help those who are most likely to fail if we \ndon't intervene. That is what Title I is. It is not the Federal \nGovernment telling these local schools what to do. We recently passed \nan Ed-Flex bill that provided increased flexibility. I support that. \nBut unless we provide resources, it is impossible for local heroes to \ntake the money and make something of it.\n  I will point out, in addition to the necessity of an early effort, an \nadditional challenge we face. It's explained in one little paragraph \nhere. Those of us born in 1943 sort of remember schools in the 1950s \nand 1960s and think, gee, why can't we do it the way we did it? Things \nhave changed. In this article, one little paragraph says the following \nabout this young girl who was given the benefit of this program:\n\n       She had changed schools three times in kindergarten, just \n     as she was starting to learn, because her mom and dad were \n     splitting up, her dad said.\n\n  She ended up caught in the middle of a custody battle, a transfer \noccurred, and as a consequence of the transfer, she fell behind. That \nis what happened. What Title I enabled her to do was catch up. It is \nquite a miraculous thing that happened as a consequence, as I said, of \nsignificant local commitment and the help of teachers who trained \nthemselves and a principal who was committed. One of the principals is \nDeann Currin at Elliott Elementary. The Lincoln school board supported \nReading Recovery. They used title I money. Again, it is not the Federal \nGovernment telling them what to do, but providing them the resources.\n  I regret to say that in Nebraska, there are 17,000 children eligible \nfor Title I programs that simply are not able to benefit because we are \nnot providing a sufficient amount of resources.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator Kerrey \nfor talking about children and education. It is truly a good news/bad \nnews story. The good news is we have heroes and heroines right in our \nown communities that, with these resources, can really give children a \nchance to develop their full potential. If there is anything we should \ndo as a Senate, it is to make sure each child has that chance. The bad \nnews is, I say to my colleague, in Minnesota so many students could be \nhelped, but we don't have the resources. There are schools in Minnesota \nwith up to a 65-student population that don't receive a cent because by \nthe time it is allocated in the cities, the schools aren't eligible, \nand those kids don't receive the help. It is just as big an issue in \nrural areas.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this is not a situation where we don't \nknow what to do. This is a situation where there is an answer and we \nsimply are not doing it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct. This is really just harping on the \ncomplexity of it all is the ultimate simplification. We know what to \ndo, and it\n\n[[Page S7560]]\n\nhas worked.

Mr. President, my understanding is that we have not \nreached an agreement with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nabout how we can have a serious, substantive, and important debate \nabout health care, about patient protection in our country. The latest \nproposal as I understand it from the Republicans basically would amount \nto Democrats having an opportunity to maybe introduce four amendments. \nThat would be it. Again, I challenge my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, as I said yesterday, to debate this.\n  The evidence is irrefutable and irreducible: When it comes to who is \ncovered, the Republican plan covers 48 million people, the Democratic \nplan covers 163 million people. That is a huge difference.\n  Republicans argue that we rely on States for the coverage, once we \ndeal with what is called the ERISA problem. Our argument is that a \nchild, a family, regardless of where the child lives, where the family \nlives--be it Mississippi or Minnesota--ought to have some protection. \nPeople ought to have the right, or the assurance, that if their child \nhas a serious illness, they will be able to have access to the best \ncare. That assurance for a family should extend to all citizens in our \ncountry. It shouldn't be based upon what different States decide or \nwhere a family lives.\n  I repeat, 163 million people with some protection versus 48 million \npeople. It is no wonder my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ndon't want to debate patient protection.\n  In the Health Committee, where we wrote this bill, I had an amendment \nthat dealt with the Republican ``gag'' clause. This amendment would \nprohibit retaliation by a health plan when a doctor advocates for a \npatient. There were two parts: First, it said that plans can't penalize \ndoctors who advocate for patients during an appeal process; and, \nsecond, it protected licensed and certified health care professionals \nfrom retaliation if they reported some problems with the actual quality \nof care being provided in a hospital or by a plan. Presenting this \ninformation to a regulatory authority or private accreditation \norganization is called whistleblower protection. This amendment was \ndefeated, I think, on an 10-8 vote. It is no wonder the Republicans in \nthe Senate don't want to debate patient protection.\n  The front page story today says doctors are going to unionize. The \nAmerican Medical Association announces doctors are going to unionize. \nNo wonder, when doctors don't have protection if they advocate for a \npatient during an appeal process, when one of these managed care plans, \nowned by one these insurance companies practicing bottom-line medicine, \nand the bottom line is the only line, and the plan decides the patient \nis not going to be able to see a pediatrician who specializes in \noncology.\n  If a child is ill with cancer and that family makes an appeal, if the \ndoctor is there for that family and says, yes, that child needs to see \nthis expert, there is no protection in the Republican plan. There is no \nwhistleblower protection for doctors who say, I have to speak out, I \nhave to say this plan, or this hospital, is not providing the kind of \ncare that people deserve. I don't blame my Republican colleagues for \nnot wanting to debate patient protection.\n  This chart shows whether or not you will have guaranteed access to \nspecialists. The Republican plan has a little bit of access; the \nDemocrats' plan makes it clear that people will have access.\n  When it gets to the question of who is going to define medical \nnecessity--that is a critical issue--we make it clear that the provider \ndefines medical necessity, not a 1-800 number you call where you have \nutilization review by people not necessarily qualified, working for \ninsurance companies that are just trying to keep costs down.\n  When it comes to the issue of choice of doctor, points-of-service \noption, being able to find a doctor outside your plan, and making sure \nyour child who needs to see that doctor can see that doctor, we are \nclear: Families should have that option. The Republican plan doesn't \nsupport that. No wonder they don't want to debate.\n\n  When it comes to whistleblower protection for providers who advocate \nfor their patients to make sure they don't lose their jobs, the \nRepublican plan doesn't provide the protection. The Democrat plan does. \nNo wonder my colleagues don't want to debate.\n  When it comes to the concerns and circumstances of women's lives vis-\na-vis a health care system that has not been terribly sensitive and \nresponsive to women, or with special emphasis on children and access to \npediatric services, or making sure that people who struggle with mental \nhealth problems or substance abuse problems are not ``defined'' out and \nare not discriminated against, I don't see the protection in the \nRepublican plan. We try to make sure there is that protection.\n  These are two plans, two proposals, two pieces of legislation where \nthe differences make a difference.\n  I say one more time to my Republican colleagues, I have been trying \nto engage people in debate for 2 days. I will yield for any Senator who \nwants to debate, on my time, so I can ask questions. That is what we \nshould be about. The Senate should be about deliberation and debate. It \nshouldn't be about delay and delay and delay and delay.\n  It may be that we will not get the patient protection legislation on \nthe floor today, Thursday, but we will get this legislation on the \nfloor. We will continue to bring up these problems that the people we \nrepresent have with this health care system right now. We will continue \nas Senators to advocate for families, to advocate for consumers, to \nadvocate for children, to advocate for women, to advocate for good \nhealth care for people.\n  If I had my way, the Democratic Party would be out here on the floor \nalso calling for universal health care coverage. We will get there. At \nthe very minimum, let's make sure there is decent protection for \nconsumers.\n  I say to my colleagues, I have carefully examined your patient \nprotection act. I think it is the insurance company protection act. We \nwent through this in committee. We went through the debate in \ncommittee. I see a piece of legislation that pretends to provide \nprotection for people, but once we have the debate and once we get into \nspecifics, I think people in the country are going to be furious. They \nwill say, don't present us with a piece of legislation with a great \ntitle and a great acronym that has no teeth in it, that has no \nenforcement in it, and that will not provide the protection we need.\n  That is why the majority party, the Republican Party in the Senate, \ndoesn't want to debate this. Republicans in the Senate right now--I \nhope this will change--do not want to have to come to the floor and \ndebate amendments. They don't want to have to argue why they don't \ncover a third of the eligible people. They don't want to have to argue \nwhy they don't want to make sure families have access to specialized \nservices. They don't want to argue why they don't want to provide \ndoctors with whistleblower protection. They don't want to argue a whole \nlot of issues that deal with patient protection.\n  When you want to debate is when you really believe you are right. \nWhen you want to debate is when you really think you have a piece of \nlegislation that will lead to the improvement of lives of people. When \nyou want to debate is when you have a piece of legislation that is \nconsistent with the words you speak and you know you are not trying to \nfool anybody; you know it is authentic; you know it is real.\n  When you don't want to debate, I say to my Republican colleagues, is \nwhen you have a whole set of propositions you cannot defend. When you \ndon't want to debate is when you know in the light of day, with real \ndebate, with people challenging you, you can't defend your proposal. \nWhen you don't want to debate is when you are worried\n\n[[Page S7561]]\n\nyou will get into trouble with the people in the country because you \nhaven't done the job.\n  That is what is going on.\n  One final time, I come to the floor of the Senate to urge my \nRepublican colleagues to be willing to debate this question.\n  Let me make a connection to what Senator Kerrey said earlier, because \nit is so important to me. If there is anything we should be about as \nSenators, it should be about focusing on good education, opportunities \nfor children, good health care for people, making sure families don't \nfall between the cracks. These are the issues that people talk about \nall the time in our States. That is what we ought to be focusing on \nright now.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMinnesota for his remarks today on the subject of health care and HMO \nreform, and particularly his strong advocacy for what has become known \nas the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I would like to report to my colleagues in the Senate the most recent \nKaiser Family Foundation/Harvard University survey reports that \nproblems with managed care are, indeed, growing and that Americans are \nincreasingly worried about how their health care plan will treat them. \nThe survey found that in 1998 as many as 115 million Americans either \nhad a problem or knew someone who had a problem with a managed care \nplan.\n  A number of provisions have been included in the Patients' Bill of \nRights to maintain the sanctity of the provider-patient relationship, \nbasically known as the doctor-patient relationship. We used to think \nthat was sacrosanct. Unfortunately, it is not today under many HMO \nplans. Health plans frequently impose restrictions on that relationship \nby taking it upon themselves to determine the most appropriate \ntreatment. These determinations are often made on the basis of costs \nrather than what is in the patient's best interest. The fact that \nhealth plans are now making medical decisions that were traditionally \nmade by the treating physician really causes me great concern. I think \nit concerns a number of Members of this body.\n  If health plans continue to arbitrarily define medical necessity, \npatients will be ultimately denied the health care they were promised. \nIn this HMO debate, this debate on reforming health maintenance \norganizations, I do not think there is any more pressing issue than \nensuring that patients are protected against the practice of some \nhealth plans of having insurance bureaucrats determining medical \nnecessity rather than trained physicians. I think that is an incredible \nabuse of the system. I think it is terrible when we treat people based \non financial necessity rather than medical considerations.\n  Health plans, I don't think, should interfere with decisions of \ntreating physicians when those decisions concern a covered benefit that \nis medically necessary, according to that physician, and appropriate \nbased on generally accepted practices and standards of professional \nmedical practice. It seems to me that is common sense.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights protects the sanctity of the doctor-\npatient relationship by allowing physicians, not accountants, to make \nmedical necessity determinations. I think that is critical. In \naddition, some managed care organizations use improper financial \nincentives to pressure doctors to actually deny care to their \npatients--incredible. The Patients' Bill of Rights, I think, will go a \nlong way to stopping this practice.\n  I would like to share one personal experience. I am glad that when I \nwas wounded in Vietnam I was not covered by a HMO. I am glad I was \ncovered by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. I could \nsee myself laying there after the grenade went off, trying to call an \ninsurance bureaucrat, being told my conditions were not covered by what \nwas in the plan and, second, I was not cost effective.\n  I am afraid more and more Americans are experiencing that, which is \nwhy I personally support the Patients' Bill of Rights. Many of my \ncolleagues do as well.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this important issue in the \nSenate. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7561-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7561-S7563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk for a few minutes \nabout agriculture appropriations. That is the bill that is before us. \nIt is one I believe is particularly important. But I want to talk, \nreally, about the need for us to be doing the necessary work of the \nCongress to be moving forward with our appropriations bills to keep the \nGovernment operating. These are the things we have before us. We have \nto pass 13 bills before this Congress is adjourned, before the 30th of \nSeptember. We have to do this to keep the operations of the Government \nmoving, particularly in the area of agriculture where we are having one \nof the toughest times we have had in the economics of agriculture, all \nover the country. It has been very difficult. Of course the \nappropriations bill for agriculture will be there to help. There will \nbe other things done as well, but this is the basic effort we will have \nto make.\n  I am very sorry to say our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave seen fit to delay this bill by using stalling tactics and bringing \nup unrelated amendments that have caused us not to be able to move \nforward. This is not a question of which issue is most important. We \nbelieve, with all of these issues, it is a question of an orderly \nprocess of moving forward to do the things that we have to do to \naccomplish our assignments.\n  I am sorry to say we are not able to do our job. It has been derailed \nby what I believe is simply an effort to bring partisan political \nissues to this debate which really do not have a place in this \nsituation.\n  One, we need to move forward with the appropriations bills; there is \nno question about that. Two, we are dealing with patients' rights, \nwhich we have dealt with before and with which we continue to deal. It \nis not a question of being willing to do it. We have a Republican bill \nfor patients' rights.\n  Are there some disagreements, some differences? Of course. We have \nbeen talking about this for more than a year. It is completely \ninappropriate to bring it up now and use it as a stalling tactic.\n  The unfortunate part is this is not the first time we have had it \nhappen. We had it happen just 2 weeks ago when we were talking about \nSocial Security, and we were unable to move forward with the lockbox \nlegislation. We are finding an unusual amount of disruption in moving \nforward with the business of this Congress.\n  I commend the Subcommittee on Agriculture Appropriations for their \nhard work in putting this bill together. The lion's share of funding, \n$47 billion, is designated for mandatory programs. Domestic food \nprograms, food stamps, and child nutrition programs account for more \nthan half of the agriculture appropriations bill.\n  Certainly, the subcommittee faced difficult challenges in crafting \nthis bill. Industry is struggling. The requests for financial \nassistance are escalating. Those types of things are very real, and we \nare prepared to deal with them. All we need to do is have the \nopportunity to move forward.\n  Unfortunately, the stalling tactics have stopped us. For those of us \nwho are primarily from agricultural States, passage of this bill is \nfundamental to our economy and fundamental to those agricultural \nproducers.\n  Recently, I heard several of my colleagues describe the financial \nproblems in agriculture, and I do not disagree with any of them. We are \nfeeling those in my State of Wyoming.\n  I am very frustrated we cannot take action on a bill because it has \nbeen bogged down. We should focus on this bill. We should get this one \ndone. We can do it. There is general agreement on it. We can deal with \nthe disagreements and move forward.\n\n[[Page S7562]]\n\n  There are a number of programs in this agriculture bill that are \nparticularly important. In addition to the domestic food programs, it \ncontains funding for activities that are essential to an industry that \nemploys more people in this country than any other industry, and that \nis agricultural producers. It has to do with land grant universities. \nIt has to do with our rural citizens.\n  Of particular importance to Wyoming, a State where 50 percent of the \nState belongs to the Federal Government and is managed by the BLM and \nForest Service, there are funds for predator management which is \nparticularly important, even important in places like Hawaii. It has to \ndo with decreasing livestock losses and crop losses. It has to do with \nresearch and extension.\n  We have the most efficient agriculture in the world because we have \nhad land grant colleges and we have had the extension service. We have \nbeen able to produce more efficiently than anyone else. It is one of \nthe largest exports we have.\n  There are conservation initiatives. Mr. President, $800 million is \nprovided in this bill to assist farmers and ranchers to be stewards of \nthe land, to be environmental stewards, to reduce soil erosion, to \nreduce nonpoint water pollution. The list of positive programs in this \nbill goes on and on.\n  For food safety, there is $638 million, an increase of $24 million \nover the fiscal year 1999 level.\n  Also in the bill are agricultural credit programs--the Presiding \nOfficer is one of the experts with a background in agriculture and has \nworked on this problem--loan authorization for rural housing, and \nassistance for rural communities to develop waste disposal and solid \nwaste management programs.\n  To brush this off and say we have other things to do, we should not \nundertake to deal with this agricultural appropriations, is distressing \nto me. I want us to move forward with it.\n  It is important, of course, not only to producers but to all of us as \ncitizens of this country when we talk about safe food.\n  When we are finally able to debate the agriculture appropriations \nbill, there will be numerous amendments, as there should be. Some will \nbe controversial which will further delay the passage of the bill.\n  We ought to also keep in mind that in order to go forward with the \nprograms of this country, we need to move forward. We have about four \nappropriations bills that have been passed. Our goal should be to pass \nat least 11 of them by the end of July. We do not want to find \nourselves in this business of having political problems that shut down \nthe Government, as we did several years ago, and trying to blame each \nother.\n  Instead, we ought to move forward and do the things we ought to be \ndoing. We have a process and we ought to move forward with it. There is \nmuch to be done, and I urge my colleagues to end their tactics of \nderailing and allow us to move forward on this very important spending \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, is the Senate still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The majority has 9 \nminutes and approximately 30 seconds. The minority has 5 minutes 5 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Wyoming who has \nexpressed a frustration that I think many of us in the Senate hold and \nthat a growing number of Americans hold as to the current tactic being \nused by Democrats to block an ag appropriations bill or to force an \nissue that is separate and apart from it.\n  We do have a responsibility in the Senate and in the Congress, and \nthat is to pass 13 appropriations bills on an annual basis to fund the \nworkings of our Government. And the one before us today is agriculture.\n  There is some $60 billion to be spent in many of the areas outlined \nby the Senator from Wyoming. They are critical to all our States, not \njust the agricultural community but for those people who are less \nfortunate, for their very nutrition--nutrition for women, infants and \nchildren, the Food Stamp Program, certainly the School Lunch Program. \nAll of those programs are embodied in this appropriations bill. A \ntactic to push what now rapidly appears to be a raw political point for \nthe purpose of upcoming campaigns against the normal and necessary \nworkings of our Government is a bit frustrating to me.\n  I have made that assumption at this moment. Let's assume that I am \nwrong, that clearly the other side is dedicated to a concern on the \npart of the average citizen as it relates to his or her health care, \nand in being so concerned they have offered a Kennedy bill that some \ncall a Patients' Bill of Rights. If I take it at face value, it is a \nbit of a frustration, and in the next few moments let me express that.\n  Chairman Patrick Kennedy in the House, a Democrat, of the \nCongressional Campaign Committee, was recently quoted and the national \nmedia is saying that ``we have written off rural areas.'' He means that \nDemocrats politically have written off rural areas.\n  Is it by coincidence the Senator from Massachusetts chooses the ag \nbill on which to place his political agenda? There seems to be a unique \ncoincidence that Patrick Kennedy, Congressman Kennedy on the other \nside, says, ``We have written off rural areas,'' and Senator Kennedy on \nthis side says, ``I'm going to attach it to the ag approps bill; I'll \nbring the ag bill down if I can't have my political agenda for a \nPatients' Bill of Rights.''\n  Let me look at the substance of what may be offered today, because it \nis my understanding that there may be an attempt, in an amendment, to \noffer a portion of the Kennedy health care mandates.\n  What would that do? That talks about what we now call medical \nnecessities. It is a portion of the bill that I think offers the \nillusion of the patients being in control, by requiring health care \nplans and employers to pay for whatever care a physician recommends--\nwithout question. If that is what the physician recommends, without \npeer review or any observation of the total situation, it is paid for.\n  If that were the case, in today's medical climate, here is the \nreaction of the Barnitz Group. Who are they? They are an economic \nconsulting firm that deals with health care and health care costs. They \nevaluate them. They make judgments as to how a given policy would \naffect the payment for health care for the individual.\n  Here is what they suggest this particular portion of the Kennedy bill \nwould do. It could cost nearly $60 a year per covered household, per \ninsured household. It could cost employers $180 a year per covered \nemployee. In other words, it shoves the cost of health care up. \nArguably, it might improve health care--I cannot debate that--by \nrequiring that anything a doctor suggests gets funded. But it would \ncost more, or at least that is the observation.\n  In that cost--this is a marketplace we are dealing with out here--it \ncould result in the loss of 191,000 jobs or it could result in the \ncancellation of coverage for 1.4 million Americans. That is a provision \nin an amendment that might be offered this afternoon.\n  Isn't it unique--I made some of this argument yesterday--that as we \ndeal with ag appropriations, at a time when the chairman of the \nNational Democratic Campaign Committee says, We write the rural areas \noff, that the Senator from Massachusetts would be offering a bill that \nwould dramatically impact the uninsured by forcing more to be \nuninsured.\n  It just so happens that a very large number of the uninsured live in \nrural America. It just so happens, according to the Employees Benefit \nResearch Institute, nearly half, or 43 percent, of all workers in \nagriculture, in forestry, and in the fishing sector of our economy have \nno health insurance. In other words, they have to provide for \nthemselves. Now we are suggesting that we will drive the cost of \ninsurance up for those who are uninsured instead of doing things that \nbring the cost of that insurance down so that the uninsured can find \ninsurance more affordable.\n  Is this a coincidence or is there a relationship? I am not sure. But \nthere is one thing that is for sure: The other side has decided to \ntarget ag appropriations with a bill that they think is extremely \nvaluable politically. It is also an issue that we have come together on \nto say that there are some real needs and we are willing to address \nthose needs in a bipartisan and timely fashion.\n\n[[Page S7563]]\n\n  But let us allow the work of the Congress to go forward in the \nappropriations area. We will deal with health care, as we should deal \nwith health care, but we cannot deal with it by driving people from it, \ncreating a greater dependency on government programs, as inevitably \nwill happen, as shown by every research institute that has looked at \nthe Kennedy bill.\n  The Kennedy bill, without question, shoves possibly 2 million people \nout of insurance; I will be conservative and say at least 1 million, or \n1.4 million by conservative estimates.\n\n  So let us get on with appropriating money for women, infants, and \nchildren for their nutritional needs, for the school lunch program, for \nfood stamps, for ag research, for those things that are important to \nrural America.\n  I do not care if Congressman Kennedy on the House side has written \noff rural America. This Senator will not write it off. We will pass an \nag approps bill. We could do it today. We could finalize it this week \nand send a very important message to American agriculture that your \nwork and your interests are important to us; that we will deal with you \non a timely basis; that we will respond to your needs as best we can; \nand we will say to those less fortunate, we will feed you, and we will \nnot use it as a political issue. We will do it in a right and \nresponsible and timely way.\n  I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can agree with \nthat. It is what they ought to be agreeing with. There is enough \npolitics to go around. Let's take politics out of the ag bill. They put \nit in with the injection of the Patients' Bill of Rights. They now have \nthe opportunity to remove it.\n  Our leaders have been negotiating for some time to establish a time \ncertain so we can handle this issue and all sides can debate its \nfairness, its equity, or its lack thereof. We will have a lot more \ndetail. But obstructionist attitudes, blocking the activity of the \nSenate, gain very few of us anything. And the American public scratches \nits head and says: What are they doing back there? Why can't they do \nthe work of the people? Pass the ag appropriations bill. Deal with \nhealth care in a timely fashion. Move the other appropriations bills \nand complete the work of Government.\n  That is what the American people expect of us. That is what they \nshould expect of us. I hope the other side will ultimately agree with \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7563-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7563-S7565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to respond just a \nbit to some of the discussion that has occurred with respect to both \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights and also the agriculture appropriations \nbill.\n  I just heard the discussion about the Kennedy position in the House \nand the Kennedy bill this and the Kennedy bill that. It is not what \nthis issue is about. This is about a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is \nabout the kind of health care the American people get when they show up \nwith a disease or with an injury and need health care treatment, what \nkind of treatment do they get under current circumstances, and what \nkinds of protections are reasonable protections for them to expect in \nthis system.\n  We have been pushing, for a long while, to try to get a Patients' \nBill of Rights enacted by this Congress and by the previous Congress, \nbut our efforts have not met with great success. I will tell you why. \nBecause as health care has reorganized, and the largest insurance \ncompanies have herded people into HMOs, they have decided they do not \nwant Congress to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. They want to be \nmaking health care decisions in their insurance offices, often 1,000 \nmiles away from a hospital room or a doctor's office. They do not want \nCongress, in any way, to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. They have \ngotten enough folks here in this Congress, and here in this Senate, to \ndecide that they would block it. And it has been blocked forever.\n  So it does not matter that it was the agriculture appropriations \nbill. It would have been any bill. The Democratic leader last week said \nto the majority leader: We intend to offer it. If you don't give us an \nagreement and an opportunity to decide that we're going to have a fair \nand free and open debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights, we're going \nto offer it.\n  We are going to pass the agriculture appropriations bill. Before we \npass the agriculture appropriations bill, we are going to have a debate \non responding to the emergency of the farm crisis. That is not in this \nbill at the present time. We tried to put it in the bill in the \nsubcommittee and were defeated in our attempts to do so.\n  But we are going to have a debate that is much larger than just this \nbill. This bill deals with the funding of USDA programs, research, food \nstamps--a range of things--but it does not address the farm crisis that \nexists out there today that deals with income: The fact that farmers go \nto a grain elevator someplace and the grain trade decides that their \nfood is not worth much, they do not get a fair price for it. Family \nfarmers are in desperate trouble. We are going to debate that bill, but \nwe are also going to debate a bill to try to respond to the farm \ncrisis.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will in a moment.\n  But let me point out, we are also going to debate the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. It is not going to be some gatekeeper who is going to tell \nus what our rights are on the floor of the Senate. Someone will stand \nover there and say: Well, we have reviewed this amendment. We think \nwe'll allow you to offer that. We are not going to do that. That is not \nthe way the Senate rules exist. The Senate rules exist in a way that \nsays to every Senator: You have a right to offer amendments.\n  I understand that we are not in the majority and we do not set the \nagenda. The other side sets the agenda. But when they decide that the \nagenda will be to enhance all of their interests and shut off any \ndebate of interests on the other side, they miss, in my judgment, the \nhistory of the Senate. That is not what this body is about.\n  We have rights. We intend to exercise those rights. We are going to \ntalk about education. We are going to talk about health care. Yes, we \nare going to talk about the farm crisis. And we are going to insist on \nit. The debate at the moment is our insistence that we be able to have \na fair opportunity to offer amendments with respect to our Patients' \nBill of Rights, that we have a full debate on them, and to have them \nvoted on. We insist on that.\n\n  I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Very briefly, I was a bit surprised last week when the \nSenator came to the floor and offered the Patients' Bill of Rights to \nthe ag bill, because I know of his commitment to agriculture. I know of \nour joint belief about the farm crisis and the reality of it.\n  What this Senate has not done yet with the Department of Agriculture \nis shape the size and the scope of the farm crisis. We agree that \ncrisis exists. You and I agree that it exists. The Presiding Officer \ncomes from a farm State. We agree it exists. But we don't know the \nmagnitude of it yet.\n  We have asked the President and the Secretary of Agriculture to \nengage with us. That is why it is not attached to this appropriations \nbill. We are not going to start legislating into a vacuum. We have to \nlegislate because we are dealing with billions of dollars. And the \nSenator is right about farmers' and ranchers' incomes. That has to be \ndone accurately.\n  But I am a bit confused. Being the farm State Senator that he is, he \nseems to be offering the Patients' Bill of Rights to this ag approps \nbill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reclaiming my time, I offered the amendment the other day \non behalf of the Senate Democratic leader. It was an amendment that we \nsaid last week we would offer to any bill on the floor of the Senate. \nThis is not going to delay the agriculture appropriations bill. The \nSenator from Idaho well knows that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the distinguished Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will not object, if there is an additional 10 minutes \nfor our side.\n\n[[Page S7564]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that the Senator's request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is my request.\n  Mrs. BOXER. When the Senator finishes his thought, will he yield for \na question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me just make this point: We are going to pass an \nagriculture appropriations bill. The Senator from Idaho says: Well, we \nall agree there is a problem. We need to understand the scope and the \ndepth.\n  I understand the scope and the depth of this problem. I sat in the \nAppropriations Committee conference in the basement of this building at \nmidnight one night, when nobody said we needed to understand the scope \nand depth of the Defense Department issues. The Pentagon asked for $6 \nbillion to prosecute the airstrikes needed to replenish their funds, \nand the Congress said: Well, you don't know what you are doing. We want \nto add another $6 billion. You didn't ask for enough money for the \nPentagon. We demand that we give you $6 billion more.\n  Nobody was sitting around saying we need to understand the scope and \nthe depth of that. They said: We demand you take $6 billion more money. \nThat night, about 1 in the morning, Senator Harkin and I said, if there \nis an extra $5 or $6 billion around, we demand a debate on the priority \nof its use. We have people going broke in farm country. We demand that \nsome of it be used for that.\n  So we offered an amendment. By 14 to 14, we lost on a tie vote; I \nsuppose, because some didn't know the scope and the depth. The Senator \nfrom Idaho cares a lot about family farming, as do I. It is mixing, in \nmy judgment, a concoction of bad meals here to suggest that by adding a \nPatients' Bill of Rights to this particular bill it does something to \nagriculture or somebody isn't committed to agriculture. That is all \nfog.\n  We wouldn't be here talking about this had someone, some long while \nago, said, yes, we will give you your rights on the floor of the Senate \nto bring a bill to the floor and to offer amendments. Yet we have been \nsystematically denied that opportunity. That is why, whether it is this \nbill or any other bill, you are going to find these kinds of \namendments.\n\n  As soon as those who are in charge allow the Senate to operate the \nway it ought to operate and function, you will not see these \namendments.\n  In my judgment, we are here on the Patients' Bill of Rights because \nwe have been told: We don't want you to be able to offer your \namendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights dealing with scope, dealing \nwith emergency room treatment, and so on. That is why we are here.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I find it quite interesting. I ask my friend, do the \npeople who live in farm country need health insurance? Do the people \nwho live in farm country have problems if they need to go to emergency \nrooms? Do the people in farm country have problems when their child \nneeds a specialist?\n  I wonder whether or not we segment things too much. I think people \nwho live in farm country also need health care. If we could reach \nagreement so we could offer our amendments and give the people in farm \ncountry and in suburbia and in urban America the right to decent health \ncare--my friend from Idaho said: Oh, my God, what you are doing will \ncost so much. We have a letter from GAO. It is $2 a person a month to \nget decent health care in this country.\n  I ask my friend, because he is such a stalwart supporter of family \nfarmers, do they not have a problem as well as all the rest of us?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The answer to that is, of course, they do. This issue is \nnot an issue of urban versus rural. The issue of health care and \nmedical treatment exists all around this country. We have talked on the \nfloor at great length about the specifics of it.\n  Yesterday I told the story--I will tell it again, because it \ndescribes something more than a Patients' Bill of Rights--does someone \nwho was taken a 40-foot fall and has been helicoptered to a hospital \nand thrown into an emergency room unconscious with fractured bones in \nthree parts of her body, does that person have a right to emergency \nroom treatment? Or does the HMO have a right to say: We won't cover \nyour emergency room cost because you didn't get prior approval to get \nto an emergency room?\n  How do you get prior approval when you are unconscious on a gurney \nbeing wheeled in from a helicopter, medivac'ed from the mountains where \nyou were hiking? Does a patient in this country who has health care \ncoverage have a right to expect emergency room treatment in those \ncircumstances? Of course.\n  That is what the Patients' Bill of Rights is about. Not just that, \nbut the right to keep the same doctor, and cancer treatment, a whole \nseries of issues like that. Does that affect rural America? Of course, \nit does.\n  But I want to go back to the point made by my colleague. The \nagriculture appropriations bill does not come to the floor of the \nSenate with an ag crisis response because it was not deemed appropriate \nby those who decided they didn't want to put it there. We are going to \ntry to put it there at some point. I hope perhaps we can do that on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I know the scope and the depth of the problem in rural America. The \nproblem is that it costs about $4.50 to produce a bushel of wheat. They \ndrive to the country elevator and the grain trade says wheat is only \nworth $2.70 a bushel. That is a quick way to go broke. We have a lot of \nfamilies who are experiencing broken dreams of being able to continue \nin family farming because the hungry world and the grain trade of the \nhungry world have said: Your food doesn't have value.\n  It is not in the bill now, so don't be in such a hurry about the \nunderlying bill. We need to add to the underlying bill the farm crisis \npackage that Senator Harkin and others are going to push. In the \nmeantime, we will insist on our rights to try to offer a Patients' Bill \nof Rights on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. One final question. The Senator from Idaho chastised my \nfriend and said: You are from farm country, yet you are supporting a \nPatients' Bill of Rights and want that debate now, when the underlying \nag bill is so important. What my friend is saying is that this bill, \nthe underlying bill, comes up short for America's farmers.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I watched at 1 in the morning. I saw the Senator, with \nSenator Harkin, offer a package that addresses the emergency needs of \nAmerica's family farmers. It was turned down pretty much on a partisan \nvote. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. It was a partisan vote except for one.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So pretty much a partisan vote.\n  We basically had the Republicans--who are out here saying, oh, bring \non this bill, our poor family farmers--voting down an emergency package \nfor those very same farmers and fighting us so those farmers and \neveryone else in America can't get decent health care.\n  Lastly, I wonder if my friend sees a connection, because I am \nthinking about it. I saw my friend from Idaho come out and, instead of \ndebating us on the bill, scare America by saying: Oh, my God, with this \nPatients' Bill of Rights, 1 million, 2 million people are going to lose \ntheir insurance. It sounds like scare tactics.\n  It reminded me a little bit of the debate we had on the juvenile \njustice bill, when all we were saying on our side of the aisle was that \nwe wanted to do background checks on criminals and mentally disturbed \npeople before they get a weapon. They said: Oh, my God, they are trying \nto take everyone's guns away.\n  America knows that is not the case. When you fight for sensible \nthings, you hear scare tactics from the other side.\n  I wonder if my friend notices this kind of desperation deal going on, \nevery time we try to do something, of trying to scare the people of \nthis country.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The only reason I stood up to respond is because there is \ninformation from the GAO and elsewhere that suggests that the Patients' \nBill of Rights may actually encourage more health care coverage. You \nmay have more people buying health insurance understanding that in \ntheir HMO they have rights. They have the right to demand information \non all the potential treatments available to them,\n\n[[Page S7565]]\n\nnot just the cheapest, for example. They might well believe that is a \npretty good thing.\n  The GAO and others say this may well increase the coverage. The \nassumption that a couple million people will opt out, I do not believe \nthat.\n  The second thing is, we are going to need to solve the farm problem \nwith folks around here from both sides of the political aisle. The \nPresiding Officer is from Kansas, a big State in dealing with the farm \nissue. I would never suggest that somehow he doesn't care about \nfarmers. I have served with him in the House and the Senate and know \ntoo well how much he cares about family farmers. We need, at some \npoint, to get together on a solution to deal with the farm crisis. I \nunderstand that. I have not said--and I could, I suppose--all right, \nyou took $6 billion that you created someplace and gave it to defense.\n\n  So my contention is this: You gave the Defense Department money they \ndidn't ask for that should have gone to farmers. I could come out here \nand make that case, I suppose. But I am not doing that. I have said I \nthought if there was $6 billion, we should have a debate about the \npriorities. We didn't. The Defense Department got it, and I am sure \nthey will use it for security needs, readiness, and other things.\n  My point is, on the underlying bill, I don't think we should be too \nquick to pass it, because it doesn't have the fundamental resources to \ndeal with the farm crisis.\n  In any event, last week the Democratic leader informed the majority \nleader: If you don't give us the opportunity that we insist upon as \nSenators, to bring these issues to the floor, such as the Patients' \nBill of Rights, then we intend to offer it as an amendment to whatever \nvehicle is on the floor. Anybody who is surprised by that simply wasn't \nawake last week.\n  So we will get through this. I think the way we will do it is to have \na full debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights at some point, with the \nability to offer amendments, as we should, and I hope we will also have \na robust debate on the issue of the farm crisis response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think it is appropriate to respond to \nsome of the commentary from the other side about the Patients' Bill of \nRights--the Republican plan versus the Kennedy bill, the proposal that \nthe other side has put forth.\n  The American public should know and recognize that a majority in this \nCongress is for moving on an effective proposal and for addressing the \nneeds of the American citizens relative to dealing with HMOs, and that \nis the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a very good package \nof ideas put together after a long and serious amount of consideration. \nIt came out of the committee of jurisdiction with a majority vote, is \nnow on the floor, and has received a majority vote in the Senate. It \nwould significantly improve the situation of patients as they deal with \ndoctors and HMOs across this country.\n  I think, however, that it also ought to be noted on the other side of \nthe coin that what Senator Kennedy's proposal does is to continue the \nClinton health care plan that we saw about 5 years ago--I guess it was \n5 years ago now--``Hillary-Care,'' as it came to be known. This is sort \nof the daughter of ``Hillary-Care'' or son of ``Hillary-Care,'' as put \nforth by the Senator from Massachusetts. Essentially, if you are going \nto be honest about the practical effect of the proposal of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, it is to increase the premiums for private health \ninsurance in this country by at least 4 percent potentially; other \nestimates have been as high as 6 percent.\n  When you start raising the premiums for health insurance--especially \non self-insured individuals--the impact of that is that people drop out \nof the health care insurance system. Why is that? Because they can't \nafford it. If you are a small business of five or six employees, if you \nare running a restaurant, or if you are running an auto shop or a small \nsoftware company, and your costs go up 4 percent on your health care \npremium, that can amount to a significant cost increase, and in many \ninstances that is going to be the difference between making it and not \nmaking it in some of these small companies. So you have a situation \nwhere people drop the insurance.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the practical \neffect of the Kennedy health care plan will be that well over 1 million \npeople will drop their health insurance. Why is this important? Why \ndoes this tie into ``Hillary-Care''? Because, if you will recall, back \nin the days when we were debating the issues of ``Hillary-Care,'' the \nbasic proposal was to create a nationalized system where the Federal \nGovernment would come in and take over all insurance carriers in this \ncountry, for all intents and purposes, with the logic behind that being \nthat there were too many uninsured people in the health market to date, \ntoo many Americans simply did not have health care insurance, and \ntherefore we needed to have ``Hillary-Care.''\n  Nationalization of the health care industry was proposed at that \ntime, and the Kennedy bill was introduced by Senator Kennedy on behalf \nthe First Lady, and the proposal was, let's nationalize the system so \nall the uninsured in this country will have a system of insurance.\n  Of course, it failed miserably, because it was incredibly complex, it \nwas incredibly bureaucratic, and it was extraordinarily expensive for \nthe American taxpayer. The cost increase and the tax burden for the \nAmerican taxpayer would have far exceeded any savings in premium that \nwould have occurred, and the cost in bureaucracy and the loss of \neffectiveness in the administration of health care in this country \nwould have had a major impact on the quality of health care.\n  So out of common sense, good sense, and good politics, the program \nwas rejected out of hand, and in fact it never came to a vote in the \nSenate because, quite honestly, a majority on the other side of the \naisle was embarrassed by the proposal and they decided to walk away \nfrom it.\n  What we have here is essentially is an extension of that, because \nwhat we have is a back-door proposal to health care. Unhappy with the \nfact that they were unable to nationalize the health care system, in \norder to cover those folks who do not have enough health insurance, \nthey have now decided, by bits and pieces, through small slices--this \none is a very large slice but through smaller slices of the pie--\nto slowly uninsure Americans. So there is such a large pool of \nuninsured Americans that we will have to come back to a ``Hillary-\nCare'' system so there will be justification for nationalization of the \nhealth insurance industry, because there will be all these uninsured \npeople out there who have been created and, because of a lack of \ninsurance, we will have to create legislation.\n\n  Because of all of these different actions taken--proposals such as we \nare seeing today on ``Kennedy-Care,'' which will create another 1 \nmillion-plus people who are uninsured--next year we will have another \nproposal which will create another group of uninsured and there will be \nanother proposal to increase the cost of insurance. And they will add \nsomething else to private insurance costs--some new benefit, or \ninitiative--that will have all sorts of trappings of nice political \nsounds so that they will need to raise the cost of insurance premiums. \nSo more people will step off of insurance, and more and more people \nwill end up being uninsured over a period of time, and we will end up \nwith just more people becoming uninsured as we continue\n\n[[Page S7566]]\n\ndown the road of adopting these initiatives which are put forward by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I will tell you, I think the basic game plan here is to create such a \npool of uninsured people in this country that we have to turn the \ncorner and come all the way back so that the Senator from Massachusetts \nand the First Lady can come to us again and say, now, we really need to \nnationalize the health care system because we have all of these \nuninsured people.\n  I think there is a bit of a cynical game plan behind the Democratic \nproposal, the Kennedy plan. Maybe I am being too suspicious, but, as a \npractical matter, I think I am being accurate and I am observing what \nthe factual events will be.\n  The fact is that because of the premium costs that will increase, \nwhich are going to be driven by ``Kennedy-Care,'' as proposed by this \nbill, we will end up with more people uninsured, and the more people \nthat become uninsured in this country, the greater the demand from the \nother side of the aisle will be for a nationalized system of health \ncare.\n  I will tell you, if a nationalized system of health care was a bad \nidea 5 years ago, it would be a bad idea today, and it will be an idea \n5 years from now when we hear from the other side of the aisle how \nimportant it is because so many people had to drop off the health care \nsystem, because they increased the premiums on the health care system \nby passing their proposed Kennedy health care bill.\n  I just wanted to make some of those comments in response to some of \nthe comments from the other side.\n  I think it is ironic that we are holding up agriculture \nappropriations over the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. I have \nnever been a great fan of the way we fund agriculture in this country, \nas the Senator in the Chair knows. We have been discussing this issue \nfor a number of years both in the House and in the Senate. I recognize \nthat the farmers in this country are a critical part of our economy and \nthat this agricultural appropriations bill is the reasonable, \nresponsible way of addressing those farmers' needs.\n  We have heard about the crisis in the farm community from the other \nside of the aisle ad nauseam now for 3 months, and suddenly we are \nabout to pass the agriculture appropriations bill, and on the other \nside of the aisle Senators from farm States come forward and say, no, \nwe can't do the agriculture appropriations bill.\n\n  As someone who is not from a farm-community State--I have a few \nfarmers, but they are not the dominant culture in New Hampshire. We \nwish they were. They are certainly wonderful, hard-working people. But \nas somebody who is not from a farm-culture State, I have to scratch my \nhead and say, is the crisis real? If these folks on the other side of \nthe aisle, who for months have been telling us about the severe crisis \nin farm country, come forward when we are about to do the agriculture \nappropriations bill and delay it for weeks and weeks, and potentially \neven months, I ask, is the crisis real in farm country? Should I, when \nwe get another supplemental appropriations bill which has another few \nbillion dollars for the farm crisis, take that seriously, or are we \nbeing ``gamed\"?\n  I think they put into serious jeopardy the reasonable arguments that \nhave been put forward from our side of the aisle by the Senator from \nKansas and the Senator from Montana, who understand the farm issue and \nwho make good arguments on behalf of the farm issue. Those folks who \nare credible on the farm issue on our side of the aisle are having \ntheir credibility undercut by this type of action from the other side \nof the aisle, which really plays games with the farm crisis and really \ndilutes the arguments on the farm crisis when they are willing to delay \nthe funding of the farm bill for what is clearly a political initiative \nundertaken for the purposes of trying to generate a higher polling rate \nthan some poll taken in some political election.\n  To me, there is a fair amount of cynicism in this Senate today, and \nmost of it is being promoted by the actions brought forward by Members \non the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, I yield myself as much of the 25 minutes \nas may be necessary to make my point.\n  I rise today with substantial concern and significant frustration. \nThe pending business before the Senate is the agriculture \nappropriations bill. But for the second day in a row, it appears that \nwe will not work on this important legislation. Those on the other side \nof the aisle have said they will not let any legislative work get done \nuntil they are able to have, apparently, an unlimited debate on a so-\ncalled Bill of Rights for health care patients.\n\n  Those on the other side claim that they must have a debate on their \nbill, but that is not the point. What they are really doing is \nthwarting this body, the Senate, in its constitutional duty to pass \nappropriations bills so that we can make sure that important components \nof our Government remain viable and continue to do their job.\n  The agriculture appropriation bill is a very important measure, not \njust in one State in America but in every State in America. Let me \nremind all Senators that our responsibility to pass appropriations \nbills is defined by the U.S. Constitution, which requires \n``appropriations made by law''--that means we have to pass them--\n``prior to the expenditure of any money from the Federal Treasury.'' \nThat is article I, section 9.\n  I see nothing in my reading of the Constitution that says the Senate \nmust have unlimited debate on some other issue of interest or that the \nSenate even has the authority to speak on all the issues between a \npatient and a doctor.\n  Granted, we have until October 1 to conclude the appropriations \nprocess. That seems like a long way off, summer having just started. \nBut I am not sure exactly why we would be dragging our feet now, \nbecause I am sure I do not have to remind anybody of what happened last \nOctober when we did not do our work early. Congress did not complete \nits job on time, and the American people are the ones who ended up \npaying for our irresponsibility with a $20 billion-some so-called \nemergency appropriation that came when, instead of constitutionally \naddressing our responsibility on appropriations, the President and a \nfew Members of this body combined to invade the Social Security trust \nfund for about $22 billion in emergency spending.\n  Members on both sides of the aisle complained bitterly for months \nabout the process and the outcome. Members from both sides pledged to \nwork together to make sure that history did not repeat itself this \nyear.\n  I commend the leadership and the Appropriations Committee for the \nwonderful start that has been made on the appropriations bills. It is \nJune 24, and the Senate has passed four appropriations bills and has \nfive more ready for the floor. If those on the other side ever allow us \nto return to our duties, we can do the job and do it well.\n  Let me caution all of us that summer will pass quickly. We should not \nput off our responsibilities. We are sent here by our constituents to \ndo our jobs for\n\n[[Page S7567]]\n\nthem, not to sit in endless quorum calls and have days of morning \nbusiness because some group wants a special interest measure to be \naddressed and demands unlimited debate without any end in sight.\n  In addition, I am concerned that certain Senators are holding this \nagriculture appropriations bill hostage at a time when many in our farm \ncommunities are undergoing great hardship. America may be in the midst \nof great prosperity, but it is not a prosperity that has reached the \nfarms. Many of our farmers are working harder and harder, and times are \ntougher and tougher, not better and better.\n  Just a few months ago, we passed an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill that dealt, in part, with the crisis in the \nagriculture sector. Members on both sides of the aisle agree that farm \nfamilies are not enjoying the prosperity that other Americans have \nrecently been enjoying. So this is not the time for the Senate to deal \nanother blow to those who are already hurting. It is not the time for \nthe Senate to kick agriculture while it is down. We need to stand up \nfor our farmers, and we need to stand up for our ranchers, not to try \nto make political hay out of an issue unrelated to agriculture on the \nagriculture appropriations bill.\n\n  Since we are not on the agriculture appropriations bill, and I am not \nsure when we will return to it, I want to spend a few minutes talking \nabout an amendment I plan to offer to the agriculture appropriations \nbill. It is an amendment that will help farmers by opening, and keeping \nopen, foreign markets to their goods.\n  I want to discuss a commitment the Congress made to America's farmers \nand ranchers when we passed the Freedom to Farm bill 3 years ago. Then, \nwe promised that as the Government reduced farmer price support \nprograms, we would ensure that farmers had ascending opportunities to \nbe competitive in international markets. As we withdrew the Government \ninvolvement in farming, we would expand the opportunities for farmers \nin markets overseas. This was a promise to open new markets. However, \nin order to do so, we had to not only remove foreign barriers to U.S. \nfarmers and ranchers, we needed to remove our own barriers to U.S. \nexports of farm goods. Removing U.S. barriers means agricultural \nsanctions reform, which is important to America's farmers and ranchers, \nand especially important to me as a Member who represents a farm State.\n  For more than 200 years, farmers and ranchers have been vital to the \ngrowth and the economic prosperity of the United States. We were an \nexport country, agriculturally, from the beginning. We always responded \nto challenges in our competitive free market system. I believe the \nUnited States has the best farmers in the world--first class in \nproduction, processing, marketing, both abroad and at home. However, we \nare now seeing the effects of depressed farm prices across the Nation. \nNo doubt, we need to face the crisis head on, but while we are passing \nmultiple spending bills this year, there are some basic questions we \nshould answer:\n  Have we done everything we can to allow farmers to be independent, to \nallow farmers to have the freedom to compete, to give them \nopportunities and not just send them money, to consider the long-term \nwell-being of family farms? In the absence of us fulfilling our promise \nto open markets, is our spending merely keeping farms solvent this year \nonly to be lost in the future?\n  We have had 3 years to answer these questions, and the answer to all \nof them is still a resounding no.\n  The administration and the Congress have many words about open \nmarkets and more export opportunities, but our actions have been to bog \nourselves down with turf battles and procedural maneuvering. How can we \nexplain this to the agricultural community across America? How can we \ntell our family farmers in the Midwest, in Missouri, in the Far West, \nor in the East and the South, that we really want to give them \nincreasing opportunity in world markets, and then thwart our own goal \nwith institutional barricades, and tell them we want to sell abroad but \nforbid them to sell abroad by having embargoes of our own products, \nsanctions against countries that are unnecessary and counterproductive, \nso it makes it impossible for them to have the same markets they would \notherwise enjoy?\n\n  I believe we must enact reforms that give farmers and ranchers the \nopportunity both to be productive and to be competitive. Such reforms \nwill strengthen farm families. I believe these policies are ones rooted \nin the American tradition of increasing opportunity.\n  One-hundred-plus years ago, my grandfather, John M. ``Cap''--they \ncalled him Cap--Larsen left northern Norway as a 13-year-old to sail \nthe high seas. He changed his name and, with all his earthly endowment \ncontained in a duffel bag, he switched ships and boarded one destined \nfor the United States as a crew member. He could not speak the \nlanguage, but he knew that America was a place of ascending \nopportunity, and he came here.\n  We have a responsibility to America to keep our opportunity growing. \nWe can't keep our opportunity growing if we are closing the markets in \nwhich American farmers can sell their produce. So, clearly, our \nopportunity is to say to American farmers--and I would like to say to \nMissouri farmers--we want you to have an opportunity to sell your goods \nin as many places as is possible.\n  The agricultural industry is the backbone of my State's economy, \naccounting for more than $4 billion annually.\n  While the United States can produce more food than any other country, \nwe account for only 5 percent of the world's consuming population. That \nleaves 95 percent of the world's consumers outside of our borders. This \nis an astounding statistic when we put it in terms of creating \nopportunities. Exports account for 30 percent of the gross cash \nreceipts for America's farmers, and nearly 40 percent of all U.S. \nagricultural production is exported. However, with the consuming \ncapacity of the world largely outside our borders, our farmers and \nranchers need increasing access to foreign demand.\n  Farmers and ranchers tell me repeatedly that they want more of our \nhelp abroad and less of our interference on their farms. They need us \nto open foreign markets, and they need us to keep those markets open.\n  Our first task--opening foreign markets--looms before us like a brick \nbarricade. With the same will and authority of President Reagan before \nthe Berlin Wall--when he said, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall''--\nwe must face head-on the barricades before our farmers and ranchers. It \nis not an easy task, but then again neither was dismantling the Evil \nEmpire.\n  The Europeans are standing on their massive wall of protectionism \nbuilt across the trail of free trade and simply rejecting U.S. beef. \nFor example, May 13 was the last date for them, according to the orders \nfrom the World Trade Organization, in which they had exhausted every \nappeal. That was the last day for them to finally say they will accept \nU.S. beef. They refused to do so.\n  We have to blaze a trail. The Europeans cannot be allowed to make a \nmockery of our competitive spirit, especially that of our cattle \nranchers.\n\n  Our second task--keeping markets open--is why my colleagues and I are \nhere on the floor today. The picture of ascending opportunity for \nfarmers is incomplete without a view of foreign markets unimpaired by \nU.S. embargoes.\n  We have gone from the idea of trade barriers on the part of the \nEuropeans to embargoes on the part of the United States. We keep a \nnumber of our farm products from being sold around the world, and \nunnecessarily.\n  I might add that using food and medicine as weapons creates a \ncumbersome trail, an environment of descending opportunities. \nAgricultural embargoes amount to a denial of much-needed food and \nmedicine for the innocent people of foreign lands with whom we have no \nquarrel and to a unilateral disarmament of the farmers in a competitive \nworld market. We have simply pulled our farmers out of competition in a \nnumber of areas where we need not. We must not use our farmers or \ninnocent people as pawns of diplomacy or allow our embargoes merely to \nadd bricks to the walls of protectionism that other countries have \nerected.\n  Our farmers have jumped through all the hoops of foreign trade \nbarriers and redtape to establish trusted relationships with foreign \nbuyers. That has\n\n[[Page S7568]]\n\nhappened. And the U.S. Government should be extremely cautious about \ninterrupting their sales by imposing trade sanctions.\n  Many farmers' livelihoods depend on sales overseas. For instance, in \nthe mid-1990s, more than one-fourth of Missouri's farm sales were made \nto overseas consumers. But because the U.S. Government has sanctioned \nagricultural trade, there has been an estimated $1.2 billion annual \ndecline in the U.S. economy during these years.\n  In other words, our whole country suffered to the tune of an annual \ndecline of $1.2 billion as a result of agricultural embargoes. This \ntranslates into 7,600 fewer U.S. jobs. Even one-third of those 7,600 \njobs lost translates into the loss of a family farm. So we have lost \nabout 2,500 family farmers in each of the last several years because of \nagricultural embargoes.\n  Sometimes I think we need to ask ourselves: Who are we hurting? We \nthink we are hurting other countries that go into the world market and \nbuy from other suppliers. I don't think we are hurting them badly--\nperhaps not nearly as badly as we hurt America when we lose 2,500 \nfamily farms a year. That is 50 family farms a week. That is a \ntradition that they no longer pass on--a tradition of resourcefulness, \na tradition of independence, a tradition of providing food and fiber to \na hungry world.\n  Additionally, this debate on agricultural sanctions reform is broader \nthan the effect sanctions have on America's farmers. In addition to \nhurting our sales and damaging our farmers' credibility as suppliers, \nembargoes deny food and medicine to those who need it most--citizens \nwho have to live under the rule of some of those who are most \noppressed.\n  Also, the United States, by imposing unilateral agricultural \nembargoes, can actually end up benefiting instead of punishing foreign \ntyrants. For instance, one of the little-known aspects of the Soviet \ngrain embargo concerns how much money the Soviets saved as a direct \nresult of the United States ``punishing'' them with an embargo. There \nmay be a number of people who do not remember the U.S. grain embargo \nwith the Soviet Union in the late 1970s, I believe it was. We \nthought, well, they are not doing things the way we want them to, so we \nwill make it tough on the Soviets. We will embargo exports from the \nUnited States to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, when we said we \nwould no longer trade with them, was able to cancel 17 million tons of \nrelatively high-priced purchases from the United States. So they \nwouldn't buy these quality well-produced items from American \nagriculture. They replaced those purchases they were going to get from \nAmerican agriculture with purchases from other countries. What do you \nknow? They even bought from other countries at lower prices.\n\n  The U.S. embargo unilaterally canceled private contracts and drove \nthe world market prices down by sending our grain into the world \nmarket, and at the same time it was estimated that the embargo saved \nthe Soviets about $250 million. In an effort to hurt the Soviets, we \nsaved them $250 million, and we cost the American agricultural \ncommunity 17 million tons of agricultural sales to a market for which \nthe contracts had already been signed.\n  That is not exactly the intended result. But all too frequently when \nwe keep our farmers from selling to countries overseas as a result of \nthese sanctions and embargoes, we end up hurting ourselves, and not the \nother country. We end up destroying family farms in America--not \nsomething in the other jurisdiction. We end up making it tough on \nAmerican farmers.\n  I agree that in some instances the United States needs to use trade \nsanctions. They can be a foundation for the protection of our national \nsecurity interests and to the promotion of our foreign policy goals. \nHowever, because I believe agriculture and medicine should rarely be \nused as a unilateral weapon--they aren't things that really are going \nto win wars for us generally, especially if the agriculture production \nthat we cut off is really replaced just by production brought on line \nin other cultures--I think we should be very serious about any effort \nto use agriculture or medicine as a weapon.\n  I think both the Congress and the administration need to consider it \nvery carefully, and that they ought to combine their authority to lift \nmost of the remaining restrictions on American farmers and ranchers. We \nought to give them a chance to sell to a hungry world.\n  That is why a number of Senators and I--Senator Hagel, Senator Boxer, \nSenator Kerrey, Senator Roberts, and Senator Dodd--are working on this \namendment which I would otherwise be offering if we weren't in morning \nbusiness. I hope many other Senators will join.\n  We want to be involved in discussing what is good for America--yes--\nwhat is good for our farm communities, and our home States, and discuss \nwhy sanctions, which really hurt us more than they hurt the other \nfellow, are really counterproductive to American farmers. If there are \ncosts to be borne in our culture as a result of our antagonism with \nothers, those costs should not be focused solely on the agricultural \ncommunities in a way that makes our farmers less competitive, because \nwe narrow in a significant way the markets that they would otherwise \nhave in the world marketplace.\n  The theme of the amendment I would have proposed is that sanctions \nshould rarely, if ever, be imposed against food or medicine, and, if \nthey need to be imposed, both Congress and the President should be \ninvolved. Our farms should not be sanctioned without serious \ndeliberation about the effects. If food and medicine for the world is \nimportant--and the Food and Medicine for the World Act should be \npassed--it is this: That in order to use agriculture or medicine as a \npart of a sanctions regime, there would have to be an agreement between \nthe administration and Congress.\n  Let me make this clear. We don't want to tie the hands of the \nPresident. We merely want to require the President and Congress to \nshake hands in agreement, if we are going to ever use food and medicine \nas a part of a sanctions or an embargo regime.\n  That is the thrust of the amendment, which I am proposing; and here \nis how it would happen. Under the amendment, agriculture is carved out \nof a sanctions package when any new sanctions are imposed. The \nPresident would still be able to use his broad sanctions authority, but \nagriculture and medicine would be treated a little differently.\n\n  When any new unilateral sanction is announced by the President, the \nsanctions he imposes may go into effect, except they would not affect \nagriculture or medicine unless the President submits a report to the \nCongress asking the sanctions include agriculture, and Congress \napproves, by joint resolution on expedited review, his request to \nsanction agriculture and/or medicine.\n  Additionally, sanctions on agriculture and medicine that are put in \nplace by the new procedure would sunset after 2 years unless the \nPresident made a new request for sanctions and the Congress extended \nthat particular item.\n  There are certain instances in which the President would not have to \nget approval from Congress to include agriculture and medicine in a \nsanctions regime. First of all, we want to make sure we are not aiding \nterrorists in any way. It is one thing for terrorists to use their \nmoney to buy our food. At least they aren't using their money to buy \nbombs and weapons. However, we need to make sure we don't somehow \nsubsidize our sales to terrorists. That is why we have included an \nexception in the bill for terrorist governments. In no instance would \nwe extend credit or credit guarantees to governments of state-sponsored \nterrorism. This is an important point to me: We are not going to be \ngiving tax dollars of the American people to terrorist governments so \nthey can buy our food and, having gotten credit from us, then buy \nmunitions to carry out their terrorism. That is not possible under this \nact.\n  Second, we will not give terrorists any dual-use items. This \nsanctions amendment specifically carves out items on the commerce \ncontrol list, items on the munitions list, and any item that would be \nused to manufacture chemical or biological weapons. This is the \nstrongest belt-and-suspenders approach possible. We honor the commerce \ncontrol list, the munitions list, and we would make sure there were no \ncredit extensions to terrorist regimes.\n  Finally, if Congress has declared war, the President would be able to \ninclude\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\nagriculture and medicine in a sanctions regime against the country of \nwhich we are at war. If we have declared war, obviously we are not \ngoing to be aiding or trading with the enemy in any way. Congress would \nnot have to again provide ratification of the President's sanctions in \nthat setting.\n  My colleagues and I are genuinely of the belief that this bill is in \nthe best interests of American agriculture. It is the best approach to \nagricultural sanctions reform. We do not have to balance national \nsecurity interests versus farm exports because we do not limit the \nability of the United States to protect its national security \ninterests. When the national interests are clearly at stake, the \nCongress and the President should be able to agree.\n  For the most part, I do not think we should use items such as wheat \nand soybeans as weapons for foreign policy. However, if the need ever \narises to embargo agriculture, Congress and the administration can \nimpose sanctions that would affect the flow of our agricultural goods \nto nations abroad; we just need to have a deliberative process set in \nplace, and we need to ensure that both the President and the Congress \nare in agreement.\n  The food and medicine for the world amendment is fair and it is \nconstitutional. The food and medicine for the world amendment, which is \nthe amendment I would propose today if we were actually on the bill, \nsends a message to overseas customers that U.S. farmers and ranchers \nwill be reliable, that people can depend on our produce and our \nproduction, and we will honor our contracts.\n\n  The food and medicine for the world amendment also sends a message to \nU.S. farmers and ranchers. It says we will not tamper with their \ncapacity to have good, open markets around the world without due \ndeliberation. Also, it begins to fulfill a definite promise made to our \nfarmers and ranchers a little over 3 years ago.\n  Not only would we be assuring U.S. farmers and ranchers, I think we \nwould be sending a signal to poor citizens around the world who need \nthe food, the produce, the fiber that we produce, the medicines that we \nhave, that we have a heart in America that respects their heart, that \nthey are not subscribing to tyranny because they have to live under it, \nand that we are not unwilling to provide needs to individuals as long \nas our provision of needs doesn't sustain the oppression of \nindividuals.\n  It is time to enact a policy that supports our farmers' efforts to \nreach their competitive potential internationally, a policy that makes \nfood and medicine available around the world. We must create \n``ascending'' opportunity for our farm families. This measure would \nprovide for that. It also understands that there are times when we need \nto curtail the flow of our goods overseas, but it requires both the \nadministration and the Congress to come to an agreement in order for \nthat to happen.\n  I believe the food and medicine amendment which I would be proposing, \nwere those on the other side of the aisle not thwarting our capacity to \nmove forward in addressing the pressing needs of agriculture today, is \nessential to the well-being of the farmers and ranchers in America, \nalso essential to our well-being and our reputation as a reliable \nproducer and provider of food, fiber, and medicine around the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent two pertinent letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 23, 1999.\n     Hon. John D. Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: We are pleased that you and other \n     supporters of sanctions reform are preparing to offer an \n     amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill today.\n       The amendment, ``Food and Medicine for the World,'' would \n     exempt agricultural and medical products from unilateral \n     sanctions unless the President submits a report to Congress \n     asking that the sanctions include agriculture and Congress \n     approves his request by joint resolution. If a sanction is \n     imposed on agricultural exports following joint resolution \n     approval, it would sunset in two years unless the process is \n     repeated at that time.\n       We strongly support this amendment and believe it would \n     result in true sanctions reform for U.S. farmers and \n     ranchers. As you know, unilateral sanctions inflicted the \n     most damage on U.S. producers. They often result in no change \n     in the target country as these nations simply source their \n     agricultural purchases from our competitors. The end result \n     is that our producers are branded unreliable suppliers and \n     lose access to important markets for decades to come. This \n     amendment would begin to restore the U.S. reputation as a \n     reliable supplier of agricultural products.\n       Access to export markets is more important than ever given \n     the decline in projected exports for 1999 and depressed \n     commodity prices worldwide.

Furthermore, I commend the \n     sponsors of the amendment for recognizing the damage \n     inflicted upon our nation's farmers when food is used as a \n     weapon.\n       This amendment is especially important given the current \n     weakness of the U.S. farm economy. Ill-conceived trade policy \n     that prevents U.S. agricultural exports not only has \n     financial ramifications for our farmers but also provides new \n     market opportunities for our competitors.\n       This amendment exempts agriculture from unilateral trade \n     sanctions, yet recognizes there may be instances where such \n     drastic action is warranted. When a situation arises where \n     the President feels it is necessary to include agriculture, \n     the amendment provides a procedure to obtain this authority.\n       Unilateral trade sanctions have proven to be a tool best to \n     avoid. I commend your efforts and urge other Senators to \n     support this important amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Charles E.

Mr. President, I join my Democratic colleagues in their \nfight to have an open and unrestricted debate on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. Over the past several days, we have heard the Republican \nleadership say they are interested in having an up-or-down vote on \ntheir bill, followed by a vote on the Democratic bill. We all know this \nis not how the Senate is supposed to work. We are a deliberative body, \nand as such, we should have debate on important issues that affect the \nlives of Americans.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights addresses one of the most important \nissues the Senate can debate: the rights of Americans to have access to \nquality health care.\n  Our health care system essentially relies on three important factors: \nFirst is access to health care; second is the quality of our health \ncare; and third is\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\ncost controls, that is, the cost of our health care.\n  The problem is it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have \nthe best in all three areas. If we concentrate on two of the areas, \nthat usually results in sacrifices in the third area. The whole reason \nwe are trying to have this debate is that this trio of access, of \nquality, and of cost control has shifted out of balance. Our market-\ndriven health care system has become too focused on controlling costs \nand protecting corporate profits. Although predictable, this, \nunfortunately, has led to sacrifices in access to health care and \nquality health care.\n  It is important to point out we do need to be concerned about cost \ncontrol in our health care system, no doubt about it. In fact, managed \ncare has done many of the things we hoped it would do. For example, it \nhas improved the efficiency of health care delivery, it has slowed down \nthe growth in health care costs, and it has enhanced the collection of \ndata to assess the quality of care. It has done all that, and that is \ngood.\n\n  The message of this debate is not that managed care is the enemy. As \nI said, managed care has done a lot of things which are very important. \nThis debate, rather, is about restoring a balance in our health care \nsystem.\n  We certainly could design a health care system that is only concerned \nabout money, but that would miss the point. Unfortunately, though, we \nare headed in that direction. We need to stop and ask ourselves what we \nvalue in our health care system and what it means to have health \ninsurance in America. That is why we want this debate so we can find \nanswers to those questions.\n  I stand with my Democratic colleagues who have called for an open \ndebate. One of the reasons an open debate would be helpful is there is \nroom for compromise. In fact, I am a cosponsor of a bipartisan patient \nprotection bill that I think strikes an important balance between the \ntwo sides which we have heard about in the last few days.\n  We need to come out of our corners and debate the issues because I \nbelieve there is an important middle ground, one that many Senators can \nsupport, if we simply have the courage to debate the provisions of \nthese bills and let the votes fall where they may.\n  I want to address an important area in the Patients' Bill of Rights; \nthat is, the provisions that address coverage for emergency services. \nBoth the Republican and Democratic bills provide coverage for emergency \nservices using a prudent layperson standard. Unfortunately, the \nRepublican version of the prudent layperson standard falls short of the \nstandard that Congress has already enacted for the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  This means that under that bill, hard-working Americans with private \ninsurance will have less protection for emergency services than \nbeneficiaries in Medicaid and Medicare programs. The bipartisan bill \nthat I cosponsor and the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights contain \nthe real prudent layperson standard for emergency services.\n  What is the problem with the other version, that is, the Republican \nversion of the prudent layperson standard? There are two important \nweaknesses in that standard.\n  First, that standard provides an inadequate scope of coverage for \nemergency services. We have heard a lot of discussion about the scope \nof coverage in the two bills over the last 2 days. The best example of \nwhy we need to have uniform protections for patients throughout the \ncountry is the prudent layperson standard.\n  The Federal Government is already involved in every emergency room \nvisit in this country. We have strict Federal standards to protect \npatients with medical emergencies. These standards are embodied in the \nEmergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act or EMTALA. It is hard to \nargue that the Federal Government should not be involved in protecting \npatients with medical emergencies when the Federal Government already \nis involved.\n  The prudent layperson standard in the Republican bill only applies to \n48 million people. Both the bipartisan bill and the Democratic bill \napply this important protection to all 180 million people with private \nhealth insurance. We need to realize in the Senate, again, we have \nalready mandated that anybody who goes to an emergency room should \nreceive health care. That is mandated. We now have an opportunity to \nensure that patients are not held financially hostage for the decisions \nthey make in an emergency. There is broad bipartisan support for the \npatient-centered concept of the prudent layperson standard. Now we need \nto extend this scope of coverage so that it parallels the Federal \nstatutes that are already on the books.\n\n  The other major weakness in the prudent layperson provisions in the \nRepublican bill is the lack of provisions for poststabilization \nservices. I want to point out what the debate about poststabilization \nservices is all about. It simply boils down to two questions.\n  First, is poststabilization care going to be coordinated with the \npatient's health plan, or is it going to be uncoordinated and \ninefficient?\n  Second, are decisions about poststabilization care going to be made \nin a timely fashion, or are we going to allow delays in the \ndecisionmaking process that compromise patient care and lead to \novercrowding in our Nation's emergency rooms?\n  We have heard a lot of rhetoric about how poststabilization services \namount to nothing more than a blank check for providers. If these \nprovisions are a blank check, then why did one of the oldest, largest, \nand most successful managed care organizations in the world help create \nthem in the first place?\n  Kaiser-Permanente is a strong supporter of the poststabilization \nprovisions in our bill for a simple reason: They realize that \ncoordinating care after a patient is stabilized not only leads to \nbetter patient care, it saves money.\n  Let me give an example of a case which took place in the past 2 \nmonths. It illustrates the problem quite nicely.\n  A woman came to an emergency department after falling and sustaining \na serious and complex fracture to her elbow. The emergency physician \ndiagnosed the problem and stabilized the patient. The stabilization \nprocess took less than 2 hours. Unfortunately, the patient's stay at \nthe emergency room lasted for another 10 hours while the staff \nattempted to coordinate the care with the patient's health plan.\n  The plan was unable to make a timely decision about the care this \npatient needed. The broken bone in her elbow required an operation by \nan orthopaedic surgeon. The patient's health plan did not authorize the \noperation in the hospital where the patient was located. They denied \nthis care because the hospital was not in its network, even though \nthere was a qualified orthopaedic surgeon available.\n  After several phone calls, a transfer was arranged to another \nhospital. Unfortunately, the patient did not leave the hospital \nemergency room for almost 12 hours.\n  When the patient arrived at the second hospital, the orthopaedic \nsurgeon looked at the complexity of the broken bone and decided he \ncould not perform the operation. The patient, therefore, had to be \ntransferred to a third hospital, where the operation was finally \nperformed.\n  Let's look at the extra costs involved in this case. The patient had \ntwo ambulance rides and two extra evaluations in hospitals. The patient \nalso laid in the emergency room with a painful broken bone for 12 hours \nbefore being transferred. During this time, the emergency room was very \nbusy and the staff had to continue to care for new patients as they \narrived.\n  So why did this occur? In this case, the problem occurred because the \nplan was unable to make a timely decision about the poststabilization \ncare this patient needed.\n  This should not be how we in this country take care of patients with \na medical emergency. I hope Republicans will join with us to pass a \nreally prudent layperson standard for emergencies.\n  I urge my colleagues to allow us to have an open debate on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We need to have this debate. Americans want \nprotections in their health plans. Americans want a system that \nbalances the needs for access, quality, and cost control in their \nhealth care.\n  Before I close, I just want to mention how delighted I am to hear my \ncolleagues talk about the needs of the uninsured in America. If they \nare serious\n\n[[Page S7571]]\n\nabout working to address the problem we have with 43 million uninsured \nAmericans, I obviously look forward to working with them. Once we have \nestablished basic, uniform rights in health care, we should return to \nthe equally important task of providing access to health care for the \nuninsured in America.\n  It seems important that universal access to adequate health care \nshould be our goal. But unless we recognize the importance of rights in \nhealth care, our constituents may end up with access to a system that \nis indifferent to both their suffering and their rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to call the attention of the Senate \nto a couple of items that relate to an appropriations bill we will be \nmarking up this afternoon in about half an hour in the Senate \nAppropriations Committee.\n  We are going to mark up three bills. I will be there as a member of \nthat committee. One of the bills deals with the District of Columbia. I \nhave spoken on the floor in recent weeks about an issue dealing with \nthe criminal justice system in the District of Columbia. I want to \ncomment on it again in light of a news story in today's paper, this \nThursday morning's Washington Post.\n  Some while ago, a young boy was rollerblading in the District of \nColumbia--a matter of weeks ago--and he was hit and killed by a car \nthat then sped away. That car allegedly was driven by a man who was \narrested, Shane DeLeon. He was arrested and put in jail and then, of \ncourse, let out of jail, as is so often the case these days.\n  Shane DeLeon, it says in the paper today, walked away from custody. \nIt says:\n\n       The man charged in the hit-and-run death of an American \n     University student walked away from a District halfway house \n     Tuesday and remained free last night. . . .\n\n  I want to read a couple of paragraphs because it describes, I think, \nthe chronic problem in the criminal justice system in the District of \nColumbia and, I should say, elsewhere as well.\n\n       Shane Simeon DeLeon failed to return to the Community \n     Correctional Center on New York Avenue NE by his 11 p.m. \n     curfew, according to D.C. Department of Corrections \n     officials. [He] was allowed out of the facility from 7 a.m. \n     to 11 p.m. to remodel the basement of his girlfriend's home \n     on MacArthur Boulevard in Northwest Washington. . . .\n       This is the third time [this fellow] has broken curfew. The \n     first two times, he was under home detention.\n\n  Now he walks away again, this fellow who is facing second-degree \nmurder charges.\n  I have spoken on the floor a lot about a case that was in the news a \ncouple of weeks ago. I spoke about this case some years ago on a number \nof occasions and then again a couple of weeks ago. It is the case \ninvolving the murder of a young woman, Bettina Pruckmayr. Bettina \nPruckmayr was a young attorney here in Washington, DC. She was abducted \nlate at night and forced to go to an ATM machine and forced to withdraw \nmoney; and then her murderer, Leo Gonzales Wright, stabbed her over 30 \ntimes in a brutal murder.\n  It turns out, a couple of weeks ago, after this murderer was \nsentenced to Federal prison--3 years later, they discovered he had not \nbeen put in Federal prison, he was still out at Lorton. The Federal \njudge was justifiably angry, wondering, why couldn't they even get that \nright to send this murderer to Federal prison? My understanding is, he \nis in Federal prison now.\n  But the story in today's paper about a fellow facing second-degree \nmurder charges simply walking away--he was allowed, by the way, while \nfacing second-degree murder charges, to go help remodel the basement of \nhis girlfriend's house from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.--why is a fellow facing \nmurder charges walking around, remodeling his girlfriend's basement?\n  It is the same story as that of Leo Gonzales Wright. What was he \ndoing walking around on the evening that he eventually murdered Bettina \nPruckmayr? Here is a man who robbed a convenience store and shot the \nconvenience store owner; he robbed a cab driver and murdered the cab \ndriver; and then he was sentenced to prison for a minimum of 20 years--\nnot to be let out before 20 years--and he was let out nearly 5 years \nearly, despite the fact that in prison he had 33 different violations \nfor assault and drugs and weapons. Then he was let out on the streets 5 \nyears before his sentence ended, and, while on the streets, he \ncommitted theft and tested positive for drugs. When he was brought \nbefore the parole board, this fellow, who was a twice-convicted \nmurderer, was told: No; you can stay out on the streets on parole. \nTaking drugs as a violent offender is not serious enough to put you \nback in prison. Theft is not serious enough to put you back in prison.\n\n  So the message is: The authorities say that a violent offender can \ncommit a theft, can take drugs, can remain on the streets, and remain \non the streets in a manner that allowed him, on that fateful evening, \nto kill this young attorney named Bettina Pruckmayr.\n  A couple of weeks ago, 3 years after this man was sentenced to \nFederal prison, the Federal judge found out he was not in Federal \nprison at all--he was in Lorton--and the judge said: What on Earth is \ngoing on?\n  I looked into it in order to find out what happened. It is a mess. At \nevery step along the way, this inspector's general report--which is \nsome 50 pages long--shows one massive problem after another. This \nsystem is completely devoid of common sense. It is a system that says \nto the fellow who was up for second-degree murder: You go ahead and fix \nyour girlfriend's basement. We'll give you every day, all day, from 7 \na.m. to 11 p.m. to do that. Then he walks away on them, and they are \nsurprised. Or a system that says to another fellow: Yes, we know you \nare violent, we know you are a murderer, but it is fine if you are on \nthe streets taking drugs, and it does not matter if you are convicted \nof theft or charged with theft. That is a system, in my judgment, that \nis defective.\n  I intend to raise some questions at the markup today with respect to \nthe District of Columbia. I notice my colleague from Illinois has come \nto the floor. He has raised questions that go directly to these issues.\n  This is the District of Columbia that says: We have a lot of money we \nwant to offer for tax cuts. They do not have enough money, apparently, \nto have prison space to keep people convicted of murder in prison.\n  The Senator from Illinois has asked the questions now a good number \nof times publicly: What about that? What about your priorities? What \nabout your responsibility to the memory of Bettina Pruckmayr, who was \nmurdered by someone who should have never been on the streets to murder \nanybody? He should have been in prison, but he was let out early.\n  This fellow Leo Gonzales Wright was in Lorton Prison. Do you know why \nhe was let out early from there? Because he apparently was allowed into \nthe prison system to change his own records; so when they looked at his \nrecords, they had all been altered to say he was a good guy when, in \nfact, he was a bad guy. It is just unforgivable what is happening on \nthe streets in this country, especially in the District of \nColumbia. And one additional point: It is not just there. There is a \ncounty adjacent to the District of Columbia in which two fellows are, I \nbelieve, on trial to be convicted for the murder of a couple people in \na Mr. Donut shop. I asked my staff to look at the backgrounds of those \nfolks. It seems the same two people carjacked a fellow on the \ninterstate around this beltway, the same two people just months ago \ncarjacked someone in a violent carjacking out on the streets so they \ncould murder a couple people at a Mr. Donut late at night.\n\n  Day after day we read this, especially in the District of Columbia. I \nam sick and tired of it.\n  I will offer a couple amendments. I will consult carefully with my \nfriend from Illinois, who is the ranking member on that subcommittee. \nOne of the amendments is, if you are on parole in the District of \nColumbia for a violent crime and you are picked up on the streets as \nhaving taken drugs, you ought to find that your next address is back in \nthat same jail cell. We ought not have violent criminals on parole \ntaking drugs and then have parole officers say that is alright; that it \nis a minor infraction.\n\n[[Page S7572]]\n\n  If you are a violent offender on parole taking drugs, my friend, your \naddress ought to be a jail cell, once again, to the end of your full \nterm.\n  I intend to offer that amendment. I hope that is the sort of thing we \ncan get passed.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for raising this.\n  In just a few moments, we will go to the Appropriations Committee and \nconsider the D.C. appropriations. I ask my friend from North Dakota to \nfollow with me for just a moment on some of the facts that we will \nface.\n  I do love the District of Columbia. I went to college and law school \nhere, and it is a beautiful city. I think anyone who has been here more \nthan 15 minutes knows that it has serious problems when it comes to the \ncrime rate, when it comes to the status in schools. The District of \nColumbia has an annual budget of about $5 billion; $1.8 billion comes \ndirectly from the Federal Government. We are big players when it comes \nto the District's budget.\n  The District of Columbia's city council has decided that things are \ngoing so well in this city, when it comes to crime and schools, they \nhave $59 million that they are going to give back to the residents in \ntax cuts.\n  To a staffer of mine the other day, at the end of the day, I said: Do \nyou need a ride home?\n  He said: I only live 5 blocks from the Capitol Building of the United \nStates. I ordinarily walk, but last week a woman was stabbed to death \nin my neighborhood 5 blocks from the United States Capitol Building.\n  I said: Do you know what you need in your neighborhood, according to \nthe D.C. city council? You need a tax break.\n  Let's get serious about it. The first thing the residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia want is safety in the streets and quality schools. \nThis D.C. city council has turned its back on that. They said: We are \ngoing to acknowledge the fact that we are the worst in the Nation when \nit comes to infant mortality, the worst in the Nation when it comes to \nthe basic standards of judging children, and yet we are going to stop \nspending money and helping these kids. We are going to give it back in \na tax cut.\n  Then they turn around, wanting an additional $17 million for a \nscholarship program, money that is going to be taken out of the Labor-\nHHS appropriations.\n  What could that money do? It is money that goes to the National \nInstitutes of Health for medical research. They want $17 million of \nthat to spend on a scholarship program, while they give away $59 \nmillion.\n  I concur with the Senator from North Dakota. I have never felt it was \nmy congressional responsibility to be the mayor of this town or a \nmember of the city council. But when they are absorbing Federal money, \nwe have the right to say: You have done something which is shameful. To \ngive away $59 million worth of problems that this city faces is just \nunconscionable.\n\n  If you walked into any Senate office or any House office and asked \nthe staff members: Has anybody here been mugged, has your home been \nbroken into or your car? You would be shocked. It is a common \noccurrence in this town.\n  We have to do something about it. I salute the Senator from North \nDakota. I hope that he is aware of the debate we are about to have in a \nfew moments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am fully aware of that debate and in full support of \nthe statements the Senator from Illinois has made.\n  Let me put up a chart that shows what has sparked my ire. I am not \nsomeone who comes to the floor to beat up on the District of Columbia, \nnor is the Senator from Illinois. I have simply had a bellyful of this \nbehavior by folks in the criminal justice system in the District of \nColumbia.\n  This headline ran a couple of weeks ago: Killer Sent to Wrong Prison \nafter Second Murder. This headline is referring to Leo Gonzales Wright \nwho murdered Bettina Pruckmayr. Three years after he was sentenced by \nthe Federal judge, they still couldn't get him in the cell that he was \nsupposed to be in.\n  The point is, the inspector general report--I urge all my colleagues \nto read it--shows a system that is totally corrupt. It portrays a \nsystem that says to a violent murderer: You are out on parole. You are \nout early. You can take drugs. You can be charged with theft, and we \ndon't care. You get to stay on America's streets.\n  A city that can't keep violent offenders off its streets and behind \nbars is a city that can't keep its streets safe. American citizens \ndeserve better, especially in America's Capital, Washington, D.C.\n  The recommendations of the inspector general are really interesting. \nI read this at home the other night. When I finished reading it, I \nshook my head and said: This is such an incompetent system. It doesn't \ntake rocket science to know what you have to do. When someone holds up \na convenience store and shoots the owner, when the same person then \ndecides to rob and murder a cabdriver, and then when that person is let \nout of prison early and decides to take drugs and steal, does that \nperson belong on our streets so that this wonderful young attorney \nBettina Pruckmayr can show up at an ATM machine one night, only to be \nsavagely murdered by this animal? Does this person belong on the \nstreets? Of course not.\n  Who was responsible for putting this person on the street? The \ncriminal justice system. Person after person after person failed, and \nthe result is a dead woman, a dead, innocent, young woman, full of \npromise, who met a killer on the streets of our Nation's Capital.\n  I say again, when we come to the floor--I will go to the \nAppropriations Committee in 15 minutes--I will offer two amendments, \none of them dealing with drugs. I would have thrown this man back in \nprison immediately, and he wouldn't have been anywhere near Bettina \nPruckmayr to be able to murder her that evening. I would have said: If \nhe is found with drugs, as he was repeatedly, having been a formerly \nconvicted murderer, that man goes back to a prison cell. That is just \ncommon sense.\n  Do you know, the policy of the District of Columbia was that drug use \nby someone on parole was not a serious enough offense to put them back \nin prison? What on earth can they be thinking? They are going to give a \ntax cut, but they don't have enough money for prison cells to keep \nviolent people behind bars.\n  Shame on those people. Shame on those people who make those \njudgments. The murder of a young woman and so many others are on their \nshoulders.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We represent, I believe, the two States with the lowest \ncrime rates in the country. Our States are about the population of the \nDistrict of Columbia. I expect either one of us could pick out a 2- or \n3-day period last year or in this past calendar year in the District of \nColumbia where more murders occurred than our States put together for \nthe year.\n  Without sounding like a poster child for the gun lobby or something \nelse, I express one frustration, also watching what has happened in \nthis recent tragic killing of a grandmother, when what appears to be, \nat least if the news accounts are accurate, people arguing over whose \ncar bumped into whose car, and suddenly there is a gang on the street \narmed like the marines landing in Kosovo, and now with the nationwide \nspotlight on this crime, the police go into action and suddenly start \nconfiscating guns.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota: Is it not his understanding, as \nit is mine, that the District of Columbia has virtually the toughest \ngun laws in the country? The carrying of these weapons or possession of \nthem is a crime. Yet have you seen an awful lot of people go to prison \nfor carrying these weapons, even though they are found with them all \nthe time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. In answer, I think there is a leniency here in this \nsystem that is unforgivable. The case that the Senator from Vermont \njust mentioned is referenced in the newspaper today. That case is the \ngrandmother who was trying to grab these children and get them off the \nstreets as the bullets began to fly last Monday. It says in this same \nstory this morning that Derrick Jackson, age 19, has been charged with \nthe first-degree-murder death of Helen Foster-El by stray bullets on \nMonday night. He had walked away\n\n[[Page S7573]]\n\nfrom a juvenile home in April. He had been placed there in connection \nwith juvenile drug and stolen vehicle charges. I will bet you that if \nyou and I take the time to try to get this person's record, we will \nfind a record as long as your arm and that person ought not to have \nbeen anywhere near that neighborhood to be able to fire a gun.\n  I will bet you that the record would justify, by any standard of any \nreasonable person, that this young man ought to have been in jail. But \nhe was out on the streets with a gun. I don't have the record, but this \nis a guy who walked away from a halfway house or a juvenile home in \nApril. Now it is almost the end of June.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield further, since he has already \nread that, if he will look at some of the numbers of unclosed cases, or \nthe number of times when leads are not followed up, the number of \ncomplaints I have received in my office, and people making complaints \nto police departments that have never been followed up, witnesses never \nsought--we spend an awful lot more in law enforcement in this city than \nthey do in the whole States of North Dakota and Vermont. There are a \nlot more people, a lot more officers available. I know many of them do \nexcellent work, and they put their lives on the line, and some lose \ntheir lives. But I also know there are a lot of areas in this city \nwhere drug selling is out in the open and a matter of public knowledge, \nand where illegal possession of weapons is a matter of open knowledge, \nand nothing happens until the spotlight of one of these terrible \ntragedies occurs.\n  So I appreciate the Senator's comments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me make one final point. There is one other part of \nthis, the case I have described, the Leo Gonzales Wright case.\n  I have always thought that in this country, in our criminal system, \nwe ought to have two standards, one for violent offenders and one for \nnonviolent offenders. In every State, violent offenders should never \nget time off for good behavior. Your prison cell ought to be your \naddress until the day your sentence ends, period, no time off. Leo \nGonzales Wright earned nearly 5 years of time off for good behavior \ndespite 33 violations in prison for assault, weapons, and drugs--5 \nyears off for good behavior. He should not have been on the streets.\n  I have a bill that is simple. I have never been able to get it \npassed. It says this: If any jurisdiction in this country lets a \nviolent offender out of prison early and that person commits a violent \ncrime during the time they would have been serving a sentence, then the \ngovernment--the city, county, or State that let him out--is responsible \nto the victim or the victim's family and doesn't have immunity from a \nlawsuit. This bill would force them make a calculation before sending a \nviolent offender back to the street as to, what might this cost us in \nterms of what that offender might do to a potential victim? I would \nlike to see Congress pass that at some point. I am going to continue to \ntry.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is no community in America that \nis suffering more difficulty today than rural America in agribusiness. \nMy State is a very large agriculture-based State, and ever since I have \nbeen in the Senate, we have been struggling with drought, flood, low \ncommodity prices--you name it. It has been very unsettling to families \nthat have been in agribusiness for over a hundred years, that are \nfacing very difficult personal decisions about their ability to stay in \nbusiness.\n  Now, to be candid, by now we should have passed S. 1233, a $60.7 \nbillion budget authority for agriculture, rural development, and \nnutrition programs. The bill contains provisions for food stamps, child \nnutrition, payments to the Federal Crop Insurance Program, Commodity \nCredit Corporation, and discretionary spending for agricultural \npurposes. It is the people's business because agriculture is the \ncornerstone of our national security, our quality of life, and our \neconomy. In our State, agriculture is one-third of the economy, and \nacross the Nation it approaches 30 percent.\n  We are stalled for political purposes. We ought to be doing the \nNation's business. We ought to be proceeding with this agriculture \nbill. This is not the time to have a debate between two very different \nviews about how to deal with the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am stunned \nthat those on the other side of the aisle would choose agriculture--\nwhich, as I said, is so terribly stressed--and use that as a vehicle to \ntry to create a political debate in the Senate. I have letters from our \nschool of agriculture, I have documentation of the massive losses that \nhave occurred in agriculture in our State, and we look to this \nlegislation to be a part of the relief, a part of stabilizing \nagriculture in our State.\n  Last year alone, we lost $700 million in agriculture interests in the \nState of Georgia. I will tell you what this reminds me of. It is an \nuncaring kind of way of dealing with this legislation. It reminds me of \nthe way the administration handled disaster relief. In the omnibus bill \nof 1998, we gave the Department of Agriculture $3 billion for disaster \npayments, and October went by, and November went by, December, January, \nFebruary, March, April, May, and June; and finally, 9 months later, we \ngot disaster payments into the hands of people who have long since \npassed financing requirements and planning decisions and the like. And \nhere we are once again trying to deal with this critical bill, and we \nhave basically a political filibuster underway that can do nothing but \nadd to more anxiety and worry in this very important economic sector of \nour country dealing with thousands upon thousands of families every \nday.\n  We ought to be on with the business of getting this agricultural \nappropriations bill handled. We will find the right time to handle \nthese other issues. But right now, it is time for the people's \nbusiness, and it happens to be a group of people who are in deep \ntrouble in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A quorum is present.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate has a responsibility, obviously, \nto do the people's business. Up until a couple of days ago, we were \ndoing pretty good this year. We had already moved four appropriations \nbills. We had taken up a number of important issues including the Y2K \nliability bill, the financial services modernization, the national \nmissile defense bill, education. We were moving right along. But all of \na sudden a couple of days ago that stopped.\n  Why is that? It is because the Democrats--Senator Kennedy, Senator \nDaschle, Senator Feinstein, and others--want to offer an unrelated bill \nto agriculture appropriations. That bill is the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Going back to last fall, we have talked many times about finding a \nway to have that legislation considered, trying to come up with some \ntimeframe that is fair to all. Consistently we have had requests for \nmany amendments. I don't know, I think it started off with the \nDemocrats saying they had to have 40 amendments. I believe at some \npoint it got down to 20, although it is not clear to me they would even \nagree to limit it to 20.\n  On the other hand, we have argued we have a good Patients' Bill of \nRights bill, one that was developed by a task force chaired by Senator \nNickles which included Senator Collins, Dr. Bill Frist, Senator \nSantorum, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Roth. A really good group \nworked very hard to come up with a good bill, with some provisions for \nprotections of patients' rights, with provisions for an appeals process \nwhen there is a disagreement with a decision within a managed care \nfacility, both internally and externally. It is a good bill. We are \nprepared to vote on that.\n  The Democrats, on the other hand, have a bill of their own that takes \na very different approach, and a big part of it is lawsuits will be the \nfinal arbiter on how these health decisions will be made.\n  We say if you have a good package, let's vote on yours. We will vote \non ours. This week we, in effect, did that. We voted not to table our \nproposal, and we voted to table the underlying Kennedy amendment.\n  We have tried very hard to come up with a way for this to be \nconsidered without it becoming an obstruction to the people's business.\n  What is the people's business? The bill pending is the agriculture \nappropriations bill, $60.7 billion for the farmers in America. But it \ngoes beyond just farmers. It also includes such programs as food \nstamps, women, infants, children, school breakfast, and lunch programs. \nIt is a broad bill and an important bill. At a time when our farmers \nhave lost markets and are having a tough time, we are tied up and \ndelaying the agriculture appropriations bill with an unrelated measure.\n  In addition to that, we have ready for consideration the \ntransportation appropriations bill, the State-Justice-Commerce \nappropriations bill, the foreign operations appropriations bill, and I \nbelieve in short order the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill.\n  In addition to that, we have very important legislation such as the \nintelligence authorization bill we need to have considered, now that we \nhave passed the defense authorization and appropriations bills. We have \nthe very critical question of how are we going to deal with the nuclear \nespionage at our labs around the country. We have an important proposal \npending on that. We have several very important appropriations bills \nthat we need to move. They are the people's business.\n\n  The point is, we want to have our other measure considered. We have \ngone back and forth. Senator Daschle and I have worked through the last \n36 hours or so. We have gone back and forth with alternative \nsuggestions. We started out 2 nights ago saying maybe we can do it this \nWednesday and Thursday and be through with it Thursday night. That did \nnot get very far.\n  Then we said, how about if we take it up July 12 when we come back \nfrom the recess and we will spend that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday and by the close of business on Thursday we will have \ncompleted this debate.\n  Maybe some people say that is not enough time. That is a pretty long \nperiod of time for debate on a legislative measure, and it is a long \nperiod of time when you take into consideration the other work that we \nreally must do for the people in passing appropriations bills, in \ncomplying with the budget resolution, and the reconciliation bill to \nallow us to return some of the tax overpayment to the working people of \nthis country. That is a long period of time in the middle of the summer \nwhen our focus really needs to be on considering the appropriations \nbills that provide what the people in this country need from their \nGovernment, if you are convinced these appropriations bills do that.\n  We talk about agriculture and transportation. You can certainly argue \nthat. Foreign operations, here is a time when we have very delicate \nrelations around the world. We just passed the State Department \nauthorization bill after about 3 years of trying. It seems now we need \nto provide the funds that go along with that. So we went back and \nforth.\n  I want to read the latest iteration as of 6:30 last night, June 23, \nof what we\n\n[[Page S7575]]\n\noffered to try to get this matter considered by itself and in a \nreasonable period of time. Apparently, for a variety of reasons, we \nhave not been able to get this agreed to or worked out:\n\n       I ask unanimous consent----\n\n  I am not asking this, I am just reading the consent request because \nit is obvious there would be objection to it----\n\n     that the text of amendment No. 703, as modified, or 702--\n\n  That would be either the Kennedy version or the Republican version--\n\n     be introduced by the majority leader, or his designee, and \n     become the pending business at 1 p.m. on Monday, July 12, \n     1999, with a vote occurring on final passage at the close of \n     business Thursday, July 15, and the bill be subject to the \n     following agreement: That all amendments in order to the bill \n     be relevant to the subject of amendment No. 703 or 702 or \n     health care tax cuts, and all first-degree amendments be \n     offered in an alternating fashion, and all first and second-\n     degree amendments be limited to 2 hours each to be equally \n     divided in the usual form.\n\n  Two hours for the first-degree amendment; 2 hours for the second-\ndegree amendment. I don't know quite what that adds up to over a period \nof a week, but a lot of amendments could be considered under that \nperiod of time. I think 2 hours is a reasonable period of time when you \ntake into consideration the significance of some of the issues that \nwould be debated. In some instances it would not take 2 hours; it might \nnot take 30 minutes.\n  I assume that somebody is going to offer an amendment both sides will \nlike, and we will say: Yes, we'll take that. So it would not take that \nlong.\n\n       I further ask consent that second degree amendments be \n     limited to 1 second degree amendment per side, with no \n     motions to commit or recommit in order, or any other act with \n     regard to the amendments in order, and that just prior to \n     third reading of the bill, it be in order for the majority \n     leader, or his designee, to offer a final amendment, with no \n     second degree amendments in order.\n       I further ask consent that following passage of the bill, \n     that should the bill, upon passage, contain any revenue blue \n     slip matter that the bill remain at the desk and that when \n     the Senate receives the House companion bill, that the Senate \n     proceed to its immediate consideration, all after the \n     enacting clause be stricken, and the text of the Senate \n     passed bill be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill as amended \n     be passed, [and] the Senate insist on its amendment. . . .\n\n  Very simply, that is to avoid the blue slip problem with the House of \nRepresentatives of a measure we pass that has revenue in it and to make \nsure this matter does not just die aborning here.\n\n       I further ask consent that no other amendments relative to \n     the Patients' Bill of Rights be in order, for the remainder \n     of the first session of the 106th Congress.\n       Once again, let's have the debate, have the amendments. \n     Let's have a vote--win or lose, whichever side. Then you move \n     on.\n       I further ask consent that at any time on Thursday, July \n     15, it be in order for the Majority Leader, if he deems \n     necessary, to offer a comprehensive amendment containing \n     several provisions, that the amendments/titles therein be \n     considered en bloc and a vote occur on or in relation to that \n     amendment, with no second degree amendments in order, prior \n     to 3rd reading and the offering of the last amendment by the \n     Majority Leader.\n\n  That is traditionally the way it has happened. The majority leader--\nthe majority gets to offer the last amendment or substitute, for that \nmatter.\n\n       Finally, [we] announce . . . the two Leaders [will work \n     together to agree] to pass three to five of the remaining \n     appropriations bills available, prior to the July 4th Recess.\n\n  And we listed the appropriations bills.\n  I wanted to make sure everybody knew that--both the Democrats and \nRepublicans, and members of the media, and our constituency--because I \nthink it is a fair proposal. Basically, it is 4 days on this subject, \nwith designated periods of time, with an end date involved--Thursday, \nJuly 15.\n  Amendments could be offered. I do not know how many that would \nprovide for, but I presume as many as 16, maybe more, depending on how \nlong it takes on some of them and how much time would be yielded back.\n  Let me just say, there is not 100-percent agreement on our side of \nthe aisle that we should do this. But at some point you have to come to \nan agreement of how you proceed and how you get an issue considered, \nhow you get it voted on. This seemed fair to me.\n  Frankly, I do not even like the idea of putting time limits on these \namendments. I think we ought to have a jump ball, call it up on Monday, \nthe 12th, and offer amendments. Let's debate them and vote and, when we \nget to the 15th and have final passage. But there was a feeling, to \nsome degree on both sides, that we ought to have some time limit \nspecified in that agreement.\n  I think we are dealing here with sort of a Molotov minuet. Everything \nwe have tried to do, we are being met with: No. Nyet. We can't do that. \nNo. We can't do something else.\n  I began to wonder, do we want to address this issue or do we just \nwant the issue? I have been through that before.\n  I can remember we had the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill a few years ago--3 \nyears ago--and as long as everybody was all dug in and saying, we are \nnot going to consider that, we are not going to do this and not going \nto do that, nothing happened. Once we finally said, we are going to do \nit, we did it and moved on.\n  I think that is what we ought to do--move on here, have a focused \ndebate, have some amendments, vote on them, and be done with it.\n  Where are we at this particular time?\n  We do have pending, I guess, an amendment by the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, that she feels very strongly about. I would \nlike to get a time agreement on that amendment and have it considered \nand vote on it and move on.\n  We have a Frist second-degree amendment by Senator Frist from \nTennessee that will be offered.\n\n  But I also should make this point: All of this is legislating on \nappropriations bills. All of that is possible under the rules because \nof a ruling that occurred a few years ago which allows this sort of \nlegislating on appropriations bills. I have been heckled in the past: \n``We ought to change that,'' on the Democratic side and on the \nRepublican side. And I think we should.\n  People on both sides of the aisle might say: Wait a minute, that is \nthe only way I can get my legislation considered. Look, that is why we \nhave authorization bills. We--both sides--abuse this. We ought to stop \nit. That is what contributes to the difficulty we have in passing \nappropriations bills now every year, because we are busy legislating \nthings on appropriations bills that we might not be able to get through \na committee or might not be able to get on an authorization bill.\n  Somebody said: Well, how would we do it? A novel idea: Go back and do \nit the way we always did it, on authorization bills, not on \nappropriations bills. I think you could argue back and forth whether \nthat benefits the majority or the minority. I do not think we ought to \nget into that on something such as this. It is the right thing to do in \neliminating this procedure. We should not be having legislation, a \nwhole bill, put on the agriculture appropriations bill.\n  So that is sort of where we are.\n  I propose we go forward and try to get some indication of where the \nvotes are, have some debate on the point of order or legislation on \nappropriations bills, have the debate on the Feinstein amendment, have \nsome debate on the Frist amendment, and then let's have some votes and \nsee where we are. But I think we need to make up our minds: Are we just \ngoing to say no or are we going to move forward?\n  We could still do a lot of work next week that would be in the \npeople's interests. Last week we passed six bills and made a big start \non State Department authorization. We can do that next week. We could \ngo out next week having passed three or four appropriations bills, \nperhaps the intelligence authorization bill, and several nominations.\n  We are now beginning to have some nominations come on to the calendar \nout of the Commerce Committee and out of the Judiciary Committee and \nout of the Foreign Relations Committee. In fact, I saw we had about 8 \nor 10 that came on last night, and more have come on. We could wind up \nwith a burst of activity that would serve the Senate well. It would \nserve the American people well.\n  Quite frankly, Senator Daschle and I like to do that, because we \nagreed a long time ago, when you do your work, everybody wins, but when \nyou dig in and just find ways to continue the Molotov minuet and say \nno, everybody loses.\n  So I think we ought to move forward. I urge my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side to consider how we can get this done. Let's get this \nagreement\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\nworked out, and let's move on with these very important appropriations \nbills.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do have some things I need to do. I know \nSenator Daschle would like to respond.\n  Does the Senator wish to ask a question or to respond on his own time \nor I should just yield and keep the floor and wait for you to finish?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, certainly the majority leader can----\n  Mr. LOTT. I do have some work I need to do.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I do want to respond. If you want to finish --go ahead.\n  Mr. LOTT. Why don't I do this because I think it would be more \nappropriate. Let me just yield to Senator Daschle so he can respond. \nWhen he finishes, I will go back and do this procedural work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. President, let me respond to a number of the comments made by the \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  He certainly is right in that we have attempted to work our way \nthrough this for some time now. But I will say, if this is a Molotov \nminuet, there is only one side dancing. And in the Senate, both sides \nhave to dance to make progress. In the Senate, if we are going to have \na dance, it takes both sides to make it work. We are getting shut out.\n  That is what this is about. We are shut out. We want to see progress, \nand there are colleagues on the other side who want to continue to shut \nus out. We are left with no recourse. We will minuet with anybody so \nlong as there is somebody there to dance with.\n  Let me just talk about the lament of our distinguished majority \nleader that this is an amendment to an unrelated bill. Just last week, \nSenator Murkowski offered the Glacier Bay legislation to the steel \nbill, and I listened very carefully to see if there was one Senator on \nthe other side who would object to bringing up a glacier amendment on a \nsteel bill. It was a cold steel bill, but it was not a glacier bill.\n  Yet there we were, unrelated legislation offered with no objection.\n  The majority leader understandably talked about the ruling on the \nenergy appropriations supplemental. Just for the Record, he made \nmention that it was a ruling. It actually wasn't a ruling. It was the \nmajority overturning the ruling. Fifty-four Republicans, actually 57 \npeople, but 54 Republicans, 100 percent of the Republican caucus, \noverruled the Chair when the Chair ruled, on March 16, 1995, that you \ncouldn't legislate on appropriations. One hundred percent of the \nRepublican caucus said: Yes, we can, and we are going to say to you, \nMr. President, we are overruling you.\n  Now we hear our colleagues saying: Oh, my goodness, we are \nlegislating on appropriations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment and the \nrollcall be printed for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Senate Voting Record--No. 107\n\n             [104th Congress, 1st Session, March 16, 1995]\n\n              Emergency Supplemental Appropriations, 1995\n\n                          (Endangered Species)\n\n                           Amendment No.: 336\n\n       Bill No.: H.R. 889.\n       Title: ``Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act, \n     1995.''\n       Subject: Hutchison appeal of the Chair ruling that the \n     Hutchison, et al., amendment, which rescinds $1.5 million \n     from amounts appropriated for the Fish and Wildlife Service \n     to make determinations regarding whether a species is \n     threatened or endangered, and whether a habitat is a critical \n     habitat under the Endangered Species Act; prohibits any \n     remaining funds designated for Resource Management, under the \n     Fish and Wildlife Service, from being used to make a final \n     determination that a species is threatened or endangered, or \n     that a habitat constitutes a critical habitat; and provides \n     that any court order requiring the Fish and Wildlife Service \n     to make determinations relating to species or habitat by a \n     date certain, shall not apply to the Service if funds are not \n     available to make those determinations by the date required \n     in the court order, violates Rule XVI of the Standing Rules \n     of the Senate. (Subsequently, the amendment was agreed to by \n     voice vote. See also Vote No. 106.)\n       Note: Rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate \n     prohibits the inclusion of new or general legislation in any \n     appropriations bill.

The majority leader has also said this is a good bill; \nthe Republican Patients' Bill of Rights is a good bill. We don't think \nso. But if it is such a good bill, what is wrong with just putting it \nbefore the Senate and having a good debate about a good bill? That is \nwhat we are supposed to do here. We are supposed to put legislation \ndown and have at it.\n  I have lamented several times that there are those in this Chamber \nwho believe that a good bill ought to be accompanied by a good rule. \nThe rule is, we will allow amendments if we like them. If you want that \nkind of an environment, run for the House of Representatives because \nthey have all kinds of rules like that. If you want to do it the way we \ndo it here, have at it. Let's have some good debate. Let's not say we \nare going to have to approve every amendment offered by our colleagues \nprior to the time we even agree to go to the bill. If it is a good \nbill, it ought to have a good debate.\n  The majority leader also read the unanimous consent request \nagreement. I will not in any way denigrate the effort that the majority \nleader has made to try to accommodate both sides. He has worked \ndiligently to make that happen. But let me just explain what is wrong \nwith that agreement as we see it.\n  First of all, it requires an end date. That, perhaps, is the most \nsignificant concern we have all had. I dare ask, could somebody come \nback and tell me when was the last time we said we will take up a bill \nwith an absolute guarantee that we will have an end date? We haven't \neven talked about--and it is murky--whether we are talking about final \npassage. I think we are, but we haven't agreed to that. There is just \nan end date. We would have to quit debating this at a time certain.\n  Well, in a body such as this, when we agree to consideration of a \nbill without any other rules than that, if we just say we are going to \nend this debate at a time certain, guess what happens? Anybody can take \nthe floor and monopolize the floor for days, if they want to. That is \nthe first problem.\n  The second problem is, as the distinguished majority leader \nindicated, under this proposal, each amendment would have 2 hours. That \nis right. He also noted that each amendment would have 2 second-\ndegrees, subject to 2 hours. By my calculation, sophisticated as it is, \nthat is 6 hours per amendment. One first-degree, 2 second-degrees, 2 \ntimes 3 is 6. If the majority leader were good enough to allow the \nSenate to go for 12 hours, that means 2 amendments per day. There are 3 \ndays. Two amendments per day, 2 times 3, ironically, once again, you \nget 6. It is amazing how this math works out. It always comes down to \n6. That is our problem.\n\n[[Page S7577]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me finish, and I will be happy to yield.\n  Six amendments. I know our colleagues on the other side say: \nCertainly, we wouldn't use all that time.\n  With that end date, who knows? As difficult as it has been to bring \nup amendments with second-degrees and with tabling motions, who knows \nhow long and how many amendments we will be able to bring up. That is \nthe problem.\n  Here are the concessions we have made in this agreement. In the \nSenate, you are able to bring up a farm bill on a peace treaty. But we \nsaid on this bill it has to be relevant. We will agree to relevancy. We \nsaid we may even agree to an end date.\n  Now, the majority says: We also are insisting, and it was in this \nagreement, we are insisting that you never talk about the Patients' \nBill of Rights until the next millennium. That is in here. What it says \nis, you can't bring it up in this entire Congress, but this entire \nCongress goes into the next millennium. So it is a gag rule until the \nnext millennium on the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Now, they did change it. They would acknowledge a willingness to \nchange it to the end of this session, but we couldn't talk about it \nanymore this session.\n\n  Then, of course, we have the question of how we resolve the \noutstanding issues on amendments. I have suggested that we leave it to \nthe two leaders to offer amendments without debate at the end. Say we \nrun up to the end of the time and somebody unfortunately has used all \nof the time and we are stuck here with 20 amendments and we have only \ndebated one, let's take the worst case scenario. I am stuck here with \nmy colleagues demanding that I protect them, and I have got 19 \namendments in my hands. I said: At least let us have a vote on that. No \ndebate; we will just have a vote. They wouldn't agree with that. No \ndebate. No votes.\n  Then the ultimate power the majority has are the two things that the \nmajority leader made reference to. The first is the power of the \nsecond-degree. Anything we lay down, they get to second-degree. And \nbecause they have 55 votes, usually they win. Second-degrees are \npowerful, and they have them. We have agreed to that.\n  The other thing they have, probably the most powerful of all, is the \nmajority leader's right of first recognition. Let's assume we have \nworked through all of this and we have won more than our share of \namendments. Well, the majority leader, as is his right--and it will \ncertainly be my right when we are in the majority--has the opportunity \nto say at the end: Well, I am going to lay down an amendment to wipe \nout everything we have done. That is my right as a majority leader. I \nam going to offer an amendment to wipe it all out.\n  He can do that, and that is in this agreement.\n  I must say, I have to ask, what are they afraid of? What is it about \nthese amendments they don't want to vote on? What is it about a \nprocedure that is so extraordinary if all we want to do is be able to \noffer the amendments and we will agree with most of everything that has \nbeen listed here?\n  I can't figure it out, but that is for them to share with the rest of \nus.\n  We have tried. I think my colleagues have given me a pretty clear \nindication where they are, as a result of a caucus this afternoon. They \nweren't very wild about this. I can understand why. We have 48 \namendments listed here that my colleagues have all said are important \nand ought to be determined in debate and in a vote.\n  There are those on the other side who say: We just don't have time. \nWell, we had time to take up 159 amendments on the defense \nauthorization bill. We had time to bring up 67 amendments on the \ndefense appropriations bill. We had time to bring up 104 amendments on \nthe budget resolution. We had time to bring up 66 amendments on the \nsupplemental appropriations. We had time to bring up 38 amendments on \nthe Ed-Flex bill. We even had time to bring up and dispose of 26 \namendments on the military bill of rights.\n  If we had 26 amendments that were legitimately considered on the \nmilitary bill of rights, how about 20 amendments on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights? That doesn't seem too much to ask to me.\n  So here we are. This is an important issue. It isn't going to go \naway. We can do it the easy way or the hard way. It appears that we are \ninclined to do it the hard way. We are prepared to do it any way. We \nwill minuet with anybody, but it takes two to tango. We are here to do \nour job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nNickles.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am really kind of surprised that our \ncolleagues have not agreed to the unanimous consent proposal that was \nmade last night. I am almost shocked because when you think about it--\nlet me put it in a little different perspective. We have about 8 weeks \nthat we are going to be in session before the end of September, before \nthe end of the fiscal year. We have a lot of work to do in that period \nof time.\n  The majority leader basically made a proposal that said you can have \nalmost all of a week. He said we will have a week off on the July 4th \nbreak, but then when we come back, you can have Monday, Tuesday, \nWednesday, and Thursday. That is 4 days not 3. It is 4 days. Under that \nproposal, amendments were limited to 2 hours each.\n  That is a major concession. A Senator has a right to have unlimited \ndebate on any amendment. Some of these amendments are very significant, \nas I think everybody would agree. Some of the proposals would change \nevery single health care plan in America. Some would be quite \nexpensive. Some would increase everybody's health care costs across the \ncountry. So we should not do that lightly. Probably we should not do it \nin 2 hours. If one amendment can increase every health care premium in \nthe country by 1 percent--and there are a couple proposals to do that--\nwe should discuss that because a lot of people are concerned about the \ngrowing cost of health care.\n  Under our proposal we said every amendment would have a 2-hour time \nlimit. Granted, every amendment could have two second-degree \namendments. I would be happy to modify that to one second-degree \namendment if you think that advances your cause. I would be happy to do \nthat. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure it out. I probably \nshould not say that; Senator Frist is here. I would not assume a \nsecond-degree amendment is exactly the same or that close to the first-\ndegree amendment.\n  So, really, if you have 2-hour time limits, if you have one amendment \nand a second-degree, that is two amendments every 4 hours. We don't \nhave to have a second-degree on every amendment. So you can have a lot \nof amendments in 4 days, a lot of them, probably to accomplish the \ndesires that you have expressed to us, which is that you wanted to have \n16 amendments or 20, or something similar to that. Some of those \namendments on the list, hopefully, would be agreed upon. I haven't \nlooked at the list. I haven't seen the list. But I am sure we can come \nto an agreement. I am also sure you don't have to spend 2 hours on \nevery single amendment.\n  So my point to my colleagues who have had amendments, and to the \nSenator from California, I mention this: You have the best deal you are \never going to get. It takes unanimous consent. A lot of Senators over \nhere don't want to give unanimous consent to 2 hours on some of these \namendments. That was in the proposal. I can't believe you didn't accept \nit, and then you said you want Friday, too. That is regrettable.\n  Other people have said, wait a minute, now you are talking about \nmaking a point of order that you should not legislate on an \nappropriations bill. The Senator from South Dakota says we have done it \nbefore--a couple weeks ago. We have a real problem. We changed the \nrules by an action on the floor, and a lot of us voted that way and \nsaid, wait a minute, that has not helped us manage the Senate. We have \nhad a rule in the Senate--a rule called rule XVI--which many times is \nabused and ignored; we legislate a lot on appropriations bills. But it \nmakes it very difficult to accomplish things. Maybe that rule should be \nreinstated. Both Democrats and Republicans know we should reinstate it. \nLet's leave the authorizing and legislating up to the\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\nauthorizing committees that have the experience and expertise to do so.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for a question, I noticed that \nthe Democratic leader held up a list of the vote and pointed out that \n54 Republicans voted to overrule rule XVI, and that three Democratic \nMembers, I guess, voted with us. Then that would mean that the balance \nof the Democratic membership--well into the 40s--voted for maintaining \nrule XVI. As I understand that argument, we are basically saying those \nguys were right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would think the Democratic membership would be happy \nabout that and would accept our representation that we made a mistake \nand that we are happy to acknowledge it, and we are going to own up to \nthat mistake and join with them and say they were right the first time \nwe voted on this and we will be with them this time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague. My point is that rule XVI is not a Democrat rule or a \nRepublican rule. It is a rule that has been abused in the past, and it \nought to be reinstated. It is a rule that would help us do our Nation's \nbusiness and finish our appropriations bills on time. We should leave \nthe legislating up to the appropriate authorizing committees. If the \nauthorizing committees aren't passing legislation we want, maybe we \nought to give them a jump start. It goes through the appropriate \nlegislative process.\n  I compliment Senator Crapo from Idaho, who suggested that we should \ndo this. He is right. Many of us suggested that we do this long before \nwe came into this dilemma. I told my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia this amendment doesn't belong on the agriculture \nappropriations bill. Granted, if you want to try to pass the so-called \nPatients' Bill of Rights, piece by piece, or body part by body part, on \nan agriculture appropriations bill, you are wasting everybody's time. \nThere is no way in the world an agriculture appropriations bill is \ngoing to come back with a Patients' Bill of Rights. Maybe you are \nmaking political statements, but you are not legislating effectively. \nIt is not going to become law.\n  The majority leader proposed that we will give you basically a week, \n4 legislative days, with time limits on amendments, which nobody has \nseen on either side. That is a tremendous gift. My colleague from \nDelaware is probably saying: I can't believe they didn't agreed to \nthat. Many people on the other side are saying: I can't believe you \nhaven't agreed.\n  I am not sure that offer is still going to be out here. I am troubled \nby that offer, I tell my colleague from South Dakota. I will tell you, \nthere is no way in the world you are going to get another UC after \ntoday. I will be shocked if you get one that will be this generous in \ntime, giving 4 legislative days to this particular issue.\n  I think I heard my colleague from South Dakota say: Wait a minute, we \nare being squeezed out and we haven't had the opportunity to bring up \nthese amendments.\n  I think the majority leader, in making this request yesterday, was \nbeing very sincere in saying, hey, this is a way we can do this--not \npiece by piece, not on legislative appropriations bills, but basically \nwe would give you 4 days beginning on July 12. I think that was a very \ngenerous offer. I wanted our colleagues to know that. If it is refused, \nthen obviously the Patients' Bill of Rights is not going anywhere this \nsession.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will just take 2 minutes. I thank my \ncolleague for his generosity. I can't tell you how bowled over I am by \nthe generosity of the Republican Party for allowing us 2 hours of \ndiscussion when, as I understood the rules, there is no limit on time, \nassuming you can get the floor. I am truly overwhelmed by that generous \noffer. And my friend from New Hampshire--\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may respond to that, I thought the best \nway to do it was not have any time limits.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am impressed.\n  The second thing I say to my friend from New Hampshire, I find his \nreasoning absolutely fascinating and appealing. It is a little like \nsaying, you know, we have been in the candy drawer for the last year, \nbut we are going to lock it now because we think you are right; there \nshould have been a lock on this drawer the whole time, as they walk \naround fat and happy and 300 pounds. I kind of like that.\n  I have been here 27 years, and I have never been as impressed with \nthe generosity of the other party as I have been today. I wanted to say \nthat and tell you how good it makes me feel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am glad to yield to the Senator from New \nHampshire for an appropriate response.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I also find it amusing that the Senator \nfrom Delaware would resist so aggressively our desire to join with him \non his original vote when he appears to have been right, and we are \nsaying: Gee, you were.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield. Put the candy back in the \ndrawer and I would be happy to help.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield briefly to the Senator from Idaho, who did a \nlot of work on this sort of issue when he was in the House, and he \nbelieves very strongly we should not be legislating on an \nappropriations bill. He was not here when we made this mistake. He is \nright, I think, that we should find a way to fix it.\n  By the way, we are going to have a vote on this issue this summer. I \nam going to find that sooner or later an amendment will come up in a \nway that I am going to appeal the ruling of the Chair, and we are going \nto fix this problem, or at least we are going to vote on it. I believe \nwhen we get a vote, it will actually pass. I hope some Democrats will \nvote for it. I think we changed the rule XVI inadvertently without \nactually understanding the impact of what we were doing. It has been \nsitting there for 4 or 5 years, and I think it is time that we do \nsomething about it. Would the Senator from Idaho like to comment on \nthat?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes, I would, very much. Mr. President, this is something \nthat I haven't said to the majority leader, but 6 years ago I ran for \nthe House of Representatives. In that campaign, I said that one of the \nthings I thought ought to be fixed in Congress was that we should stop \nCongress from considering legislation with amendments that have nothing \nto do with the underlying bill. I used to say they should not be \nallowed to put nongermane amendments on legislation. I was told that \nmaybe that is too big a word, ``nongermane.''\n  I think the American people understand that concept. In fact, the \nAmerican people understand that one of the problems we face in \nCongress--both the House and the Senate--is that when a piece of \nlegislation is considered, we don't keep it germane: we don't keep the \nfocus of the debate on that legislation. Americans understand that is \nwhy we run into budget problems.\n  They understand that is why we have so many difficult problems in \nCongress. They can't understand why we can't come to agreement. The \nfact is that it is a very sensible commonsense principle that used to \nbe in the rules of the Senate--that when a piece of legislation was \nbrought before the Senate, an amendment cannot be put on that \nlegislation unless the amendment is germane or relevant to that \nlegislation itself. It is something that all Americans have an easy \ntime understanding. Yet for some reason we have a difficult time here \nin the Senate honoring that basic principle.\n  This isn't an issue of who is right on this issue or who is right on \nthat issue or who is going to get political advantage out of this rule. \nIt is a rule that cuts the same way all the time, and whichever party \nor whichever interest would like to abuse it is the one that is going \nto have to face its consequences. But it is one which is a fair \nprinciple that will allow us to properly move forward.\n  I think it is very critical to recognize that today we are debating \nthis issue because we are trying to finish the appropriations process, \nand not run into a problem a few months from now when we are not able \nto get the Government's budgeting process finished, to keep our \ncommitment to the American people to keep a balanced budget, and maybe \neke out an opportunity for some tax relief and yet fulfill our \nresponsibilities to the important programs in the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\n  That is the debate today. Part of that debate we are on today is the \nagriculture appropriations bill. Yet we have stopped the functions of \nthe Senate now for several days, and the threat apparently is \npermanently, unless we shift the debate to another very important \ntopic--the health care issue.\n  No one disagrees that we should debate health care issues. We even \noffered that we can debate those issues. The offer simply has been \nlet's do it in an orderly and a principled way. Let's not allow \namendments that are unrelated to the subject of the underlying \nlegislation to be submitted.\n  I think it is very interesting that the argument was made just a \nminute ago that, well, you Republicans changed this rule a few years \nago. I didn't. I wasn't here a few years ago when that vote was taken. \nI was campaigning 6 years ago, so that shouldn't be the way this Senate \nshould operate, and it shouldn't be the way the House of \nRepresentatives operates. I have taken that position every session that \nI have been in this Congress. I take that position here today. We have \nto take the strong position on principles.\n  I think the American people will recognize that, and they know a lot \nof politics is being played as we debate here today. But if we will \nmake our decisions on principles by which the American people should be \ngoverned, and by which this House of our Congress should be governed, \nand then let those principles work their way out as the various \ninterests try to play politics on the issues, then at least we will \nknow that the process is fair. That is what this Senate ought to do and \nwhat it ought to return to.\n  I think it is time for us to resolve this impasse by returning to the \nkind of governing principles that we should follow as a Senate.\n  I thank the majority leader for yielding and giving me this \nopportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have some procedures I would like to go \nthrough, and then we will put in a time for morning business, and then \nSenators can engage on their own.\n  I think we should go on with the people's business of passing our \nappropriations bills.\n  I will continue to work with Senator Daschle and all of those who are \ninterested in trying to see if we can come up with some agreement to \nhandle a Patients' Bill of Rights separately and aside from the \nappropriations bills in a specified period of time and an acceptable \nway. That is obviously not easy. But we have found solutions to \ncomplicated problems before. Hopefully, we can find one this time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I want you to cooperate and find a \nway in which we can have a good debate with 20 amendments freestanding \nwith up-or-down votes. We can live with that. We could even live with a \ntime certain so long as we have a good debate on those amendments with \na vote on those amendments prior to the time we reach the end date. But \nthat is a simple request. It is a simple desire to find some \nresolution.\n  Our colleagues have been more than willing to cooperate in that \nregard. I hope we can do it. Our door is still open. We will work to \nsee if we can't find a way to accomplish that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thought we would be going back to the \namendment of the Senator from California. I hope those Americans who \nhave been watching the Senate for the last few minutes--and also for \nthe past few days--have no doubt in their minds what this is all about. \nThis hasn't got anything to do with the Senate rules at all or Senate \nprocedure. It is about a very fundamental and basic issue; it's about \nwhether the Senate of the United States is willing to take up the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, the core of which states that decisions \naffecting the medical treatment of an individual are going to be \ndecided by the doctors and trained medical professionals and not by \ngatekeepers or insurance adjusters or insurance accountants. That is \nthe basic issue.\n  We can talk about 2-hour amendments, 4 days, a week, we can talk \nabout four cloture motions, but the bottom line is that the Republican \nmajority is refusing to permit the Senate to go about the people's \nbusiness and schedule a Patients' Bill of Rights and permit the kind of \norderly procedure that has been a part of this body for almost 200 \nyears. That is what is going on here. Then they have the effrontery to \ntalk about how they are going to change the rules in order to try and \ndeny any opportunity to have a measure of this kind brought before the \nSenate.\n  Let's be very clear what this is about. This is about something which \nis basic and fundamental to the families in this country. For 2 days, \nthe Senator from California has been trying to bring up her amendment \nand get action on it. She has been precluded from doing so. The last \naction this evening--morning business at 5:10 on Thursday evening--has \nagain precluded a debate and vote on her amendment. She was here \nyesterday at 9:30 in the morning. It doesn't take a Member of the \nSenate to understand what is going on. She is being denied a vote on \nthe key issue of this whole debate, and that is whether insurance \ncompanies which cover American families are going to have to use a \ndefinition of what is ``medically necessary'' that will reflect the \nbest medical training, judgment, and skill in the United States. That \nis what her amendment is.\n  I have seen a lot of actions taken in order to preclude a Member of \nthe Senate from getting a vote, but to go through the process of having \nfour cloture votes next Monday, all in an attempt to deny the Senator \nfrom California an opportunity to get an up-or-down vote on her \namendment, is a very clear indication of what is going on.\n  This isn't about process. This is about substance. What kind of \nquality health care programs are we going to have in the United States \nof America?\n  We are being denied the opportunity to make that decision. We were \ndenied it last year and we are denied it again this year. We can listen \nto all the other bills left to do this year, and the Patients' Bill of \nRights should be one of them. We tried to get it up last year, but we \ncouldn't get it up under regular order. We have tried to get it up this \nyear, but, again, we can't get it up under regular order.\n  Earlier today, we heard reference to the process and procedure that \nwas followed during Kassebaum-Kennedy. Let me remind my colleagues that \nthe consent agreement to consider the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation was \nreached on February 6 of that year. It said the bill must be brought up \nno earlier than April 15 and no later than May 3, with no time \nagreements or limitations on amendments. And we passed it, unanimously, \nunder those terms.\n  It seems to me that the last two days provide a very clear example of \nthe majority effectively, I believe, abusing the process and procedures \nof the Senate, to deny the debate, discussion and the vote on an \nimportant issue in order to protect themselves on the issue of health \ncare. We should be protecting the American people. They are going to \nunderstand it. There can be no other interpretation of what is \nhappening on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I hate to see my colleague and friend \nfrom Massachusetts get so exercised--and he happens to be incorrect.\n  He has to know the rules of the Senate very well. The proposal the \nmajority leader was propounding is very fair. The Senator from \nCalifornia wants a vote on her amendment. I will be very frank. The way \nshe can get a vote on her amendment is to move forward and accept the \noffer already made. She could offer her amendment, for example, as a \nsecond-degree amendment. The Senator can get a vote on her amendment.\n  The way to do this is not on an appropriations bill. The Senator from \nIdaho is correct. We shouldn't be doing this on an appropriations bill. \nEveryone in the Senate knows it. This is not the way to legislate.\n  We ought to be able to manage the Nation's business in an appropriate \nmanner, not coming up with the Patients' Bill of Rights saying: We will \ndo this piece by piece; we have 40 pieces and we will do it on various \nbills, bills that are going to go to conferees.\n  Conferees know absolutely nothing about this issue. They have never \nhad a hearing on this issue, never dealt with this issue. Asking them \nto legislate on it is wrong. It is not going to happen. It will not \npass; it will not become law. We are wasting our time.\n  It is not anybody's intention on this side to filibuster, to deny the \nopportunity to offer amendments. The Senator can have the opportunity. \nYes, it is quite likely there will be amendments offered in the second-\ndegree, but a lot of amendments wouldn't be offered in the second-\ndegree. Likewise, second-degree amendments are available to Members on \nboth sides. That should be very apparent.\n  The point is I am a little frustrated by people saying we are not \nbeing treated fairly. The Senator has been offered a most generous \nproposal where Senators could offer lots and lots of amendments and get \nvotes on those amendments. It doesn't take a legislative genius to make \nthat happen.\n  I encourage our colleagues to see if we can't work together and make \nthis happen instead of offering this piece by\n\n[[Page S7581]]\n\npiece on an agriculture appropriations bill, even though we know it \nwill not become law.\n  I think there is a right way to legislate. This is not the right way \nto legislate. I hope we will work together to come up with something \nacceptable. I think there has been put off a more than generous \nproposal from on our side. We have been amending it for the last 2 \ndays, trying to accommodate legitimate concerns. Somebody said \noriginally it was 3 hours on each amendment. Some people say we \nshouldn't have any debate limit on amendments. I happen to think that \nis probably closer to correct when considering the magnitude and the \nscope of some of these amendments.\n  I urge our colleagues to step back and lower the rhetoric, not get so \nexercised, and see if we can't come up with an appropriate legislative \nway to solve this problem, see if we can't come up with a legitimate, \npositive, legislative approach that will help solve some of the \nproblems that have been acknowledged, without dramatic increases in \nconsumer costs and increases in the number of people who are uninsured. \nThat is what I prefer. The hotter the rhetoric gets, the less likely \nthat is to happen.\n  We need to work together in order to make positive legislation \nhappen. The Democrats alone will not pass legislation; the Republicans \nalone will not pass legislation. Nothing will become law if it is \nstrictly partisan.\n  I urge my colleagues to step back a little bit and look at some of \nthese unanimous consent requests and see if we can find an appropriate \nvehicle and manner to legislate on this important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will take this opportunity to \nrespond to the distinguished--I was going to say the difficult Senator, \nbut I mean the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I feel caught on the horns of a dilemma. On one hand, what I am \nseeing is this is never going to happen on an agriculture \nappropriations bill. On the other hand, what I am hearing is, you have \nan offer to offer your amendment; it will be second-degreed; it will be \ndefeated; there won't be a real opportunity to have an up-or-down vote \non the amendment.\n  Our leader, I believe, is willing to come to a reasonable agreement \nwhereby the main points of the Patients' Bill of Rights can be debated \non the floor with an agreement that amendments be voted up or down \nwithin a certain period of time. But he is very astute. I do not think \nhe wants us to find out that someone comes on the floor, takes up all \nthe time, there is no opportunity for an up-or-down vote on the \namendments, there is one vote en bloc, and then the majority leader can \ncome on the floor and undo it all after it is over.\n\n  What we are asking for, and maybe now is as good a time as any--I \nhave learned there are times when you go to the wall and there are \ntimes when you do not go to the wall, and it is important to know the \ndifference in the timing.\n  Let me share with the Senator one story that happened at UCLA, which \nis why I feel so strongly about this Senate passing legislation that \nprevents arbitrary interference with the physician's treatment and the \nsetting of that treatment, in other words, the hospital length of stay. \nIf the Senator wants, I can give him the doctor's name and he can \nverify it.\n  This is about a neurosurgeon who performed surgery at the UCLA \nMedical Center to remove a brain tumor. The patient's managed care plan \ncovered 1 day in the intensive care unit. After that day, the patient \nhad uneven breathing and fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. The \ndoctor wanted her to stay in the hospital another day for monitoring. \nThe HMO utilization reviewer consulted the guidebook that said only 1 \nday was allowed in the ICU, so she was denied the extra day. The doctor \nthought it would be medically unethical to move the patient out of the \nICU, so he kept her there. The next day, the HMO called again and said \nthe cost of the second day would be deducted from the surgeon's fee.\n  That is the kind of thing that is happening. We have to put an end to \nit because the result is going to be terrible for the practice of \nmedicine. There are now doctors voting to unionize, to collectively \nbargain. I know some people have said with some disdain: Oh well, \nthat's just over their wages. I am here to say it is not.\n  My own doctor at Great Mount Zion Medical Center, now part of the \nUniversity of California, after 30 years of practice, says he has never \nbeen so disillusioned, never been so disappointed. He said the morale \nof doctors is so low from being countermanded all the time by medical \nplans and having to hassle to get a drug approved. Using this kind of \ndisincentive of, if you believe a patient belongs in ICU after brain \nsurgery for an additional day, we are going to deduct it from your \nfee--what kind of a practice of medicine is that?\n  These are big issues, I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, because, in \nmy view, they are life-or-death issues. We have a chance to address it. \nI do not want to legislate on an agriculture appropriations bill, but, \non the other hand, I believe to the depth and breadth and height of me \nin this amendment. Other colleagues have other amendments.\n  The time has come to have a debate on the issue. Our leader will \nnegotiate a fair agreement. I really think it is in your hands. We want \nan up-or-down vote on these amendments.\n  This is not an amendment that has been just quickly put together for \nwhat someone might say is a political purpose. This amendment has been \nworked on, it has been vetted, and it is supported by 200 organizations \nand supported by every single medical organization in this country--\nnurses, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, \nthe American Lung Association--across the board.\n  No one should be afraid to keep a patient, following brain surgery, \nin intensive care for an extra day. The gall of the health insurance \nplan to say, OK, we are deducting it from the doctor's fee. I hope the \nSenator will have some reaction to this, because I know that is not the \nway he wants to see medicine practiced in this country.\n\n  I can go on and on. Perhaps because my State is such a big managed \ncare State, there are so many examples. They need to be stopped, and \nthere is no better time than right now. All we need is an agreement \nthat will allow some amendments--leave it up to our leaders--up-or-down \nvote, and prevent the opportunity from sidetracking that up-or-down \nvote. At the end of this, we will have something.\n  Senator Kennedy was absolutely right. I remember all the wrangling \nover the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, and then finally, bingo, it just got \ndone. That is what we are asking for now. That is what the people of \nAmerica are asking for now as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom California. She mentioned timing. I do not think the time is now. \nI do not think it should be on the appropriations bill. We have been \npretty straightforward in saying we will give you a few days after the \nFourth of July break. Basically, that means next week we will be \nworking on other appropriations bills, and that means the following \nweek we will be working on the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I will tell my colleague--I can easily tell her, and anybody else--\nthe Senator can orchestrate a way to get a vote on her amendment. It \ncan be done. Her amendment can be a second-degree amendment, I tell my \ncolleague. I have already stated we can limit the agreement to one \nsecond-degree amendment instead of two. There are many of us willing to \ndo that. The way not to do it, in my opinion, is piecemeal on 20 \ndifferent legislative items--some on this appropriations bill, some on \nthat appropriations bill--knowing those appropriators are going to \nconference and will say: What in the world are we going to do with \nmedical necessity? We don't know what that is.\n  I appreciate the fact she mentioned a brain surgeon who said a \npatient should stay in a day longer and some managed care idiot, or \nbureaucrat, said no. I do not happen to think the legislative solution \nproposed in the Senator's legislation is the right fix. I happen to \nthink the better idea is to give an internal appeal that can be done \nimmediately. It can be appealed. If it is\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\nnot overturned--the example the Senator cited I think would be \noverturned immediately, and, if not done immediately, it could be done \nby an external appeal done by outside peer review experts. They do not \nhave to go to court, they do not have to sue, and they have immediate \nchange. That is the better process.\n\n  My point is, as far as process is concerned now, we should not be \ndebating this on an appropriations bill. Offering a few days beginning \non July 12 is more than generous. I will try to be flexible in further \nnegotiations, but the give is just about given when, if the Senator \nlooks, we have just about 8 weeks to legislate before the end of the \nfiscal year.\n  I think the majority leader has been very, very generous. I will work \nwith my colleague to see if we cannot come to a constructive \nconclusion. I appreciate her willingness to do so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator and appreciate everything he said \nand the graciousness with which he said it.\n  I will make two points in terms of my question. I am a freshman \nSenator. I am well familiar with the process of the House. That is \nsomething I wished to escape. It is one of the reasons I ran for the \nSenate. The reason was that we could not debate at any time \nappropriations bills or authorization bills without really the consent \nof the Rules Committee, which was controlled by the Speaker 11 to 5. We \ncould not get anything done.\n  From what I understand in listening to my colleagues and being here \nmyself, this has been like a pressure cooker. On bill after bill, bills \nthat we have done, instead of being given the chance to offer \namendments--we did some authorizing bills, but then on a good number of \nthem--Y2K, for instance--the tree was filled. In other words, the \nmajority leader offered an amendment and then put on a second-degree \namendment, and then another amendment and put on a second-degree \namendment. We were not permitted to, say, add a Feinstein amendment or \nan amendment that I hoped to offer about scope or other amendments as \nwell.\n  The frustration on our side--I began to hear my colleagues, who have \nbeen here many years longer than I have been, start saying that this is \njust like the House, that in the past the right of the majority was to \nsort of set the agenda--chair the committees, call the hearings--but in \nthe Senate, in its grand traditions, the minority always had the right \nto offer some amendments.\n\n  As we moved through the process this year, through a bunch of \nlegislative maneuvers--all within the rules but maybe not within the \nprevious traditions of the Senate--we were not allowed to do that.\n  So we came to the conclusion that, on something as important to so \nmany of us as the Patients' Bill of Rights, we would not have the \nopportunity, under any circumstance, to offer those amendments.\n  My guess is that the kind of offer that was made, which our minority \nleader has outlined why we think it is inadequate, we never would have \ngotten to that point if there had been an open process and we had been \nallowed to offer amendments as we went through that process.\n  I just ask the majority whip, who is a Senator I have a great deal of \nrespect for--and I understand we have different views on the Patients' \nBill of Rights, but he is coming at this and trying to be very fair--\nwhat can be done to avoid the kinds of frustration that my colleagues \non this side of the aisle are genuinely feeling on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights or on so many other issues, that we will not have any \nopportunity, any time, to offer amendments on issues important to us, \nunless we sort of force the issue, as we have done this week?\n  I yield. That is my question to the majority whip.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I tell my friend, and colleagues, there is a lot of work \nto be done. I think it is in the interest of all Senators to work \ntogether. I do not think that necessarily it is really constructive to \nsay we are going to shut down the Senate for a week, as has actually \nhappened the last couple days, unless we get our will. I would like us \nto work maybe a little more off the floor and a little more behind the \nscenes and say: What can we do?\n  That will take cooperation. It will take saying, We are willing to \ntake up this bill and finish it by tomorrow. Then you do not have to \nget into a whole lot of extended discussion and maybe a lack of trust. \nBecause I heard some people say, well, wait a minute. Under this \nagreement that we proposed, somebody could filibuster the bill, and you \ncould only have one or two amendments.\n  That was not our intention. I can tell my colleagues that was not my \nintention. Do we want to have 25 really tough votes? No. But votes go \nboth ways.\n  But my point being, there is no one I know of who was saying we are \ngoing to have somebody come in and filibuster this bill. Nobody was \ntalking about doing that. Maybe we need to have a little more faith and \na little more collegiality and willingness to work together.\n  This is an item of interest to a lot of people. There are a lot of \npeople on this side who would like us to pass a positive bill.\n  I have also stated my very sincere conviction that we should not pass \na bill that is going to increase health care costs a total of about 13 \nor 14 percent, after you add in inflation. I really mean that. I am \nvery sincere about that.\n  So we may have some differences, but, I have not totally given up on \nthe idea of us working something out.\n  I will suggest the absence of a quorum. Maybe something else can be \ndone to accomplish that.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask the Senator, before you do, may I respond to \none quick thing you said on ``medical necessity''?\n  You made the comment: Nobody really knows what ``medical necessity'' \nis. Let me just very briefly read you the definition because it is a \nstandard definition. The term ``medical necessity'' or \n``appropriateness'' means, with respect to a service or benefit, ``a \nservice or benefit which is consistent with generally accepted \nprinciples of professional medical practice.'' That is the definition \nof ``medical necessity'' or ``appropriateness'' in this bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Thank you.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In morning business, I ask unanimous consent I be given \n10 minutes to address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7582-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7582-S7583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would just like to first thank my \ncolleagues from South Dakota, Massachusetts, and California for \nbringing up this issue.\n  Let me just say that, again, as I travel across my State, the issue \nof the Patients' Bill of Rights is one that is foremost on the minds of \nmy constituents. I have heard their pleas and complaints. I have heard \nabout horrible situations that people are forced into. I have heard \nabout the fears of tens of thousands of people in each community who do \nnot have a problem now with their HMO, but having heard about a \nrelative, a friend, a professional colleague who has, they worry about \nhaving one themselves.\n  So the bottom line is a simple one. We wish to have a free and open \ndebate. That is our position. It is more important than many of the \nissues we were debating.\n  I heard the majority leader say we had to do the foreign operations \nbill. That is a bill that is important to me and to many of my \nconstituents but hardly one as important as the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n\n[[Page S7583]]\n\n  So what we are saying on this side is the following: That there has \nbeen such a breakdown in the patient-doctor relationship, and with the \nintrusion of that patient-doctor relationship by an army of accountants \nand actuaries and bureaucrats who are making decisions that should be \nmade by doctors and nurses and hospitals, that something has to be \ndone.\n  We disagree on cost issues. The Senator from Oklahoma thought it \nwould raise costs 13, 14, 15 percent. The Senator from Massachusetts \nhas a CBO estimate--CBO is impartial--that says it would be the cost of \na Big Mac a month to a family. But the very least is that we should be \ndebating that issue, debating it fully and openly.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has said that it was not his intention, \nwhen he offered his proposal, that someone filibuster and take the \nwhole 30 hours or the whole week just filibustering.\n  That may well be the case, but there may be one of the 100 Senators \nwho feels so strongly against this issue that he would take to the \nfloor to filibuster. Unless we can get in the confines of the agreement \nthat we will be able to vote on the very important issues that are part \nof the Patients' Bill of Rights, then how can we agree? Because if we \nwere to agree now--and there are so many thousands of our constituents \non whose hopes and even prayers this legislation rests--and we were not \nto get those votes, and instead someone would filibuster, they would \nall think we had let them down.\n  So the bottom line is a very simple one. The bottom line is, yes, we \ncan come to an agreement, but the agreement, from our point of view, \nneeds to allow open debate and votes on a whole series of issues. My \nguess is we won't win every one, but my guess is we will win a good \nnumber.\n\n  To have an agreement that might allow one person to filibuster the \nwhole time, even though it may not be the majority whip's intention, to \nhave an agreement that would not allow the major issues to be not only \ndebated but voted upon would be a serious miscarriage of the hopes of \nmillions of Americans who wish to see the patient-doctor relationship \nrestored. It would have been much better if we had done that debate \nthis week.\n  As I mentioned to the majority whip, the feeling on this side of the \naisle of frustration, that the open process on which the Senate has \nprided itself for 200 years would no longer be allowed, led to our view \nthat we would make sure and do everything in our power within the rules \nof the Senate to see that open debate and votes on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights occurred.\n  I think we are doing a service to our constituents. I think this is \nwhat they sent us to the Senate to do. I will be doing everything I \ncan, helping our minority leader, helping the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts and all of my other colleagues who care so much about \nthis issue, to see that we get that open, full debate and the votes on \nthe very important issues of the Patients' Bill of Rights to which our \nconstituents are entitled.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Tuesday, the Senate voted 57-42 to \nrefuse debate on legislation that would provide some support to \nsteelworkers.\n  I think those of us who wanted to provide some protection to \nsteelworkers and their families against the illegal dumping of steel \nfrom foreign exporters to our country lost mainly because of the White \nHouse, which used import data from the month of April and convinced a \nlot of Members that the steel crisis is over.\n  Here we are, 2 days later, and there are new, important numbers out \nfor May. We find out 2 days later that the steel crisis is not over. In \nfact, overall steel imports went up 30 percent from April to May. Most \nof the increase comes from the import of various kinds of semifinished \nsteel, the very products that our taconite mines in Minnesota compete \nagainst. Imports of blooms, billets, and slabs are up a whopping 122 \npercent. Let me repeat that: 2 days ago the administration was telling \nus there was no crisis; the surge of imports is over. Now we find out a \n30-percent surge of imported steel, the latest figures today, over a 1-\nmonth period from April to May, and for billets and slabs and blooms, a \n122-percent increase in imports.\n  This is a disaster. It is a disaster for the women and men who have \nlost their jobs on the Iron Range and may never get them back. It is a \ndisaster for the workers who are hanging by a thread. It is a disaster \nfor their husbands and their wives and children. For them the steel \ncrisis is not over. If anything, the steel crisis is getting worse.\n  The question I ask my colleagues who voted against our bill, who \nvoted against even debating our bill, is: What next? To the \nadministration, I say you were successful in defeating the Rockefeller \nbill. Now what do you propose? Are we going to simply give up on the \nsteel industry?\n\n  We cannot give up on the steel industry, and we cannot give up on the \niron ore industry in our own country. We have to do something.\n  I am troubled by the arguments that were made in our Senate debate. I \nam troubled by some of the newspaper opinion pieces, because they seem \nto be suggesting that we ought to just give up on this industry. They \nseem to be suggesting that the extraordinary surge of steel imports, \nthe dumping of cheap steel, the illegal dumping of steel sold below \ncost of production in our country is actually good for the economy, \ngood for the economy because it keeps prices down in other sectors of \nour economy.\n  If that is the case, we should actually encourage foreign countries \nto dump on our markets. If we want to lower steel prices, then we \nshouldn't have any antidumping laws. We should repeal them all. We \nshouldn't even have any antidumping laws on the books. If that is the \ncase, we ought to get rid of a section 201 law which provides for WTO \nlegal quotas to import surges, the likes of which we have been \nexperiencing. The fact of the matter is, we have had this surge of \nimported steel, and the argument is, it is good for the country because \nit keeps prices down.\n  That means we are not going to have a steel industry. That means we \nwill not have an iron ore industry. That means many of these workers \nand their families are going to be spit out of the economy. Our workers \ncan compete with anybody, any place, any time, anywhere. But they \ncannot compete with a surge of illegally dumped imports. Our \nsteelworkers, our iron ore workers are the most efficient in the world. \nThey can compete with fairly traded steel, but they cannot compete with \nthis.\n  I am real worried, because I think this administration and I think \ntoo many of my colleagues in the Senate have sent the following message \nwhen it comes to trade policy: If it is a top contributor, Chiquita \nbananas, we are there for you. We will make sure that we put on a real \nstrong import quota. When it comes to investments of Wall Street \ninvestors, when they go sour in Korea or Indonesia, Thailand or Mexico, \nBrazil or Russia, we will pick up the tab.\n  But when the global economic crisis boomeranged on American \nsteelworkers, the message from the administration and the Senate was: \nYou get stuck with the bill.\n  The crisis is not over. The May import numbers prove it. The question \nfor all of you who oppose the Rockefeller bill, the question for this \nadministration, a Democratic administration that is supposed to care \nabout working people is: What do you propose to do now?\n  Let me just repeat this one more time. I was thinking to myself, I \nwonder why the administration hasn't released figures, since they were \nmaking the case that the crisis was over. Surely they will release the \nMay figures. They must have had them a few days ago. Two days ago, one \nof the major arguments used for opposing our legislation was ``the \ncrisis is over.'' Now we find out 2 days later, overall steel imports \nare up 30 percent from April to May, and imports of blooms and billets \nand slabs, which compete against our taconite on the Iron Range, are up \n122\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\npercent. We didn't get those figures from the administration 2 days \nago. I think I know why.\n  I say to the President, I say to the administration, and I say to \nSenators who voted against an opportunity to even debate this \nlegislation: The crisis is not over. The statistics prove it. My \nquestion is: What do you propose to do now? What do you propose to do \nnow?\n  Mr. President--not the President that is presiding on the floor of \nthe Senate, but Mr. President of the United States of America--what do \nyou propose to do now? Your administration told us 2 days ago this \ncrisis was over. Now we have the figures: 30 percent increase in \nimports of steel, 122 percent in imports of blooms, billets, and slabs. \nIt is going to be an economic convulsion for the Iron Range of \nMinnesota. It is going to be an economic convulsion for steelworkers, \nillegally dumped steel. We will compete against anybody. But if you are \ngoing to make the argument that we should not do anything about \nillegally dumped steel, that we can't provide any protection for our \nworkers, that we can't have an administration and a Government that \nnegotiates a fair and a tough trade policy that provides protection to \nour workers, then what in the world are we here for?\n\n  I speak with a little bit of--not bitterness but outrage. I heard \nwhat was being said just two days ago. Now the numbers have come out. \nNow we know we have this crisis. Now we know we have this surge of \nimports. It is illegally dumped steel.\n  My question for the President of the United States of America is: \nWhat are you going to do? You defeated our legislation. What are you \ngoing to do now?\n  I am not going to give up on this. I hope the steelworkers and their \nfamilies won't give up on this. My suggestion is that we need to have a \nmeeting with the President and the administration because I have to \nstill believe that they are concerned and they will be willing to take \nsome action. We need to talk about what kind of action we will take \nsoon, because if we don't, there are going to be a lot of broken \ndreams, a lot of broken lives, and a lot of broken families all across \nour country, including in Northeast Minnesota, the iron range of \nMinnesota. I can't turn my gaze away from that. I can't quit fighting \nbecause of the vote a couple days ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7584-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7584-S7585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I don't want to be redundant, but I \nwould like to continue the statement I began to make earlier this \nmorning. Let me quickly put it in perspective.\n  The statement further explains an amendment that I have at the desk, \nwhich essentially says that a group health plan or an insurance issuer \nmay not arbitrarily interfere with, or alter, the decision of the \ntreating physician with respect to the manner or the setting in which \nparticular services are delivered if those services are medically \nnecessary or appropriate.\n  It then goes on to define ``medically necessary'' as ``that which is \nconsistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical \npractice.'' The amendment, of course, means that the doctor can \ndetermine what is a medically necessary length for a hospital stay, and \nthe doctor can determine the kind of treatment or drug the patient can \nbe best treated with.\n  I know some people wonder why am I so vociferous about physicians \nmaking medical decisions. California has the largest number of \nindividuals in managed care. We have around 20 million people in \nmanaged care plans in California.\n  I have heard of many different cases. Let me just give you one other \ncase--I just talked about the person with the brain illness. I can also \ngive you the case of the Central Valley man, 27 years old who had a \nheart transplant and was forced out of the hospital after 4 days \nbecause his HMO would not pay for more days. That constituent of mine \ndied. That is the reason I feel so strongly.\n  Additionally, I know--and the Washington Post this morning \ndocuments--that doctors are increasingly frustrated, demoralized, and \nhamstrung by insurance plans' definitions of medical necessity. An \nAmerican Medical Association survey reported in the March 2, 1999, \nWashington Post, quoted an AMA spokeswoman who said that some managed \ncare companies have begun to define explicitly what treatments are \n``medically necessary,'' and they have chosen to define them in terms \nof lowest cost.\n  She says:\n\n       Doctors used to make that decision solely on the basis of \n     what was best for the patient.\n\n  She stressed that doctors are unhappy that managed care organizations \nare ``controlling or influencing medical treatment before the treatment \nis provided.'' She said, ``Denials and delays in providing care \ndirectly harm the health and well-being of the patients.''\n  A fall 1998 report found that ``patients and physicians can expect to \nsee more barriers to prescriptions being filled as written,'' according \nto the Scott-Levin consultant firm, because HMOs are requiring more \n``prior authorizations'' by the plans before doctors can prescribe \nthem.\n  Then, as I spoke of a little earlier, there is the issue of financial \nincentives, another form of interference in medical necessity \ndecisions. In November, the New England Journal of Medicine pointed \nout:\n\n       Many managed care organizations include financial \n     incentives for primary care physicians that are indexed to \n     various measures of performance. Incentives that depend on \n     limiting referrals or on greater productivity applies \n     selective pressure to physicians in ways that are believed to \n     compromise care.\n\n  That is what we are trying to stop.\n\n       Incentives that depend on the quality of care and patients' \n     satisfaction are associated with greater job \n     satisfaction among physicians.\n\n  Let me describe how Charles Krauthammer put it in writing in the \nJanuary 9, 1998 Washington Post under the headline, ``Driving the Best \nDoctors Away'':\n\n       The second cause of [doctors leaving the profession] is the \n     loss of independence. More than money, this is what is \n     driving these senior doctors crazy: some 24-year-old \n     functionary who knows as much about medicine as he does about \n     cartography demanding to know why Mr. Jones, a diabetic in \n     renal failure, has not been discharged from the hospital yet. \n     Dictated to by medically ignorant administrators, questioned \n     about every prescription and procedure, reduced in status \n     from physician to ``provider,'' these doctors want out.\n\n  Mr. President, that is a sorry commentary, and it is the truth.\n\n       One of my deepest interests is cancer. I cochair the Senate \n     Cancer Coalition with the distinguished Senator from Florida, \n     Senator Connie Mack. Let me quote from a report of the \n     President's Cancer Panel:\n       Under the evolving managed care system, participating \n     physicians are increasingly being asked to do more with \n     less--to see a greater volume of patients and provide \n     significantly more documentation of care with less assistance \n     or staff. In addition, managed care has dictated a major \n     shift to primary care gatekeepers who are under pressure to \n     limit referrals to specialists and care provided in tertiary \n     care facilities, and may be financially rewarded for their \n     success in doing so.\n\n  Nancy Ledbetter, an oncology nurse and clinical research nurse \ncoordinator for Kaiser Permanente said, ``. . . necessary care is being \nwithheld in order to contain costs.'' This is from the June 16, 1999 \nJournal of the National Cancer Institute.\n  A breast cancer surgeon wrote me:\n\n       Severe limitations are being placed upon surgeons in giving \n     these women [with breast cancer] total care . . . Patients \n     feel that their care is reduced to the mechanics of surgery \n     alone, ignoring the whole patient's medical, emotional, and \n     psychological needs.\n\n  Surely, one of the oldest axioms of medicine, and the way my father \nused to practice medicine, is that you can't just treat the wound, you \nhave to treat the whole patient as an individual, as a human being.\n  In my State, again, over 80 percent of people who have insurance are \nin managed care. Forty percent of California's Medicare beneficiaries \nare in managed care. Some say Californians have been pioneers for \nmanaged care. Some even say Californians have been the Nation's \n``guinea pigs.''\n  The complaints don't abate: delaying diagnoses and treatments as \ntumors grow; trying the cheapest therapies first, instead of the most \neffective; refusing needed hospital admissions; refusing to refer \npatients to specialists who can accurately diagnose conditions and \nprovide effective treatments; \n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\nwe hear complaints about shoving patients out of the hospitals \nprematurely, against doctor's wishes. We hear complaints about \nmisclassifying medically necessary treatments as ``cosmetic.''\n\n  We hear about plans demanding that doctors justify their care and \nsecond-guessing doctors' medical judgments.\n  We have had heard about doctors exaggerating the patient's condition \nto be able to give them a certain drug, or keep them in a hospital \nbeyond a certain length of time, to get plans to pay for care.\n  I hope this amendment can restore some balance to the system by \nempowering patients and the medical profession to provide the kind of \nquality medical care that people not only pay for but that they \ndeserve.\n  That is why I feel so strongly about this amendment.\n  Again, I harken back to the day when I had the first example in 1997 \nof a woman in a major managed care plan undergoing an outpatient \nradical mastectomy--7:30 in the morning, surgery; 4:30, out on the \nstreet with drains hanging from her chest, and unable to know where she \nwas going.\n  That is not good medicine.\n  I can only end my comments on this amendment by saying that the \namendment is sincerely presented.\n  The amendment is the heart of a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The amendment should not increase premium costs.\n  The amendment is what the American people expect.\n  And the amendment simply says that an insurance company cannot \narbitrarily interfere with the doctor's decision with respect to \ntreatment or hospitalization.\n  I don't think that is too much to ask this body to legislate and to \nstate unequivocally, and I think every single person in my State, as \nwell as every State, will be much better off once this is accomplished.\n  Let me end by saying that I believe that Senator Daschle is willing \nto work out an agreement which allows a number of amendments to come to \nthe floor and be debated, provided that these amendments can be voted \nup or down.\n  I suspect that what we are going to really end up with is a \nbipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights. I suspect that if we can get this \nunanimous consent agreement, we will find that there will be many on \nthe other side of the aisle who will vote for this amendment, and there \nwill be some of us who will vote for some of the amendments on the \nother side as well.\n  It seems to me that when you have a situation whereby the physicians \nin America have reached the point where they have decided to unionize \nand collectively bargain that this should be a very loud call that all \nis not well with the practice of medicine in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  It should be a very loud call for a unanimous consent agreement which \nwill allow us, on the floor of the Senate, to work out a series of \namendments which can provide the kind of quality care that the people \nof the United States are entitled to, and that certainly 20 million \nCalifornians in managed care are.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7585-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr President, I want to express my support for the \nresolution, which was adopted by the Senate yesterday, to begin a new \ntradition in this distinguished body: to begin our days by saying the \nPledge of Allegiance each morning in this Chamber. There were about ten \nof my colleagues on the floor this morning to inaugurate this new \ntradition, and I only wish there could have been more to join us.\n  We will pay tribute to our flag, the greatest symbol of our freedom, \nin the Chamber where we are sworn to uphold the very freedoms the flag \nsymbolizes. There can be no more fitting tribute to our Constitution \nthan the free and unfettered expression of patriotism that the Pledge \nof Allegiance represents.\n  Today in the Senate, we honor the flag. In contrast to this voluntary \ncelebration of our flag, the other chamber today may vote on an \namendment to our Constitution that asks us to turn away from the \nfreedoms we cherish in order to protect our flag, in effect to compel \nreverence for the flag. This amendment, in a misdirected attempt to \nprotect a cherished symbol, instead tears at the very fabric of our \nfreedom.\n  In the past, I have walked in the Appleton, WI, parade on Flag Day. I \nam told that it is the largest Flag Day parade in our country--it is \ncertainly one of the best. As I saw the faces of those people, those \nAmericans, as they waved the flag, filled with pride in our great \nnation, I knew then not only that patriotism shouldn't be legislated, \nbut that it doesn't need to be. It is in this Chamber and in the hearts \nand minds of millions of Americans across this country. Again, I \ncelebrate the effort to pay tribute to the flag, and the freedom it \nrepresents, in this Chamber each day. I only hope when and if the \namendment that threatens that freedom is considered on this floor, we \nwill remember the Pledge of Allegiance, and remain true to the liberty \nit speaks of, and that all of us hold so dear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7585-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7585-S7587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CUBA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, during the Memorial Day recess, I spent \ntwo days in Havana, Cuba, from June 1 to 3. I met with numerous Cuban \nofficials, including a marathon six-and-a-half hour session with \nPresident Fidel Castro, with Cuban human rights dissidents, with \nreligious leaders, with several foreign ambassadors and with our U.S. \nteam. I am convinced there are a number of steps we can take, pursuant \nto our existing U.S. policy, to create closer people-to-people \nrelations with Cuba. Sharing medical research, especially on \nimmunizations, would be appropriate, between the National Institutes of \nHealth and the Cuban Ministry of Health. Former Gen. Barry McCaffrey, \nhead of U.S. drug policy, had suggested to me that we should work \ncloser with the Cuban government on drug interdiction, and I think he \nis right.\n  Relations between our two countries, only 90 miles apart, are almost \nnon-existent. We have an embargo and a boycott. We have no exchange of \nambassadors, and the limited coordination between our governments does \nnot extend beyond very limited cooperation on drug interdiction.\n  I believe it is worthwhile to share with my colleagues some of my \nfindings and impressions from my trip. The issue of the embargo is \ncomplex, and I am not yet ready to advocate a position. But there are \nother issues, such as the benefits of increasing contact and \ncooperation, which merit comment at this time.\n  Upon arrival in Havana about 2 pm June 1, we were met by Jorge \nLexcano Perez, President of the Commission on International Relation, \nand Jose Manuel Barrios, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' \nU.S. Department. Primarily, all parties agreed that both nations would \nprofit from better relations between the two.\n  I met next for more than an hour with our country team at the U.S. \nEmbassy. We discussed the steps needed to normalize relations between \nour two nations and the dynamics of Cuba's government and economy, \nincluding the booming black market. We discussed the social climate, \nincluding religious freedom and human rights concerns.\n  I met next with Dr. Jose Miller, President of Casa de la Comunidad \nHebrea de Cuba (The Jewish Community House of Cuba) and leader of \nCuba's Jewish community, and with Adela Dworin, Dr. Miller's Vice \nPresident. Dr. Miller maintained that freedom of religion has been ``no \nproblem'' in Cuba for both Jews and Christians since the fall of the \nBerlin Wall eight years ago. Cardinal Jaime Ortega, in a later meeting, \nalso stressed that Cuba has seen an improvement in religious freedom \nduring the past decade. Both said the greater openness came from a \nrecognition on President Castro's part that a religious reconciliation \nwas necessary. President Castro, Dr. Miller noted, has attended \nHanukkah services at his synagogue. Dr. Miller and Ms. Dworin estimated \nthat Cuba's Jewish population has shrunk to 1,500 from about 15,000 in \n1959, and that they must bring in a rabbi to hold high holiday \nservices.\n  We held our final meeting June 1 with Dr. Pedro Lopez Saura at The \nCenter for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, an impressive biotech\n\n[[Page S7586]]\n\nfacility that has apparently pioneered a vaccination for Meningitis B. \nMeningitis B, which also plagues the United States, is a severe \ninfectious disease that may lead to permanent neurological damage and \neven to death in acute cases. Meningitis strikes about 2,600 people \nannually, more than half under five years old. Meningitis B accounts \nfor 50-55 percent of all U.S. cases. While NIH, our federal medical \nresearch arm, has a budget 1,000 times the size of The Cuban center's, \nthe Cuban facility has apparently outstripped American efforts in a \ncouple of narrow areas, including Meningitis B vaccine and interferon \nwork. I found Dr. Lopez, who has trained in Cuba, Belgium, East Germany \nand Finland, very impressive. I suggested that Dr. Lopez visit NIH \nDirector Dr. Harold Varmus, who has already visited the Cuban facility, \nfor an exchange that could benefit both nations.\n  We began our meetings the next morning, June 2, with the Cuban \nMinister of Health, Dr. Carlos Dotres Martinez, at one of Cuba's \nlargest medical teaching facilities on the outskirts of Havana. Dr. \nMartinez touted the Cuban health system and presented charts and \nstatistics to suggest that Cuba's aggressive research and vaccination \nprogram has eradicated polio, diphtheria and other pestilences and \nimproved its citizens' health and longevity. In a common Cuban refrain, \nDr. Martinez argued that the U.S. blockade has forced Cubans to spend \nmore for medical imports from Europe and China. He estimated Cuba has \nspent an estimated $20 million more for freight and other incidental \ncosts on top of the fixed costs of $50 million to $100 million.\n  I suggested that Dr. Martinez meet with HHS Secretary Donna Shalala.\n  We met next with Concepcion de la Campa, President and General \nDirector of the Finlay Institute, which manufactures vaccines, \nincluding the Meningitis B vaccine pioneered by the Cuban research \nlabs. I had a particular interest in this biotechnology effort because \na company with a substantial base in my state of Pennsylvania is \nnegotiating a license to work with Cubans to produce the Meningitis B \nvaccine. Under their proposed arrangement, the Pennsylvania company \nwould produce the vaccine in quantity for distribution in the United \nStates and elsewhere in the First World and the Cubans would \nmanufacture the vaccine for the rest of the world.\n  Mrs. Campa, like her Cuban medical colleagues, agreed that medical \nresearch would be boosted by closer relations between the United States \nand Cuba, and by such joint ventures.\n  We met next at the U.S. Ambassador's Residence with ambassadors from \nseveral nations: Charge Josef Marsicek of the Czech Republic, \nAmbassador Reinhold Huber of Germany, Ambassador Eduardo Junco Bonet of \nSpain, Ambassador David Ridgway of Britain, and Ambassador Keith \nChristie of Canada. The ambassadors gave me a frank assessment of \nPresident Castro and the Cuban realities. Like the US team, the \nEuropean diplomats also saw a thawing in the Castro regime's stridency, \nas demonstrated by Cuban overtures for dialog.\n\n  After my talk with the ambassadors, I met at the US residence with \nfive Cuban dissidents and human rights activists: A member of the \nChristian Liberation Movement; a former Batista-era soldier, an \nenvironmental and peace activist; a medical doctor removed from his \npost for criticizing the Cuban medical establishment; and a member of \nthe Pro-Human Rights Party. We discussed human rights and repression \ngenerally and specifically, with a focus on ``The Four,'' four jailed \nCuban dissidents whose plight has stirred international human rights \ncomplaints. I have omitted their names and limited comments on their \nstatements to protect their identities.\n  The dissidents told us passionately of the Cuban government's \nintolerance for any dissent, demonstrated by frequent jailings and loss \nof jobs and travel opportunities for those who speak out. The \ndissidents disagreed on remedies for accomplishing change, differing, \nfor example, on whether the United States should lift its embargo.\n  At 8 pm Wednesday evening, we arrived at the President's complex for \na dinner meeting with President Castro. The President arrived 10 \nminutes later, apologized for his tardiness, and proceeded to host us \nfor a six hour and 37 minute session, ending at nearly 3 am. We had \nbeen advised that President Castro enjoyed lengthy talks. We knew we \nwere in for a long night when President Castro said he had worked until \n5:45 am the night before and then slept eight hours, waking at 2 pm--\njust six hours before our meeting. We did not even move from the \nPresident's conference room to his dining room until midnight.\n  I found President Castro, at 73, robust and engaging. Always cordial, \nhe was at times jocular and at other times guarded. He wore his \ntrademark green military uniform with modest insignia and took notes \nthroughout much of our meeting. During our talk, we covered the gamut \nof subjects.\n  I asked about the possibility of parole for the four celebrated \ndissidents. President Castro told me, ``I think they should fulfill \ntheir sentences because they have done great damage to this country,'' \nHe insisted that charges against Cuba of human rights abuses ``were \ntotally unfair,'' arguing that Cuba did not torture prisoners, employ \ndeath squads or practice assassination.\n  On the issue of drug trafficking, President Castro said his country \nhas been cracking down, including establishing the death penalty for \ninternational drug trafficking. ``We are willing to cooperate'' with \nthe United States, he said. ``We don't ask the Americans for anything \nin return. We do it as a matter of ethics.'' He noted that Cuba would \nnot, however, allow the United States to violate its territorial waters \nor air space.\n  I asked President Castro about the assassination of President \nKennedy, an area of particular interest for me because of my work as a \nlawyer on the Warren commission. President Castro maintained that the \nCuban government played no role in the assassination, and that it would \nhave been insane for it to have become involved, given that the United \nStates, by his reckoning, was looking for provocation or pretense to \ninvade Cuba. Castro said Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's assassin, wanted \nto go to Cuba--a request the Cubans denied--simply to transit to the \nSoviet Union. President Castro said he was relieved that the Warren \nCommission concluded that Cuba was not involved with Oswald.\n  I asked President Castro if he was concerned that people might think \nCuba had been involved with Oswald. He said, ``Yes, we were \nconcerned.''\n  President Castro gave an elaborate description of the Cuban Missile \nCrisis. He described how Cuba initially bought its weapons from \nBelgium, a NATO country, to avoid inciting the United States. But the \nsecond Belgian shipment was sabotaged and blown up on Havana's docks, \nCastro said, and he eventually arranged to buy Soviet arms. President \nCastro said former Soviet leader Nikita Kruschev made a mistake in not \ndescribing the missiles as defensive weapons and in ``getting into a \ngame of definitions'' instead of simply maintaining his right to \ninstall weapons without question. President Castro noted the United \nStates had weapons at the time in Turkey and Italy. He described his \nhunting trip in Russia with Kruschev, and how Kruschev had pulled out \nand read from a letter to Kennedy. When Kruschev read a passage about \nKennedy promising to pull U.S. missiles out of Turkey and Italy, \nPresident Castro said, Kruschev realized he had made a mistake in \nrevealing that Kruschev was going to breach his deal with Castro and \nremove the Cuban missiles. That would leave Cuba vulnerable to U.S. \ninvasion, in President Castro's view.\n  In the end, President Castro said, the Russian withdrawal also served \nCuba's purpose. ``We preferred the risk of invasion to the presence of \nSoviet troops, because it would have established an image [of Cuba] as \na Soviet base.''\n  President Castro told us about various assassination attempts against \nhim by the United States since 1959, some documented by the U.S. \nSenate's Church Committee. Plans were launched to poison President \nCastro's milk shake, to plant an exploding cigar and to blow him up. \n``Some of them were childish,'' he said. President Castro said he had \nsurvived largely ``as a matter of luck.''\n  I asked him how he felt about being the target of so many \nassassination attempts.\n\n[[Page S7587]]\n\n  President Castro replied, ``Do you play any sports?''\n  I said, ``I play squash every day.''\n  He said, ``That is my sport.''\n  Throughout the evening, the Cuban President frequently dispatched an \naide or minister in the wee hours to produce a document or find an \nofficial's name. The aides performed their research in short order. In \none case, President Castro wanted the name of a U.S. Senator who had \nvisited Cuba in 1977, which turned out to be former Sen. Lowell Weicker \nof Connecticut.\n  The next morning--or, more accurately, later Thursday morning--we met \nwith Cardinal Ortega. Like Dr. Miller of the Havana synagogue, Cardinal \nOrtega also said the Cuban regime had adopted a more open attitude \ntoward religion, from the previous ``climate of fear.'' He attributed \nthe thaw in the government's position to a recognition that it was not \neasy to erase religious faith. He noted there have always been \ndiplomatic relations between Havana and the Vatican.\n  As for living conditions in Cuba under Castro, the Cardinal said the \nobvious in noting widespread poverty. On human rights, he said the \nCastro regime always equates human rights as the right to health, study \nand education, a low threshold.\n  Our visit was facilitated by the assistance and cooperation of the \nU.S. team and the Cuban government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7587-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHILD ACCESS PREVENTION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the 1999 school year came to a close, \nour Nation was shocked by the incidences of school violence that \nclaimed so many lives. In the aftermath of these tragedies, Americans \nhave become more sensitized to the dangers of guns and the easy access \nthat children have to them. Yet, despite this additional scrutiny by \nparents, guns continue to claim the lives of young people. Each day, \nmore children are dying, not just in schoolyards, but in the home. They \nare killed by guns in unintentional shootings.\n  Unintentional shootings are among the leading causes of death for \nyoung people. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, \neach day at least one person under the age of 19 is killed by an \nunintentional shooting. Unsafe guns are an enormous danger to these \nyoung people, who are the victims of 33 percent of all accidental \nfirearm deaths. And in Michigan, people under the age of 19 make up \nmore than 50 percent of the fatalities caused by unintentional \nshootings.\n  Unintentional shootings almost always occur at home, when a child \nfinds a loaded weapon and while playing with it, shoots himself, a \nsibling, or a young friend. Some parents try to take precautions \nagainst these tragedies by hiding their firearm in a drawer, a closet \nor even under the mattress. Unfortunately, if it is loaded or without a \nsafety lock, it does not matter where that gun is hidden. It has the \npotential to kill, and for hundreds of kids each year, it does just \nthat.\n  Daily shootings resulting from the careless storage of guns can \neasily be prevented. Locking devices for guns are simple to handle and \ninexpensive, but they must be used. In the Juvenile Justice bill that \npassed the Senate just a few weeks ago, an amendment was included that \nwould require all sales, deliveries or transfers of handguns to include \na secure gun storage or safety device, which was a step in the right \ndirection. But, there was nothing to require that adults, especially \nwith children in the house, use those safety devices. Safe storage \nlaws, or Child Access Prevention, CAP, laws are needed to ensure that \nadults store loaded guns with safety devices in place and in locations \nreasonably inaccessible to children.\n  There is no doubt that owning a firearm requires precaution and \nresponsibility, especially when young children are around. CAP laws \nhold adults criminally responsible if a loaded firearm was left where \nit could be reasonably accessed by a juvenile, and the juvenile uses or \nbrings into public the adult's firearm without the permission of his \nparent or guardian. Criminal liability would not apply to adults who \nhave no reasonable expectation of having a juvenile on their premises \nor if a juvenile obtains a firearm as a result of an unlawful entry. \nCAP laws simply require adults to use common sense safety measures, \nsuch as secure gun storage devices or trigger locks for their firearms.\n  Currently, there are 16 States that have enacted CAP laws. And since \nthe first law took effect 10 years ago, state CAP laws have reduced \nunintentional deaths of children by firearms on an average of 23 \npercent. In Florida, just one year after CAP was enacted, unintentional \nshootings dropped more than 50 percent. And for every state that has \nenacted a safe storage law, there is compelling evidence that because \nof CAP, children are safer at home.\n  Despite these successes, there are still an overwhelming number of \nstates, including Michigan, without CAP laws. And until there is \nawareness that guns should be locked up and stored unloaded, guns will \ncontinue to claim the lives of innocent children. Until CAP or safe \nstorage laws are the law of the land, people will continue to learn the \nhard way that the guns in their home meant for protection will continue \nto claim the lives of those they are trying to protect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7587-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I am announcing, today, my intention to \nplace a hold on the nomination of Mr. Richard Holbrooke to be the next \nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. I would like to explain for the \nbenefit of my colleagues why I have done so.\n  First, let me explain that I have nothing against Mr. Holbrooke. He \nis simply caught in the middle. The issue can be cleared up very, very \nquickly, if reasonable heads come together.\n  At issue is the outrageous treatment by the State Department of one \nof its employees. Her name is Linda Shenwick. She is Counselor for \nResources Management at the United States U.N. Mission. She is the \nMission's expert on financial and management matters.\n  Ms. Shenwick has been instrumental in bringing to light many of the \nwaste and mismanagement issues associated with the U.N. She's been an \ninvaluable source of information and insight for the people's branch of \ngovernment. Some people in the State Department, apparently all the way \nto the top, don't much care for Ms. Shenwick's candor with Congress. \nAnd so they painted a big, ol' target on Ms. Shenwick, and have come \nafter her, relentlessly.\n  You see, Ms. Shenwick is guilty of committing the crime of telling \nthe truth. And when you commit truth, you're history in the State \nDepartment.\n  Here is how the State Department has treated Ms. Shenwick. I'd like \nmy colleagues to know this, so they can judge for themselves whether \nthis is conduct befitting such a grand institution as the State \nDepartment.\n  Ms. Shenwick has been ``Felix Bloched.'' You remember Felix Bloch. He \nwas investigated while under suspicion for espionage. He was put on \nnon-duty status while he was investigated. That's now what they've done \nto Ms. Shenwick, effective last Friday at 5:30 pm.\n  That's not all. Before kicking her out of her office last week, she \nwas not allowed to talk to other employees. They could not talk to her. \nShe had to keep her door closed at all times. She could\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\nnot access the main computer in the office. They forced her to fly to \nWashington, with little or no notice, for meetings that didn't occur.\n  At the end of this month, Ms. Shenwick must report to a new job in \nWashington, in an area in which she has no background. They know that \nshe wants to stay in New York. They seem determined to break this woman \ndown. So far, they have not succeeded.\n  Mr. President, I have a long-standing practice of taking up the cause \nof witnesses before the Congress who have done the right thing at great \nrisk to their careers. Before I do this, I must make sure the \nindividual has sufficient credibility, and is being retaliated against \nfor their disclosures in the public interest. I have spoken with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, and on both sides of Capitol \nHill. They all agree she has credibility, and has provided solid, \naccurate information to Congress. It is information that has led to \nmanagement reforms and more effective controls of the U.N. budget. No \none has ever successfully challenged her information. Instead, the \nDepartment has attacked her.\n  In all the whistleblower cases I have worked over the years, this one \nstands out. I have never seen such a blatant, raw attempt to harass and \nsilence a whistleblower who simply told the truth. Can the truth be \nthat offensive to the State Department?\n  My action to put a hold on the Holbrooke nomination is a contest over \nwhich message will prevail. By its actions, the message the State \nDepartment wants to send is fear. Every other employee of the USUN \nMission has their eyes firmly fixed on this case. The State Department \nwants them to know, if they commit truth like Ms. Shenwick did, that \nthey, too, will get the ``Felix Bloch Treatment.'' I guess committing \ntruth is just as bad as committing espionage.\n  Mr. President, It's my hope that we in this body will intercept that \nmessage, and send one of our own. The people's right to know the truth \nis what we care about. And those who help Congress know the truth will \nbe protected, not punished.\n  Until this month, Ms. Shenwick and her attorney had been negotiating \nwith the State Department to find her a new job in New York. There was \nsome progress, but the Department started negotiating in bad faith. The \ntalks broke down, and Ms. Shenwick is being transferred to Washington \nat the end of the month, to a job for which she has no background.\n  I am willing to release my hold of the nomination of Mr. Holbrooke \nforthwith. But before that happens, fairness and civility must prevail. \nGood faith negotiations must re-start, and an agreement must be reached \nby both parties. This could happen within 24 hours, if desired.\n  In 1997, another member of this body put a similar hold on a nominee \nuntil the Department resolved Ms. Shenwick's situation. The Secretary \nagreed to resolve the issues and keep Ms. Shenwick at the USUN Mission. \nThe hold was lifted. But instead of resolving the matter, the \nharassment continued. And it continues to this day.\n  That will not happen again. The hold gets lifted when there's an \nagreement in writing.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues appreciate the \nreasonableness of my position, and the importance of the message that I \nam asking this body to send. I hope I can count on their support in the \npublic's best interest. And we can then allow Mr. Holbrooke to get on \nwith his important work in New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7588-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7588-S7589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EDUCATION EXPRESS ACT OF 1999 (ED-EXPRESS)\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday, Senator Domenici and I \nintroduced the Education Express Act (Ed-Express). This legislation \nbuilds on the success of the Ed-Flex bill, which earlier this year \npassed the Senate and House of Representatives by overwhelming margins, \nand was signed into law in April.\n  It is critical that this Congress builds on Ed-Flex's themes of \nflexibility and accountability. As we consider the Reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we must continue the push \nto cut red tape and remove overly-prescriptive federal mandates on \nfederal education funding. At the same time, we must hold states and \nlocal schools accountable for increasing student achievement.\n  Flexibility, combined with accountability, must be our objective. The \nend result of our reform effort must spark innovation--innovation \ndesigned to provide all students a world-class education.\n  This need for flexibility and accountability in education was \nrepeated again and again in hearings held by the Senate Budget \nCommittee's Task Force on Education. The Task Force, on which Senator \nDomenici serves as an Ex-officio member, and I serve as the chairman, \nissued a report entitled ``Prospects for Reform: The State of Education \nand the Federal Role.''\n  In this report the Task Force made several recommendations of ways to \nimprove the federal education effort. The number one recommendation \nnoted, ``In light of the continuing proliferation of federal \ncategorical programs, the Task Force recommends that federal education \nprograms be consolidated. This effort should include reorganization at \nthe federal level, and block grants for the states. The Task Force \nparticularly favors providing states flexibility to consolidate all \nfederal funds into an integrated state strategic plan to achieve \nnational educational objectives for which the state would be held \naccountable.''\n  The Ed-Express bill is the legislative response to this \nrecommendation. Specifically, $37 billion over the next five years \nwould be provided from the federal government as part of a larger \nconsolidation of duplicative and limiting categorical programs into a \nmuch more streamlined and direct funding stream to states and \nlocalities for a variety of education purposes.\n  We have a national emergency in education. To address this crisis, \nthe federal government will commit additional resources for a five-year \nperiod in order to improve student achievement and the quality of our \nteaching force.\n  This would infuse significant funds to the hands of parents, \ncommunities, and local/State governments to improve the education \nachievement of students.\n  Under this plan, States may elect to receive elementary and secondary \neducation funding by ``Direct Check.'' Incentives such as replacing \nexisting burdensome federal categorical programs are provided to \nencourage States to choose the direct check option. A State, however, \nmay choose to remain in the categorical system.\n  In the spirit of Ed-Flex, this legislation that we introduced also \nlooks to the Governors for leadership. States which opt for the Direct \nCheck Flexibility will receive their education funding upon the \nadoption of a State plan written by the governor that outlines the \ngoals and objectives for the funds.\n  The Nation's governors are leading the way for education reform in \nthis country. It was the Nation's Governors who helped bring about the \nsuccessful passage of Ed-Flex. We at the Federal level must do all we \ncan to advance the reform efforts taking place at the State and local \nlevels.\n  Ed-Express establishes a Challenge Fund, a Teacher Quality Fund, and \nan Academic Opportunity Fund.\n  Challenge Funds would be provided to States and localities with the \nflexibility to design and implement programs to improve student \nlearning. These funds may be used to purchase new books, hire teachers, \npromote character education, provide tutoring services for students, \nand for a variety of other education initiatives.\n  Teacher Quality Funds may be used for such activities as providing \nprofessional development opportunities for teachers, merit pay, \nincreasing teachers' salaries, and alternative certification programs.\n  Academic Opportunity Funds may be used to provide governors who \nchoose the Direct Check option with the ability to reward school \ndistricts and schools that meet or exceed state-defined goals and \nperformance objectives for student achievement and teacher quality.\n  The need for a consolidated Federal education effort has never been \ngreater. I think that we are all familiar with the statistics that show \nour students are not able to keep up academically with their \ninternational counterparts. In fact, the longer a student stays in an \nAmerican school the more his/her academic skills deteriorate. We must \ndraw\n\n[[Page S7589]]\n\nupon innovative methods to correct this problem so that our children \nwill be able to compete in the global economy.\n  As a scientist, I know the value of looking for new ways to solve \nproblems, and America has long had a proud tradition to innovation. Ed-\nExpress will create a whole new generation of inventors in the field of \neducation--in particular, Governors, local school boards, teachers, and \nparents will be better able to put good ideas into practice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7589-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY CAUSED BY THE LAPSE OF THE EXPORT \n   ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 1979 FOR THE PERIOD AUGUST 19, 1998 THROUGH \n          FEBRUARY 19, 1999--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 40\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 204 of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)) and section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nperiodic report on the national emergency declared by Executive Order \n12924 of August 19, 1994, to deal with the threat to the national \nsecurity, foreign policy, and economy of the United States caused by \nthe lapse of the Export Administration Act of 1979.\n                                                  William J.

I \nam also pleased to transmit my written approval, authorization, and \ndetermination concerning the Protocol, and an unclassified Nuclear \nProliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) concerning the Protocol. (In \naccordance with section 123 of the Act, as amended by Title XII of the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-\n277), I have submitted to the Congress under separate cover a \nclassified annex to the NPAS, prepared in consultation with the \nDirector of Central Intelligence, summarizing relevant classified \ninformation.) The joint memorandum submitted to me by the Secretary of \nState and the Secretary of Energy and a letter from the Chairman of the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission stating the views of the Commission are \nalso enclosed.\n  The proposed Protocol has been negotiated in accordance with the \nAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and other applicable law. In my \njudgment, it meets all statutory requirements and will advance the \nnonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United \nStates.\n  The Protocol amends the Agreement for Cooperation Concerning Civil \nUses of Atomic Energy Between the Government of the United States of \nAmerica and the Government of Canada in two respects:\n  1. It extends the Agreement, which would otherwise expire by its \nterms on January 1, 2000, for an additional period of 30 years, with \nthe provision for automatic extensions thereafter in increments of 5 \nyears each unless either Party gives timely notice to terminate the \nAgreement; and\n  2. It updates certain provisions of the Agreement relating to the \nphysical protection of materials subject to the Agreement.\n  The Agreement itself was last amended on April 23, 1980, to bring it \ninto conformity with all requirements of the Atomic Energy Act and the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. As amended by the proposed \nProtocol, it will continue to meet all requirements of U.S. law.\n  Canada ranks among the closest and most important U.S. partners in \ncivil nuclear cooperation, with ties dating back to the early days of \nthe Atoms for Peace program. Canada is also in the forefront of \ncountries supporting international efforts to prevent the spread of \nnuclear weapons to additional countries. It is a party to the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and has an agreement \nwith the IAEA for the application of full-scope safeguards to its \nnuclear program. It also subscribes to the Nuclear Supplier Group (NSG) \nGuidelines, which set forth standards of the responsible export of \nnuclear commodities for peaceful use, and to the Zangger (NPT \nExporters) Committee Guidelines, which oblige members to require the \napplication of IAEA safeguards on nuclear exports to nonnuclear weapon \nstates. It is a party to the Convention on the Physical Protection of \nNuclear Material, whereby it has agreed to apply international \nstandards of physical protection to the storage and transport of \nnuclear material under its jurisdiction or control.\n  Continued close cooperation with Canada in the peaceful uses of \nnuclear energy, under the long-term extension of the U.S.-Canada \nAgreement for Cooperation provided for in the proposed Protocol, will \nserve important U.S. national security, foreign policy, and commercial \ninterests.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed Protocol and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe Protocol and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsections 123b. and 123d. of the Atomic Energy Act. My Administration is \nprepared to begin immediate consultations with the Senate Foreign \nRelations and House International Relations Committees as provided in \nsection 123b.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act, to facilitate the \ntransition to more competitive and efficient electric power markets, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                FEDERAL POWER ACT OF AMENDMENTS OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the electricity \nrestructuring bill I introduced in the last Congress. I offer the bill \ntoday because the Energy and Natural Resources Committee will be \nholding two legislative hearings next week on the pending electricity \nrestructuring bills, and I want this bill to be included in the \ndiscussions. With the exception of two typographical corrections, the \ntext of the bill is identical to S. 1276, which I introduced in the \nlast Congress.\n  The bill has three principal legislative objectives: (1) clarifying \nthe line between state and federal jurisdiction, (2) strengthening the \nreliability of the transmission system, and (3) ensuring fair access to \nthe interstate transmission grid. When I introduced the bill in the \nlast Congress it received wide support as the nucleus of the most \ncritical issues that Congress must address in any restructuring \nlegislation.\n  As many Senators are aware, I am working with the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, my good friend Senator \nMurkowski, on developing a consensus electricity bill that can be \nmarked up and reported to the full Senate. Although I had expected that \nwe would be further along in the process by now, I remain fully \ncommitted to following this bi-partisan course. My introduction of this \nbill should not impeded that process.\n  Much has happened in the electric utility industry since this bill \nwas first drafted nearly two years ago. There are now six approved \nregional transmission operators, and several more are on the drawing \nboards. Twenty-two states, including New Mexico, have implemented some \nform of electric competition and two more may pass legislation this \nyear. And there is now industry-wide consensus on the importance of \nfederal legislation to assure the continued security and reliability of \nthe nation's high-tension transmission grid.\n  Mr. President, I continue to see a strong need for federal \nelectricity legislation so that states that have elected retail \ncompetition can fully enjoy all of the benefits that completion brings. \nIn addition, improvements in federal regulation will streamline \nwholesale markets in every state. At the same time, I believe Congress \nshould not enact federal legislation that disrupts existing state laws \nor that forces unwilling states to restructure.\n  I also have increasing concern about the mounting cloud of litigation \npending in the federal courts that could frustrate the development of \nhealthy wholesale and retail markets. Only Congress can clear up \njurisdictional issues and let competitive markets fully develop. \nInterstate transmission must be a federal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I believe we now have a consensus on the core issues \nthat Congress must address. The Energy Committee held an oversight \nhearing last month on the status of restructuring in the states. There \nwas nearly universal agreement among the witnesses on the need for \nfederal legislation addressing interstate transmission and federal-\nstate jurisdiction\n  I look forward to the legislative hearings next week on this and \nother bills and to reporting bi-partisan electricity legislation that \ncan pass the Senate this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the accessibility to and affordability of health care, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               health care access and equity act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Chairman \nRoth and Senator Abraham, to introduce legislation which will provide \naccess to affordable health insurance for 43 million uninsured \nAmericans, correct the inequities in the tax treatment of certain types \nof health insurance, and allow for the full deductibility of long term \ncare insurance.\n  The Health Care Accessibility and Equity Act of 1999 presents us with \nthe opportunity to create the most comprehensive tax-deductible \ncoverage system in our nation's history.\n  One of the most discriminatory portions of the tax code is the \ndisparate treatment between an employer purchasing a health plan as \nopposed to an individual purchasing health insurance on their own.\n  Mr. President, when employers purchase a health plan for their \nemployees, he or she can fully deduct the costs of providing that \ninsurance, effectively lowering the actual costs of providing that \ncoverage.\n  However, when an employee purchases an individual policy on their \nown, they must do so with after tax-dollars. They don't have the \nability or the advantage offered to employers to reduce the actual \ncosts of the policy by deducting premiums from their taxes every year.\n  Therefore, they usually wind up without health coverage. The Health \nCare Accessibility and Equity Act will end this discrimination within \nthe tax code and make health care available for many Americans today.\n  Further, the legislation offered today by Senator Roth, Senator \nAbraham, and myself would immediately allow the self-employed to fully \ndeduct health insurance costs. Twenty-five million Americans are in \nfamilies headed by a self-employed individiual--20 percent of those are \nuninsured.\n  We always talk about trying to have more Americans covered by health \ncare insurance. Yet, we have a tax code which discriminates against \nsome, while favoring others. This results in fewer people being \ncovered.\n  Let's make the same tax incentives for purchasing health insurance \navailable to employers apply to everyone--level the playing field and \nwe will have taken the next logical step in the evolution of our health \ncare system,\n  Mr. President, I believe Congress should be doing all we can to lower \nthe costs of health insurance.\n  However, it seems most proposals before the Senate do just the \nopposite by forcing some federal definition of a quality health plan on \nconsumers and sticking them with the bill.\n  It's not good policy it does nothing for those who are uninsured and \nit certainly won't help those who will be forced to drop health \ninsurance because they can no longer afford the premiums,.\n  Mr. President, we've heard a lot of rhetoric about patient \nprotections and why the Federal Government needs to step in and help \nconsumers. Indeed, a better role for the Government is to help \nconsumers by removing restrictions on Medical Savings Accounts as we do \nin this legislation as well.\n  MSAs allow the consumers to control their costs when it comes to \nproviding their families with health care. It would allow them to \ndecide which provider they want to see and which services they want and \nwill pay for. Certainly, empowering patients is a much more productive \nsolution to a problem than simply forcing consumers to buy the \ngovernment's definition of quality health insurance.\n  When Congress created the medical savings accounts in the Kassebaum-\nKennedy Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, there were \nso many restrictions placed upon the program then that it was \nessentially set up to fail. Yet MSAs have managed to become \ntremendously successful.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, 37 percent of all MSA \npolicyholders were previously uninsured. When you gave them the option \nand the opportunity, they were then able financially to buy insurance. \nClearly, MSAs are providing an option for those who before couldn't \nafford to buy health insurance.\n  The bill we are introducing today does not force Americans into a \ngovernment-centered health care plan, a system that they spoke so \nloudly against back in 1993, if we remember. Senator Kennedy's \nPatients' Bill of Rights legislation, I think, is another example of a \ngovernment-centered approach which actually threatens the accessibility \nand the affordability of health care.\n  Again, this morning, our legislation fosters a consumer-centered \nhealth care system without raising the costs, which so many of our \nconstituents have favored.\n  Glenn Howatt of the Minneapolis Star Tribune recently did an article \non MSAs and spoke with several policyholders. I will read a portion of \nhis article which I believe demonstrates exactly why Congress needs to \nlift the restrictions on MSAs so that everyone has the opportunity to \npurchase an affordable health insurance plan. Mr. Howatt gives an \naccount of Suzanne Eisenreich Roberts.\n\n       Last year, Roberts thought it would be a good idea to dump \n     her individual health insurance policy, which cost $330 every \n     month, because she rarely got sick.\n       She switched to an MSA last year. Her premiums dropped to \n     $100 per month, but her deductible shot up to $2,250 a year.\n       Two days after the new policy became effective, Roberts \n     developed a gallstone problem that required surgery. Although \n     the insurance covered the $14,000 surgery, Roberts had to pay \n     $2,250 to satisfy the deductible requirement.\n       ``Financially, I can afford the deductible,'' said Roberts. \n     And, she noted, ``I was really out nothing because I would \n     have spent it in premiums anyway.''\n       If Roberts had kept her old policy, her annual premiums \n     would have been $3,960.\n       But her new policy's premiums are just $1,200 a year--a \n     $2,760 saving that more than makes up for the deductible \n     cost.\n\n  Even though she went with the MSA, even though she had to have \nsurgery the first year, she was far ahead by having a medical savings \naccount compared to her own insurance policy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed the entire text of Mr. \nHowatt's article and another pertinent article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Star Tribune, Feb. 28, 1999]\n\n  Medical Savings Accounts Offer Relief From High Health Care Premiums\n\n                           (By Glenn Howatt)\n\n       At time when health care premiums in Minnesota are up 15 to \n     20 percent over last year's rates, a growing number of small \n     businesses are turning to medical savings accounts as a way \n     to seek relief.\n       Commonly known as MSAs, medical savings accounts combine a \n     high-deductible insurance policy with a tax-advantaged \n     account the consumer can use to pay the deductible. MSAs \n     represent a departure from the norm in a state serviced \n     primarily by health maintenance organizations and other forms \n     of managed care.\n       Most health insurance policies in Minnesota provide \n     coverage for a wide range of medical needs--everything from \n     complex surgery to routine clinic visits.\n       But under MSAs, insurance coverage doesn't kick in until \n     the individual policyholder has paid for thousands of dollars \n     worth of health care out of pocket.\n       This high-deductible insurance policy is paired with the \n     medical savings account, a tax-advantaged fund that helps the \n     policyholder cope financially with the demands of the \n     deductible.\n       To its advocates, the MSA is more than a one-time fix to \n     cut costs, instead representing a long-term approach to \n     buying health care.\n\n\n                             The advantages\n\n       The catastrophic insurance policy results in much lower \n     premiums, the high deductible controls costs by cutting down \n     on unnecessary visits to the doctor, and the attractive \n     savings account gives users an incentive to stay healthy so \n     they can use the money for other things, such as retirement, \n     advocates content.\n       But MSAs also have critics, who say the high deductible is \n     a burden for those with chronic medical conditions. Some also \n     fear public health consequences if individuals\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\n     avoid spending money to receive the kind of preventive health \n     care that is fully covered by managed care policies.\n       Congress asked the General Accounting Office (GAO), the \n     investigative and research arm of the government, to gauge \n     the impact of MSAs on the health insurance market when it \n     authorized the marketing of MSAs under a four-year experiment \n     that began in 1997.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       While the policy implications of MSAs are still unclear, in \n     practical terms, MSAs are becoming an option for small \n     businesses and the self-employed, the only groups that are \n     eligible to set up MSAs.\n       Under the current law, the definition of self-employed is \n     the same as the Internal Revenue Service's: a person who pays \n     self-employment tax or pays Social Security tax as a self-\n     employed person. The plans are not available to people who \n     are unemployed or who have retired early and are not yet \n     covered by Medicare, but a bill proposed in the U.S. House \n     would expand the definition to include those groups.\n\n\n                          small business buyer\n\n       Eldon Kimball, owner of Edina-based Creative Systems \n     Software, happened upon the MSA option after he received a \n     general mailing from an insurance broker.\n       Kimball, who provides health benefits for himself and his \n     four employees, was looking for some way to deal with \n     spiraling health care premiums.\n       ``Premiums were going up and up and up and up and for a \n     small company like ours, that was becoming a terrible \n     burden,'' Kimball said.\n       Small businesses such as Kimball's have few options--cut \n     benefits, ask employees to shoulder more cost, drop health \n     insurance altogether, or let health care take a bigger bite \n     out of the bottom line.\n       While Kimball noted that switching to an MSA would lower \n     his total premium bill by nearly $200 a month, he was more \n     impressed with the benefits that the MSA could provide to his \n     employees.\n       Kimball uses the money he saves on premiums to partially \n     fund the medical savings accounts for his employees, a move \n     that gives him a break on his taxes.\n       The employees can use the money in their MSAs to pay for \n     medical costs--the annual deductibles for the insurance \n     policy are $2,250 for individuals and $4,450 for families.\n       Anything that employees don't spend they keep, making the \n     MSA another way of saving for retirement. At that point, the \n     money becomes available for any purpose without penalty. \n     Withdrawals from MSAs can be made before retirement for non-\n     medical purposes, but those are subject to penalties and \n     taxes.\n\n\n                            retirement fund\n\n       ``It has a long-term advantage,'' said Kimball. The MSA \n     ``becomes another benefit in the form of a retirement fund if \n     they don't use it.''\n       Under the MSA regulations, employers are not required to \n     put money into employees' accounts.\n       Edwrd M. Ryan, an Eden Prairie-based certified public \n     accountant who employs 10 workers, said his employees still \n     come out ahead even though he doesn't fund their MSAs.\n       Before his office switched to MSAs last year, he split the \n     cost of the monthly insurance premium with his workers. Now \n     he pays the entire cost of the premium, freeing up workers' \n     money to fund their MSAs.\n       But MSAs also come with high deductibles, as Suzanne \n     Eisenreich Roberts, who owns Accountant Profile Inc., a \n     Roseville-based placement agency for accountants, knows well.\n       Last year, Roberts thought it would be a good idea to dump \n     her individual health insurance policy, which cost $330 every \n     month, because she rarely got sick.\n       She switched to an MSA last year. Her premiums dropped to \n     $100 per month, but her deductible shot up to $2,250 a year.\n       Two days after the new policy became effective, Roberts \n     developed a gallstone problem that required surgery. Although \n     the insurance covered the $14,000 surgery. Roberts had to pay \n     $2,250 to satisfy the deductible requirement.\n       ``Financially I can afford the deductible,'' said Roberts. \n     And, she noted, ``I was really out nothing because I would \n     have spent it in premiums anyway.''\n       If Roberts had kept her old policy, her annual premiums \n     would have been $3,960. But her new policy's premiums are \n     just $1,200 a year--a $2,760 saving that more than makes up \n     for the deductible cost.\n\n\n                          targeting uninsured\n\n       Companies that sell MSAs obviously are targeting people \n     such as Roberts who have little downside risk. But they also \n     hope to sign up people who could not afford health insurance \n     before.\n       The GAO reported that of the nearly 42,000 MSA accounts \n     established in 1997, 37 percent were started by individuals \n     who previously did not have health insurance.\n       ``MSAs were intended for having a lower cost mechanism to \n     attract more people without insurance,'' said Scott Krienke, \n     vice president of marketing for Fortis Insurance in \n     Milwaukee.\n       The GAO report issued in December said about 40 companies \n     nationally were selling high-deductible insurance policies \n     paired with MSAs. Some insurance companies act as trustee for \n     the account, but sometimes a bank or investment company \n     serves as the trustee.\n       Insurance companies responding to the GAO survey said they \n     were disappointed with sales, but hoped that growing \n     familiarity with MSAs on the part of consumers and brokers \n     would lead to greater acceptance of the product.\n       Fortis, which sells MSAs nationwide, is believed to be the \n     largest seller of MSA policies in Minnesota, according to \n     state officials.\n       Krienke said Fortis sold 260 individual policies in \n     Minnesota in 1997 and nearly doubled that number to 516 in \n     1998. He hopes sales will reach 700 this year.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                             new customers\n\n       MSAs could gain a larger market presence this year through \n     Community Coordinated Health Care, a new health plan being \n     formed by a consortium of clinics and hospitals.\n       The plan will offer MSAs to small and medium-sized \n     businesses that are part of the Employers Association, a \n     coalition of more than 1,700 companies.\n       ``We are going to appeal to everybody,'' said Bernie \n     Mackell, of Eden Prairie-based Medical Savings Accounts Inc., \n     who is coordinating MSAs for the new health plan.\n       Mackell said education will be a large component of the MSA \n     programs being offered to Employers Association companies.\n       ``Having employees involved in their health care is \n     important,'' Mackell said. Health education would encourage \n     employees to seek preventive care as one way that they can \n     preserve capital in the MSA funds.\n       The new health plan is expected to be operational by this \n     summer.\n       And at least two large health insurers are watching the MSA \n     market closely.\n       Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota said it is \n     monitoring the market, although right now it has not plans to \n     offer an MSA.\n       However, HealthPartners said it is actively considering \n     offering an MSA product.\n       ``We already have in our product line a $1,000 deductible \n     plan for individuals that moves in the direction that MSAs \n     go,'' said George Halvorson, HealthPartners chief executive, \n     adding that there is a ``good likelihood'' that \n     HealthPartners may add an MSA into the mix at some point.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                         a national experiment\n\n       Insurance companies began selling medical savings accounts \n     (MSAs) in 1997 under a four-year trial period established by \n     Congress. Self-employed workers and small businesses with 50 \n     or fewer employees are eligible for MSAs. Sales of MSAs have \n     not met expectations, and only 42,000 MSAs were opened in \n     1997, according to the General Accounting Office (GAO). MSA \n     advocates say the rules laid down by Congress are too \n     restrictive and want the accounts to be available to a wider \n     market. But critics fear that MSAs could siphon healthier \n     individuals from the traditional insurance market. A GAO \n     study on the effect of MSAs was canceled because not enough \n     MSAs have been sold.\n\n\n                             how msas work\n\n       Medical savings accounts are paired with high-deductible, \n     low-premium health insurance policies.\n\n\n                      the health insurance policy\n\n       Premiums on high-deductible policies are typically lower \n     than most other forms of insurance. Employers offering MSAs \n     can require workers to pay part of the premium.\n       For individual coverage, deductibles must be at least \n     $1,500 but no more than $2,250. For family coverage, \n     deductibles range between $3,000 and $4,500.\n       The policy might (but is not required to) have additional \n     out-of-pocket costs, such as copayments for office visits. \n     Maximum annual out-of-pocket expenses, including the \n     deductible, are $3,000 for individuals and $5,500 for \n     families.\n\n\n                      the medical savings account\n\n                                deposits\n\n       Money deposited into the MSA, which is separate from the \n     premiums paid on the health policy, can come from the \n     individual or the employer, but not from both in the same \n     year.\n       There's a limit to how much money can be put into an MSA \n     each year. For individual coverage, up to 65 percent of the \n     deductible amount can be contributed. For family coverage, \n     the maximum goes up to 75 percent of the deductible.\n       Contributions made by individuals are tax-deductible. \n     Contributions made by employers do not count toward gross \n     income and are not subject to taxes.\n       Most MSA accounts earn interest similar to passbook savings \n     accounts, but some MSA administrators offer the option to \n     transfer money into money market accounts or mutual funds \n     under certain conditions.\n\n\n                              withdrawals\n\n       MSA contributions accrue and are not ``use it or lose it'' \n     accounts. Individuals are not required to use MSA funds when \n     paying deductible amounts under the insurance policy.\n       MSA dollars can be used to pay for qualified medical \n     expenses, including doctor visits, prescription drugs, vision \n     and dental care.\n       Withdrawals from MSAs for non-medical expenses are subject \n     to a 15 percent tax penalty and are counted as gross income.\n       After the MSA account holder turns age 65, MSA funds can be \n     used for any purpose and are not assessed the 15 percent \n     penalty.\n\n\n[[Page S7595]]\n\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Clearly, Mr. President, MSAs offer many benefits for the \nuninsured. Let's lift the restrictions placed on MSAs and allow \neveryone to open a Medical Savings Account.\n  The Health Care Accessibility and Equity Act begins the process of \ndealing with our nation's long term care needs.\n  Mr. President, it is estimated that, in the history of the world, \nhalf of the people who have ever reached age 65 are alive today.\n  And as the babyboom generation ages, the population of those over age \n65 will increase quicker than at any time in history.\n  The increase in the aged population brings with it a number of \ncomplex and vexing issues, one of which is long term care.\n  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act tinkered \nslightly with the issue of long term care insurance, but we need to \nmeet the issue head on.\n  The legislation Chairman Roth, Senator Abraham, and I are introducing \ntoday would eliminate the questions surrounding what constitutes a \nqualified versus non-qualified long term care plan and their tax \ntreatment.\n  I have always believed we should encourage individuals to save for \ntheir retirement needs and, for a number of reasons, usually cost, long \nterm care insurance is often overlooked during retirement planning.\n  Unfortunately, this often leads to individuals spending themselves \ndown to poverty and relying on Medicaid. By allowing individuals to \ndeduct the costs of long-term care insurance, we can prevent many of \nour elderly from impoverishing themselves in order to receive long-term \ncare.\n  The Health Care Accessibility and Equity Act of 1999 is good policy \nand will begin to address the crisis of 43 million Americans without \naccess to affordable health care insurance today. Most important, it \nlevels the playing field for those who are purchasing health insurance \nindividually.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to help us get \ncloser to the goal of health care access for all Americans.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, there is a serious inadequacy in the \ntreatment of Americans who must pay for their health care on their own \nand those who receive it on a tax subsidized basis from their \nemployers. In addition, our tax code restricts people from making \nhealth care decisions in a tax advantaged way. I am happy to join with \nmy colleagues, Senator Grams of Minnesota and Senator Abraham of \nMichigan in sponsoring the Health Care Access and Equity Act of 1999. \nOur bill would rectify this situation and provide a level playing field \nfor all Americans who purchase their own health insurance and those who \nreceive employer subsidized insurance. It will also give people more \ntax-advantaged options in how they use their health care dollars.\n  Let me explain the current unfairness of our tax code as it relates \nto health care insurance. Current law provides that any employer \nsubsidy of health benefits is not included in the income of the \nemployee. This means that if an employer pays the entire cost of health \ncare insurance, that entire subsidy is not included in the employee's \ntaxable income.\n  However, if the employer does not provide health care insurance for \nits employees or if the employee has to pay the full cost of the \ninsurance, they do not get the same tax benefit as those who have all \nor a portion of their health care insurance paid for by their employer. \nThose premiums that are not paid for by the employer can be deducted by \nthe employee--but only to the extent that the total premium amount and \nother health care costs exceed 7.5% of the employee's adjusted gross \nincome. What this effectively means is that these individuals are \ndenied a tax effective way of paying for health insurance.\n  Self-employed individuals don't have an employer to cover their \nhealth insurance needs; they must pay for their health insurance on \ntheir own. Self-employed individuals can only deduct 60% of the amount \nof their health care premiums. This percentage will increase over time \nuntil the year 2003, when health care premiums will be fully \ndeductible.\n  Our current tax code does not treat all taxpayers the same. Our bill \nchanges this situation.\n  This bill provides that all taxpayers can fully deduct the amount \npaid for health insurance--as long as the taxpayer is not eligible to \nparticipate in an employer subsidized medical plan. This equalizes the \ntax treatment of paying for health insurance so that all individuals \nget a tax incentive when they have health care insurance, regardless of \nwhether their employer pays for the coverage.\n\n  This amendment underscores the need to make health care more \naffordable for more Americans and to begin providing greater equity in \nthe tax treatment of health insurance whether people obtain their \ncoverage at their place of employment or purchase coverage in the \nindividual health insurance market.\n  It is a sobering fact that there are over 41 million Americans \nwithout health insurance.\n  Largely as a result of the tax incentives I explained before, the \nnumber of people covered by employer-provided health insurance has \ngrown from less than 12 million in 1940 to approximately 150 million \ntoday.\n  However, those who do not have tax-subsidized health care benefits do \nnot fare as well. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, \nindividuals who must pay for health coverage with after-tax dollars are \n24 times more likely to be uninsured as those with employer-provided \ncoverage.\n  With this change, all individuals who do not receive the employer-\nprovided subsidies for health care insurance will not have the \nopportunity to have their taxes reduced because they purchased \ninsurance.\n  This amendment will benefit approximately 12 million taxpayers who do \nnot have health insurance that is subsidized by an employer.\n  Our bill also provides that more individuals will be able to have \nlong term care insurance in a tax effective manner, by giving them a \ntax deduction for the payment of premiums for a long term care policy. \nCurrent law only allows a deduction for long term care premiums if \nthose premiums, along with other medical expenses exceed 7.5% of \nadjusted gross income. With this bill, the entire amount of the long \nterm care premium will be deductible. This will benefit at least 3.8 \nmillion taxpayers. Clearly more people will be able to prepare for \ntheir future needs by buying long term care insurance.\n  Another important provision of our bill is the expansion of the \navailability of medical Savings Accounts. MSAs gives individuals more \nchoice in how they spend their health care dollars.\n  Current law restricts who can participate in an MSA and clearly \nthese restrictions have limited who participate in this program. Our \nbill would lift these caps on this program and give people more reason \nto choose to be in an MSA.\n\n  Another important point to remember with MSAs is that they encourage \nthose individuals who are not insured to become insured. When the \nGeneral Accounting Office reviewed what has happened in the MSA market, \nthey reported that approximately one third of those who participated in \nthe MSA program had been previously uninsured. The MSA participated in \nthe MSA program had been previously uninsured. The MSA program has been \nproven to increase those covered under a health plan; with this bill we \nexpand the program so that more people will be insured.\n  Finally, our bill provides incentives for employees to contribute to \nflexible spending accounts. With a flexible spending account, an \nemployee can contribute a portion of his salary--thereby reducing his \ntaxable income--to a flexible spending account and then use the money \nin that account to pay for health care benefits, whether or not they \nare covered by his medical insurance. Increasing the availability of \nthese FSAs, will give employees more freedom on how to spend their \nmoney when purchasing health care.\n  The policy behind our bill is clear--increased equity in the tax \nsystem for health care insurance and more choice for individuals in how \nthey spend their health care dollars. I am happy to join my two \ndistinguished colleagues--Senator Grams and Abraham and the other \nSenators co-sponsoring this important health care legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\n  S. 1275. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to produce \nand sell products and to sell publications relating to the Hoover Dam, \nand to deposit revenues generated from the sales into the Colorado \nRiver Dam fund; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   HOOVER DAM MISCELLANEOUS SALES ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to authorize \nthe Bureau of Reclamation to produce commemorative items for sale at \nthe Hoover Dam Visitor Center.\n  Mr. President, the Hoover Dam receives more than one million visitors \na year. Many of those visitors have expressed an interest in purchasing \nbooks, maps, photos, and other memorabilia relating to the Colorado \nRiver and the design, construction, and operation of the Dam. This bill \nwould authorize the production and sale of such items, including the \nminting of commemorative coins from scrap copper that came from \nelectrical cabinets and boxes which were used when the Dam was manually \noperated. Four to five tons of copper are available for this purpose.\n  Mr. President, this bill not only responds to the public's demand for \nHoover Dam-related items, it also creates a revenue source to help \nrepay the cost of constructing the visitor center and of providing \nguided tours of the Dam and its power plant. Currently, purchasers of \nHoover Dam power in Arizona, California, and Nevada are paying for the \nconstruction of the visitor center, which ended up costing \napproximately $125 million, nearly four times as much as the original \nestimate. This bill further authorizes the Bureau to select a private \nconcessionaire to manage the gift shop selling these items, thereby \ncreating a new business opportunity for a private or a non-profit \nentity. Thus, this bill would enhance the visitor experience at Hoover \nDam in a taxpayer-friendly way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1275\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hoover Dam Miscellaneous \n     Sales Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the sale and distribution of general public information \n     about the use of public land and water areas for recreation, \n     fish, wildlife, and other purposes serve significant public \n     benefits;\n       (2) publications and other materials educate the public and \n     provide general information about Bureau of Reclamation \n     programs and projects;\n       (3) in 1997, more than 1,000,000 visitors, including \n     300,000 from foreign countries, toured the Hoover Dam;\n       (4) hundreds of thousands of additional visitors stopped to \n     view the dam;\n       (5) visitors often ask to purchase maps, publications, and \n     other items to enhance their experience or serve educational \n     purposes;\n       (6) in many cases the Bureau of Reclamation is the sole \n     source of those items;\n       (7) the Bureau is in a unique position to fulfill public \n     requests for those items; and\n       (8) as a public agency, the Bureau should be responsive to \n     the public by having appropriate items available for sale.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to offer for \n     sale to members of the public that visit the Hoover Dam \n     Visitor Center educational materials and memorabilia; and\n       (2) to use revenue from those sales to repay the costs \n     relating to construction of the Hoover Dam Visitor Center.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT SALES.\n\n       With respect to the Hoover Dam, the Secretary of the \n     Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, \n     may--\n       (1) conduct sales of--\n       (A) materials generated by the Bureau of Reclamation such \n     as posters, maps, brochures, photographs, and similar \n     publications, videotapes, and computer information discs that \n     are related to programs or projects of the Bureau; and\n       (B) memorabilia and other commemorative items that depict \n     programs or projects of the Bureau;\n       (2) convert unneeded property or scrap material into Bureau \n     memorabilia for sale purposes; and\n       (3) enter into agreements with nonprofit organizations, \n     other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and \n     commercial entities for--\n       (A) the production or sale of items described in paragraphs \n     (1) and (2); and\n       (B) the sale of publications described in paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 5. COSTS AND REVENUES.\n\n       (a) Costs.--All costs incurred by the Bureau of Reclamation \n     under this Act shall be paid from the Colorado River Dam fund \n     established by section 2 of the Act of December 21, 1928 (43 \n     U.S.C. 617a).\n       (b) Revenues.--\n       (1) Use for repayment of sales costs.--All revenues \n     collected by the Bureau of Reclamation under this Act shall \n     be credited to the Colorado River Dam fund to remain \n     available, without further Act of appropriation, to pay costs \n     associated with the production and sale of items in \n     accordance with section 4.\n       (2) Use for repayment of construction costs.--All revenues \n     collected by the Bureau of Reclamation under this Act that \n     are not needed to pay costs described in paragraph (1) shall \n     be transferred annually to the general fund of the Treasury \n     in repayment of costs relating to construction of the Hoover \n     Dam Visitor Center.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Chafee, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Specter, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Harkin, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Wellstone, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, \n        Mr. Leahy, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Reid, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Robb, Mr. Cleland, Mr. \n        Moynihan, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Levin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Bryan, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1276. A bill to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n               employment non-discrimination act of 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here today to \nintroduce the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1999 (ENDA). I am \nhere today because I believe that the principles of equality and \nopportunity should be applied to all Americans and that success at work \nshould be based on performance, not prejudice.\n\n  Unfortunately, qualified, hard-working Americans continue to be \ndenied job opportunities based instead on sexual orientation. The \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act will help put an end to this \ninsidious discrimination. By extending to sexual orientation the same \nfederal employment discrimination protections established for race, \nreligion, gender, national origin, age and disability, the Employment \nNon-Discrimination Act will further ensure that principals of equality \nand opportunity apply to all Americans.\n  This bill is about fairness, this bill is about equality, this bill \nis about basic civil rights. This bill must pass this Congress.\n  ENDA will achieve equal rights -- not ``special rights'' -- for gays \nand lesbians. This legislation prohibits preferential treatment based \non sexual orientation. To remove any doubt, we have added language to \nexpressly prohibit affirmative action on the basis of sexual \norientation.\n  ENDA does not require an employer to justify a neutral practice that \nmay have a statistically disparate impact based on sexual orientation, \nnor provide benefits for the same-sex partner of an employee. Rather, \nit simply protects a right that should belong to every American, the \nright to be free from discrimination at work because of personal \ncharacteristics unrelated to successful performance on the job.\n  We took a fresh look at ENDA and we have made a number of \nconstructive changes this year. We have re-written the discrimination \nsection to more closely track Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964. This new language has the benefit of 35 years of legal \ninterpretation. Employers and courts alike understand this language and \nwhat is expected under it.\n  One concern that we have heard repeatedly during past debates is that \nthis language will create a tidal wave of litigation. In Vermont, one \nof 11 states to have enacted a sexual-orientation anti-discrimination \nlaw, the legal waters have been more like the Tidal Basin. In the 9 \nyears since the enactment of Vermont's law, Vermont's Attorney General \nhas initiated only 25 investigations of alleged sexual orientation \ndiscrimination.\n  Vermont is not unique. According to the GAO, none of the states with\n\n[[Page S7597]]\n\nENDA-type laws have experienced a wave of litigation. Instead, these \nstates have ensured that employees working within their borders cannot \nbe discriminated against for being gay.\n  As I have stated before, success at work should be directly related \nto one's ability to do the job, period. We first introduced ENDA in \n1994. Over the past six years, we have held hearings, listened to the \nconcerns raised and revised this legislation to respond to those \nconcerns. I am pleased to report that it was worth the effort because \nThe Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1999 is the best bill we have \never introduced. The time has come to make the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act the law of the land.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1276\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Employment Non-\n     Discrimination Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide a comprehensive Federal prohibition of \n     employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation;\n       (2) to provide meaningful and effective remedies for \n     employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; \n     and\n       (3) to invoke congressional powers, including the powers to \n     enforce the 14th amendment to the Constitution and to \n     regulate interstate commerce, in order to prohibit employment \n     discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am proud to stand with Senator \nJeffords, Senator Lieberman, Congressman Frank, and Congressman Shays \nto announce the introduction of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act \nof 1999, which has over 30 co-sponsors in the Senate and over 150 co-\nsponsors in the House of Representatives. Once this bill becomes law, \nit will ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to work without \nfear of reprisal because of their sexual orientation. It is the next \nimportant step for civil rights in America.\n  This country has made great progress toward fairness and an end to \nbigotry in the workplace. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nensures that Americans--without regard to their race, ethnic \nbackground, gender, or religion--have the opportunity to obtain and \nkeep a job. The Minimum Wage guarantees a basic standard of living. The \nFamily and Medical Leave Act guarantees that working men and\n\n[[Page S7599]]\n\nwomen can balance important family and employment responsibilities \nwithout fear of reprisal by their employer. The Americans with \nDisabilities Act establishes important protections for workers with \ndisabilities.\n  Now, Congress must take steps to achieve the same kind of fairness \nfor gay men and lesbians who encounter blatant discrimination in the \nworkplace. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act will accomplish that \ngoal by prohibiting employers from using sexual orientation as a basis \nfor hiring, firing, promotion, or compensation.\n  The bill is important for what it does, as well as what it doesn't \ndo. It does not require domestic partnership benefits. It does not \nauthorize ``disparate impact'' claims. It does not apply to the Armed \nServices. It contains a broad exemption of religious organizations. It \nprohibits quotas and preferential treatment, and bars the EEOC from \nrequiring the collection of statistical information on sexual \norientation.\n  A broad coalition of churches, businesses, and civil rights liberties \norganizations support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 68 percent \nof Americans from all regions of the country support its passage.\n  The American people agree that workplace discrimination is wrong, and \nthat clear protections are needed to prevent it. Some states already \nhave such laws, and many businesses have policies similar to our \nproposal. But this patchwork of protection is inadequate. A national \nstandard is essential for the protection of this basic right.\n  The discrimination that exists today is a stain on our democracy.\n  David Horowitz encountered this bigotry when he applied to be an \nAssistant City Attorney in Mesa, Arizona. He had graduated near the top \nof his law school class at the University of Arizona. While employed by \na private law firm, he applied for a position with the City Attorney. \nHe was not offered a position, but he was told he was the second \nchoice. Six months later, he was called and interviewed for another job \nopening. The City Attorney asked David for references and told him \nthat, ``I only ask for references when I'm ready to make someone an \noffer.'' In the interview, David told the City Attorney that he was \nopenly gay, and the tone of the interview suddenly changed. David was \ntold that his sexual orientation posed a problem, and three weeks later \nhe received a rejection letter.\n  What happened to David Horowitz was wrong, but he had no recourse \nunder State or Federal law against this blatant discrimination. No \nAmerican should be denied a chance to work because of prejudices. It is \nlong past time to close this loophole in our civil rights law, and I \nurge the Congress to act this year to close it.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with Senators \nJeffords, Kennedy and over 30 of our colleagues as an original \ncosponsor of this important legislation, the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act of 1999. By guaranteeing that American workers \ncannot lose their jobs simply because of their sexual orientation, this \nbill would extend the bedrock American values of fairness and equality \nto a group of our fellow citizens who too often have been denied the \nbenefit of those most basic values.\n  Our nation's foundational document, the Declaration of Independence, \nexpressed a vision of our country as one premised upon the essential \nequality of all people and upon the recognition that our Creator \nendowed all of us with the inalienable rights to life, liberty and the \npursuit of happiness. Two hundred and twenty-three years ago, when that \ndocument was drafted, our laws fell far short of implementing the \nDeclaration's ideal. But since that time, we have come ever closer, \nextending by law to more and more of our citizens--to African \nAmericans, to women, to disabled Americans, to religious minorities and \nto others--a legally enforceable guarantee that, with respect to their \nability to earn a living at least, they will be treated on their merits \nand not on characteristics unrelated to their ability to do their jobs.\n  It is time to extend that guarantee to gay men and lesbians, who too \noften have been subject to incidents of discrimination and denied the \nmost basic of rights: the right to obtain and maintain a job. A \ncollection of one national survey and twenty city and state surveys \nfound that as many as 44 percent of gay, lesbian and bisexual workers \nfaced job discrimination in the workplace at some time in their \ncareers. Other studies have reported even greater discrimination--as \nmuch as 68 percent of gay men and lesbians reporting employment \ndiscrimination. The fear in which these workers live was clear from a \nsurvey of gay men and lesbians in Philadelphia. Over three-quarters \ntold those conducting the survey that they sometimes or always hide \ntheir orientation at work out of fear of discrimination.\n  The toll this discrimination takes extends far beyond its effect on \nthose individuals who must live in fear and without full employment \nopportunities. It also takes an unacceptable toll on America's \ndefinition of itself as a land of equality and opportunity, as a place \nwhere we judge each other on our merits, and as a country that teaches \nits children that anyone can succeed here as long as they are willing \nto do their job and work hard.\n  This bill provides for equality and fairness--that and no more. It \nsays only what we already have said for women, for people of color and \nfor others: that you are entitled to have your ability to earn a living \ndepend only on your ability to do the job and nothing else. In fact, \nthe bill would even do somewhat less than it does for women and people \nof color, because it would not give gay men and women all of the \nprotections we currently provide to other groups protected under our \ncivil rights laws.\n  Mr. President, this bill would bring our nation one large step closer \nto realizing the vision that Thomas Jefferson so eloquently expressed \n223 years ago when he wrote that all of us have a right to life, \nliberty and the pursuit of happiness. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting this important legislation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senator \nJeffords as he reintroduces the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. As \nbefore, I speak as a strong supporter of this legislation, because I \nhave always believed that every single American deserves fair treatment \nunder the law no matter his or her gender, race, religion or sexual \norientation.\n  As one of only a few women to ever serve in the United States Senate, \nand the first ever from Washington state, I understand what it means to \nbe part of a group that seeks fairness and equal opportunity. I have \nnever advocated for any special class, just equal treatment and \nprotection under the law.\n  Not long ago, many thought it would be impossible for women to serve \nin the Senate or an elected office of any kind. It was felt this was \nnot a suitable occupation for a woman and that simply being a woman \nmeant a person was incapable of meeting the demands of the job. These \npeople alleged that women would somehow jeopardize the work done in the \nU.S. Congress. While these statements may seem impossible to believe \ntoday, they do illustrate what many women faced. However, to our \ncountry's benefit, these stereotypes were overcome. I am confident that \nnone of my colleagues today would deny the tremendous contributions \nwomen have made here, in the House, in state and local government, and \nat every level of public service.\n  People suffer when stereotypes based on fear or ignorance are used to \njustify discrimination. I do not believe elected leaders serve our \ncountry well if they deny any citizen equal opportunities and equal \ntreatment under the law. A person's success or failure must depend on \nhis or her qualifications, skills, efforts, and even luck. But, no one, \nI repeat, no one, should be denied opportunities because of race, \ngender, religion, age or sexual orientation. No one should endure \ndiscrimination such as many people have endured in the workplace \nbecause of sexual orientation.\n  I am always disappointed to hear about cases of economic \ndiscrimination based solely on sexual orientation. It defies logic that \nin today's society any employer could refuse to hire an individual, \ndeny them equal pay, or professional advancement and subject them to \nharassment simply because of their sexual orientation. Our country is \nbased on the ideal of allowing equal opportunity and basic civil rights \nfor all Americans, but we have not fully\n\n[[Page S7600]]\n\nachieved this goal. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act will correct \nthat wrong.\n  As we would all agree, discrimination based on race, gender, ethnic \norigin, or religion is not just unfair, but illegal as well. ENDA would \nsimply add sexual orientation to this list. It is written even more \nnarrowly than current law for other areas of non-discrimination, \nbecause it does not allow positive corrective actions such as quotas or \nother preferential treatment. It simply says that a person cannot be \nunfairly treated in employment, based on his or her sexuality, whether \nthat person is heterosexual or homosexual. Mr. President, this is a \nreasonable expectation. In fact, it has become a reality in nine \nstates, including California, Massachusetts, and Minnesota, and in many \nlocal jurisdictions across the country. Also, many Fortune 500 \ncompanies, such as Microsoft and IBM, have adopted their own non-\ndiscrimination policies. Companies such as these recognize that it \nmakes good business sense to value each and every one of their \nemployees equally. It is time that our laws reflect these values as \nwell.\n  Not only do these companies and governments support a non-\ndiscrimination policy in the workplace, but the public also supports \nENDA by a wide margin, according to a bipartisan 1998 poll conducted \nfor the Human Rights Campaign. This poll found that 58 percent of \nAmericans support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This is \ncompelling evidence that Americans are behind ENDA, support expanding \nthese basic civil rights to all, and believe that everyone deserves \nthese rights. They understand that our country will be a better place \nwhen discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace is put \nto an end.\n  Mr. President, this is not about one group's protection at another's \nexpense. This issue is still not about allowing a greater window for \nlitigation, as opponents have previously argued. It is about common \nsense, common decency and our fundamental values as Americans.\n  In the last Congress, we came within one vote of adopting this \nimportant, bipartisan legislation. I urge my colleagues now to support \nthis measure so that we can continue our proud tradition of protecting \nbasic civil rights and opportunity for all Americans. Let us join \ntogether to pass this bill so that our brothers and sisters, sons and \ndaughters, friends and relatives will have protection against unjust \ndiscrimination. We have the opportunity to provide them with these \nbasic civil rights now. I hope my colleagues will seize this \nopportunity to make our country the just, equal, and fair place it \nshould be.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 1277. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a new prospective payment system for Federally-qualified \nhealth centers and rural health clinics; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  safety net preservation act of 1999\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nco-sponsored by Senator Baucus to preserve hundreds of community health \ncenters and rural health clinics across the country. Our bill, The \nSafety Net Preservation Act of 1999, would remedy a phase-out of the \npayment system that covers the clinics' cost of caring for Medicaid \npatients. Congress approved the phase-out of cost-based reimbursement \nduring the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  The phase-out was meant to save Medicaid money and respond to those \nwho felt cost-based reimbursement imposed an expensive mandate on \nstates. Scheduled to begin on October 1, the phase-out will force the \nclinics to use scarce federal grants intended to provide care for the \nuninsured to prop up Medicaid under-payments. The change could force \nhealth centers to lose as much as $1.1 billion over the next five \nyears.\n  Our bill would establish a prospective payment system to ensure that \nhealth centers and clinics receive sufficient Medicaid funding. The \nbill would protect the federal investment in health centers while \ngiving states the flexibility to design their own payment systems for \nhealth centers and clinics.\n  There's no doubt that community health centers and rural health \nclinics serve a unique and essential role in getting high-quality \nhealth care services to those in need. They are the backbone of \nAmerica's health care infrastructure for millions of medically under-\nserved rural and urban communities, where access to health care is \noften limited. I've seen first hand the valuable services provided by \nthese centers and the obstacles the providers overcome to do so. Last \nyear, I visited a center in Des Moines. They serve patients who speak \nnine different languages. In many cases, these clinics are often the \ndifference between seeing a doctor and forgoing treatment. We can't \nallow money shortfalls to force them to shut down. We have to preserve \nthis safety net for millions of Americans.\n  I am pleased for the support of Senators Murkowski, Rockefeller, \nConrad, Robb and Harkin as original co-sponsors of The Safety Net \nPreservation Act of 1999. I look forward to passage of this important \nlegislation in the 106th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERREY (for himself, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1279. A bill to improve the environmental quality and public use \nand appreciation of the Missouri River and to provide additional \nauthority to the Army Corps of Enginees to protect, enhance, and \nrestore fish and wildlife habitat on the Missouri River; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n             missouri river valley improvement act of 1999\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, \nalong with my colleagues Senator Daschle and Senator Johnson, the \nMissouri River Valley Improvement Act of 1999. This legislation is \nimportant for the 10,000 people who live along the 2,321-mile Missouri \nRiver, and marks also the upcoming bicentennial anniversary of the \nLewis and Clark expeditions along this great River. The intent of the \nAct is to improve the environmental qualtiy and public use and \nappreciation of the Missouri River, and to provide additional \nauthorities to the Army Corps of Engineers to protect, enhance, and \nrestore fish and wildlife habitat as part of their ongoing operations \non the River.\n  The Missouri River is a resource of incalculable value to the 10 \nstates which it traverses, but it is a river that has changed \ndramatically since the pioneering days of Lewis and Clark. The \nconstruction of dams and levees over the past 50 years has aided \nnavigation, flood control, and water supply along the Missouri River, \nbut has also reduced habitat for native river fish and wildlife, and \nresulted in lost opportunities for recreation on the river.\n  The legislation will help to restore a series of nature areas along \nthe river in time to celebrate the 2004 anniversary of the Lewis and \nClark, when we are anticipating greatly increased visitation along the \nriver and to the surrounding areas, due in large part to the records \nand descriptions as detailed by these explorers on their 1804 trip.\n  The bill will also aid native river fish and wildlife, help to \nrestore cottonwoods along the river, reduce flood losses, and enhance \nrecreation and tourism, all vital to the economies and quality of life \nto our communities along the river. It additional provides authorities \nfor the revitalization of historic riverfronts, similar to the ongoing \n`Back to the River' revitalization project currently underway in my \nhome state of Nebraska. The Back of the River Project in Nebraska is \nbringing our families and our businesses back to the Missouri River, \nfor recreational enjoyment as well as for the commercial and business-\nrelated opportunities that follow. It is our hope that this will aid \nother communities to participate in similar efforts in their \nriverfronts.\n\n  Another major provision of this bill is the creation of a long-term, \nscience-based monitoring program on the Missouri River. This program, \nto be developed and operated through the U.S. Geological Survey-\nBiological Resources Division in Columbia, Missouri, will monitor the \nphysical, biological, and chemical characteristics of the Missouri \nRiver. The program will help us to monitor and assess the quality of \nbiota, habitats, and the water itself in this great river, and to \nprovide information that will enhance our understanding of the \nMissouri, how it is operated, and how future operation decisions may \naffect the river.\n\n[[Page S7601]]\n\n  We currently do not understand a lot about the river, beyond the \nphysical and some of the habitat-based impacts that have been caused by \nchannelization. This program will create a publicly-accessible database \nof all the information we do have on the river, and all that is \ncollected through the project, and will help to guide our management of \nthe river in the future. The database will also provide additional \nopportunities for the people who live along the river to interact with \nthe river in another way, and to learn more about the river that they \nlive near.\n  I have seen how successful educational opportunities related to the \nRiver can be, and how excited and involved children and adults get when \nthey learn about and become more involved with their natural resources. \nThe Fontenelle Forest Association in Nebraska, which contains forests \nand wetlands, and is along the Missouri River, has hands-on exhibits, \nlive animal displays, teaching spaces, and even meeting spaces for \nNebraskans. Ken Finch, the Executive Director of the Fontenelle Forest \nAssociation, has been instrumental in providing educational programs \nand opportunities, including a program called H2Omaha, a multi-faceted \nscience education program which uses the Missouri River and its \nwatershed as a living laboratory. I envision that the Missouri River \ndatabase created by this Improvement Act will greatly expand \ninformation and data available to Ken and the participants at \nFontenelle Forest, and I know that other communities will find this \nresource valuable, as well.\n  I have also seen successful restoration efforts on the river--efforts \nlike Boyer Chute and Hamburg Bend in Nebraska--both side channels \ncreated with the aid of the Corps of Engineers. These side channels \nhave been enormously successful in restoring lost habitat for river \nspecies by creating slower-moving, more shallow waterways parallel to \nthe river. These restoration areas have attracted not just wildlife, \nsuch as the native fish and birds and even river otter that \nhistorically lived in large numbers on the Missouri, but have also \nattracted canoeists and hikers who enjoy the scenic beauty and the \nrecreational opportunities that these sites offer. This bill will help \ncommunities to create additional restoration projects like this along \nthe river, projects that will not impact existing uses of the river, \nbut that will add immensely to recreational and wildlife opportunities, \nand that will also add additional flood protection to surrounding \ncommunities.\n  In anticipation of the greatly increased visitation along the river \nthat will occur with the Lewis and Clark bicentennial celebration, the \nbill additionally will establish Lewis and Clark Interpretive Centers \nto educate the public about the Missouri River, and will allow the \nCorps of Engineers to provide enhancements to recreational facilities \nand visitors centers.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues who represent the states and \ncommunities along the Missouri River to look closely at this bill, and \nto join me and the other cosponsors of the bill in supporting this \nimportant legislation. The Missouri River Valley Improvement Act of \n1999 will help to restore and improve our access and enjoyment of the \nriver, and will provide vital economic, recreational, and educational \nopportunities for everyone who lives along and visits this great river, \nthe Crown Jewel of the midwest.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n        Cleland):\n  S. 1281. A bill to consolidate in a single independent agency in the \nexecutive branch the responsibilities regarding food safety, labeling, \nand inspection currently divided among several Federal agencies.\n\n\n                           the safe food act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould replace the current fragmented federal food safety system with a \nsingle, independent agency responsible for all federal food safety \nactivities--the Safe Food Act of 1999 (S. 1281). I am pleased to be \njoined by Senators Torricelli, Mikulski, and Cleland in this important \neffort.\n  Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with one of the safest \nand most abundant food supplies in the world. However, we can do \nbetter. Foodborne illness is a significant problem.\n  The safety of our nation's food supply is facing tremendous pressures \nwith regard to emerging pathogens, an aging population with a growing \nnumber of people at high risk for foodborne illnesses, broader food \ndistribution patterns, an increasing volume of food imports, and \nchanging consumption patterns.\n  The General Accounting Office (GAO) estimates that as many as 81 \nmillion people will suffer food poisoning this year and more than 9,000 \nwill die. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable. In terms \nof medical costs and productivity losses, foodborne illness costs the \nnation up to $37 billion annually. The situation is not likely to \nimprove without decisive action. The Department of Health and Human \nServices predicts that foodborne illnesses and deaths will increase 10-\n15 percent over the next decade.\n  In 1997, a Princeton Research survey found that 44 percent of \nAmericans believe the food supply in this country is less safe than it \nwas 10 years ago. American consumers spend more than $617 billion \nannually on food, of which about $511 billion is spent on foods grown \non U.S. farms. Our ability to assure that the safety of our food and to \nreact rapidly to potential threats to food safety is critical not only \nfor public health, but also to the vitality of both domestic and rural \neconomies and international trade.\n  Many of you are probably following the dioxin crisis in Belgium. Days \nbefore the national elections poultry, eggs, pork, beef, and dairy \nproducts were withdrawn from supermarket shelves. Butcher shops closed \nand livestock farms were quarantined. Since then countries, worldwide, \nhave restricted imports of eggs, chickens, and pork from the European \nUnion. Public outrage in Belgium over the dioxin scandal led to a \ndisastrous showing by the ruling party in the national and European \nelections on June 14, and the government was forced to resign. Food \nsafety concerns and fears are global.\n  Today, food moves through a global marketplace. This was not the case \nin the early 1900's when the first federal food safety agencies were \ncreated. Throughout this century, Congress responded by adding layer \nupon layer--agency upon agency--to answer the pressing food safety \nneeds of the day. That's how the federal food safety system got to the \npoint where it is today. And again as we face increasing pressures on \nfood safety, the federal government must respond. But we must respond \nnot only to these pressures but also to the very fragmented nature of \nthe federal food safety structure.\n  Fragmentation of our food safety system is a burden that must be \nchanged to protect the public health from these increasing pressures. \nCurrently, there are at least 12 different federal agencies, 35 \ndifferent laws governing food safety, and 28 House and Senate \nsubcommittees with food safety oversight. With overlapping \njurisdictions, federal agencies often lack accountability on food \nsafety-related issues.\n  Last August, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) released a report \nrecommending the establishment of a ``unified and central framework'' \nfor managing federal food safety programs, ``one that is headed by a \nsingle official and which has the responsibility and control of \nresources for all federal food safety activities.'' I agree with this \nconclusion.\n  The Administration has stepped forward on the issue of food safety--\nthe President's Food Safety Initiatives and the President's Council on \nFood Safety have focused efforts to track and prevent microbial \nfoodborne illnesses. I commend President Clinton and Secretaries \nGlickman and Shalala for their commitment to improving our nation's \nfood safety and inspection systems. Earlier this year in response to \nthe NAS report, the President's Council on Food Safety stated its \nsupport for the NAS recommendation calling for a new statute that \nestablishes a unified framework for food safety programs with a single \nofficial with control over all federal food safety resources.\n  An independent single food safety agency is needed to replace the \ncurrent, fragmented system. My proposed legislation would combine the \nfunctions of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FDA's Center \nfor\n\n[[Page S7602]]\n\nFood Safety and Applied Nutrition and the Center for Veterinary \nMedicine, the Department of Commerce's Seafood Inspection Program, and \nthe food safety functions of other federal agencies. This new, \nindependent agency would be funded with the combined budgets from these \nconsolidated agencies.\n  With overlapping jurisdictions, federal agencies many times lack \naccountability on food safety-related issues. There are simply too many \ncooks in the kitchen. A single, independent agency would help focus our \npolicy and improve enforcement of food safety and inspection laws.\n  The General Accounting Office has been unequivocal in its \nrecommendation for consolidation of federal food safety programs. GAO's \nApril 1998 report states that ``since 1992, we have frequently reported \non the fragmented and inconsistent organization of food safety \nresponsibilities in the federal government.'' In a May 25, 1994 report, \nGAO cites that its ``testimony is based on over 60 reports and studies \nissued over the last 25 years by GAO, agency Inspectors General, and \nothers.'' The Appendix to the 1994 GAO report lists: 49 reports since \n1977, 9 USDA Office of Inspector General reports since 1986, 1 HHS \nOffice of Inspector General report in 1991, and 15 reports and studies \nby Congress, scientific organizations, and others since 1981.\n\n  Again, earlier this year, GAO in its 21-volume report on government \nwaste, pointed to the lack of coordination of the federal food safety \nefforts as an example. ``So many cooks are spoiling the broth,'' says \nthe GAO while highlighting the absurdity of having one federal agency \ninspecting frozen meat pizza and another inspecting frozen cheese \npizza.\n  Over 20 years ago, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs \nadvised that consolidation is essential to avoid conflicts of interest \nand overlapping jurisdictions. In a 1977 report the committee stated, \n``While we support the recent efforts of FDA and USDA to improve \ncoordination between the agencies, periodic meetings will not be enough \nto overcome [these] problems.'' This statement is just as true today as \nit was then.\n  It's time to move forward. Let us stop using multiple federal \nagencies to inspect pizza. Instead let us ``deliver'' what makes \nsense--a single, independent food safety agency.\n  A single, independent agency with uniform food safety standards and \nregulations based on food hazards would provide an easier framework for \nimplementing U.S. standards in an international context. When our own \nagencies don't have uniform safety and inspection standards for all \npotentially hazardous foods, the establishment of uniform international \nstandards will be next to impossible.\n  Research could be better coordinated within a single agency than \namong multiple programs. Currently, federal funding for food safety \nresearch is spread over at least 20 federal agencies, and coordination \namong those agencies is ad hoc at best.\n  New technologies to improve food safety could be approved more \nrapidly with one food safety agency. Currently, food safety \ntechnologies must go through multiple agencies for approval, often \nadding years of delay.\n  In this era of limited budgets, it is our responsibility to modernize \nand streamline the food safety system. The U.S. simply cannot afford to \ncontinue operating multiple systems. This is not about more regulation, \na super agency, or increased bureaucracy, it's about common sense and \nmore effective marshaling of our existing federal resources.\n  With the incidence of food recalls on the rise, it is important to \nmove beyond short-term solutions to major food safety problems. A \nsingle, independent food safety and inspection agency could more easily \nwork toward long-term solutions to the frustrating and potentially \nlife-threatening issue of food safety.\n  Mr. President, together, we can bring the various agencies together \nto eliminate the overlap and confusion that have, unfortunately, at \ntimes characterized our food safety efforts. We need action, not simply \nreaction. I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to \nconsolidate the food safety and inspection functions of numerous \nagencies and offices into a single, independent food safety agency.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1281\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to ensure that no \nState may establish, maintain, or enforce on behalf of any electric \nutility an exclusive right to sell electric energy or otherwise unduly \ndiscriminate against any consumer who seeks to purchase electric energy \nin interstate commerce from any supplier; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Electric \nConsumer Choice Act. For the last three years hearings and workshops \nhave been held in both the House and Senate examining the issue of \nrestructuring the electric industry. Many bills have been introduced on \nthis issue by both Congressmen and Senators, some comprehensive and \nsome dealing with more discreet issues such as repeal of the Public \nUtility Holding Company (PUHCA) or repeal of the Public Utility \nRegulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). The bill that I am introducing \ntoday cuts to the heart of the issue: do we or don't we support \nallowing consumers to choose their electric supplier? Do we or don't we \nsupport a national competitive market in electricity? I believe the \nanswer to these questions is a resounding ``yes''! I believe \ncompetition is good, that free markets work and that every American \nwill benefit from a competitive electric industry.\n  The Electric Consumer Choice Act is intended to begin the process of \nachieving a national, competitive electricity market. It achieves this \nin a simple, straight-forward method. Primarily, it eliminates electric \nmonopolies by prohibiting the granting of exclusive rights to sell to \nelectric utilities. It prohibits undue discrimination against consumers \npurchasing electricity in interstate commerce. It provides for access \nto local distribution facilities and it allows a state to impose \nreciprocity requirements on out-of-state utilities. The bill before you \ntoday also includes a straight repeal of PUHCA and the prospective \nrepeal of the mandatory purchase provisions of PURPA. The bill also \nmakes it clear that nothing in this act expands the authority of the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or limits the authority of \na state to continue to regulate retail sales and distribution of \nelectric energy in a manner consistent with the Commerce Clause of the \nUnited States Constitution.\n  The premise of this bill is that all attributes of today's electric \nenergy market--generation, transmission, distribution and both \nwholesale and retail sales--are either in or affect interstate \ncommerce. Therefore, any State regulation of these attributes that \nunduly discriminates against the interstate market for electric power \nviolates the Commerce Clause unless such State action is protected by \nan act of Congress.\n  The Supreme Court has interpreted Part II of the Federal Power Act \n(FPA) as protecting State regulation of generation, local distribution, \nintrastate transmission and retail sales that unduly discriminates \nagainst the interstate market for electric power. The Court has \nreasoned that Congress, in the FPA, determined that the federal \ngovernment needed only to regulate wholesale sales and interstate \ntransmission in order to adequately protect interstate commerce in \nelectric energy. Thus, all other aspects of the electric energy market \nwere reserved to the States and protected from challenges under the \nCommerce Clause. The Electric Consumer Choice Act amends the FPA to \neliminate the protection provided for State regulation that \nestablishes, maintains, or enforces an exclusive right to sell electric \nenergy or that unduly discriminates against any consumer who seeks to \npurchase electric energy in interstate commerce.\n  This bill provides consumers and electric energy suppliers with the \nmeans to achieve retail choice in all States by January 1, 2002. It \ndoes not impose a federal statutory mandate on the States. It does not \npreempt the States' traditional jurisdiction to regulate the aspects of \nthe electric power market in the reserved realm--generation, local \ndistribution, intrastate transmission, or retail sales--it merely \nlimits the scope of what the States can do in that realm. It does not \nexpand or extend FERC jurisdiction into the aspects of traditional \nState authority.\n  As I stated earlier, this bill is intended to provide every consumer \na\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\nchoice when it comes to electricity suppliers. It is intended to be the \nbeginning, not the end of the process. There are many other issues that \nneed to be addressed at the federal level to facilitate a national \nmarket for electricity. Some of these issues include taxation \ndifferences between various electric providers, clarification of \njurisdiction over transmission, ensuring reliability, providing for \ninclusion of the Power Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee \nValley Authority in a national market, and other issues that can only \nbe addressed at the Federal level. These issues need to be addressed \nand should be addressed. But while these issues are being debated we \nshould ensure that progress towards customer choice proceeds.\n  I am proud to say that my state of Oklahoma has been in the forefront \nof opening up it's electricity markets to competition. Nineteen other \nstates have also moved to open their markets. It is my hope that the \nElectric Consumer Choice Act will facilitate this process nationally. \nTo that end, I am introducing this bill today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Electric Consumer \nChoice Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1284\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Electric Consumer Choice \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (a) the opportunity for all consumers to purchase electric \n     energy in interstate commerce from the supplier of choice is \n     essential to a dynamic, fully integrated and competitive \n     national market for electric energy;\n       (b) the establishment, maintenance or enforcement of \n     exclusive rights to sell electric energy and other State \n     action which unduly discriminates against any consumer who \n     seeks to purchase electric energy in interstate commerce from \n     the supplier of its choice constitutes an unwarranted and \n     unacceptable discrimination against and burden on interstate \n     commerce;\n       (c) in today's technologically driven marketplace there is \n     no justification for the discrimination against and burden \n     imposed on interstate commerce by exclusive rights to sell \n     electric energy or other State action which unduly \n     discriminates against any consumer who seeks to purchase \n     electric energy in interstate commerce from the supplier of \n     its choice; and,\n       (d) the electric energy transmission and local distribution \n     facilities of all of the nation's utilities are essential \n     facilities for the conduct of a competitive interstate retail \n     market in electric energy in which all consumers have the \n     opportunity to purchase electric energy in interstate \n     commerce from the supplier of their choice.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend section 40102(37) of title 49, United States \nCode, to modify the definition of the term ``public aircraft'' to \nprovide for certain law enforcement and emergency response activities; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           law enforcement public aviation reform act of 1999\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join with \nmy distinguished colleagues, Senator DeWine and Senator Feingold, in \nintroducing the Law Enforcement Public Aviation Reform Act of 1999. \nThis legislation will help law enforcement officers in their efforts to \nprotect our citizens. In 1994, the Congress made a terrible mistake \nwhen it passed Public Law 103-411. Under this law, aircraft belonging \nto law enforcement agencies are considered ``commercial'' if costs \nincurred from flying missions to support neighboring jurisdictions are \nreimbursed.\n  In the last Congress, we were able to include an amendment on the \nCommerce, State, and Justice appropriations bill that would have made \nthe necessary changes. Unfortunately, this measure was stripped from \nthe final conference committee report.\n  This law has placed unnecessary restrictions and costly burdens on \ngovernment agencies who operate public aircraft, particularly law \nenforcement agencies. At a time when law enforcement faces growing \nsophistication and organization of criminals, the federal government \nshould not be placing additional mandates on our law enforcement \nofficials. This law is so restrictive that it even prevents assistance \nfrom neighboring jurisdictions under mutual aid compacts.\n  Current law requires that the agency in need of assistance exhaust \nall commercially available options before requesting assistance from \nanother jurisdiction. Even in the event of ``significant and imminent \nthreat to life or property,'' the requesting agency must first \nestablish that ``no service by a private operator was reasonably \navailable to meet the threat.'' Law officers, pledged to protect public \nsafety and fight crime, need the flexibility to determine the \nappropriate aircraft for any particular mission. They should not be \nrequired to offer private companies the right of first refusal on \nsensitive law enforcement missions. In\n\n[[Page S7605]]\n\nmany cases, it is simply not appropriate to have private companies \nperforming law enforcement or other governmental functions.\n  Under this bill, public agencies would be permitted to recover costs \nincurred by operating aircraft to assist other jurisdictions for the \npurpose of law enforcement, search and rescue, or imminent threat to \nlife, property or natural resources.\n  Mr. President, law enforcement organizations strongly support this \nbill. This legislation has the endorsement of the National Sheriff's \nAssociation, Airborne Law Enforcement Association, International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, Florida Sheriff's Association, and the \nCalifornia State Sheriff's Associations. From my home state in Florida, \nI have heard from Sheriff George E. Knupp, Jr. of Lake County. Sheriff \nKnupp stated, ``Current law restricts our ability to use this aircraft \nin the best possible manner and frankly, the law questions the \nauthority of a popularly elected official to exercise the duties and \nresponsibilities of the office.''\n  Our bipartisan proposed is simple, sound, and will serve the \ninterests of law enforcement officials across this country. I urge all \nmy colleagues to support the passage of this much needed legislation. \nFurther delay in this matter will only serve to cost the American \npeople unnecessary tax dollars and hamper the efforts of our law \nenforcement officials.\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, to introduce a \nbill that will assist our local law enforcement agencies to respond in \na timely fashion to life or death situations.\n  Sheriffs in my state and around this country have found that their \nhands are tied when it comes to sharing helicopters or other public \naircraft with neighboring jurisdictions. The Milwaukee County Sheriff's \nDepartment recently became the first sheriff's department in Wisconsin \nto acquire a helicopter. Neighboring counties would like to borrow that \nhelicopter and reimburse the Milwaukee County Sheriff for the cost of \ntheir use of that helicopter. The Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department \nis perfectly willing to share its helicopter but it can't easily do so. \nUnder current law, in order for the assisting agency to receive a cost \nreimbursement from the neighboring jurisdiction for use of a \nhelicopter, the neighboring sheriff must first exhaust the possibility \nthat a private commercial helicopter is available. Even when the \nneighboring sheriff is faced with a serious imminent threat to life or \nproperty, the law requires the neighboring sheriff to first determine \nwhether a privately operated helicopter is available. This law is \nabsurd and puts everyone's safety at risk.\n  Law enforcement agencies use helicopters for a variety of reasons--to \nchase a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime, in search and rescue \nmissions, to control crowds in public gatherings, to transport \nprisoners and to detect and eradicate marijuana. Saving lives and \nmaintaining law and order is delayed if we require sheriffs to \ndetermine first whether they can find a private helicopter. Public \nsafety is also jeopardized because private commercial pilots are likely \nnot trained law enforcement personnel with experience in sensitive and \nsometimes dangerous situations. But if we allow sheriffs to share their \naircraft with neighboring jurisdictions without first exhausting \nprivate avenues, law enforcement response is far more likely to be \nswift and sure.\n  This bill modifies the definition of ``public aircraft'' so that law \nenforcement agencies no longer need to make an attempt to find a \nprivate helicopter operator before using a neighboring jurisdiction's \nhelicopter.\n  Mr. President, we demand that law enforcement act quickly and \nprofessionally to life or death situations. But we're not giving them \nthe tools they need to do their job. We must do our part. I urge my \ncolleagues to join in this bipartisan effort to change the law and give \nthe sheriffs in Wisconsin and across this country the tools they need \nto keep our communities safe and secure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1286. A bill to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to \nlocal educational agencies to carry out school violence prevention and \nschool safety activities in secondary schools; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                         School Safety Fund Act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it has been two months since the tragic \nshooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. That incident heightened \nawareness around the country--and I saw it first hand when I traveled \nthroughout California--of the need to take steps to make our schools \nsafer.\n  It seems to me that being safe in school is a fundamental right. It \nought to be a top priority of every school district in America--and I \nknow that a lot of schools are committed to making improvements. But \nsome are having a hard time finding the money to do what needs to be \ndone. I believe it ought to be a top priority of the federal government \nto help localities do what they need to do to ensure the safety of our \nchildren when they are in school.\n  So, today, I am introducing, along with my colleague, Senator Durbin, \nthe School Safety Fund Act. This bill would allow the Attorney General \nto provide grants to school districts to undertake a variety of \nactivities to prevent school violence and to make our schools safer. \nThe key is we want local schools to make the decision about what they \nneed to do, but we want the federal government to provide some \nfinancial help.\n  Now, what are some of the things that schools want to--and should--\ndo?\n  Schools could establish hotlines and tiplines, so that students could \nanonymously report potentially dangerous situations. We could put more \ncommunity police officers in the public schools. Some schools need \nmetal detectors and other security equipment. I think almost all \nschools could use more counselors, psychologists, and school social \nworkers. Many teachers and administrators need training on the \nidentification of the early warning signs of troubled youth. And, many \nof our students need conflict resolution programs and mentoring.\n  The point is, each school needs to decide the extent of its problem \nand what the best solution will be in that community. We are not \ndictating here. We are saying that we want to--we need to--help our \nlocal schools.\n  Let me talk about how these grants will be funded, because I think it \nis an interesting approach. Rather than set up a specific authorization \nlevel--rather than pulling a number out of a hat and saying, this is \nthe need--my bill would give discretion to the Attorney General. The \nbill says that the Attorney General can make these grants out of the \nViolent Crime Reduction Trust Fund to meet the need that is out there.\n  For example, if there is a particular crisis in a particular \ncommunity, the Attorney General has the flexibility to make grants. She \ndoes not have to wait for Congress to act--or watch as Congress fails \nto act. If the problem improves, the Attorney General can spend less \nor, perhaps someday, no money at all for school safety. Again, the \nnumber of grants would be based on an assessment of the needs.\n  Finally, let me say a word about my cosponsor, Senator Durbin. I am \nvery pleased to have him join me in this effort because several weeks \nago, he fought this fight hard. He was a member of the conference \ncommittee on the supplemental appropriations bill, and he tried to get \nadditional emergency funding--and it was and still is, in many \nrespects, an emergency--for many of the activities we are talking about \nin this bill. Some on the other side of the aisle resisted his efforts, \nand eventually they voted him down. But, with his previous work on the \nsubject, I am so pleased that he has joined me on this bill.\n  Mr. President, it is now mid-June, and many schools are closed for \nthe summer or will close shortly. We must reject the notion that \nbecause our children are no longer in school, there is no longer a \nproblem. There is a problem, and unless we begin to find ways to solve \nit--and unless the federal government helps fund the solutions our \nlocal communities come up with--I fear that when the school house doors \nopen again in the Fall, the problem might again hit the front pages of \nthe newspapers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1286\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

RESOLUTION--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS THAT \n  A COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP SHOULD BE ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES \n POSTAL SERVICE HONORING THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WHO HAVE BEEN \n                        AWARDED THE PURPLE HEART\n\n  Mr. ROBB submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n                             S Con. Res. 42\n\n       Whereas Order of the Purple Heart for Military Merit, \n     commonly known as the Purple Heart, is the oldest military \n     decoration in the world in present use;\n       Whereas the Purple Heart is awarded in the name of the \n     President of the United States to members of the Armed Forces \n     who are wounded in conflict with an enemy force or while held \n     by an enemy force as a prisoner of war, and posthumously to \n     the next of kin of members of the Armed Forces who are killed \n     in conflict with an enemy force or who die of a wound \n     received in conflict with an enemy force;\n       Whereas the Purple Heart was established on August 7, 1782, \n     during the Revolutionary War, when General George Washington \n     issued an order establishing the Honorary Badge of \n     Distinction, otherwise known as the Badge of Military Merit \n     or the Decoration of the Purple Heart;\n       Whereas the award of the Purple Heart ceased with the end \n     of the War of the Revolution, but was revived out of respect \n     for the memory and military achievements of George Washington \n     in 1932, the year marking the 200th anniversary of his birth; \n     and\n       Whereas 1999 is the year marking the 200th anniversary of \n     the death of George Washington: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) a commemorative postage stamp should be issued by the \n     United States Postal Service honoring the members of the \n     Armed Forces who have been awarded the Purple Heart; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued in \n     1999, the year marking the 200th anniversary of the death of \n     George Washington.\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto submit a resolution honoring our veterans that have earned the \noldest military decoration in the world, the Purple Heart. This \nresolution expresses the Sense of the Congress that the U.S. Postal \nService should issue a postage stamp honoring Purple Heart recipients.\n  The Purple Heart was established by General George Washington in 1782 \nas a badge of distinction for ``meritorious action.'' After the \nRevolutionary War, however, the Purple Heart was not awarded again \nuntil it was revived in 1932, the year marking the 200th anniversary of \nWashington's birth.\n  Today, the Purple Heart is awarded to members of the U.S. armed \nforces who are wounded by an instrument of war in the hands of the \nenemy. Additionally, it is awarded posthumously to next of kin in the \nname of those who are killed in action or die of wounds received in \ncombat. This year, the 200th anniversary of George Washington's death, \nis a fitting time for the Postal Service to honor our Purple Heart \nrecipients with a commemorative postage stamp. They deserve no \nless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7607-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7607-S7610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                ASHCROFT (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 736\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \nKerrey, and Mr. Dodd) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nthem to the bill (S. 1233), making appropriations for Agriculture, \nRural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \nprograms for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 76, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7____.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress should enact legislation to correct the \n     distribution of the tax burden among the various classes of \n     persons using the Federal-aid highways, or otherwise deriving \n     benefits from such highways;\n       (2) the most recent highway cost allocation study by the \n     Department of Transportation found that owners of heavy \n     trucks significantly underpay Federal highway user fees \n     relative to the costs such vehicles impose on such highways, \n     while owners of lighter trucks and cars overpay such fees;\n       (3) pavement wear and tear is directly correlated with \n     axle-weight loads and distance traveled, and to the maximum \n     extent possible, Federal highway user fees should be \n     structured based on this fundamental fact of use and \n     resulting cost;\n       (4) the current Federal highway user fee structure is not \n     based on this fundamental fact of use and resulting cost; to \n     the contrary--\n       (A) the 12-percent excise tax applied to the sales of new \n     trucks has no significant relationship to pavement damage or \n     road use and does the poorest job of improving tax equity,\n       (B) the heavy vehicle use tax does not equitably apply to \n     heavy trucks (such tax is capped with respect to trucks \n     weighing over 75,000 pounds) and does not vary by annual \n     mileage, thus 2 heavy trucks traveling 10,000 miles and \n     100,000 miles, respectively, pay the same heavy vehicle use \n     tax, and\n       (C) diesel fuel taxes do a poor job recovering pavement \n     costs because such taxes only increase marginally with weight \n     increases while pavement damage increases exponentially with \n     weight, and increasing the rates for diesel fuel will not \n     resolve this fundamental flaw;\n       (5) truck taxes based on a combination of the weight of \n     vehicles and the distance such trucks travel provide greater \n     equity than a tax based on either of these 2 factors alone; \n     and\n       (6) the States generally have in place mechanisms for \n     verifying the registered weight of trucks and the miles such \n     trucks travel.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to replace the heavy vehicle use tax and all other \n     Federal highway user charges (except fuel taxes) with a \n     Federal weight-distance tax which is designed to yield at \n     least equal revenues for highway purposes and to provide \n     equity among highway users; and\n       (2) to provide that such a tax be administered in \n     cooperation with the States.\n\n     SEC. ____3.

TRANSPORTATION EQUITY FOR FERRY SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that\n       (1) The San Francisco Bay Area Regional Ferry Plan contains \n     two phases. The first phase of the Plan is devoted to the \n     existing ferry services operating on the Bay. The second \n     phase considers the feasibility of new origins and \n     destinations for passenger ferry services and institutional \n     arrangements to best operate the ferry services on the Bay.\n       (2) This study is a result of initiatives to improve ferry \n     service in the Bay Area and to develop better ways of \n     evaluating ferry proposals. These include Senate Bill 2169 \n     (Kopp, 1990), which suggests preparation of a Bay Area ferry \n     plan by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and \n     Proposition 116, a 1990 initiative which included $30,000,000 \n     in capital funding for ferry improvement projects, including \n     $10,000,000 dedicated for Vallejo service.\n       (3) Ferry transit has played a significant role in San \n     Francisco Bay for almost 150 years. Vessels which brought \n     people during gold rush days were utilized for San Francisco-\n     Sacramento and cross-bay service. Eclipsed by highway and \n     bridge construction during the 1930's, a faster generation of \n     ferries are once more becoming valuable cross-bay connectors \n     offering alternatives to congestion in some corridors, and as \n     emergency alternatives to these same highways and bridges.\n       (4) The summary of Phase 1 of the Plan includes (1) goals \n     and objectives for the region's ferry services, (2) \n     description of current ferry services, (3) an evaluation of \n     the existing ferry services, and (4) recommendations to \n     improve the existing ferry services. Funding has been secured \n     for many of the recommended improvements (e.g., vessel \n     purchases and terminal improvements), which will be \n     implemented over the next few years and are expected to \n     significantly increase ferry ridership in the Bay Area.\n       (5) The summary of Phase 2 of the Plan includes (1) a \n     detailed evaluation of and recommendations for potential new \n     ferry routes throughout the region, and (2) an evaluation of \n     and recommendations for institutional arrangements to best \n     operate ferry services. The evaluation of new routes analyzes \n     the expected performance and the implementation steps needed \n     for potential new services. An important factor for all Phase \n     2 services is that current services consume all existing \n     funding available.\n       (6) Any implementation of Phase 2 requires additional new \n     revenue sources.\n       (7) As regional and local agencies look to the future of \n     the San Francisco Bay Area, goals include transportation \n     mobility, transit coordination, clean air, fully accessible \n     transit, reduction in dependence on the automobile, emergency \n     preparedness transit alternatives, access to recreation and \n     tourism, energy-saving transportation, and environmentally \n     superior and cost-effective alternatives to new highway \n     construction. When applied to the appropriate corridors, \n     ferries can provide the means for achieving all of these \n     regional objectives.\n       (7) Experience in other metropolitan areas of North America \n     is indicating increasing utilization of ferries for commute \n     and non-commute travel, particularly in New York, Boston, \n     Vancouver, and Seattle. Goals and objectives vary, but \n     providing attractive alternatives to congested highways and \n     transit linkages are universal, as are goals to reduce the \n     use of automobiles in congested central cities.\n       (8) A set of goals and polices for Bay Area ferry service \n     are proposed based on the regional transportation and air \n     quality goals, and experience with ferry service in other \n     areas. In sum, the proposed goals are to enhance regional \n     mobility and support regional planning policies, create a \n     transit option that is an attractive alternative to the \n     automobile, offer a transit option that can be initiated in a \n     timely environmentally benign, and cost effective manner, \n     provide transit service that operates efficiently and reduces \n     the need for high cost alternative transportation \n     investments, provide ferry service that is reliable, safe, \n     and fully accessible and develop terminals that are \n     consistent with local and regional plans.\n       (9) The Plan has developed a comprehensive set of criteria \n     to evaluate the existing services and potential new ferry \n     services. It is important to have a set of evaluation \n     criteria in place for two purposes.\n       (10) First, criteria are essential for the evaluation of \n     competing proposals for ferry service, where operating and \n     capital funds are limited. Second, the criteria are important \n     for the evaluation of ferry service as a temporary or \n     permanent alternative to other transportation investments \n     such as building a new bridge, widening a freeway, or \n     building an alternative transit project.\n       (11) This list of criteria can also act as a checklist for \n     consideration when ferries are proposed as traffic mitigation \n     or emergency service providers.\n       (12) Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation \n     District's (GGBHTD) and Red & White both serve Sausalito, but \n     at different times of the day. Geographically, Sausalito is \n     ideally suited for the six mile commute to San Francisco. The \n     terminal facilities in Sausalito are spartan and not \n     accessible to persons with disabilities.\n       (13) Golden Gate's eleven mile Larkspur to San Francisco \n     route is the most integrated and efficient ferry system in \n     the Bay Area. Three large, medium speed ferries, operating \n     from well engineered terminal facilities, provide very \n     nearly a shuttle service from Marin County to San \n     Francisco. Of approximately 2,000 daily Marin County ferry \n     commuters, the Larkspur service carries 1,400 of them. The \n     two mile Larkspur Channel with its wake restriction is a \n     significant constraint to Larkspur service, and present PM \n     peak period traffic conditions preclude greater use of \n     autos for terminal access.\n       (14) Like Sausalito, Tiburon has ideal geographic \n     conditions, but rudimentary terminal facilities. Red & white \n     operates non-subsidized service between Tiburon and San \n     Francisco, providing commuter service to downtown San \n     Francisco via the Ferry Building (Pier 1/2) and non-commute \n     service to Fisherman's Wharf.\n       (15) Subsidized ferry service has been provided from \n     Oakland and Alameda to San Francisco since the 1989 Loma \n     Prieta earthquake. Seventy five percent of the riders are \n     commuters and most of these come from Alameda where the \n     facilities have just been substantially improved. The service \n     is currently provided by a leased vessel which is slow in \n     both loading and crossing. While commute times from Alameda \n     are competitive with auto, bus and BART, the Oakland service \n     is not.\n       (16) Red & White provides subsidized service to Vallejo in \n     the longest current Bay Area ferry route. The single commute \n     trips in the morning and afternoon are essentially full, \n     while the three non-commute round trips in between account \n     for nearly an equal number of passengers. As is the case in \n     Larkspur, a two mile wake restricted channel adds extra time \n     to the Vallejo commute. The current vessels make the trip in \n     about 70 minutes.\n       (17) The findings of the evaluation of the existing \n     services fall into three main categories: travel time of \n     ferry services is not competitive with the automobile, \n     frequency of ferry services are not adequate and ferry \n     terminal facilities do not offer basic amenities or adequate \n     accessibility.\n       (18) The current commute time between Sausalito and San \n     Francisco is 30 minutes, which is not competitive with the \n     automobile.\n       (19) The terminal facilities in Sausalito do not provide \n     adequate accessibility to persons with disabilities. The \n     terminal facilities do not meet published guidelines for \n     barrier free access in the areas of gangway slope, tactile \n     makings for the sight impaired, and protective railing on \n     floats.\n       (20) The current Larkspur to San Francisco service is well \n     conceived and provides excellent shoreside facilities. The \n     terminals, both in Larkspur and San Francisco, are well \n     designed for passenger flow, passenger safety, and passenger \n     comfort.\n       (21) The ferry commute time between Larkspur and San \n     Francisco is excessive (45 minutes), which is not competitive \n     with the automobile.\n       (22) The access into and out of the parking lot at the \n     Larkspur terminal is not adequate. On the return trips from \n     San Francisco it can take up to 15 minutes to get out of the \n     parking lot, which  significantly adds to overall travel \n     time.\n       (23) The Red & White ferry service to Tiburon is efficient \n     and could accommodate increased patronage.\n       (24) The terminal facilities in Tiburon do not provide \n     adequate accessibility to persons with disabilities or \n     covered passenger waiting areas.\n       (25) The total ridership on the Alameda/Oakland service has \n     been increasing. Approximately 70% of commute period \n     ridership is from Alameda.\n       (26) Alameda shows strong potential as a commute terminal.\n       (27) With a short channel speed restricted zone, auto \n     commute time is significantly longer than the current ferry \n     travel time of 20 minutes.\n       (28) The Oakland terminal has limited residential access to \n     the ferry terminal, which results in limited commute trips. \n     However, midday and weekend service from Oakland is and is \n     expected to continue to be productive.\n       (29) The current vessel on the Alameda/Oakland service is \n     not suitable, both by loading arrangement (accessibility) and \n     speed for commuter service from Alameda and Oakland.\n       (30) Given the traffic congestion on I-80, Vallejo is an \n     excellent candidate for high speed ferry service.\n       (31) The current service consists of one commute trip each \n     day, which does not provide adequate capacity or a real \n     commute option for commuters from Solano County.\n       (32) Ferry travel time between Vallejo and San Francisco is \n     approximately 65-70 minutes, which is marginally competitive \n     with the automobile.\n       (33) The Pier \\1/2\\ terminal facility in San Francisco is \n     served by the ferry services from Alameda, Oakland, Tiburon, \n     and Vallejo. The Pier \\1/2\\ terminal facility is deficient in \n     a number of areas, including:\n       (34) Ramps and floats are not adequately accessible to \n     persons with disabilities.\n       (35) There is not adequate sheltered passenger waiting \n     area.\n       (36) There is no area for convenient and easily accessible \n     connecting bus service, so that ferry passengers can easily \n     transfer to buses servicing Union Square, the Civic Center, \n     and the City's various institutions.\n       (37) The recommended ferry service improvement plan for the \n     existing services is based on: (1) a plan to resolve the \n     service deficiencies identified in the evaluation of the\n\n[[Page S7623]]\n\n     existing services, and (2) a service plan that supports \n     ridership projections.\n       (38) In order to carry out one of the major goals of the \n     Plan that the recommendations lead to the implementation of \n     improved services, the plan set out parameters in developing \n     the recommended service improvement plan.\n       (39) The major parameters/guidelines used in developing the \n     service improvement plan are as follows: a plan that could be \n     implemented, accounts for the current planning of the \n     individual operators, and can be financed (operating and \n     capital), maximizes ridership in relation to funding \n     investment, provides incremental approach to service \n     improvements, coordinate ferry services to extent possible \n     with other transit services.\n       (40) In general, the major service and capital improvement \n     recommendations in the plan include interlining some of the \n     existing services, so in a sense there are three routes \n     provided: a Larkspur-San Francisco-Sausalito route, an \n     Oakland-Alameda-San Francisco-Tiburon route and a Vallejo to \n     San Francisco route; purchasing five to six new high speed \n     catamarans; constructing terminal improvements at Pier \\1/2\\ \n     in San Francisco, and in Vallejo, Sausalito and Tiburon; and \n     improving the current feeder bus services to all of the ferry \n     terminals.\n       (41) The recommended service improvement plan for GGBHTD's \n     Larkspur and Sausalito services include purchasing two high \n     speed catamarans to operate on the Larkspur and Sausalito \n     services, operating a 68 weekday trip schedule (38 Larkspur-\n     San Francisco, 30 Sausalito San Francisco), compared to 46 at \n     present. Hourly midday service would encourage peak hour \n     patronage because of the additional flexibility. This service \n     plan would allow the district to operate 15 to 30 minute \n     headways between Larkspur and San Francisco during the a.m. \n     peak period as opposed to the 30 to 40 minute headways \n     currently being provided, reduce the travel time between \n     Larkspur and San Francisco from the current 45 to 50 minutes \n     down to 30 minutes, which is faster than the automobile \n     between the Larkspur area and San Francisco, allow the \n     District to provide a total of 45% more service in about the \n     same number of operating hours as currently being operated, \n     due to the faster vessels. Therefore, the total operating \n     cost for the increased service level is not that much more \n     than for the current operations, improve parking access to/\n     from the Larkspur ferry terminal (The City of Larkspur is \n     currently improving the access into/out of the terminal), and \n     improving terminal facilities in Sausalito.\n       (42) It is estimated that this service plan will generate \n     7,000 daily riders on the Sausalito and Larkspur services \n     compared to about 5,500 riders at present. Service would \n     begin upon the delivery of new, fast vessels and the 1994-95 \n     fiscal year would represent the first full year of operation.\n       (43) The recommended service improvement plan for the \n     Tiburon-Alameda-Oakland services includes the purchase of two \n     high speed catamarans to provide service on one continuous \n     route between Oakland-Alameda-San Francisco and Tiburon, \n     operating 64 weekday trips compared to 37 on the two routes \n     at present, including hourly service during the midday. This \n     service plan would use vessels more efficiently--one high \n     speed vessel will have difficulty maintaining hourly headways \n     between Oakland-Alameda-San Francisco.\n       (44) While one vessel would have slack time in operating \n     hourly headways between Tiburon and San Francisco, it will \n     provide more commute service between Alameda and San \n     Francisco, which has the most potential of the three \n     locations for ridership gains. The commute service level for \n     Oakland and Tiburon would remain about the same as it is now.\n       (45) Improvements to feeder bus services are proposed, \n     including both rerouted Alameda buses and better service to \n     the Tiburon terminal.\n       (46) It is estimated with this level of service that \n     ridership on these services would increase about from about \n     1,500 daily riders to over 2,600 daily riders. However, given \n     that Red & White Fleet operates un-subsidized service to \n     Tiburon, some type of coordination between those entities or \n     some type of different institutional arrangement would have \n     to be worked out before this service improvement could be \n     implemented. Given this, at this time, the Plan is \n     recommending that initially one high speed vessel be \n     purchased for the Alameda-Oakland-San Francisco service and \n     the Tiburon service remain unchanged.\n       (47) The recommended service improvement plan for the \n     Vallejo-San Francisco service includes purchase and operation \n     of two high speed vessels on a 28 day weekday trip schedule \n     in contrast with six trips at present, (this service plan \n     would reduce the one way travel time between Vallejo and San \n     Francisco to about 55 minutes, compared to about a 65 to 70 \n     minute travel time on that service now), provide three to \n     four a.m. commute trips (compared to the one a.m. commute \n     trip currently provided), construct an intermodal facility in \n     Vallejo, and improve local connecting bus services and \n     connecting bus services from locations throughout Solano \n     County.\n       (48) With this service level and anticipated growth in \n     Solano County, the Plan projects that ridership on the \n     Vallejo service would increase significantly--from about 800 \n     riders per day to about 2,500 riders per day. Expanded \n     service is expected to begin in 1994 and the 1994-95 fiscal \n     year would represent the first full year of operation.\n       (49) The recommended service improvement plan for the Pier \n     \\1/2\\ terminal facility are: provision of an adequate number \n     of ferry slips (these slips should accommodate the required \n     number of peak period vessels in an efficient and convenient \n     method), central control over the ferry docking facilities in \n     San Francisco by the Port Commission to ensure that any \n     potential provider of viable ferry service has access to a \n     convenient and coordinated facility, provision of barrier \n     free accessibility for disabled persons to all ferry docks, \n     provision of a convenient passenger environment sheltered \n     from poor weather and featuring comfortable waiting areas, \n     provision of convenient and easily accessible connecting bus \n     service.\n       (50) The plan looked at a number of different vessel types \n     to operate the recommended service levels. Including \n     conventional monohulls, catamarans, hydrofoils, hovercrafts \n     and surface effect ships.\n       (51) The vessel types were evaluated on a number of factors \n     including, capital and operating cost, speed, size of the \n     vessel, comfort, reliability, accessibility and ability to \n     be build in the U.S.\n       (52) Several vessels exist which meet the requirements \n     developed for the individual routes. At the time of bid, \n     other possibilities may exist, but in 1991 the supply of \n     adequate high speed, high capacity boats is limited.\n       (53) To operate the recommended service plan for the \n     Vallejo and Larkspur services, vessels capable of around 35 \n     knots (38 mph), are necessary to provide transit speeds that \n     are competitive with the automobile. The recommended vessels \n     for these services are either the 37 meter Westamarin \n     catamaran from Norway or the 35(S) meter Incat design from \n     Australia. Both vessels can be build in the U.S., although to \n     date neither has, are capable of appropriate commute speeds, \n     represent existing proven technology and are suitable for all \n     sea and climatic conditions. It is recommended that the \n     GGBHTD and City of Vallejo jointly procure vessels, which \n     result in ship-builder economies of scale and lower costs to \n     the public. The cost of each vessel is projected at $5-5.5 \n     million.\n       (54) At this time, it is recommended that initially one new \n     vessel be purchased for the Alameda/Oakland-San Francisco \n     service, pending resolution of institutional issues with the \n     Tiburon service and pending successful testing of Alameda \n     service. It it appears that this arrangement can be achieved, \n     it is recommended that a second vessel be procured to operate \n     the service. A 25-26 knot vessel is recommended for the \n     Alameda/Oakland service--at an estimated cost of $2.5-3 \n     million per vessel.\n       (55) The Plan recommends that the Alameda, Oakland, and \n     Vallejo ferry services continue to be operated by private \n     ferry operators under contract to public agencies. The public \n     agencies would purchase and own the recommended vessels and \n     contract out the operations of those vessels to a private \n     operator(s). It is believed that the free market provides a \n     powerful incentive to the private sector to make a profit and \n     that this motivation can be harnessed to increase overall \n     system productivity.\n       (56) The Plan evaluated 17 potential ferry routes \n     throughout the Bay Area. The routes that were evaluated were \n     determined by review of past and current ferry service \n     proposals and the routes evaluated as part of MTC's Bay \n     Crossing Study. Considerations were also given to the \n     potential to interline routes--either making multiple stops \n     or alternating service routes with a single vessel in order \n     to gain greater efficiency in the utilization of vessels and \n     crew. While commute routes are the primary focus for this \n     analysis, consideration has also been given to recreational \n     ferry services, facilitation of bicycle access, accommodation \n     of freight, and emergency preparedness capabilities of ferry \n     services. Each of the potential routes was evaluated on \n     number of criteria, including projected patronage levels, \n     financial performance (e.g. cost per passenger), \n     environmental impacts, and capital and operating costs and \n     requirements.\n       (57) A key factor regarding implementation of new services \n     is that operating and capital subsidy funds for \n     transportation projects are extremely limited. In general, \n     there are limited capital funds available for new projects; \n     however, existing operating funds are used to their maximum. \n     In fact, many transit operators in the region are reducing \n     their services due to the lack of operating \n     support. Therefore, a crucial component of implementing \n     any new ferry service is securing additional fund sources.\n       (58) The evaluation criteria were assessed individually and \n     as a whole for each route. For example, if a particular route \n     did not perform well on a certain criteria (e.g. no \n     facilities in Place), but performed well on all other \n     criteria, it could be given favorable consideration. At the \n     same time, there could be one criteria (e.g. major \n     environmental issues or other planned transit improvements in \n     the same corridor) that could over-ride other more favorable \n     factors and make the route not feasible. Based on this \n     analysis, the routes were grouped into the three categories, \n     as follows:\n       (59) Four routes are recommended for further consideration \n     in this Plan. Further study does not represent a \n     recommendation for implementation at this time, but \n     preparation of a more detailed consideration in the regional \n     plan to determine the feasibility of implementation. The four \n     routes are:\n\n[[Page S7624]]\n\n       --Port Sonoma/Marin--San Francisco\n       --Martinez--San Francisco\n       --Berkeley/Albany--San Francisco\n       --Alameda (Bay Farm Island)--San Francisco\n       (60) These routes are the best performing routes in terms \n     of patronage and financial performance. All of the routes are \n     projected to recover more than 50% of their costs from the \n     farebox and require subsidy levels that are consistent with \n     other transbay transit services in the region. Major adverse \n     environmental concerns (dredging, wake impact) are not \n     expected with these services.\n       (61) Port Sonoma-Marin-San Francisco: Of the routes \n     evaluated, this route is projected to have the highest \n     ridership (438 passengers for three A.M. peak departures) and \n     the best financial performance. Ferry travel time (one-way) \n     is projected at about 45 to 50 minutes, which is about 30 \n     minutes faster than driving between Novato and San Francisco \n     (single occupant auto). This service has been proposed by a \n     private organization as a mitigation to a development in the \n     Bel Marin Keys area. The developer has indicated that it will \n     at least partially fund the service. No dredging or major \n     wake impacts are expected due to this service.\n       (61) Martinez-San Francisco: Ridership projections for this \n     route are 250 peak passengers for one A.M. peak departure. \n     Ferry travel time (one-way) is projected to be about 55 \n     minutes, which is about 30 minutes faster than driving \n     between Martinez and San Francisco (single occupant auto). \n     The Martinez area does not have a high level of other transit \n     options to San Francisco. No dredging or major wake impacts \n     are expected due to this service.\n       (62) Berkeley/Albany-San Francisco: Morning peak patronage \n     is expected to exceed 270 passengers for three peak trips. \n     The Golden Gate Fields option at Gilman Street promises \n     stronger midday patronage and also serves portions of \n     Berkeley and Albany that are not well served by other \n     transbay transit. It is estimated that on race days total \n     daily ridership would be approximately 1,200 passengers per \n     day for this 20 minute crossing. There would be some dredging \n     needed at the Golden Gate Fields terminal location.\n       (63) Alameda (Bay Farm Island)-San Francisco: This service \n     was implemented in March, 1992. The proposed service has \n     docking facilities in-place in Alameda and in San Francisco. \n     A.M. peak ridership is expected to be 217 passengers for \n     three 23 minute trips; current ridership is about 75% of \n     projections. The route is currently supported by a private \n     development firm. No dredging or major wake impacts are \n     expected due to this service.\n       (64) The routes in this category do not perform as well as \n     the routes recommended for further evaluation. Given limited \n     operating resources, these routes are not recommended for \n     further evaluation at this time, but are worthy of future \n     consideration as circumstances change. These circumstances \n     include population increases near terminal facilities, delays \n     or elimination of other planned transportation improvements, \n     ability to provide lower cost ferry service, and new sources \n     of operating subsidies. The routes recommended in this \n     category are Richmond-San Francisco, San Leandro-San \n     Francisco, Rodeo-San Francisco.\n       (65) In general, these routes are projected to recover less \n     than 50% of their costs from the farebox and require subsidy \n     levels that are between $3.00 and $5.00 per passenger, which \n     is higher than existing transbay transit services in the \n     region.\n       (66) Richmond-San Francisco: Of the routes in this group \n     the Richmond service using the Point Richmond docking site \n     has the best overall performance. Projected ridership is \n     about 240 A.M. peak riders generating about a 41% farebox \n     recovery ratio; the subsidy per passenger is projected to be \n     $3.40 per passenger. The major limiting factors for a \n     Richmond service are that patronage is constrained because at \n     this time there is no midday travel generator and there are \n     good commute services between central Richmond and San \n     Francisco provided by AC Transit and BART. Bus services and \n     shared ride auto travel is expected to improve between \n     Richmond and San Francisco with the planned construction of \n     high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes on Interstate 80 between \n     Richmond and the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Also, during the \n     construction project period, a number of transit improvements \n     are planned for the I-80 corridor as mitigation measures. As \n     the I-80 improvement project begins and mitigation measures \n     are implemented and evaluated, it is recommended that the \n     City work with Caltrans to determine if there is the need and \n     available mitigation funding to consider ferry service from \n     Richmond as a mitigation project. The City of Richmond has \n     indicated that the commercial and industrial base in Richmond \n     is growing and further developments are expected. As \n     residential and commercial densities grow in the terminal \n     areas, ferry patronage would be expected to increase which \n     would enhance the feasibility of ferry service from Richmond. \n     MTC will be assisting the transit operators in the I-80 \n     corridor to develop a long range finance plan for transit \n     services in the corridor. It is recommended that the City of \n     Richmond participate in these planning efforts so that ferry \n     services between Richmond and San Francisco can be further \n     considered as a long-term transit project for the I-80 \n     corridor. Additionally, the East Bay Regional Park District \n     has expressed interest in examining alternate uses for the \n     Point Richmond docking facility (e.g. shared ferry \n     maintenance facility, etc.). It is recommended that the Park \n     District and City explore alternate uses of these facilities \n     in conjunction with the proposed Ferry Consortium.\n       (67) Rodeo-San Francisco: Projected ridership for service \n     between Rodeo and San Francisco is about 250 A.M. peak rider \n     for a one vessel service. Projected riders are fairly high \n     for this service because there are not good transit service \n     options to San Francisco from the Rodeo, Crockett, and \n     Pinole areas. The greatest limiting factor for a service \n     from Rodeo is the need to widen and dredge the marina, \n     build a dock, and provide parking, which is estimated to \n     cost about $4.0 million.\n       (68) San Leandro-San Francisco: Projected ridership for \n     service between San Leandro and San Francisco is about 200 \n     a.m. peak riders. The subsidy per passenger is projected to \n     be $4.77, which is significantly higher than other ferry \n     services. Ridership for a San Leandro service is constrained \n     because the major population centers in the area are east of \n     I-880 and are served by the BART system, while the area near \n     the marina is primarily industrial. Ferry service from San \n     Leandro would only be feasible if higher density residential \n     areas developed near the San Leandro marina.\n       (69) Based on the evaluation, the routes listed below are \n     not feasible for ferry services. Ridership levels are \n     projected to be low and for many of these areas there are \n     other existing or planned transit services serving the same \n     corridors. These routes are Benicia-San Francisco, Pittsburg-\n     San Francisco, Redwood City-San Franciso, South San \n     Francisco-San Francisco, Redwood City-San Leandro, Benicia-\n     Martinez, and South San Francisco-San Leandro.\n       (70) In each case, the potential ridership was projected to \n     be under 200 during the a.m. peak period, farebox recovery \n     ratios were projected to be less than 35%, and the subsidy \n     per passenger required to support the services is between \n     $6.00 and $12.00 per passenger, which is significantly higher \n     than current ferry services and other transbay transit \n     services.\n       (71) Based on the preliminary analysis of airport, \n     recreational and vehicle/freight ferry services, it appears \n     there could be potential for these types of services, but a \n     more thorough analysis of each type is needed. Therefore, it \n     is recommended that MTC, Caltrans, the proposed Ferry \n     Consortium and other interested parties should discuss and \n     examine the need and the method to further evaluate ferry \n     services related to ferry services feeding the San Francisco \n     and Oakland airports, recreational ferry services, and \n     vehicle, truck and freight movement ferry services.\n       (71) The Plan refined the patronage forecasting, service \n     planning, vessel and facility analysis, and financial \n     analysis for the four routes that were recommended for \n     further evaluation: Port Sonoma-Marin to San Francisco, \n     Martinez to San Francisco, Berkeley/Albany to San Francisco \n     and Alameda/Bay Farm Island to San Francisco.\n       (72) One of the routes, the Bay Farm Island to San \n     Francisco service, also known as the Harbor Bay Isle Ferry, \n     recently initiated operation. This is a privately funded \n     service intended to operate as a demonstration for at least \n     three years. At the end of this period this service should be \n     evaluated against the goals and objectives outlined in this \n     study.\n       (73) Of the potential ferry services analyzed, service from \n     Port Sonoma-Marin is found to be overall the most effective. \n     A high speed ferry service from Port Sonoma would \n     significantly reduce the travel time between the Port Sonoma/\n     Novato area and San Francisco.\n       (74) The financial performance of the Port Sonoma-Marin \n     service is also very good. The required subsidy per passenger \n     trip is estimated to be about $1.60 and the farebox recovery \n     ratio for the Port Sonoma ferry service is approximately 70%, \n     which are both significantly better than most transit \n     systems operating in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n       (75) The capital cost requirements for the service are \n     significantly greater than the other ferry service analyzed \n     in this report. The contributing factor is that this service \n     requires two high speed vessels to be successful. The capital \n     costs for the vessels and terminal improvements are projected \n     to be about $12.5 million, which is almost twice as much as \n     any of the other services.\n       (76) At present there is not a midday market for the \n     service. Lack of service during the midday could reduce \n     commute ridership.\n       (77) Ferry service from Martinez would be effective. One \n     way travel time between Martinez and San Francisco on the \n     ferry service (55-60 minutes) is estimated to be 35% faster \n     than by automobile (drive alone) and 29% faster than the \n     combination of BART express bus and BART rail service.\n       (78) A major concern regarding the Martinez service is that \n     the proposed level of service (one a.m. and one p.m. \n     departure) does not offer enough of an option for commuters \n     to sustain projected ridership for the long-term. The limited \n     peak period service limits total ridership levels.\n       (79) There is not a midday market for the service between \n     Martinez and San Francisco. Lack of service during the midday \n     could reduce commute ridership, since returning during the \n     midday is not an option for the commuter. To adequately use \n     the vessel for this service, midday uses for the vessel \n     should be explored.\n       (80) The Martinez service has the best financial \n     performance and the lowest amount\n\n[[Page S7625]]\n\n     of operating subsidy required of the services analyzed. The \n     required subsidy per passenger trip would be about $1.30 and \n     the estimated farebox recovery ratio for the Martinez ferry \n     service is approximately 75%.\n       (81) Although its travel time is comparable to BART service \n     and AC Transit express bus service between Berkeley/Albany \n     and San Francisco, this service may be slightly less \n     convenient because it does not offer as frequent service \n     during peak periods.\n       (82) The Berkeley/Albany service is the only one of the \n     services analyzed that offers a viable midday trip generator. \n     The service would provide direct Golden Gate Fields racetrack \n     access, which reduces traffic during the midday on I-80 and \n     maximizes the use of the vessel and should help support the \n     commute period riders by having the option of returning to \n     their point of origin during the midday.\n       (83) The financial performance of the Berkeley/Albany \n     service is not as good as the other new ferry services \n     analyzed. The required subsidy per passenger trip is \n     estimated to be about $2.70 and the farebox recovery ratio \n     for the Berkeley/Albany service is approximately 45%. The \n     Berkeley/Albany service also requires the most annual \n     operating subsidy of the services analyzed. It is estimated \n     that this service will require about $700,000 in annual \n     subsidy support.\n       (84) The Harbor Bay Isle service is currently averaging \n     about 310 total passengers per weekday day, which is about \n     100 daily riders less than anticipated by Harbor Bay Maritime \n     and about 70% of the ridership projections in this plan.\n       (85) The current service is significantly faster than other \n     modes of travel between Bay Farm Island and San Francisco. \n     Current one way travel time, including access time, on the \n     Harbor Bay service is approximately 30 minutes including \n     access time, which is about 20 minutes faster than by \n     automobile (drive alone) and about 14 minutes faster than AC \n     Transit express bus service. However, the ferry service is \n     more costly to the passenger than AC Transit's express bus \n     service.\n       (86) Based on projected ridership levels and the plan's \n     estimate of costs (excludes vessel lease costs), the required \n     subsidy per passenger is estimated to be about $2.15 per \n     passenger and the estimated farebox recovery ratio for the \n     service is approximately 62%.\n       (87) Overall, all of the potential new services (Port \n     Sonoma, Martinez and Berkeley/Albany) would represent a \n     beneficial enhancement to the matrix of transportation \n     options available in the Bay Area. While the new services \n     would not have a large impact on San Francisco bound commute \n     traffic, together with existing transit services they offer \n     another viable option to the private automobile. The Alameda \n     Bay FarmIsland/Harbor Bay service has expanded ridership \n     levels from the City of Alameda without significantly \n     diverting patronage from the pre-existing Alameda ferry \n     service. AR of the services would: (1) be faster than autos; \n     (2) provide new transit service without significant capital \n     investment compared to alternatives; (3) provide an emergency \n     preparedness option; and (4) take vehicles completely off of \n     the bridge/highway system. Also, a few of the routes include \n     opportunities for long-term private investment which is of \n     critical importance during this period of greatly constrained \n     public revenues. Private investment in ferries increases the \n     overall economic viability of the services.\n       (88) However, the implementation of any of the new services \n     relies on a number of outstanding factors. The most important \n     include determining a project sponsor(s) to pursue the \n     implementation of the services, and securing capital funds \n     and long-term operating support for the services.\n       (89) The first step for a new service is to determine what \n     entity or entities (local jurisdiction, private party, etc.) \n     will implement and operate the services. This plan analyses \n     the expected performance, the operating and capital needs, \n     and the remaining implementation steps for each of the \n     services. It will ultimately be up to the project sponsors to \n     use this analysis and their own information to determine if \n     the implementation of the ferry services are consistent with \n     their plans and within current resources. At present, there \n     are inadequate federal, state, and regional funds to support \n     the operations of the new services without adversely \n     affecting existing transit services.\n       (90) The report recommendations are presented as: (1) the \n     step(s) on the part of the project sponsors that need to take \n     place to begin implementation and/or continuation of the \n     services; and (2) policy direction and role for the \n     Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) in the review, \n     planning, and funding of new ferry services.\n       (91) The steps required for implementation of the potential \n     services address the critical issues that will need to be \n     resolved by the local jurisdictions/project sponsors for each \n     route to determine their ultimate ability to be implemented. \n     These issues include securing operating and capital funds \n     for the services, completing access improvements to the \n     terminals, finding sponsoring agencies to manage and \n     operate the services, and securing required governmental \n     approvals. Many of these issues hinge upon one another and \n     most will need to be fully satisfied prior to investments \n     in the services. It is recommended that MTC support and \n     public fund investments in any of these services be \n     contingent upon completion and/or substantial progress \n     being made on all of the outstanding implementation \n     issues. For example, it would not be prudent to invest \n     public funds into capital requirements (e.g. vessels \n     purchases) for any service until required governmental \n     approvals (e.g. BCDC, PUC, local jurisdiction approvals) \n     or adequate operating funds have been secured. The \n     implementation steps are outlined for each service below.\n       (92) Operating and Capital Financial Support. A commitment \n     on the part of the private sponsor is needed for the required \n     capital equipment and to support long term operations. The \n     proposed sponsor's interest (Venture Corporation) is \n     contingent upon approval of the Bel Marin Keys development. \n     Without approval and construction of that project, Venture \n     Corporation will not develop the system. If Venture \n     Corporation does not exceed with its current plans, another \n     public and/or private sponsor will be required to implement \n     the service. Such entity will need to secure funding and \n     obtain landing rights at Port Sonoma.\n       (93) Terminal Access: Access improvements are needed to the \n     terminal facility (traffic light at the intersection of the \n     marina access road and Highway 37) and additional traffic \n     impact analysis would be needed to fully determine the \n     traffic impacts on Lakeville Road and Highway 37 to determine \n     other needed roadway improvements. The sponsor will need to \n     discuss with GGBHTD re-routing and expanding its bus service \n     to the proposed ferry terminal.\n       (94) Project Sponsor: The sponsor should contract the \n     management of the service with the Golden Gate Bridge, \n     Highway and Transportation District.\n       (95) Governmental Approvals: Approvals must be secured from \n     Sonoma County, BCDC, and the Corps of Engineers for required \n     terminal construction or any other required shoreside \n     improvements.\n       (96) Operating and Capital Financial Support: A commitment \n     of funding is needed from local jurisdictions/transit \n     operation(s) for the required capital equipment (vessel and \n     terminal construction) and to support long-term service \n     operations.\n       (97) Terminal Access: Local jurisdictions and CCCTA will \n     need to work together for CCCTA to extend buses to provide \n     feeder bus service to the ferry terminal.\n       (98) Project Sponsor Project sponsor(s) will need to be \n     determined. Local jurisdictions will need to work with CCCTA \n     to sponsor the service.\n       (99) Governmental Approvals: Approvals are needed from BCDC \n     for required terminal construction, terminal parking use and \n     improvements and any other shoreside improvements. The East \n     Bay Regional Park District and City approvals are also \n     required.\n       (100) Project Sponsor: Project sponsor(s) will need to be \n     determined; it is recommended that AC Transit sponsor the \n     service.\n       (101) Operating and Capital Financial Support: A commitment \n     of funding is needed from local jurisdictions/transit \n     operator(s) for the required capital (vessel and terminal \n     construction), channel dredging costs, and to support long-\n     term operations. Given that the midday service would serve \n     patrons of Golden Gate Fields racetrack, local jurisdictions \n     should work with Golden Gate Fields.\n       (102) Terminal Access: Local jurisdictions will need to \n     work with AC Transit to reroute buses to provide feeder bus \n     service to the ferry terminal.\n       (103) Governmental Approvals: Approvals must be secured \n     from BCDC for required terminal construction, dredging or any \n     other shoreside improvements. Corps of Engineers approval \n     will be needed for dredging and the protective breakwater. \n     Because of the more complex facility approvals required in \n     addition to construction, implementation of this route would \n     take longer than others.\n       (104) The service has been implemented as a privately \n     operated and funded service and is expected to remain so for \n     at least three years. If Harbor Bay Maritime does not intend \n     to operate and fund the service beyond the current agreement, \n     a project sponsor(s) for the service will need to be \n     determined. It has been indicated that the City of Alameda \n     may consider taking over the operation and financing of the \n     service after Harbor Bay's commitment. If the City is going \n     to pursue the service, it is recommended that the first step \n     to determine the continuation of this service be that the \n     City of Alameda further evaluate the service based on its \n     performance as a privately operated service over the next two \n     years.\n       (105) Operating and Capital Financial Support: A commitment \n     of long-term operating funding will be needed if Harbor Bay \n     Maritime does not operate and fund the project beyond the \n     current agreement.\n       (106) Potential service sponsors/operators should be \n     required to participate in the proposed Ferry Consortium (see \n     Institutional Analysis), to increase the level of \n     coordination between services and identification of potential \n     benefits of joint activity.\n       (107) MTC should require the long-term operating support be \n     identified and secured for new services before any public \n     fund investments (federal, state and regional funds) are \n     granted for new services. It is recommended that existing \n     funding not be diverted from other projects.\n       (108) MTC should require that other approvals (BCDC, U.S. \n     Army Corp of Engineers, etc) and other identified service \n     requirements (e.g. terminal access improvements) are in place \n     prior to investments of public funds in the services.\n       (109) MTC should work with project sponsors/operators to \n     find additional fund sources that can be used for capital and \n     operating\n\n[[Page S7626]]\n\n     purposes. If new, stable operating fund sources are secured \n     for transit service, these new ferry services should be \n     considered for regional financing to add to the Bay Area \n     transportation network.\n       (110) MTC should require inter-operator coordination for \n     all new services, so that the potential ferry services \n     operate in conjunction with planned feeder transit service. \n     MTC could facilitate local jurisdictions and transit \n     operators to exploring varying institutional arrangements to \n     operate and manage the services.\n       (111) MTC should not be in a lead position on the \n     implementation of the proposed services, but it should \n     provide planning assistance and provide guidance on funding \n     issues, where needed. Planning assistance could include \n     further examination of ways vessels could be best utilized \n     for ferry services on the Bay, including sharing vessels \n     between services, interlining existing services with new \n     points of origin, finding midday markets/uses for vessels \n     used only during commute periods, and assessing the need for \n     `spare' vessels.\n       (112) MTC should require that project sponsors purchasing \n     new vessels consider the ability to interchange parts with \n     other vessels operating in the region and the coordination of \n     maintenance activities as part of their vessel bid and \n     specifications and vessel maintenance planning.\n       (113) MTC should work with regulatory agencies (BCDC, PUC \n     and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, PUC, U.S. Coast Guard) to \n     make governmental approval process understandable, \n     coordinated and as streamlined as possible.\n       (114) MTC, Caltrans, the proposed Ferry Consortium and \n     other interested parties should participate in examining the \n     need to further evaluate ferry services related to: (1) ferry \n     services feeding the San Francisco and Oakland airports \n     including serving the United Airlines maintenance/operational \n     facilities, (2) ferry services as they relate to emergency \n     preparedness, (3) recreational ferry services, and (4) \n     vehicle, truck and freight movement ferry services.\n       (115) There are a number of opportunities to improve the \n     planning and operation of ferry services on the Bay by \n     coordinating and/or consolidating ferry service operations. \n     Based on our review of the varying institutional \n     arrangements, a two pronged approach is recommended to \n     immediately improve the coordination, planning and operations \n     of ferry services on the Bay:\n       (116) First, existing and potential publicly operated or \n     funded ferry services should be institutionally merged with \n     existing transit operators/ districts, where feasible; and\n       (117) Second, a consortium or working group of public and \n     private ferry operators should be established. The consortium \n     would include public and private ferry operators, ports, \n     cities, connecting transit operators, and concerned citizens, \n     who would meet on a regular basis to discuss policy, planning \n     and operational objectives to advance and coordinate ferry \n     services on the Bay.\n       (118) The combination of these options would facilitate \n     bus/ferry coordination, faster and coordinate regional and \n     sub-regional policy and planning for ferry services, and \n     increase funding to the region and for ferry operations, and \n     could be implemented readily and immediately.\n       (119) Although not recommended at this time, the \n     possibility remains that some form of a regional ferry agency \n     may eventually be both warranted and readily feasible. As \n     described above, a regional ferry agency, either a JPA or \n     a legislated regional ferry district could provide many \n     operational improvements, such as coordinated maintenance \n     and marketing, ability to share vessels between services \n     to maximize labor efficiencies, and savings from \n     consolidated vessel and equipment purchases. Therefore, it \n     is further recommended that MTC in conjunction with the \n     ferry operators further examine the opportunities that may \n     exist with a regional ferry agency, especially as the \n     network of ferry services grow on the Bay.\n       (120) This arrangement includes incorporating the \n     operational and planning functions for the Bay's publicly \n     operated ferry services into the existing operations of \n     connecting bus services. This is already the situation for \n     GGBH and the City of Vallejo, which operate both the bus \n     systems and ferry services within their respective service \n     areas. For example, under this arrangement ferry services \n     from the East Bay would be operated by AC Transit, or BART; \n     services from Marin, Sonoma and San Francisco Counties would \n     be operated by GGBH or San Francisco Muni; and services \n     started from San Mateo County would be operated by SamTrans.\n       (121) This arrangement limits the number of transit \n     operators, thereby not duplicating transit planning and \n     operational activities: facilitates better bus/ferry schedule \n     and transfer connections; and allows ferry services to be \n     part of comprehensive transit planning activities.\n       (122) The Bay Ferry Consortium appears to be an immediately \n     feasible option for ferry services. This arrangement would \n     provide a forum for ferry operators to share information, be \n     involved jointly in activities, coordinate planning and form \n     regional objectives for ferry services. Initial consortium \n     membership should include public and private ferry operators \n     (GGBH, Red & White Fleet, Blue & Gold Fleet, the Cities of \n     Alameda, Vallejo, Oakland), MTC, BCDC, representatives of \n     intermodal transit agencies which would connect with the \n     ferries (MUNI, AC Transit, etc.), Caltrans, rider group \n     representatives, and others as determined by the membership. \n     The Consortium would be expected to meet as a committee of \n     the whole quarterly or on an as needed basis.\n       (123) The activities of the consortium would be the basis \n     for implementing the recommendations of the Regional Ferry \n     Plan and for continued regional ferry planning. However, the \n     major shortcoming of the consortium is that it does not have \n     policy authority over individual ferry operators; therefore, \n     the operators are not bound to follow the direction of the \n     consortium. To offset this, it is recommended that the \n     consortium be advisory to MTC on ferry issues.\n       (124) MTC already provides substantial operating and \n     capital funds for ferry services and is responsible for \n     certain coordination activities for transit systems in the \n     region. The consortium should explicitly acknowledge the role \n     of MTC as the lead agency in coordinating regional ferry \n     planning and in reconciling differences and coordinating the \n     activities of the individual ferry operators and other \n     transit operators. While the concept of a consortium would be \n     to establish mutually beneficial relationships between the \n     parties providing ferry services, it is recommended that MTC \n     make operator participation in the consortium a requirement \n     for the receipt of operating and capital funding. This would \n     give policy direction to and the ability to implement the \n     recommendations of the consortium.\n       (125) The Regional Ferry Plan contains two phases. The \n     first phase of the Plan is devoted to the existing ferry \n     services operating on the Bay. The second phase considers the \n     feasibility of new origin and destinations for passenger \n     ferry services and institutional arrangements to best operate \n     the ferry services on the Bay. Phase I of the Plan includes \n     (1) goals and objectives for the region's ferry services, (2) \n     description of current ferry services, (3) an evaluation of \n     the existing ferry services, and (4) recommendations to \n     improve the existing ferry services. Phase 2 of the Plan \n     includes (1) a detailed evaluation of and recommendations for \n     potential new ferry routes throughout the region, and (2) an \n     evaluation of and recommendations for institutional \n     arrangements to best operate ferry services.\n       (126) The City of Vallejo and the Metropolitan Transit \n     Commission, in response to legislative mandate, bond issue \n     direction, and local and regional transit plans, have jointly \n     undertaken this Regional Ferry Plan to analyze existing ferry \n     transit resources and to plan for new ferry services in San \n     Francisco Bay. The two specific mandates for the study are \n     Senate Bill 2169 (1990) and Proposition 116 from the June \n     1990 general election.\n       (127) The key legislation which shapes the San Francisco \n     Bay Ferry Study is California Senate Bill No. 2169. Filed in \n     response to the experience of the 1989 Loma Prieta \n     Earthquake, and increasing interest in ferry transit by a \n     variety of interests, including the Bay Area Water Transit \n     Task Force, it is intended to give transit planners an \n     evaluative tool in decision-making for ferry systems in the \n     future.\n       (128) Senate Bill 2169 (Kopp, 1990) authorizes the \n     Metropolitan Transportation Commission to develop and adopt a \n     long-range plan implementing high-speed water transit on the \n     bay. Its language indicates: ``The commission may develop and \n     adopt a long-range plan for implementing high-speed water \n     transit on San Francisco Bay, including, but not limited to, \n     all of the following:\n       ``a. Policies and procedures for allocating capital and \n     operating assistance from local, state, or federal funds.\n       ``b. Criteria and standards for evaluating and selecting \n     services to be funded with local, state, or federal funds, \n     based upon, but not limited to fare box revenue to operating \n     cost ratio, amount of subsidy per passenger and local \n     financial support, local support in providing ground access, \n     and impact on bridge traffic.''\n       (129) The California Clean Air and Transportation \n     Improvement Act of 1990 initiative measure, passed by the \n     voters in June 1990, while primarily oriented to investment \n     in rail improvements, contained an element for capital \n     improvements to ferry service. This included the following \n     sections:\n       ``99646. Ten million dollars ($10,000,000) shall be \n     allocated to the City of Vallejo for expenditures on water-\n     borne ferry vessels and terminal improvements.\n       ``99651. Twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) shall be \n     allocated to fund a program of competitive grants to local \n     agencies for the construction, improvement, acquisition, and \n     other capital expenditures associated with water-borne ferry \n     operations for the transportation of passengers or vehicles, \n     or both.''\n       (130) This study has been undertaken within the framework \n     of existing regional transit and environmental Policies with \n     the aim of establishing a short-term action plan for the \n     implementation of expanded ferry service in San Francisco Bay \n     and specifically for Vallejo. It builds on the 1985 High \n     Speed Water Transit Study for the San Francisco Bay Area \n     prepared by MTC.\n       (131) The recently completed San Francisco Bay Crossing \n     Study (mandated by Senate Concurrent Resolution 20) also \n     studied a ferry alternative including up to 17 terminals \n     served by a fleet of fast ferries as an option to additional \n     bridge or rail crossings of the Bay, but that study focused \n     on a more conceptual approach and longer time frame for \n     implementation than this current study which will evaluate \n     more specific options and develop more refined implementation \n     projects.\n\n[[Page S7627]]\n\n       (132) Today's visitor to the San Francisco Bay area is \n     never far away from the great recreational, scenic and \n     working resource which is the Bay. From every hill, bridge or \n     high-rise office building, the Bay is the focal point. Of the \n     San Francisco work force of 570,000, some 130,000 commute \n     into San Francisco each day for work over the Golden Gate and \n     Bay Bridges, or on BART. An additional 3,500 commute by water \n     over the Bay from Larkspur, Sausalita, Tiburon, Vallejo, \n     Alameda and Oakland.\n       (133) Water transportation was the earliest mode used to \n     cross San Francisco Bay. Rowboats, sailing craft and packets \n     provided the first connections. Steam ferries appeared in \n     1847. Steamships bringing Gold Rush adventurers, such as the \n     ``New World'', which arrived from New York in 1850, sailed in \n     from the East Coast, and became part of the San Francisco Bay \n     and river ferry system. ``New World'', used in Sacramento \n     service, was eventually sold to Oregon, but returned finally \n     to Vallejo, where she provided ferry service until she was \n     dismantled in 1879. These steamers provided the links that \n     connected the early mining and farming communities.\n       (134) Transbay ferry service began in 1850, with the \n     establishment of a route between San Francisco and the \n     Oakland Estuary, served by the ``Kangaroo''. In 1852, Oakland \n     granted what was to be the first Bay ferry franchise to a \n     ``reliable'' operator of a public ferry. Over the last \n     century and a half, up to thirty major cross-bay ferries \n     existed, serving 29 destinations. The great period of ferry \n     transit reached its peak in the 1930's when 60 million \n     persons crossed the bay annually, along with 6 million autos.\n       (135) The Ferry Building was the second busiest \n     transportation terminal in the world in the early 1930s. Each \n     day, some 250,000 persons travelled through the Ferry \n     Building to work or other destinations. Ferries made \n     approximately 170 landings a day at this time, and the Ferry \n     Building was served by trolley lines which left every 20 \n     seconds for city destinations. Ferries to Oakland could carry \n     4,000 persons, and were designed to incorporate restaurants, \n     shoe shine parlors, and luxury surroundings, including mohair \n     hangings, teak chairs, hammered copper lighting fixtures, \n     and leather chairs in the ladies lounges. The highly \n     efficient Key Route ferry/train transfer at the Oakland \n     Mole enabled 9,000 commuters to load and unload in less \n     than 20 minutes.\n       (136) As in most cities in the United States, the building \n     of bridges and tunnels and the expansion of the use of the \n     train and then the automobile led to the demise of ferry \n     routes. These same cities are now dealing with the result of \n     suburban development patterns--severe bridge, highway and \n     tunnel congestion, and, in some cases, the need to provide \n     alternate transportation routes during reconstruction of \n     these aging structures. In San Francisco, for example, the \n     Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, \n     which the state created in 1923 to construct the Golden Gate \n     Bridge, recognized 32 years after its completion that \n     increasing bridge congestion suggested a need for a wider \n     choice of modes. Studies in the early 1970s recommended \n     establishing an integrated system of buses, ferries, and \n     park-and-ride facilities in an attempt to delay the need for \n     a more costly second deck, tunnel, or additional bridge.\n       (137) After a series of vessel and terminal modifications, \n     Bridge District ferry service from Larkspur to San Francisco \n     now carries about 4,000 passengers a day, and continues to \n     grow. Buses meet the ferries on peak commuter runs, and serve \n     12 Marin County routes. District ferry service to Sausalito \n     carries some 1,700 passengers daily, both commuters and \n     tourists.\n       (138) East Bay ferry service to San Francisco ended in \n     1958. With the temporary resumption of Berkeley-San Francisco \n     ferry service during the 1979 BART Transbay Tube closure, \n     Harbor Bay Island demonstrations, and, more recently, service \n     to Vallejo, supplemental post earthquake service, and \n     continuing Alameda/Oakland service, East Bay water transit \n     access to San Francisco is gradually being restored.\n       (139) Throughout the world, more passengers are transported \n     by ferry each day than by air. In the United States, the two \n     largest ferry systems, Washington State (50,000 passengers \n     per day) and Staten Island (80,000 passengers per day) carry \n     the bulk of United States' ferry commuters, even though there \n     are over 275 separate ferry operations in the country. The \n     ``Wall Street Journal'' estimated in a recent article that \n     there were only 150,000 passengers travelling by ferry every \n     day in the entire United States, which is equivalent to a \n     day's ferry usage in the city of Lisbon, Portugal.\n       (140) Fast ferries (over 25 knots) have become key to \n     successful ferry operations in many countries since World War \n     II. Today, there are about 155 operators of fast ferries \n     worldwide. (83) Of these, six are located in the United \n     States. The three operators which provide commuter service \n     (Washington State, Red & White Fleet, TNT) all use Incat \n     catamarans. Because of US restrictions on foreign hulls, fast \n     ferries have, with few exceptions, not been available for \n     United States use. US manufacturers of fast vessels have \n     chosen to focus on military applications with four \n     exceptions: the Boeing Jet-foil (now only produced in Japan), \n     glass-hulled planing craft, a demonstration Air Ride surface-\n     effect vessel and the Incat catamaran of Australian design. \n     Several US shipyards have licenses to build Scandinavian \n     catamarans, British hovercraft and surface-effect vessels; \n     these have not yet been constructed. New SWATH (small water \n     area twin hull) craft in San Diego and Hawaii have generated \n     interest in the marine community.\n       (141) During the 60's and 1970's, there were two high-speed \n     ferry demonstrations on San Francisco Bay, utilizing a \n     hydrofoil and an amphibious hovercraft. A year-long \n     hovercraft demonstration served the Oakland and San Francisco \n     Airports, and, according to the Port of Oakland's Air Cushion \n     Vehicle Mass Transportation Demonstration Project Final \n     Report' (April 1967), was favorably received passengers. \n     According to the 1984 UMTA review `Existing and Former High \n     Speed Water-borne Transportation Operations in the United \n     States', the service, which was ``the first use of hovercraft \n     for a revenue service in the United States'' carried 12,510 \n     passengers during the year, with an overall load factor of \n     27.3 percent. Wind gusts, wave height, and vessel reliability \n     adversely affected the particular vessel used. Hydrofoil \n     service was demonstrated by the FMC Corporation in the early \n     1970s as a potential market opportunity.\n       (142) Additionally, a short-term demonstration with a \n     surface-effect craft was put into place by Harbor Bay \n     Maritime in 1985 from Bay Farm Island (Alameda) to San \n     Francisco. This rigid sidewall, air cushion Hover-marine \n     vessel was built in England, and required a Jones Act waiver \n     to operate between two points in the Bay. Like the \n     hovercraft, the speed of the service was attractive to \n     riders. However, ride comfort was not acceptable. Harbor Bay \n     Maritime intends to initiate regular ferry service during \n     1991 with a fast planing monohull to connect Bay Farm Island \n     with the San Francisco Ferry Building.\n       (143) San Francisco Bay today has a ferry fleet of \n     approximately twenty-five vessels, with a passenger capacity \n     of 10,500 persons. Speeds range from 25 knots provided by the \n     catamarans, to 12 knots, the speed of the harbor tour \n     vessels. Seven of these vessels provide commuter \n     transportation, and the remainder provide transportation to \n     recreational and tourist destinations, or are dedicated to \n     charter work. Each year, about two million commuter trips are \n     made on San Francisco Bay. There are about one million \n     tourist trips to Alacatraz, Angel Island (180,000 visitors a \n     year), Vallejo, Sausalito, Tiburon, Alameda and Oakland each \n     year. It is estimated that there are about two million harbor \n     tour and charter passengers as well.\n       (144) The Red & White Fleet has been the chief private \n     provider of commuter service, and operates both non-\n     subsidized routes to Sausalito and Tiburon, as well as \n     subsidized services to Vallejo and to Alameda and Oakland in \n     the East Bay. Red & White also runs ferries to Angel Island \n     State Park, tour service to Alcatraz under an agreement with \n     the National Park Service, and provides mid-day connections \n     to Vallejo.\n       (145) Other passenger vessel operators in San Francisco Bay \n     in 1991 include Blue and Gold, which carries 300,000 tour \n     visitors a year, and Hornblower Dining Yachts, which provides \n     dinner and charter cruises on San Francisco Bay. The Angel \n     Island Ferry provides a short connection between Tiburon and \n     the Island, and carries about half of the 180,000 visitors \n     each year. The California Parks Department has purchased a \n     new 48-passenger crew boat `Ayala' to serve park functions \n     between Tiburon and Angel Island. Finally, a small crew boat, \n     based in Vallejo, is used to transport refinery workers to \n     Pacific Refinery's terminal off Rodeo. Mare Island ferry \n     service carried Shipyard workers between Vallejo and the \n     Island until 1988.\n       (146) During the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake recovery \n     period, Caltrans, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, \n     the City of Vallejo, and other East Bay communities \n     participated in an extension of commuter ferry services. The \n     Golden Gate District also augmented service from Marin \n     County. From a normal situation, where 6,000 persons \n     travel by ferry each day, ferries met a demand of 20,000 \n     riders each day while the Bay Bridge was closed to \n     automobiles. Although ferry service expanded by more than \n     300% while the Bay Bridge was closed, commuter numbers \n     dropped shortly after the restoration of bridge service. \n     Realizing that an attractive, dependable, reliable, \n     stress-free transportation mode exists, public interest in \n     cross-bay ferries has grown since the earthquake.\n       (147) Along the waterfront in San Francisco, the Port of \n     San Francisco is exploring new maritime uses for its \n     property, and directing investment of earthquake emergency \n     monies (from the Federal Highway Administration and Caltrans) \n     into initial improvements of the ferry landing at Pier 1/2. \n     Oakland and Alameda are also using similar funds for terminal \n     improvements. Recent passage of Proposition 116 will make $30 \n     million available state-wide for investment in ferries and \n     related infrastructure, with $10 million targeted to the \n     Vallejo-San Francisco ferry link. Caltrans, under its Traffic \n     Mitigation Program for the reconstruction of the Cypress \n     Street freeway in Oakland, has designated monies for ferry \n     marketing and terminal improvements in Alameda and Oakland.\n       (148) Key legislators and individuals, agencies, such as \n     the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Caltrans, and the \n     Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District, and \n     key communities, such as Alameda, Oakland and Vallejo, have \n     moved the Bay Area towards restoration of a greater San \n     Francisco Bay ferry network. In addition, state legislative \n     interest in decreased\n\n[[Page S7628]]\n\n     traffic congestion, regional interest in transit service \n     coordination, and local efforts to promote waterfront \n     development also contributed to desire for an overall ferry \n     plan.\n       (149) The study team has conducted comprehensive \n     interviews, reviewed existing studies, policies, and \n     legislation from San Francisco Bay and appropriate sources \n     outside the Bay Area, and participated in public meetings in \n     order to build the background from which to view this \n     project. A review of ferry experiences--both historical and \n     current--has provided unique hands-on perspectives. Ferry \n     captains who deal each day with channel siltation and debris, \n     herring and other fishing activity, high speed ferry \n     technology in action, and the dilemmas of mixing commuter and \n     tourist traffic added valuable observations to the study. \n     Ferry operators, who continue to refine the day-to-day \n     management and operations issues, and ferry commuters, who \n     have made a definite transit mode choice, and who recognize \n     the benefits and shortcomings of existing services, offered \n     suggestions for future ferry service as well. Public agency \n     planners and decision-makers generously shared their own \n     transit and environmental plans, polices and objectives.\n       (150) A roster of those interviewed during the course of \n     the study is appended to this report. Additionally, a \n     bibliography is appended which lists historical volumes, as \n     well as ferry and transit studies from the Bay Area, and \n     others which seem appropriate from other cities and \n     countries. These reports and policies have been collected and \n     reviewed by the study team, and cited where appropriate. \n     Other ferry system goals and service standards, terminal and \n     vessel designs, lessons learned, and government policies can \n     be found among these reports. Bay Area ferry and transit \n     schedules have been collected and are incorporated into the \n     analyses. Federal transportation documents, ferry system \n     analyses and agency standards, and transportation texts have \n     also been reviewed for relevant criteria, and extensive \n     commuter surveys have been undertaken for the Phase I \n     analysis.\n       (151) This section includes goals and policies and \n     evaluation criteria for ferry services operating in the San \n     Francisco Bay Area. They have been created based on three \n     primary sources: transportation and related goals by Bay Area \n     regional agencies, counties and cities; goals and policies of \n     ferry operations elsewhere; and the views of key informants \n     expressed in interviews.\n       (152) A description of ferry operations elsewhere, and \n     associated goals, objectives, and policies is contained in \n     Appendix B. The lessons learned from these operations include \n     the fact that there is no single approach to initiating new \n     ferry service. Congestion relief and alternatives to new \n     bridge construction have been successfully implemented goals \n     for several services. Intermodal connections have also been \n     important components. Appropriate and reliable vessels, \n     attention to vessel access, and attention to environmental \n     constraints, particularly wake restraints, have been \n     important. Finally, in order to compete for scarce public \n     subsidy funds for transit service, it is important to develop \n     cost-effective and efficient operations.\n       (153) Summarizing the goals, ferries on San Francisco Bay \n     will be considered where they offer the potential to: improve \n     mobility; alleviate bridge and highway congestion; provide a \n     cost-effective, flexible, dependable, comfortable, attractive \n     and safe mode of transportation that helps the region to meet \n     air quality, energy consumption, and accessibility goals; and \n     enhance tourism, recreation and regional economic \n     development.\n       (154) Goal 1. Enhance regional mobility and support \n     regional planning policies.\n       Policy 1. Ferry services must enhance mobility in congested \n     corridors and help meet goals of Congestion Management Plans.\n       Policy 2. Ferry services should reduce the number of \n     vehicles entering San Francisco.\n       Policy 3. Ferry service projects must help achieve regional \n     air quality and environmental goals.\n       Policy 4. Ferries must provide a seamless network of \n     interconnecting regional services with other public transit \n     and para-transit programs.\n       Policy 5. A set of core ferry facilities and equipment \n     suitable for rapid expansion should be available if \n     alternative modes become inoperable as a result of natural or \n     man-made disasters.\n       Policy 6. Ferry service alternatives should be considered \n     for vehicles transporting hazardous materials or other \n     vehicles that reduce the efficiency of the regional highway \n     network.\n       Policy 7. Ferry services should support bikeway programs.\n       (155) Goal 2. Create a transit option that is an attractive \n     alternative to the automobile.\n       Policy 1. Ferry service must be competitive with the \n     automobile in travel time, cost, reliability and comfort.\n       Policy 2. Schedules, intermodal facilities, fare policy, \n     and marketing must be oriented to provide a single integrated \n     system.\n       Policy 3. A ferry system should provide an amenity and \n     comfort level that win attract commuters, off-peak and \n     weekend riders, and new riders unfamiliar with water \n     transportation.\n       Policy 4. Ferry services should increase public access to \n     recreational destinations.\n       Policy 5. Ferry and terminal concessions which enhance the \n     ferry experience should be provided.\n       (156) Goal 3. Offer a transit option that can be initiated \n     in a timely, environmentally benign, and cost effective \n     manner.\n       Policy 1. Ferry vessels to be acquired for the Bay Area \n     must be cost-effective and represent proven technology.\n       Policy 2. Public/private partnerships should be utilized, \n     maintaining the most cost-effective role for each sector.\n       Policy 3. Terminals must be functional, attractive and \n     cost-effective, while providing shelter, amenities, efficient \n     access and egress, and adequate intermodal connections.\n       Policy 4. Improvements should be developed incremental as \n     required to meet ridership.\n       Policy 5. Ferry service should be expanded within the \n     institutional framework of agencies that now exist.\n       Policy 6. The application/permit process for new ferry \n     services should be simplified and coordinated by a single \n     agency.\n       Policy 7. Ferry services must complement the navigational \n     waterways of the Bay, reflecting draft, wake, speed, and \n     harbor traffic constraints.\n       (157) Goal 4. Provide transit service that operates \n     efficiently and reduces the need for high cost alternative \n     transportation investments.\n       Policy 1. Ferry transit should be implemented to reduce or \n     delay the need for high capital cost highway and transit \n     projects where the projected fare box recovery ratio and \n     subsidy per passenger indicate fiscal benefits.\n       Policy 2. Vessels selected should be of appropriate size \n     and speed to meet the need, and of sufficient number to \n     provide the desired schedule frequency.\n       Policy 3. Competitive bidding should be used to procure and \n     operate boats efficiently.\n       Policy 4. Joint purchasing, service interlining, \n     recreational sub-lets, and joint use of spare equipment \n     should be utilized to reduce system cost.\n       Policy 5. Local financial and in-kind support should be \n     required for new and continuing ferry services.\n       (158) Goal 5. Provide ferry service that is reliable, safe, \n     and fully accessible.\n       Policy 1. Require vessels of proven reliability and \n     terminals compatible with the vessels.\n       Policy 2. Vessels must meet or exceed all Coast Guard \n     safety requirements.\n       Policy 3. All terminals and vessels should meet all state \n     and federal accessibility standards.\n       (159) Goal 6. Develop terminals that are consistent with \n     local and regional plan.\n       Policy 1. Terminals must meet the requirements of the BCDC \n     Plan, the Corps of Army Engineers permitting procedures, the \n     Bikeways Program, transit coordination objectives, and \n     accessibility standards.\n       Policy 2. Terminals must support local planning, economic \n     development, tourism, regional marketing, environmental and \n     design objectives.\n       Policy 3. Terminals should be developed as local (and \n     regional where appropriate) transit hubs.\n       (160) It is important to have a set of criteria in place \n     for two purposes. First, criteria are essential for the \n     evaluation of competing proposals for ferry service, where \n     operating and capital fund are limited. Second, the criteria \n     are important for the evaluation of ferry service as a \n     temporary or permanent alternative to other transportation \n     investments such as building a new bridge, widening a \n     freeway, or building an alternative transit project. This \n     list of criteria can also act as a checklist for \n     consideration when ferries are proposed as traffic mitigation \n     or emergency service providers. Criteria are categorized into \n     the following categories:\n       --Mobility/Performance\n       --Energy and Environment\n       --Socio-economic\n       --Financial\n       --Service\n       --Ease of Implementation\n       (b) of the funds appropriated under the heading ``Federal-\n     Aid Highways'', $5,000,000 shall be made available to carry \n     out section 1207(c)(1) of Public Law 105-178.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 950\n\n       Page 91, strike lines 10-12, and insert:\n       ``This Act may be cited as the `No TEA for Two Department \n     of Transportation and Related Appropriations Act, 2000' ''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 951\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3____.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Acid Deposition and Ozone \n     Control Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (A) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) reductions of atmospheric nitrogen oxide and sulfur \n     dioxide from utility plants, in addition to the reductions \n     required under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), \n     are needed to reduce acid deposition and its serious adverse \n     effects on public health, natural resources, building \n     structures, sensitive ecosystems, and visibility;\n       (2) nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide contribute to the \n     development of fine particulates, suspected of causing human \n     mortality and morbidity to a significant extent;\n       (3) regional nitrogen oxide reductions of 50 percent in the \n     Eastern United States, in addition to the reductions required \n     under the Clean Air Act, may be necessary to protect \n     sensitive watersheds from the effects of nitrogen deposition;\n       (4) without reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur \n     dioxide, the number of acidic lakes in the Adirondacks in the \n     State of New York is expected to increase by up to 40 percent \n     by 2040; and\n       (5) nitrogen oxide is highly mobile and can lead to ozone \n     formation hundreds of miles from the emitting source.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to recognize the current scientific understanding that \n     emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, and the acid \n     deposition resulting from emissions of nitrogen oxide and \n     sulfur dioxide, present a substantial human health and \n     environmental risk;\n       (2) to require reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur \n     dioxide emissions;\n       (3) to support the efforts of the Ozone Transport \n     Assessment Group to reduce ozone pollution;\n       (4) to reduce utility emissions of nitrogen oxide by 70 \n     percent from 1990 levels; and\n       (5) to reduce utility emissions of sulfur dioxide by 50 \n     percent after the implementation of phase II sulfur dioxide \n     requirements under section 405 of the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7651d).\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am deeply honored to rise today \nto recognize Douglas Scales, Floyd Eugene Collins, Jr., and Richard \nFloyd Burnham, Jr., three young men from my home town of Lithonia, \nGeorgia who fought in Vietnam, but tragically, did not come home. On \nJuly 5, 1999, the city of Lithonia will dedicate the Lithonia Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial to honor the sacrifices of these heroic young men. It \nis said, ``Poor is the nation which has no heroes. Poorer still is the \nnation which has them, but forgets,'' We will dedicate this memorial to \nremember, and to show our heart-felt appreciation to these young men \nfor fighting for our country, and to say thank you to their families \nfor their own sacrifices in the name of our freedom.\n  As I mentioned, this memorial will be dedicated on July 5, one day \nafter we will celebrate July 4, our Independence Day. On July 4, 1776, \nthe Continental Congress signed the Declaration of Independence in \nPhiladelphia. In that powerful and historic document, the thirteen \ncolonies declared themselves a self-governing body, and rightly stated \nthat King George VIII had ``plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, \nburnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.''\n  It strikes me that those words could have applied to many situations \nand many cruel and despotic rulers since 1776. I think of Hitler's \nGermany, I think of Vietnam, I think even of Bosnia and Kosovo. But \nbecause of the principals of our founding fathers and because of many \ngreat American presidents who have followed, the United States has been \nin a unique but sobering position to defend not only its own freedom, \nbut the very concept of freedom across the globe. That was the case in \n1967 when Specialist Collins was in Bien Hoe. That was the case in 1968 \nwhen Private First Class Scales was in Tay Ninh. That was the case in \n1968 when Specialist Burnham was in Quan Nam. It is still the case \ntoday.\n  Three Georgians signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776. On \nJuly 5, we will unveil and honor the names of three Georgians. Winston \nChurchill described his concept of duty in this way, ``What is the use \nof living if it be not to strive for noble causes and to make this \nmuddled world a better place for those who will have it after we are \ngone.'' Doug Scales, Floyd Eugene Collins, Jr. and Richard Floyd \nBurnham,\n\n[[Page S7649]]\n\nJr. strove for noble causes and made this world a better place for us. \nMy colleague and fellow Vietnam Veteran Senator John Kerrey described \nwhat he remembered most about his experience. ``The shared struggle to \ndo more than survive,'' he said. ``And most of all to bestow honor on \nour service and to our friends who were lost.'' In this small way, we \nin Lithonia hope to bestow honor on our friends, our brothers, our sons \nand husbands who were lost. Not, we say, in vain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7649-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO ORION COMPUTER SOURCING GROUP\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor the Orion Computer Sourcing Group for being named one of \nEntrepreneur Magazine's ``Hot 100'' fastest growing businesses in the \ncountry. Orion was the highest ranking of the three New Hampshire \nbusiness included on this prestigious list and one of only seven New \nEngland businesses recognized by the magazine.\n  This Portsmouth based company, which purchases excess computer \nhardware from manufacturers and sells it to clients like Hewlett-\nPackard, Compaq, and Packard Bell, is definitely on the move. Orion's \npresident, Grant Guilbeault, started the company in his basement in \nOctober of 1997 with just $30,000. It has grown to a work force of 14, \nand continues to expand as business increases. Orion has more than \ndoubled last year's revenue, and similar growth is expected for next \nyear.\n  Orion Computer Sourcing is not content with resting on its laurels. \nGrant Guilbeault and the entire Orion team have set their goals for the \nfuture and are currently in the process of making plans to grow the \ncompany into a $100-million dollar business in the next few years. If \ntheir efforts of the past 18 months are any indication, I have no doubt \nthey will reach their goals.\n  Part of Orion's tremendous success has been their ability to come \ntogether as a team and have a good time. One of the centerpieces of the \noffice is a pool table where all the employees can gather to enjoy \nthemselves, escape the pressures of building a business, and get to \nknow each other. It has obviously been a very successful formula for \neveryone at Orion.\n  Once again, I wish to congratulate the employees of Orion on their \nachievement. I am proud to serve you in the United States \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7649-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIREMENT OF SAM HARMAN\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a most \noutstanding and accomplished citizen of Georgia, Mr. Sam Harman, on the \neve of his retirement from the public schools system. As an educator \nfor 36 years, Sam Harman's work ethic, coupled with his goal of \nexcellence at each of his schools has earned him the sincere respect \nand admiration of his Dunwoody, Georgia community.\n  Mr. Harman began his career as a math, social studies and science \nteacher. Later, he coached football and driver's education. His first \nadministrative job was as principal of one of Georgia's largest middle \nschools, in Cobb County, Georgia. In 1987, he was named the principal \nof Vanderlyn Elementary in Dunwoody, Georgia, where he remains today.\n  Throughout his tenure at Vanderlyn, Mr. Harman has always put his \nduties to his school ahead of anything else to make this school an \nexample of excellence not only in the community, but in the public \nschool system at large. He arrives at school at 6 o'clock each morning \nand stays until 6 o'clock every night. He is a remarkable person with \nenergy to spare.\n  Sam Harman's dedication to education and his contributions to the \ncommunity are numerous. To really get an understanding of this \nwonderful man, you only have to look at his school's many \naccomplishments. Under his watch, Vanderlyn Elementary has expanded \nfrom 400 to more than 700 students. Scholastically, Vanderlyn ranks in \nthe top five schools in Georgia. National test scores for the past five \nyears show Vanderlyn students averaging above the 90th percentile in \nvirtually every academic subject. Teacher transfer rates are extremely \nlow while pupil and teacher attendance rates are among the highest in \nthe country. These statistics are the direct result of Sam Harman's \ncommitment to this school.\n  Mr. Harman takes a personal interest in every child in his school, \nand knows each by name. He visits each classroom daily, and supervises \nboth lunchroom and bus duty both to reduce the work of his teachers and \nto interact with the children. Strong pride exists at Vanderlyn because \nstudents, parents and staff know that Principal Harman cares about them \nas individuals.\n  While his compassion for others is unique, he is also a firm mediator \nand strict disciplinarian. Mr. Harman has a rule that students must \ncome to school to learn. Students are well aware that anyone who \nperforms differently will be dealt with swiftly and directly. Simply \nput, Mr. Harman will not allow any students to disrupt the learning \nprocess.\n  After eleven years at Vanderlyn and 36 years in education, Mr. Harman \nhas now decided to retire. Instead of rising at dawn to herd children, \nhe will be getting up to herd cattle on his farm, where he hopes to \nspend much more time.\n  Mr. President, I warmly request that you and my colleagues join me in \npaying tribute to a most outstanding man, Mr. Sam Harman of Atlanta, \nGA. We have been richly blessed to find such a caring and dedicated \nschool leader who has positively touched the lives of many. I thank \nhim, as well as his family, for allowing us to occupy so much of his \ntime for these past 36 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7649-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7649-S7650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP I. EARL\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nPhillip I. Earl, the Curator of History for the Nevada Historical \nSociety in Reno. Phillip Earl will be retiring from the Nevada \nHistorical Society on June 30, 1999 after 30 years of service to the \nState of Nevada.\n  Allow me to introduce Phillip Earl. He grew up in Boulder City, \nNevada and graduated from high school there in 1955. After high school, \nPhillip Earl started working in construction and later in 1957, he \njoined the U.S. Army and served in Europe until 1960.\n  After his service to his country, Phillip Earl began attending \nclasses at Nevada Southern university in Las Vegas. He transferred to \nReno for his senior year and graduated with a degree in history/\npolitical science and education. Phillip Earl was a graduate assistant \nfor two years following his graduation. During that time he taught \nschool in Reno and was married.\n  In 1973 Phillip Earl began his career at the Nevada Historical \nSociety. During his tenure, he has worked under six governors, two \nacting directors, and three directors. He has worked with four \nassistant directors. Phillip Earl has also worked with many photo \ncurators, accountants, registrars, and volunteers. Phillip Earl has \nsurvived them all. He has provided his expertise and passion for \nhistory with editors, copy writers, authors, curriculum specialists, \nteachers, exhibit designers and many others whose jobs reflect on \nhistory in one way or another.\n  He started at the Nevada Historical Society as a Museum Attendant and \nworked his way up to Curator of Exhibits and later Curator of History, \nhis present role at the Historical Society.\n  Phillip Earl has many achievements since serving as Curator of \nHistory. He is best known in Nevada for his popular history column, \n``This Was Nevada,'' which went out to some 26 newspapers around the \nstate. When the column's first edition came out in May of 1975, there \nwere six people on the column's staff. But the column eventually fell \ninto the very capable hands of Phillip Earl who became it's only \nauthor. In 1986, the Historical Society published the first volume of \narticles from the column and a second volume is under production and \nscheduled to be released this summer. This second volume of Phillip \nEarl's column will probably be a very popular item, because his column, \n``This Was Nevada'' retires with Phillip Earl later this month making \nhis retirement even more special for Nevada and the history he has been \nable to capture for over 20 years.\n  Phillip Earl also writes scholarly essays for the Nevada Historical \nSociety Quarterly and the Humboldt Historian, the journal of the North \nCentral Nevada Historical Society.\n  He has explored many historical topics in depth over his career. Some \nof these are the Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II, early \naviation,\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\nautomobiling, shortline railroads, outlaw and lawmen history, the movie \nindustry, race relations, boxing, ethnic history, women's history, the \nLincoln Highway, county seat fights, county boundary controversies, the \nGreat Spanish Flu Epidemic of 1918 to 1919, and even Searchlight, \nNevada. And there is much more, too numerous to list.\n  Phillip Earl's love for Nevada and the rich history that the State is \non display every week during the school year. Since 1976 Phillip Earl \nhas been teaching Nevada History at Truckee Meadows Community College \nin Reno. He helps bring Nevada's past to life for hundreds of college \nstudents who may never have had exposure to the Silver State's rich \nhistory before.\n  Capturing the history of the Great State of Nevada will always be the \nlegacy of Phillip I. Earl. He has preserved Nevada's history for all \nfuture generations to reflect upon, to learn from, and to enjoy. As one \nwho has a great deal of respect for Nevada's proud history, it is this \nSenator's privilege to pay tribute to Phillip I. Earl, a great \nhistorian, Nevadan, and American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7650-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF FRANK D. STELLA\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nspecial person who will be honored on June 28, Frank D. Stella.\n  A ballroom in Cobo Hall in my hometown of Detroit will be filled next \nMonday with people from all walks of life who have been touched by this \nremarkable man. In 1946, after serving in World War II, Frank Stella \nestablished The F.D. Stella Products Company, a food service and dining \nequipment design and distribution company, in Detroit. He built his \nbusiness into one of the most successful of its kind in Michigan, and \nthroughout the years he has used his success to give back to his \ncommunity. But he is also recognized across the country and worldwide \nas a leader in the Italian-American community.\n  I will not list all of the business, national, international, civic, \nfraternal, religious, veterans and social organizations that Frank \nStella belongs to--the list is so long, my colleagues might accuse me \nof trying to filibuster. But I would like to highlight a few of the \nhonors he has received because I believe that they illustrate just how \nmany lives he has touched. In Metro Detroit, Frank has been recognized \nfor his commitment to the community with many awards, including the \nSpecial Distinguished Humanitarian Award by the Arab and Chaldean \nCommunity Council, the Distinguished Service Award by Detroit Symphony \nOrchestra Hall, the State of Israel Bonds Award and the Summit Award by \nthe Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce. Frank's humanitarian works \nhave also received recognition outside Michigan. He has been invested \nas a Knight of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, \nreceived the Ellis Island Medal of Honor and was given Italy's highest \ndecoration by the President and Prime Minister of Italy in 1991.\n  Frank Stella is a man of countless talents and immeasurable \ndedication. But Frank has something else, too, something he uses \nperiodically to the benefit of the people of Metro Detroit, to wit, \nclout. While we all know people with clout, Frank's clout is unique. \nYes, he has known Presidents, from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton. He \nhas met the Pope and Mother Teresa. He counts among his friends famous \nentertainers like Sophia Loren, John Travolta and Tony Bennett. But \nFrank Stella may be the only individual in the United States who could \nconvince the ``Three Tenors,'' Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and \nJose Carreras to make their only U.S. concert appearance this year (and \none of only three worldwide) at Tiger Stadium in Detroit on July 17. \nThis concert will not only be the rarest of treats for Metro Detroit \nmusic lovers, but it will also raise a significant amount of money for \nthe Michigan Opera Theatre's $25 million capital campaign.\n  Mr. President, Frank Stella wears many hats, including those of a \nbusinessman, a humanitarian, a community leader and a father. But for \nthose in attendance at Cobo Hall next Monday night, the most important \nhat that Frank wears is that of friend. The invitation to the gala \nencourages people to ``Please be Frank with us.'' But, as everyone \nknows, there is only one Frank Stella. I know my colleagues will join \nme in congratulating Frank on his years of success in so many arenas, \nand in thanking him for the truly remarkable contributions he has made \nto our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7650-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TREATMENT OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN\n\n  On June 23, 1999, the Senate passed S.

Res. 39\n\n       Whereas 10 percent of the citizens of the Islamic Republic \n     of Iran are members of religious minority groups;\n       Whereas, according to the State Department and \n     internationally recognized human rights organizations, such \n     as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, religious \n     minorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran--including Sunni \n     Muslims, Baha'is, Christians, and Jews--have been the victims \n     of human rights violations solely because of their status as \n     religious minorities;\n       Whereas the 55th session of the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights passed Resolution 1999/13, which expresses \n     the concern of the international community over ``continued \n     discrimination against religious minorities'' in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran, and calls on that country to moderate its \n     policy on religious minorities until they are ``completely \n     emancipated'';\n       Whereas more than half the Jews in Iran have been forced to \n     flee that country since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 \n     because of religious persecution, and many of them now reside \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the Iranian Jewish community, with a 2,500-year \n     history and currently numbering some 30,000 people, is the \n     oldest Jewish community living in the Diaspora;\n       Whereas five Jews have been executed by the Iranian \n     government in the past five years without having been tried;\n       Whereas there has been a noticeable increase recently in \n     anti-Semitic propaganda in the government-controlled Iranian \n     press;\n       Whereas, on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover 1999, \n     thirteen or more Jews, including community and religious \n     leaders in the city of Shiraz, were arrested by the \n     authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran; and\n       Whereas, in keeping with its dismal record on providing \n     accused prisoners with due process and fair treatment, the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran failed to charge the detained Jews \n     with any specific crime or allow visitation by relatives of \n     the detained for more than two months: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the \n     United States should--\n       (1) continue to work through the United Nations to assure \n     that the Islamic Republic of Iran implements the \n     recommendations of resolution 1999/13;\n       (2) continue to condemn, in the strongest possible terms, \n     the recent arrest of members of Iran's Jewish minority and \n     urge their immediate release;\n       (3) urge all nations having relations with the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran to condemn the treatment of religious \n     minorities in Iran and call for the release of all prisoners \n     held on the basis of their religious beliefs; and\n       (4) maintain the current United States policy toward the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran unless and until that country \n     moderates its treatment of religious minorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7650-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7650-S7651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  On June 23, 1999, the Senate passed S.

A failure to \n     adequately discipline, and in some cases remove from the \n     Foreign Service, those career members who violate laws or \n     regulations would erode the qualities of excellence required \n     of United States Foreign Service members.\n       (5) Retention of members of the Foreign Service who do not \n     meet high standards of conduct would in the long term harm \n     important national interests of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 312.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Secure Embassy \n     Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On August 7, 1998, the United States embassies in \n     Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were \n     destroyed by simultaneously exploding bombs. The resulting \n     explosions killed 220 persons and injured more than 4,000 \n     others. Twelve Americans and 40 Kenyan and Tanzanian \n     employees of the United States Foreign Service were killed in \n     the attack.\n       (2) The United States personnel in both Dar es Salaam and \n     Nairobi showed leadership and personal courage in their \n     response to the attacks. Despite the havoc wreaked upon the \n     embassies, staff in both embassies provided rapid response in \n     locating and rescuing victims, providing emergency \n     assistance, and quickly restoring embassy operations during a \n     crisis.\n       (3) The bombs are believed to have been set by individuals \n     associated with Osama bin Laden, leader of a known \n     transnational terrorist organization. In February 1998, bin \n     Laden issued a directive to his followers that called for \n     attacks against United States interests anywhere in the \n     world.\n       (4) Following the bombings, additional threats have been \n     made against United States diplomatic facilities.\n       (5) Accountability Review Boards were convened following \n     the bombings, as required by Public Law 99-399, chaired by \n     Admiral William J. Crowe, United States Navy (Ret.) (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Crowe panels'').\n       (6) The conclusions of the Crowe panels were strikingly \n     similar to those stated by the Commission chaired by Admiral \n     Bobby Ray Inman, which issued an extensive embassy security \n     report more than 14 years ago.\n       (7) The Crowe panels issued a report setting out many \n     problems with security at United States diplomatic \n     facilities, in particular the following:\n       (A) The United States Government has devoted inadequate \n     resources to security against terrorist attacks.\n       (B) The United States Government places too low a priority \n     on security concerns.\n       (8) The result has been a failure to take adequate steps to \n     prevent tragedies such as the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.\n       (9) The Crowe panels found that there was an institutional \n     failure on the part of the Department of State to recognize \n     threats posed by transnational terrorism and vehicular bombs.\n       (10) Responsibility for ensuring adequate resources for \n     security programs is widely shared throughout the United \n     States Government, including Congress. Unless the \n     vulnerabilities identified by the Crowe panels are addressed \n     in a sustained and financially realistic manner, the lives \n     and safety of United States employees in diplomatic \n     facilities will continue to be at risk from further terrorist \n     attacks.\n       (11) Although service in the Foreign Service or other \n     United States Government positions abroad can never be \n     completely without risk, the United States Government must \n     take all reasonable steps to minimize security risks.\n\n     SEC. 403. UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC FACILITY DEFINED.\n\n       In this title, the terms ``United States diplomatic \n     facility'' and ``diplomatic facility'' mean any chancery, \n     consulate, or other office building used by a United States \n     diplomatic mission or consular post or by personnel of any \n     agency of the United States abroad, except that those terms \n     do not include any facility under the command of a United \n     States area military commander.\n\n     SEC. 404.

STANDARDS FOR VERIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     following terms when used in publications of the United \n     States Government, or in oral representations by officials of \n     the United States Government, should have the following \n     meanings:\n       (1) Effectively verifiable.--The term ``effectively \n     verifiable'' means that the requirements of subparagraphs (A) \n     and (B) are met, as follows:\n       (A) The Director of Central Intelligence has certified to \n     the President that the intelligence community has a high \n     degree of confidence, with respect to a particular treaty or \n     other agreement, in its ability to detect any militarily \n     significant violation of the treaty or other agreement in a \n     timely fashion, and to detect patterns of marginal violation \n     over time. In determining the intelligence community's \n     confidence, the Director should assume that all measures of \n     concealment could be employed and that standard practices \n     could be altered so as to impede monitoring.\n       (B) The Secretaries of State and Defense and the Chairman \n     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have certified to the President \n     that they have a high degree of confidence, with respect to a \n     particular treaty or other agreement, that the United States \n     will be able to reach a legal and technical determination \n     regarding any militarily significant violation of the treaty \n     or other agreement in a timely fashion, and to reach such a \n     determination regarding patterns of marginal violation, once \n     detected. In determining the level of confidence under this \n     subparagraph, the Secretaries of State and Defense and the \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff should assume that all \n     measures of concealment could be employed and that standard \n     practices could be altered so as to impede monitoring.\n       (2) Militarily significant violation.--The Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Defense, has sole responsibility for determining with \n     specificity, for purposes of any treaty or other \n     international agreement having implications for the national \n     security of the United States, what constitutes a militarily \n     significant violation. In making such a determination, the \n     Chairman should give great weight to his judgment that the \n     violation could pose a threat to the national security \n     interests of the United States.\n       (3) Timely fashion defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``timely fashion'' means in sufficient time for the United \n     States to take remedial action to safeguard the national \n     security.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 37(a) of the Arms \n     Control and Disarmament Act (22 U.S.C. 2577(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``adequately'';\n       (2) by redesignating subsections (b), (c), and (d) as \n     subsections (c), (d), and (e); and\n       (3) by inserting after subsection (a) the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(b) Assessments Upon Request.--Upon the request of the \n     chairman or ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate or the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives, in \n     case of an arms control, nonproliferation, or disarmament \n     proposal--\n       ``(1) under consideration for presentation to a foreign \n     country by the United States;\n       ``(2) presented to a foreign country by the United States; \n     or\n       ``(3) presented to the United States by a foreign country;\n\n     the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Committee \n     on the degree to which elements of the proposal are capable \n     of being verified.''.\n\n     SEC. 616. CONTRIBUTION TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF SEISMOLOGY.\n\n       The United States Government shall make available to the \n     public in real time, or as quickly as possible, all raw \n     seismological\n\n[[Page S7662]]\n\n     data provided to the United States Government by any \n     international organization that is directly responsible for \n     seismological monitoring.\n\n     SEC. 617. PROTECTION OF UNITED STATES COMPANIES.\n\n       The United States National Authority (as designated \n     pursuant to section 101 of the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     Implementation Act of 1998 (as contained in division I of \n     Public Law 105-277)) shall reimburse the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation for all costs incurred by the Bureau in \n     connection with implementation of section 303(b)(2)(A) of \n     that Act, except that such reimbursement may not exceed \n     $1,000,000 in any fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 618. PRESERVATION OF THE START TREATY VERIFICATION \n                   REGIME.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Paragraph 6 of Article XI of the START Treaty states \n     the following: ``Each Party shall have the right to conduct \n     reentry vehicle inspections of deployed ICBMs and SLBMs to \n     confirm that such ballistic missiles contain no more reentry \n     vehicles than the number of warheads attributed to them.''.\n       (2) Paragraph 1 of Section IX of the Inspections Protocol \n     to the START Treaty states that each Party ``shall have the \n     right to conduct a total of ten reentry vehicle inspections \n     each year''.\n       (3) Paragraph 4 of Section XVIII of the Inspections \n     Protocol to the START Treaty states that the Parties ``shall, \n     when possible, clarify ambiguities regarding factual \n     information contained in the inspection report'' that each \n     inspection team must provide at the end of an inspection, \n     pursuant to paragraph 1 of Section XVIII of that Protocol.\n       (4) Paragraph 12 of Annex 3 to the Inspections Protocol to \n     the START Treaty states that, once a missile has been \n     selected and prepared for reentry vehicle inspection, the \n     inspectors shall be given ``a clear, unobstructed view of the \n     front section [of the missile], to ascertain that the front \n     section contains no more reentry vehicles than the number of \n     warheads attributed to missiles of that type''.\n       (5) Paragraph 13 of Annex 3 to the Inspections Protocol to \n     the START Treaty states the following: ``If a member of the \n     in-country escort declares that an object contained in the \n     front section is not a reentry vehicle, the inspected Party \n     shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the inspectors that \n     this object is not a reentry vehicle.''.\n       (6) Section II of Annex 8 to the Inspections Protocol to \n     the START Treaty provides that radiation detection equipment \n     may be used during reentry vehicle inspections.\n       (7) Paragraph F.1 of Section VI of Annex 8 to the \n     Inspections Protocol to the START Treaty states the \n     following: ``Radiation detection equipment shall be used to \n     measure nuclear radiation levels in order to demonstrate that \n     objects declared to be non-nuclear are non-nuclear.''.\n       (8) While the use of radiation detection equipment may help \n     to determine whether an object that ``a member of the in-\n     country escort declares..is not a reentry vehicle'' is a \n     reentry vehicle with a nuclear warhead, it cannot help to \n     determine whether that object is a reentry vehicle with a \n     non-nuclear warhead.\n       (9) Article XV of the START Treaty provides for a Joint \n     Compliance and Inspection Commission that shall meet to \n     ``resolve questions relating to compliance with the \n     obligations assumed''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should assert and, to the maximum \n     extent possible, exercise the right for reentry vehicle \n     inspectors to obtain a clear, unobstructed view of the front \n     section of a deployed SS-18 ICBM selected for reentry vehicle \n     inspection pursuant to paragraph 6 of Article XI of the START \n     Treaty;\n       (2) the United States should assert and, to the maximum \n     extent possible, obtain Russian compliance with the \n     obligation of the host Party, pursuant to paragraph 13 of \n     Annex 3 to the Inspections Protocol to the START Treaty, to \n     demonstrate to the satisfaction of the inspectors that an \n     object which is declared not to be a reentry vehicle is not a \n     reentry vehicle;\n       (3) if a member of the in-country escort declares that an \n     object contained in the front section of a deployed SS-18 \n     ICBM selected for reentry vehicle inspection pursuant to \n     paragraph 6 of Article XI of the START Treaty is not a \n     reentry vehicle, but the inspected Party does not demonstrate \n     to the satisfaction of the inspectors that this object is not \n     a reentry vehicle, the United States inspection team should \n     record this fact in the official inspection report as an \n     ambiguity and the United States should raise this matter in \n     the Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission as a concern \n     relating to compliance of Russia with the obligations assumed \n     under the Treaty;\n       (4) the United States should not agree to any arrangement \n     whereby the use of radiation detection equipment in a reentry \n     vehicle inspection, or a combination of the use of such \n     equipment and Russian assurances regarding SS-18 ICBMs, would \n     suffice to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the inspectors \n     that an object which is declared not to be a reentry vehicle \n     is not a reentry vehicle; and\n       (5) the United States should not agree to any arrangement \n     whereby the use of technical equipment in a reentry vehicle \n     inspection would suffice to demonstrate to the satisfaction \n     of the inspectors that an object which is declared not to be \n     a reentry vehicle is not a reentry vehicle, unless the \n     Director of Central Intelligence, in consultation with the \n     Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, has determined \n     that such equipment can demonstrate to the satisfaction of \n     the inspectors that an object which is declared not to be a \n     reentry vehicle is not a reentry vehicle.\n       (c) START Treaty Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``START Treaty'' means the Treaty With the Union of Soviet \n     Socialist Republics on the Reduction and Limitation of \n     Strategic Offensive Arms, including all agreed statements, \n     annexes, protocols, and memoranda, signed at Moscow on July \n     31, 1991.\n\n  CHAPTER 2--LANDMINE POLICY, DEMINING ACTIVITIES, AND RELATED MATTERS\n\n     SEC. 621.

Citizens lack \n     both the freedom peacefully to express opposition to the \n     party-led political system and the right to change their \n     national leaders or form of government.''.\n       (B) ``The Government continued to commit widespread and \n     well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of \n     internationally accepted norms. These abuses stemmed from the \n     authorities' very limited tolerance of public dissent aimed \n     at the Government, fear of unrest, and the limited scope or \n     inadequate implementation of laws protecting basic \n     freedoms.''.\n       (C) ``Abuses included instances of extrajudicial killings, \n     torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, \n     arbitrary arrest and detention, lengthy incommunicado \n     detention, and denial of due process.''.\n       (D) ``Prison conditions at most facilities remained harsh. \n     . . . The Government infringed on citizens' privacy rights. \n     The Government continued restrictions on freedom of speech \n     and of the press, and tightened these toward the end of the \n     year. The Government severely restricted freedom of assembly, \n     and continued to restrict freedom of association, religion, \n     and movement.''.\n       (E) ``Discrimination against women, minorities, and the \n     disabled; violence against women, including coercive family \n     planning practices--which sometimes include forced abortion \n     and forced sterilization; prostitution, trafficking in women \n     and children, and the abuse of children all are problems.''.\n       (F) ``The Government continued to restrict tightly worker \n     rights, and forced labor remains a problem.''.\n       (G) ``Serious human rights abuses persisted in minority \n     areas, including Tibet and Xinjiang, where restrictions on \n     religion and other fundamental freedoms intensified.''.\n       (H) ``Unapproved religious groups, including Protestant and \n     Catholic groups, continued to experience varying degrees of \n     official interference and repression.''.\n       (I) ``Although the Government denies that it holds \n     political or religious prisoners, and argues that all those \n     in prison are legitimately serving sentences for crimes under \n     the law, an unknown number of persons, estimated at several \n     thousand, are detained in violation of international human \n     rights instruments for peacefully expressing their political, \n     religious, or social views.''.\n       (2) In addition to the State Department, credible press \n     reports and human rights organizations have documented an \n     intense crackdown on political activists by the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China, involving the harassment, \n     detainment, arrest, and imprisonment of dozens of activists.\n       (3) The People's Republic of China, as a member of the \n     United Nations, is expected to abide by the provisions of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n       (4) The People's Republic of China is a party to numerous \n     international human rights conventions, including the \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and is a signatory to the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the \n     Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.\n\n     SEC. 702.

CONGRESSIONAL POLICY REGARDING UNITED NATIONS \n                   GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION ES-10/6.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In an emergency special session the United Nations \n     General Assembly voted on February 9, 1999, to adopt \n     Resolution ES-10/6, entitled ``Illegal Israeli Actions in \n     Occupied East Jerusalem And The Rest Of The Occupied \n     Palestinian Territory'', to convene for the first time in 50 \n     years the parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention for the \n     Protection of Civilians in Time of War.\n       (2) That resolution unfairly places full blame for the \n     deterioration of the peace process in the Middle East on \n     Israel and dangerously politicizes the Geneva Convention, \n     which was established to address critical humanitarian \n     crises.\n       (3) The adoption of that resolution is intended to prejudge \n     direct negotiations in the peace process in the Middle East, \n     put additional and undue pressure on Israel to influence the \n     results of such negotiations, and single out Israel for \n     unprecedented enforcement proceedings which have never been \n     invoked, even against governments with records of massive \n     violations of the Geneva Convention.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--Congress--\n       (1) commends the Department of State for the vote of the \n     United States against United Nations General Assembly \n     Resolution ES-10/6, thereby affirming that the text of the \n     resolution politicizes the Fourth Geneva Convention, which is \n     primarily humanitarian in nature; and\n       (2) urges the Department of State to continue its efforts \n     against convening the conference specified in the resolution.\n\n     SEC. 724.

UNITED STATES POLICY WITH RESPECT TO NIGERIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A stable and democratic Nigeria is important to the \n     interests of the United States, the West African region, and \n     the international community.\n       (2) Millions of Nigerians participated in four rounds of \n     multiparty elections as part of a transition program that \n     will culminate in the inauguration of a civilian president, \n     members of the National Assembly, governors, and local \n     leaders on May 29, 1999. Although turnout in each of the four \n     rounds was lower than expected, a clear majority of Nigerians \n     demonstrated their support for a swift and orderly transition \n     to democratic civilian rule through participation in the \n     elections or through other means.\n       (3) Nevertheless, continued rule by successive military \n     regimes in Nigeria has harmed the lives of the people of \n     Nigeria, undermined confidence in the Nigerian economy, \n     damaged relations between Nigeria and the United States, and \n     threatened the political and economic stability of West \n     Africa.\n       (4) Although the current military regime, under the \n     leadership of General Abdusalami Abubakar, has made \n     significant progress in liberalizing the political \n     environment in Nigeria, including increased respect for \n     freedom of assembly, expression, and association, numerous \n     decrees are still in force that suspend the constitutional \n     protection of fundamental human rights, allow indefinite \n     detention without charge, and revoke the jurisdiction of \n     civilian courts over executive actions.\n       (5) Despite the optimism expressed by many observers about \n     the progress that has been made in Nigeria, the country's \n     recent history raises serious questions about the potential \n     success of the transition program. In particular, events in \n     the Niger Delta in early 1999 underscore the critical need \n     for ongoing monitoring of the situation and indicate that a \n     return by the Government of Nigeria to repressive methods \n     remains a possibility.\n       (b) Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that the \n     United States--\n       (1) supports a timely, effective, and sustainable \n     transition to democratic, civilian government in Nigeria; and\n       (2) encourages the incoming civilian government in Nigeria \n     to make the political, economic, and legal reforms necessary \n     to ensure the rule of law and respect for human rights in \n     Nigeria, including establishing effective democratic \n     institutions, integrating the military into democratic \n     society, and creating mechanisms for transparency and \n     accountability.\n\n     SEC. 727. PARTIAL LIQUIDATION OF BLOCKED LIBYAN ASSETS.\n\n       (a) Liquidation of Certain Blocked Libyan Assets.--The \n     President shall vest and liquidate so much of blocked Libyan \n     assets, ordered pursuant to Executive Order No. 12544 \n     (January 8, 1986), as is necessary to pay for the reasonable \n     costs of travel to and from The Hague, Netherlands, by \n     immediate family members of United States citizens who were \n     victims of the crash of Pan American flight 103 in 1988 and \n     wish to attend the trial of those individuals suspected of \n     terrorist acts causing the crash.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) Blocked libyan assets.--The term ``blocked Libyan \n     assets'' refers to property and interests of the Government \n     of Libya, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled\n\n[[Page S7666]]\n\n     entities and the Bank of Libya, blocked pursuant to Executive \n     Order No. 12544 (January 8, 1986).\n       (2) Immediate family members.--The term ``immediate family \n     member'' means parents, siblings, children, spouse, or a \n     person who stood in loco parentis or to whom he or she stood \n     in loco parentis, of a crash victim.\n\n     SEC. 728. SUPPORT FOR REFUGEES FROM RUSSIA WHO CHOOSE TO \n                   RESETTLE IN ISRAEL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Russian Jewish community is the third largest \n     Jewish community in the world.\n       (2) Anti-Semitic rhetoric from members of the Duma of the \n     Russian Federation has increased during the past year.\n       (3) The Duma failed to pass a resolution condemning the \n     anti-Semitic statements made by Russian lawmakers on March \n     19, 1999.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should support members of Russia's \n     Jewish community; and\n       (2) the United States should continue to provide assistance \n     to Russian Jewish refugees resettling in Israel.\n\n     SEC. 729. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING EXTRADITION OF LT. \n                   GENERAL IGOR GIORGADZE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On Tuesday, August 29, 1995, President Eduard \n     Shevardnadze of Georgia was the victim of an attempted \n     assassination plot as he was departing his offices in the \n     Georgian Parliament building to attend the signing ceremony \n     for a new Georgian constitution.\n       (2) Former Chief of the Georgian National Security Service, \n     Lt. General Igor Giorgadze, has been implicated in organizing \n     the August 29, 1995 car bomb attack on President \n     Shevardnadze, and allegedly fled from the Varziani air base, \n     one of Russia's four military bases in Georgia at that time, \n     and the same Russian base on which three Georgia aircraft SU \n     25's were sabotaged, preventing them from performing fighter \n     escort duty for President Shevardnadze's aircraft.\n       (3) Lt. General Igor Giorgadze has subsequently been seen \n     walking freely on the streets of Moscow as well as living and \n     utilizing facilities of the Government of Russia.\n       (4) Interpol is conducting a search for Lt. General Igor \n     Giorgadze for his role in the assassination attempt against \n     President Shevardnadze.\n       (5) In the aftermath of the attack on President \n     Shevardnadze, and regularly since that time, the Government \n     of Georgia has made repeated requests for the extradition of \n     Lt. General Igor Giorgadze to Tbilisi, Georgia.\n       (6) The Russian Interior Ministry has claimed that it is \n     unable to locate Giorgadze.\n       (7) The Georgian Security and Interior Ministries on \n     repeated occasions have provided to the Russian Interior \n     Ministry--\n       (A) the exact locations in Russia where Giorgadze could be \n     found, including the exact location in Moscow where \n     Giorgadze's family lived;\n       (B) the exact location where Giorgadze himself stayed \n     outside of Moscow in a dacha of the Russian Ministry of \n     Defense;\n       (C) people he associates with;\n       (D) apartments he visits; and\n       (E) the places, including restaurants, markets, and \n     companies, he frequents.\n       (8) Russian newspapers regularly carry interviews with \n     Giorgadze in which Giorgadze calls for a change in regime in \n     Tbilisi.\n       (9) Giorgadze is actively engaged in a propaganda campaign \n     against President Shevardnadze and the democratic forces in \n     Georgia, with the assistance of his father who is the \n     Communist Party chief in Georgia.\n       (10) Giorgadze continues to organize and plan attempts on \n     the life of President Shevardnadze.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President and other senior United States Government \n     officials should raise at each bilateral meeting between \n     officials of the United States Government and officials of \n     the Russian Federation the issue of the extradition of Lt. \n     General Igor Giorgadze to Georgia.\n\n     SEC. 730. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE USE OF CHILDREN AS \n                   SOLDIERS OR OTHER COMBATANTS IN FOREIGN ARMED \n                   FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are at least 300,000 children who are involved in \n     armed conflict in at least 25 countries around the world. \n     This is an escalating international humanitarian crisis which \n     must be addressed promptly.\n       (2) Children are uniquely vulnerable to military \n     recruitment because of their emotional and physical \n     immaturity, are easily manipulated, and can be drawn into \n     violence that they are too young to resist or understand.\n       (3) Children are most likely to become child soldiers if \n     they are orphans, refugees, poor, separated from their \n     families, displaced from their homes, living in a combat \n     zone, or have limited access to education.\n       (4) Child soldiers, besides being exposed to the normal \n     hazards of combat, are also afflicted with other injuries due \n     to their lives in the military. Young children may have \n     sexually related illnesses, suffer from malnutrition, have \n     deformed backs and shoulders which are the result of carrying \n     loads too heavy for them, as well as respiratory and skin \n     infections.\n       (5) One of the most egregious examples of the use of child \n     soldiers is the abduction thousands of children, some as \n     young as 8 years of age, by the Lord's Resistance Army (in \n     this section referred to as the ``LRA\") in northern Uganda.\n       (6) The Department of State's Country Reports on Human \n     Rights Practices For 1999 reports that in Uganda the LRA \n     abducted children ``to be guerillas and tortured them by \n     beating them, raping them, forcing them to march until \n     collapse, and denying them adequate food, water, or \n     shelter''.\n       (7) Children who manage to escape from LRA captivity have \n     little access to trauma care and rehabilitation programs, and \n     many find their families displaced, missing, dead, or fearful \n     of having their children return home.\n       (8) A large number of children have participated and been \n     killed in the armed conflict in Sri Lanka, and the use of \n     children as soldiers has led to a breakdown in law and order \n     in Sierra Leone.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--\n       (1) Condemnation.--Congress hereby joins the international \n     community in condemning the use of children as soldiers and \n     other combatants by governmental and non-governmental armed \n     forces.\n       (2) Further sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress \n     that the Secretary of State should--\n       (A) study the issue of the rehabilitation of former child \n     soldiers, the manner in which their suffering can be \n     alleviated, and the positive role that the United States can \n     play in such an effort; and\n       (B) submit a report to Congress on the issue of \n     rehabilitation of child soldiers and their families.\n\n     SEC. 731.

SELF-DETERMINATION IN EAST TIMOR\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) On May 5, 1999, the Governments of Indonesia and \n     Portugal signed an agreement that provides for an August 8, \n     1999 ballot organized by the United Nations on East Timor's \n     political status.\n       (2) On June 22, 1999, the ballot was rescheduled for August \n     21 or August 22 due to concerns that the conditions necessary \n     for a free and fair vote could not be established prior to \n     August 8.\n       (3) On January 27, 1999, President Habibie expressed a \n     willingness to consider independence for East Timor if a \n     majority of the East Timorese reject autonomy in the August \n     ballot.\n       (4) Under the May 5th agreement the Government of Indonesia \n     is responsible for ensuring that the August ballot is carried \n     out in a fair and peaceful way in an atmosphere free of \n     intimidation, violence or interference.\n       (5) The inclusion of anti-independence militia members in \n     Indonesian forces responsible for establishing security in \n     East Timor violates the May 5th agreement which states that \n     the absolute neutrality of the military and police is \n     essential for holding a free and fair ballot.\n       (6) The arming of anti-independence militias by members of \n     the Indonesian military\n\n[[Page S7667]]\n\n     for the purpose of sabotaging the August ballot has resulted \n     in hundreds of civilians killed, injured or disappeared in \n     separate attacks by these militias who continue to act \n     without restraint.\n       (7) The United Nations Secretary General has received \n     credible reports of political violence, including \n     intimidation and killings, by armed anti-independence \n     militias against unarmed pro-independence civilians.\n       (8) There have been killings of opponents of independence, \n     including civilians and militia members.\n       (9) The killings in East Timor should be fully investigated \n     and the individuals responsible brought to justice.\n       (10) Access to East Timor by international human rights \n     monitors and humanitarian organizations is limited, and \n     members of the press have been threatened.\n       (11) The presence of members of the United Nations \n     Assistance Mission in East Timor has already resulted in an \n     improved security environment in the East Timorese capital of \n     Dili.\n       (12) A robust international observer mission and police \n     force throughout East Timor is critical to creating a stable \n     and secure environment necessary for a free and fair ballot.\n       (13) The Administration should be commended for its support \n     for the United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor which \n     will provide monitoring and support for the ballot and \n     include international civilian police, military liaison \n     officers and election monitors.\n       (b) Policy.--(1) The President, Secretary of State, \n     Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (acting through the United States executive directors to \n     international financial institutions) should immediately \n     intensify their efforts to prevail upon the Indonesian \n     Government and military to--\n       (A) disarm and disband anti-independence militias;\n       (B) grant full access to East Timor by international human \n     rights monitors, humanitarian organizations, and the press;\n       (C) allow Timorese who have been living in exile to return \n     to East Timor to participate in the ballot.\n       (2) The President should submit a report to the Congress \n     not later than 21 days after passage of this Act, containing \n     a description of the Administration's efforts and his \n     assessment of steps taken by the Indonesian Government and \n     military to ensure a stable and secure environment in East \n     Timor, including those steps described in paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 734. PROHIBITION ON THE RETURN OF VETERANS MEMORIAL \n                   OBJECTS TO FOREIGN NATIONS WITHOUT SPECIFIC \n                   AUTHORIZATION IN LAW.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding section 2572 of title 10, \n     United States Code, or any other provision of law, the \n     President may not transfer a veterans memorial object to a \n     foreign country or entity controlled by a foreign government, \n     or otherwise transfer or convey such object to any person or \n     entity for purposes of the ultimate transfer or conveyance of \n     such object to a foreign country or entity controlled by a \n     foreign government, unless specifically authorized by law.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Entity controlled by a foreign government.--The term \n     ``entity controlled by a foreign government'' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 2536(c)(1) of title 10, United \n     States Code.\n       (2) Veterans memorial object.--The term ``veterans memorial \n     object'' means any object, including a physical structure or \n     portion thereof, that--\n       (A) is located at a cemetery of the National Cemetery \n     System, war memorial, or military installation in the United \n     States;\n       (B) is dedicated to, or otherwise memorializes, the death \n     in combat or combat-related duties of members of the United \n     States Armed Forces; and\n       (C) was brought to the United States from abroad as a \n     memorial of combat abroad.\n\n     SEC. 735.

EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE \n                   TREATMENT OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN THE \n                   ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN, AND PARTICULARLY THE \n                   RECENT ARRESTS OF MEMBERS OF THAT COUNTRY'S \n                   JEWISH COMMUNITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) ten percent of the citizens of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran are members of religious minority groups;\n       (2) according to the State Department and internationally \n     recognized human rights organizations, such as Human Rights \n     Watch and Amnesty International, religious minorities in the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran--including Sunni Muslims, Baha'is, \n     Christians, and Jews--have been the victims of human rights \n     violations solely because of their status as religious \n     minorities;\n       (3) the 55th session of the United Nations Commission on \n     Human Rights passed Resolution 1999/13, which expresses the \n     concern of the international community over ``continued \n     discrimination against religious minorities'' in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran, and calls on that country to moderate its \n     policy on religious minorities until they are ``completely \n     emancipated'';\n       (4) more than half the Jews in Iran have been forced to \n     flee that country since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 \n     because of religious persecution, and many of them now reside \n     in the United States;\n       (5) the Iranian Jewish community, with a 2,500-year history \n     and currently numbering some 30,000 people, is the oldest \n     Jewish community living in the Diaspora;\n       (6) five Jews have been executed by the Iranian government \n     in the past five years without having been tried;\n       (7) there has been a noticeable increase recently in anti-\n     Semitic propaganda in the government-controlled Iranian \n     press;\n       (8) on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover 1999, \n     thirteen or more Jews, including community and religious \n     leaders in the city of Shiraz, were arrested by the \n     authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran; and\n       (9) in keeping with its dismal record on providing accused \n     prisoners with due process and fair treatment, the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran failed to charge the detained Jews with any \n     specific crime or allow visitation by relatives of the \n     detained for more than two months.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the United States should--\n       (1) continue to work through the United Nations to assure \n     that the Islamic Republic of Iran implements the \n     recommendations of Resolution 1999/13;\n       (2) condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the recent \n     arrest of members of Iran's Jewish minority and urge their \n     immediate release;\n       (3) urge all nations having relations with the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran to condemn the treatment of religious \n     minorities in Iran and call for the release of all prisoners \n     held on the basis of their religious beliefs; and\n       (4) maintain the current United States policy toward the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran unless and until that country \n     moderates its treatment of religious minorities.\n\n     SEC. 737.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING CHILD LABOR.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The International Labor Organization (in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``ILO'') estimates that at \n     least 250,000,000 children under the age of 15 are working \n     around the world, many of them in dangerous jobs that prevent \n     them from pursuing an education and damage their physical and \n     moral well-being.\n       (2) Children are the most vulnerable element of society and \n     are often abused physically and mentally in the work place.\n       (3) Making children work endangers their education, health, \n     and normal development.\n       (4) UNICEF estimates that by the year 2000, over \n     1,000,000,000 adults will be unable to read or write on even \n     a basic level because they had to work as children and were \n     not educated.\n       (5) Nearly 41 percent of the children in Africa, 22 percent \n     in Asia, and 17 percent in Latin America go to work without \n     ever having seen the inside of a classroom.\n       (6) The President, in his State of the Union address, \n     called abusive child labor ``the most intolerable labor \n     practice of all,'' and called upon other countries to join in \n     the fight against abusive and exploitative child labor.\n       (7) The Department of Labor has conducted 5 detailed \n     studies that document the growing trend of child labor in the \n     global economy, including a study that shows children as \n     young as 4 are making assorted products that are traded in \n     the global marketplace.\n       (8) The prevalence of child labor in many developing \n     countries is rooted in widespread poverty that is \n     attributable to unemployment and underemployment among \n     adults, low living standards, and insufficient education and \n     training opportunities among adult workers and children.\n       (9) The ILO has unanimously reported a new Convention on \n     the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (10) The United States negotiators played a leading role in \n     the negotiations leading up to the successful conclusion of \n     the new ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (11) On September 23, 1993, the United States Senate \n     unanimously adopted a resolution stating its opposition to \n     the importation of products made by abusive and exploitative \n     child labor and the exploitation of children for commercial \n     gain.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) abusive and exploitative child labor should not be \n     tolerated anywhere it occurs;\n       (2) ILO member States should be commended for their efforts \n     in negotiating this historic convention;\n       (3) it should be the policy of the United States to \n     continue to work with all foreign nations and international \n     organizations to promote an end to abusive and exploitative \n     child labor; and\n       (4) the Senate looks forward to the prompt submission by \n     the President of the new ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of \n     Child Labor.\n\n     SEC. 740. REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON WORLDWIDE CIRCULATION OF \n                   SMALL ARMS AND LIGHT WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In numerous regional conflicts, the presence of vast \n     numbers of small arms and light weapons has prolonged and \n     exacerbated conflict and frustrated attempts by the \n     international community to secure lasting peace. The sheer \n     volume of available weaponry has been a major factor in the \n     devastation witnessed in recent conflicts in Angola, \n     Cambodia, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, \n     Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, among others, and has contributed \n     to the violence endemic to narcotrafficking in Colombia and \n     Mexico.\n       (2) Increased access by terrorists, guerrilla groups, \n     criminals, and others to small arms and light weapons poses a \n     real threat to United States participants in peacekeeping \n     operations and United States forces based overseas, as well \n     as to United States citizens traveling overseas.\n       (3) In accordance with the reorganization of the Department \n     of State made by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring \n     Act of 1998, effective March 28, 1999, all functions and \n     authorities of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency were \n     transferred to the Secretary of State. One of the stated \n     goals of that Act is to integrate the Arms Control\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\n     and Disarmament Agency into the Department of State ``to give \n     new emphasis to a broad range of efforts to curb \n     proliferation of dangerous weapons and delivery systems''.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     containing--\n       (1) an assessment of whether the export of small arms poses \n     any proliferation problems including--\n       (A) estimates of the numbers and sources of licit and \n     illicit small arms and light arms in circulation and their \n     origins;\n       (B) the challenges associated with monitoring small arms; \n     and\n       (C) the political, economic, and security dimensions of \n     this issue, and the threats posed, if any, by these weapons \n     to United States interests, including national security \n     interests;\n       (2) an assessment of whether the export of small arms of \n     the type sold commercially in the United States should be \n     considered a foreign policy or proliferation issue;\n       (3) a description of current Department of State activities \n     to monitor and, to the extent possible ensure adequate \n     control of, both the licit and illicit manufacture, transfer, \n     and proliferation of small arms and light weapons, including \n     efforts to survey and assess this matter with respect to \n     Africa and to survey and assess the scope and scale of the \n     issue, including stockpile security and destruction of excess \n     inventory, in NATO and Partnership for Peace countries;\n       (4) a description of the impact of the reorganization of \n     the Department of State made by the Foreign Affairs Reform \n     and Restructuring Act of 1998 on the transfer of functions \n     relating to monitoring, licensing, analysis, and policy on \n     small arms and light weapons, including--\n       (A) the integration of and the functions relating to small \n     arms and light weapons of the United States Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency with those of the Department of State;\n       (B) the functions of the Bureau of Arms Control, the Bureau \n     of Nonproliferation, the Bureau of Political-Military \n     Affairs, the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law \n     Enforcement, regional bureaus, and any other relevant bureau \n     or office of the Department of State, including the \n     allocation of personnel and funds, as they pertain to small \n     arms and light weapons;\n       (C) the functions of the regional bureaus of the Department \n     of State in providing information and policy coordination in \n     bilateral and multilateral settings on small arms and light \n     weapons;\n       (D) the functions of the Under Secretary of State for Arms \n     Control and International Security pertaining to small arms \n     and light weapons; and\n       (E) the functions of the scientific and policy advisory \n     board on arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament \n     pertaining to small arms and light weapons; and\n       (5) an assessment of whether foreign governments are \n     enforcing their own laws concerning small arms and light \n     weapons import and sale, including commitments under the \n     Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing \n     of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and \n     Other Related Materials or other relevant international \n     agreements.\n\n             Subtitle C--United States Entry-Exit Controls\n\n     SEC. 751.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to call my colleagues' \nattention to the current conflict between India and Pakistan over the \nline of control of Kashmir. I have a great deal of respect for the \nproblem of watching situations that are not only a long way away from \nus but are so remote that it is hard to get a camera crew there. I fear \nthat is what is going on. A lot of cameras and journalists are in \nKosovo watching the return of refugees and watching the United States \ntroops come back into that region, as well they should.\n  There is a real danger in not watching and paying attention to what \nis going on between India and Pakistan, and there is a danger that our \nlack of attention to this particular problem could produce a \nconfrontation that not only would be deadly but would draw in the rest \nof the world as well.\n  One of my principal concerns about the Kosovo operation, though I \nsupported the bombing and I am pleased it is over and pleased that we \nhave had some measure of success, was that it drew our attention away \nfrom non-NATO missions. The United States of America, unlike many of \nour NATO allies--indeed, unlike most of our NATO allies--has very \nimportant missions that we are performing throughout the world.\n  India and Pakistan is one of those missions. We were all surprised \nlast year--and nobody should be surprised this time around--after India \nand Pakistan detonated nuclear weapons--surprised our State Department, \nsurprised our CIA. We had a hearing trying to figure out why we were \nnot able to predict this, even though the Prime Minister who won the \nrace for the Parliament had, as part of his party platform, a promise \nto detonate and become a nuclear power. I do not think we should have \nbeen surprised. We were surprised.\n  We should not be surprised in this situation if this deteriorates \ninto an additional war. India and Pakistan have had not only three wars \nsince independence in the last 50 years, but there have been many \nserious and deadly skirmishes that have taken place over the line of \ncontrol in Kashmir.\n  This could not only deteriorate again, and there is a bloody battle \ngoing on as we speak, but in addition to that, unlike the United States \nand the Soviet Union that over the last 50 years developed protocols to \ndeal with nuclear weapons--and we have fairly substantial impressive \nmargins for error--there have been no such discussions between India \nand Pakistan. Both of them are nuclear powers. Both of them could \ndetonate nuclear weapons and use nuclear weapons in a confrontation of \nthis kind.\n  I have come before the Senate only to say to my colleagues I hope we \npay an increasing amount of attention to what is clearly an issue that \nis vital to the security of the United States of America. This is not \none where there is any doubt. It is a good example of the kind of non-\nNATO mission to which the United States of America, our diplomats, and \nour warfighters have to pay attention. This is a region of the world \nthat is extremely unstable at the minute, and that instability could \nproduce a confrontation with deadly consequences to us and deadly \nconsequences to our interests in the region as well.\n  Just because it does not appear on this evening's news or in the \nnewspapers, or it does not appear we are getting lengthy stories and \ncoverage of the problems going on between India and Pakistan in Kashmir \nright now, no one should be surprised if, through our own failure to \nintervene with both significant diplomacy and other efforts, this \nconfrontation gets larger and, as a consequence, we find ourselves \nsuffering an awful lot more than the suffering we are currently seeing \nin Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/24/senate-section/article/S7679-4", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 28, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
