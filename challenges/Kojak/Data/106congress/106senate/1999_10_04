Mr. President, those of us who are privileged to serve \nin the Senate are also privileged to become associated with a great \nmany people who also serve our Nation's Capitol and, in turn, better \nenable us to meet our responsibilities.\n  They also serve the true ``owners'' of this Capitol Building, the \nmany men, women, and children who visit this very historic place to see \nfirsthand ``their'' Capitol, their symbol of America, and the freedoms \nthat we all enjoy.\n  Despite the fact they do a good job, they are mostly unsung. I am \ntalking about the 1,600 employees of the Senate. If you count our fine \nU.S. Capitol Police force, that number goes over 2,000.\n  Today, I rise to pay tribute to one such employee, former Hill \nstaffer, James Thomas ``Tony'' Anderson, who passed away this past \nAugust.\n\n[[Page S11824]]\n\n  For the past 5 years, the Senate's appointment desk, just one floor \nfrom this Chamber, was where Tony always greeted people with a smile \nand made them feel very special. In this tribute to him, I also speak \nfor his coworkers and friends, Joy Ogdon, Christine Catucci, and Laura \nWilliams.\n  Mr. President, I first met Tony Anderson when I worked for Kansas \nSenator Frank Carlson and was a good friend with his mother, Margaret, \nwho was a long-time and valued member of the Carlson staff.\n  Like many of our dedicated employees, Mr. Anderson was never far from \nCapitol Hill. He was born in the old Providence Hospital at Third and E \nStreets N.E., and Tony got his training early and from some of the \nbest. While still in high school, and later in college, he worked in \nvarious capacities for many Senators; the list reads similar to a Who's \nWho of the Senate during those years. I am talking about Senator \nRussell Long, Senator Leverett Saltonstall, Senator John Kennedy, \nSenator George Murphy, and Senator Frank Carlson.\n  He graduated from Anacostia High School and later attended Federal \nCity College, Montgomery College, and later the University of the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  James Thomas Anderson was also Brother Bernard, junior Profess member \nof the Order of St. Francis, a Holy Order within the Episcopal Church, \nlocated at Little Portion Monastery in New York. His chosen service \nwithin the Order of St. Francis was commensurate with his strong \nsupport of human and animal rights. Upon his return from the monastery, \nhe worked for the Architect of the National Cathedral.\n  Mr. Anderson's life took a turn from Washington as a result of being \na waiter at the old Carroll Arms Hotel Restaurant, where his interest \nin wines led him to a successful career that took him to the vineyards \nof Italy, France, Germany, and Spain. With his knowledge of wine and \ncheeses, he helped to open the Capitol Hill Wine and Cheese Shop, one \nof the first business successes that led to the revitalization of \nCapitol Hill.\n  He later became the sommelier at the Watergate Terrace, the Four \nSeasons, Jean Louis at the Watergate, and then to the Hay Adams Hotel. \nMr. Anderson was instrumental in getting the Four Seasons' wine and \nbeverage program started.\n  Tony Anderson then returned to the Capitol, working in the Senate \nRestaurant and Banquet Department. He could tell many accounts of \nserving First Ladies, visiting dignitaries, and even a luncheon for the \nQueen of England. No one did it better or with more elegance and \npropriety than Tony.\n  Mr. Anderson left the Senate Restaurant, and for the past 5 years \nserved on the Senate Appointments Desk. In that capacity, he was a \nnatural. Tony Anderson was born in the city, grew up in the city. He \nloved the city and the Senate dearly. He truly enjoyed people, made \nthem feel welcome, and if they had a moment, he made their visit to our \nCapitol special with all of his stories and experiences.\n  I am not sure when he told me who he was. As I indicated, we were \nfriends when I worked for Senator Frank Carlson a long time ago. For me \nand for most who have worked here as pages, interns, employees, and \nstaffers--and, yes, also as Members of Congress--each experience, each \nperson and, yes, even the places, are like a special collage etched in \nyour memory.\n  I can't remember exactly when it was, but I know I was coming from \nthe Hart Building; I decided not to take the elevator to get to the \nfirst floor but to take the old stairs that I used when I was an intern \nfor Senator Frank Carlson; they lead to the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee room. Well, I turned right and was hurrying on my way, \nglancing at those ever-present appointment cards, when I heard Tony:\n\n       Hey, Pat, remember me? I'm Tony Anderson, Margaret \n     Anderson's son.\n\n  And there he was, with a bow tie and a smile, the same smile and \nalways pleasant demeanor that made him special to his family, \ncoworkers, and friends--not to mention everyone he ever served and \nhelped, from the Queen of England to John Q. Public, visitor to our \nNation's Capitol.\n  Mr. Anderson died at the age of 57. He is survived by his sister, \nKaren Anderson Cramer of Ocean Pines, MD. He was preceded in death by \nhis parents, James and Margaret Anderson, and Edward Brodniak, his life \npartner of 32 years.\n  Tony, thanks and godspeed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/04/senate-section/article/S11824-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

and\n       (C) creating a toll-free, private-sector operated, \n     telephone number, staffed by multilingual operators, to \n     provide assistance to international tourists coping with an \n     emergency;\n       (9) by establishing a satellite system of accounting for \n     travel and tourism, the Secretary of Commerce could provide \n     Congress and the President with objective, thorough data that \n     would help policymakers more accurately gauge the size and \n     scope of the domestic travel and tourism industry and its \n     significant impact on the health of the Nation's economy; and\n       (10) having established the United States National Tourism \n     Organization under the United States National Tourism \n     Organization Act of 1996 (22 U.S.C. 2141 et seq.) to increase \n     the United States share of the international tourism market \n     by developing a national travel and tourism strategy, \n     Congress should support a long-term marketing effort and \n     other important regulatory reform initiatives to promote \n     increased travel to the United States for the benefit of \n     every sector of the economy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to provide \n     international visitor initiatives and an international \n     marketing program to enable the United States travel and \n     tourism industry and every level of government to benefit \n     from a successful effort to make the United States the \n     premiere travel destination in the world.\n       (c) International Visitor Assistance Task Force.--\n       (1) Establishment.--Not later than 9 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall \n     establish an Intergovernmental Task Force for International \n     Visitor Assistance (hereafter in this subsection referred to \n     as the ``Task Force'').\n       (2) Duties.--The Task Force shall examine--\n       (A) signage at facilities in the United States, including \n     airports, seaports, land border crossings, highways, and bus, \n     train, and other public transit stations, and shall identify \n     existing inadequacies and suggest solutions for such \n     inadequacies, such as the adoption of uniform standards on \n     international signage for use throughout the United States in \n     order to facilitate international visitors' travel in the \n     United States;\n       (B) the availability of multilingual travel and tourism \n     information and means of disseminating, at no or minimal cost \n     to the Government, of such information; and\n       (C) facilitating the establishment of a toll-free, private-\n     sector operated, telephone number, staffed by multilingual \n     operators, to provide assistance to international tourists \n     coping with an emergency.\n       (3) Membership.--The Task Force shall be composed of the \n     following members:\n       (A) The Secretary of Commerce.\n       (B) The Secretary of State.\n       (C) The Secretary of Transportation.\n       (D) The Chair of the Board of Directors of the United \n     States National Tourism Organization.\n       (E) Such other representatives of other Federal agencies \n     and private-sector entities as may be determined to be \n     appropriate to the mission of the Task Force by the Chairman.\n       (4) Chairman.--The Secretary of Commerce shall be Chairman \n     of the Task Force.

The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate begins \nconsideration of a bill that will, if and when enacted, affect the \nconstituents of every single Member of this body. An efficient air \ntransportation system is critical not only to our commute home every \nweekend but, on a larger scale, to the functioning of a national and \nglobal economy.\n  The U.S. economy is becoming increasingly dependent upon a safe and \nefficient national air transportation system. Without a sound aviation \ninfrastructure, the enormous flow of goods and services across the \nnation and over the oceans would slow to a trickle. Unfortunately, the \nair traffic delays experienced this past summer seem to be the first \nsigns that the system is reaching its limits. It is vital, therefore, \nthat Congress acts now to keep this essential form of transportation on \na solid foundation.\n  S. 82, the Air Transportation Improvement Act, would reauthorize the \nprograms of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), including the \nAirport Improvement Program (AIP), which expired last Friday. The AIP \nprovides federal grants to support the capital needs of the nation's \ncommercial airports and general aviation facilities. S. 82 establishes \ncontract authority for the program. Without this authority in place, \nthe FAA cannot distribute airport grants, regardless of whether an AIP \nappropriation is in place. It is imperative that airports receive the \nsupport that they need to operate both safely and efficiently.\n  In addition to grants for airport development, S. 82 includes \nnumerous provisions designed to enhance aviation safety, to improve \ncompetition and service in the aviation industry, and to address the \nissue of commercial air tour flights over national parks.\n  On behalf of the aviation leadership of the Commerce Committee, I am \noffering an amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 82. This \nmanagers' amendment does not dramatically change the provisions of the \nbill as it was reported. Rather, it makes technical changes and \nincorporates aviation-related provisions requested by many of our \ncolleagues. The one notable difference between the bill as reported and \nas modified by the managers' amendment, is that the new version \nlengthens the term of the bill so that authorizations would be provided \nthrough fiscal year 2002.\n  At this point, let me take a moment to summarize some of the major \nprovisions of the substitute amendment:\n  Title I provides 3-year authorizations for the AIP, the Facilities \nand Equipment account (F), and the Operations account. [Unlike the \nreported\n\n[[Page S11843]]\n\nbill, S. 82 also includes an authorization for the FAA's Research, \nEngineering and Development (RE) account.]\n  Title II would amend various provisions of the Airport Improvement \nProgram. Although the current allocation formulas for AIP monies would \nremain essentially the same, there are a few differences. For example, \nthe set-aside for noise mitigation would increase from 31 percent to 35 \npercent. Another change would increase from $500,000 to $650,000 the \nminimum amount of entitlement funds that an eligible airport receives \neach year.\n  As recommended by the DOT Inspector General, airports would be \nrequired to use their entitlement funds for their highest priority \nprojects before using them on lower priority projects. Title II also \nincludes numerous technical amendments requested by the Administration.\n  Title II also establishes a five-year pilot program to allow more \nairports to have the benefit of air traffic control services. This \npilot program would be akin to the existing contract tower program. The \ndifference being that an airport would bear part of the costs of a \ncontract tower if it does not meet the benefit/cost ratio established \nfor the regular program.\n  Title III includes several technical and substantive amendments to \ncurrent aviation law. The key provisions would do the following:\n  Give the FAA the authority to establish consortia of government and \naviation industry representatives at individual airports to provide \nadvice on aviation security and safety.\n  Give the FAA broader authority to determine when a criminal history \nrecord check is warranted for persons performing security screening of \npassengers and cargo.\n  Reauthorize the ``War Risk'' aviation insurance program and implement \nan FAA suggestion to ensure timely payment of claims under the program.\n  Make it a crime for someone to pilot a commercial aircraft without a \nvalid certificate.\n  Title IV includes a wide variety of provisions, all of which are \nintended to improve aviation safety, security, or efficiency. Notable \nprovisions would do the following:\n  Require collision avoidance equipment to be installed on cargo \naircraft.\n  Require more aircraft to be equipped with emergency locator \ntransmitters.\n  Prohibit anyone convicted of a crime involving bogus aviation parts \nfrom working in the industry or obtaining a certificate from the FAA.\n  Give the FAA authority to impose fines on unruly passengers.\n  Require the DOT to step up its enforcement of laws and regulations \nrelated to the treatment of disabled passengers.\n  Require the FAA to accelerate its rulemaking on a program under which \nairlines and their crews share operational information. This new source \nof information may assist safety experts in identifying potential \nproblems before they cause accidents.\n  Require the FAA to develop a plan to implement the Wide Area \nAugmentation System (WAAS), which enables aircraft to use the Global \nPositioning System for navigation.\n  Require the DOT Inspector General to initiate an independent \nvalidation and assessment of the FAA's cost accounting system, which is \ncurrently under development.\n  Title V contains provisions intended to promote aviation competition \nand service. Key provisions include the following:\n  A five-year pilot program would be created to help small communities \nattract improved air service. It is designed to facilitate incentives \nand projects that will help communities improve their air access to \nbusiness markets, through public-private partnerships.\n  The bill as approved by the Commerce Committee also includes several \nprovisions dealing with slot controls for high-density airports and the \nperimeter rule at Reagan National Airport. Although the managers' \namendment does not alter those provisions as they came out of \ncommittee, we will soon offer an amendment to replace them with a \ncompromise redraft. That amendment has been crafted to accommodate the \nconcerns of several Senators.\n  One notable difference is, the number of slot exemptions at Reagan \nNational will be reduced from 48 to 24. Another change is that the high \ndensity rule will eventually cease to apply to all of the slot control \nairports, with the exception of Reagan National. Before the slot \ncontrols are eliminated, access to the airports will be broadened for \nregional jet air service to smaller communities and new infant \nairlines.\n  Title VI contains consensus legislation developed by Chairman McCain \nto regulate the overflight of national parks by air tour operators.\n  Title VII contains entirely technical amendments to address \nrecodification and other errors in title 49 of the United States Code.\n  Title VIII contains new provisions that transfer the aeronautic \ncharting activities of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric \nAdministration to the FAA.\n  The passage of this bill is crucial. We have a duty to the American \npeople to provide support to the national air transportation system. \nAir travel and the aviation-related industries are a fundamental part \nof our social and economic structure, and their response will continue \nto grow. The Congress may play only one part in the overall workings of \nthis system, but it is an essential part.\n  The Air Transportation Improvement Act gives an opportunity to renew \ncommitment to the future of this country. I strongly urge my colleagues \nto support S. 82.\n  Before we start the amendments and begin debate, I note with great \npleasure the presence of my friend and colleague, the Senator from West \nVirginia. Senator Rockefeller and I are often together on one cause or \nanother. The Senator is responsible for many of the good things that \nare included in this bill, which is the result of a true partnership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my distinguished colleague for those very \ngenerous comments. I feel no obligation to argue with him at this \npoint. He and I have been on the floor many times before, sometimes \nsuccessful, sometimes not. Today and tomorrow we hope to be more \nsuccessful. Always I rely on the intelligence and the articulation of \nthe good Senator from the State of Washington.\n  We are dealing with a new bill and a substitute for it which will \ncome up shortly. Ordinarily in these matters, one doesn't talk about \neither Senators or staff or anybody else until everything is over. \nHowever, I think it would actually set a good tone for this debate if I \nthanked a few of my colleagues upfront. One, it may put them in a \nbetter mood; two, it will discharge a duty which I believe I have.\n  I have been very frustrated by this whole process because it has \ntaken a long time and I don't like temporary extensions. We have had a \nhistory of short-term extensions. The FAA has suffered, the airports \nhave suffered, my State has suffered, the Senator's State has suffered, \na lot of it during the course of this past year.\n  My frustration spilled over as far as the junior Senator from West \nVirginia is concerned a few weeks ago when I came to the Senate floor \nand poured out my frustrations about the whole troubled state of our \nair traffic control system and the potential impact on our national \neconomy, as well as the impact on my State and a lot of other things \nwhich I characterize as being fairly scary in terms of delays and \ncongestion on what I consider to be an already enormously overburdened \nsystem. I am frightened about the prospects for the future. What we \nwill do today is by no means the end of what we must do in the future.\n  Today I am feeling very good. It is very good to be on the floor. We \nare on the floor for a reason. We are on the floor introducing the Air \nTransportation Improvement Act of 1999, which we all know and love as \nthe FAA and AIP reauthorization act.\n  The chairman of the Commerce Committee, John McCain, and the ranking \nmember, Fritz Hollings, have been working around the clock with Senator \nGorton and myself--the latter two being on the Aviation Subcommittee--\nto work out a number of long, lingering conflicts, some of which still \nlinger but most of which do not with respect to this bill.\n  The majority leader and the Democratic leader were both extremely \nhelpful and were very personally involved, showing their strong \ncommitment to\n\n[[Page S11844]]\n\naviation by finding time in a very busy fall schedule. I do not know \nhow long it will last, but a potential 2 days is generous, and I \nrespect and appreciate that.\n  A whole host of other Senators have constituents who care enormously \nabout this whole question from a variety of points of view--access to \nair service, lack of access to air service, noise, all kinds of other \nissues--and have been willing to roll up their sleeves and work very \nhard to find a compromise. I want to name some: Senator Schumer; the \nIowa Senators, Harkin and Grassley; Senator Wyden from Oregon; the \nVirginia Senators, both Robb and Warner; the Illinois Senators, both \nDurbin and Fitzgerald. Everyone has had to give a little, and it hasn't \nbeen easy. I hope everyone has also gotten a little, and, in some \ncases, some have gotten quite a lot.\n  First, I extend my thanks to my colleagues and to the leadership for \nputting the Senate in a situation for a fair debate. We have at least \ngone this far. There is a lot of work to do, but first things first. As \nwe begin Senate consideration of the FAA reauthorization bill, I am \noptimistic we can proceed in good order. I think we can do this in a \ncouple of days.\n  I tend to think at a fundamental level the cooperation and hard work \nI have seen reflects a deep and abiding sense of responsibility on the \npart of my colleagues, which they can hardly ignore in the first place, \nfor the continued safety and efficiency of our aviation system and the \ncondition of our air traffic control system which is unknown to most \nbut ought to be feared by all.\n  We have a number of issues to debate here, some of which, as I \nindicated, are still in controversy. The vast majority--and I think my \ncolleague will agree--have been fully worked out and have been agreed \nto on all sides. ``All sides'' become very important words. Not all, \nbut a majority.\n  Aviation, as my ranking chairman indicated, is a proven engine of \neconomic growth in this country. People don't think of it that way. \nSimilar to universities, sometimes people think of them in different \nways. It is an enormous economic engine. Each day, 2 million people \ntravel on U.S. commercial airlines and a quarter of million do the same \nthing on smaller, private planes that transport people for business. \nSometimes they do it simply for the sheer pleasure of flying.\n  Every day and night, U.S. airlines carry more than 10 million \npackages and overnight letters. Every day, more than 10 million \nAmericans go to work in aviation-related businesses. Ten million \nAmericans? Yes. That makes America among the largest manufacturing \nexporters of any enterprise. To the great credit of the aviation \nindustry and the Federal Aviation Administration, projected growth for \naviation is unparalleled. Within 10 years, U.S. airlines will be \ncarrying more than 1 billion passengers each year; that is up more than \n50 percent from the records that were carried last year. The number of \naircraft in the air, on the ground, moving about, will increase by 50 \npercent in the next decade. That can make you happy; that can also make \nyou nervous.\n  The regional fleet, which is something I care about enormously, \nbecause that is the connection in the whole hub and spoke system, a \nconnection which is very important, will grow by more than 40 percent. \nWorldwide, air cargo will more than triple. These are incredible \nfigures, projections of which the FAA and the industry can and should \nbe very proud.\n  Of course, there is a catch. We have to be able to handle this air \ntraffic, and we have to be able to handle it safely, in order to \nrealize this growth. By most accounts at the FAA and at airports across \nthe Nation, we are simply not ready to do this. In fact, we are having \ntrouble staying on top of the system. With every year and every month \nthat we allow ourselves to fall further behind in our modernization \neffort, there are times when one wonders will we ever catch up, will we \never understand what it means to put into place a full infrastructure \nfor an air traffic control system so we can take this doubling and \ntripling I have talked about before.\n  That is why, as Senator Gorton indicated, it is so critical we in \nCongress hold up our end of the bargain by making improvements where we \ncan and provide a system with some kind of predictability. The FAA \nreauthorization bill is all about starting to chart a course for \ngrowth, with a focus on increasing efficiency, improving customer \nservice, and facilitating competitive access, all the while staying \nfocused on strengthening our strong safety record.\n  This is a 4-year authorization bill. It will cost about $45 billion \nin total in aviation funding. That sounds like an enormous sum. It is, \nbut it is not. It is because it is. It isn't because it will not do the \njob, but it will help us. It will get us started on the right path.\n  Ours is an enormous and complex aviation system. People don't stop to \nthink about it. They take it for granted. They did not take it for \ngranted when there was enormous traffic congestion to get to the \nRedskin Stadium a couple of weeks ago, and they did take it for granted \nwhen there seemed to be none yesterday. I wasn't at either game so I \nhave no idea. But people tend to take for granted things which they use \nfrequently. That is not something we can afford to be doing in \nCongress.\n  For now, let me note this $45 billion authorization includes roughly \n$10 billion for airports under the Airport Improvement Program, $24 \nbillion for the FAA's nearly 50,000 employees and for air traffic \ncontrol operations, and $10 billion for air traffic equipment as part \nof the whole modernization effort.\n  Let me share some of the highlights of the bill and the agreed-upon \ncommittee substitute, which I believe Senator Gorton and I will want to \nintroduce momentarily. In terms of changes in aviation law and policy \nand innovative new programs, the package includes some of the \nfollowing: an important agreement worked out with the majority to \nauthorize an increase of $500 million for the FAA's Air Traffic Control \nModernization Program. We are grateful for every $50 million, $100 \nmillion, and $1 billion we can get our hands on.\n  Mr. President, $500 million is an increase; it is more than it was, \nand we are glad. There is an emphasis on improving air service to \nsomething we call small communities, which I imagine would be of \ninterest to the Presiding Officer. That increase will take various \nforms such as an increase in the minimum Airport Improvement Program \nentitlement from $500 million to $650 million annually, a new $80 \nmillion pilot project to assist small communities that are struggling \nto restore air service, and an immediate and, hopefully, lasting \npriority for new service opportunities at the four slot-controlled \nairports: O'Hare, LaGuardia, Kennedy, and Reagan National, and a ban on \nsmoking on all international flights to and from the United States. \nHere, actually, I give special thanks to the tireless efforts of \nSenator Durbin.\n\n  There is whistle-blower protection for airline and FAA employees so \nnone will fear losing their jobs for pointing out safety violations or \nconcerns that are pertinent. This is an item Senator Kerrey from \nNebraska has been preaching on for quite a while. There is a series of \nspecific safety improvements such as new runway incursion technologies \nand stronger enforcement of hazardous materials regulations, and a \nsignificant new agreement on noise and environmental issues arising \nfrom aircraft that fly over our National Parks. In one case, we have an \nairport in a National Park--only one, thank heavens. This reflects \nseveral years of very tough negotiations among Senator McCain, Senator \nBryan, and others.\n  In addition, through the amendment process, I know we will be \nconsidering, and hopefully taking action on, several other very \nimportant provisions. For example, Senator Gorton and I will offer a \npainstakingly negotiated agreement among all parties for an overhaul of \nthe slot rules at the four high-density airports: Reagan National, \nChicago O'Hare, New York Kennedy, and LaGuardia. Under this deal, the \nslot rules will be phased out over time--phased out over time--in New \nYork and Chicago. This was a rather bold idea at the time, put forward, \nactually, by the Secretary of Transportation last spring. Most \nimportant, from my perspective, these changes offer us an opportunity \nto increase access to these key airports. Once again, I am thinking of \nthe constituents of the State of\n\n[[Page S11845]]\n\nthe Presiding Officer, and that is the name of the game: Can you get \ninto some of these larger airports? This will give an extra boost of \nservice to small communities and to new entrant airlines.\n  Several of us, further, will join together to offer an amendment to \nprotect airline passenger rights--Senator Gorton and I and others will \ndo that--to hold the airlines' feet to the fire on their promise to \nimprove customer service and to reduce customer complaints. This last \nsummer, I thought, was almost historic, not that it seemed to have \nenormous effect but it was a historic example of what happens when you \nget gridlock in the air. People were held up. It was all during the \nsummer travel months. That period of time is going to keep growing as \nthe congestion grows greater and greater.\n  Another amendment Senator Gorton and I will offer will propose \nincremental FAA management reform--that is something we feel very \nstrongly about--and an innovative financing piece for air traffic \nequipment.\n  Finally, I expect we will see some amendments and debate related to \nairline competition. That will be controversial, the question of \nwhether and how we should strengthen Federal competition laws and \npolicies as they apply to the airline industry.\n  In closing, obviously, there are other important provisions in this \nbill. I will not go through them in full. Suffice it to say, Senator \nGorton and I believe this is a truly balanced package, an inclusive FAA \nand AIP reauthorization package. There has been a lot of consulting, a \nlot of negotiating--an enormous amount of negotiating. I think it is a \ngood bill.\n  I am glad to join my colleague, Senator Gorton, in offering the \ncommittee substitute today on behalf of ourselves, the chairman and \nranking member, at the appropriate time. I look forward to the debate \non it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I wish to express my strong \nopposition to the conference agreement on H.R. 2084, the Fiscal Year \n2000 Transportation Appropriations Bill as recently approved by the \nHouse and Senate conferees.\n  I recognize that there are very important provisions in the \nlegislation, sections that appropriate funds for programs vital to the \nsafety of the traveling public and our national transportation system \nover all. Yet despite that necessary funding, the legislation once \nagain goes overboard on pork barrel spending.\n  It is extremely disappointing the conferees chose to meld the \nenormous number of listed projects that were earmarked in the House and \nSenate reports accompanying the transportation appropriations bill this \nyear. Many additional projects were also included by the conferees. It \nseems that there is never a dearth of special projects that come to the \nattention of appropriators--even after both chambers have already \npassed their versions of the legislation.\n  One would have thought with the windfall enjoyed by most states due \nto the new budgetary scheme under Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st Century, there would have been less project earmarking, but \nunfortunately that was not the case. And, there always seems to be a \nready list of towns, airports, universities, or research organizations \nthat appropriators want to reward with more money to work on a \ntransportation project.\n  For example, many airports that failed to be included when the House \nand Senate considered the transportation funding legislation somehow \nmanaged to be included in the conference agreement. Some of the new \nentrants on the airport funding priority list are the Aurora Municipal \nAirport in Illinois, the Upper Cumberland Regional Airport in \nTennessee, the Abbeyville Airport in Alabama, and the Eastern West \nVirginia Airport in West Virginia.\n  Like some airports, transit projects that failed to make the cut when \nthe House and Senate considered their respective funding bills also \nsomehow made the cut in the conference report. Further, the conferees \ndeemed it necessary to provide specific recommendations to allocate 65 \npercent of the dollars set aside for the new jobs access and reverse \ngrants program established under TEA-21. And, yet the House \napproprators had acknowledged in the House report accompanying the bill \nthat this program was created ``to make competitive grants.'' If the \nfunding is to be competitively awarded, why did the conferees find the \nneed to provide a listing of 47 specific recipients?\n  I have consistently fought Congressional earmarks that direct money \nto particular projects or recipients, believing that such decisions are \nfar better made through nationwide competitive, merit-based guidelines \nand procedures. I continue to find this practice an appalling waste of \ntaxpayer dollars. Bill after bill, year after year, earmarks continue \nto divert needed federal resources away from more meritorious and \ndeserving projects. It is simply unconscionable that Congress condones \nwasting so much of our taxpayers dollars by funneling funds to special \ninterest projects while at the same time, so many of our young men and \nwomen serving in the armed services go underpaid and in some cases, are \nforced to accept food by Congress, have been classic examples.\n  Let me share with my colleagues some of the university-related pork. \n$500,000 is provided for Crowder College in Missouri for a truck \ndriving center safety initiative. $875,000 is set aside for the \nUniversity of South Alabama to begin a research project on rural \nvehicular trauma victims. $250,000 is set aside for Montana State \nUniversity at Bozeman to pilot real-time diagnostic monitoring of rail \nrolling stock. $250,000 is set aside for the University of Missouri-\nRolla to work on advanced composite materials for use in repairing old \nrailroad bridges.\n  As I have said previously, I do not question that some--perhaps all--\nof this research may be needed, but I do question whether the \nspecifically selected universities are the best place to spend taxpayer \ndollars on those projects. It is conceivable that there may be other, \nmore experienced entities, that could perform the research--but we will \nnever know because earmarking ignores merit-based criteria.\n  I vehemently object to the expenditure of scarce transportation funds \non projects that have not been subject to uniform, objective funding \ncriteria. I further object to the expenditure of scarce transportation \nfunds on unauthorized programs.\n  Section 365 provides $500,000 in grants to the Environmental \nProtection Agency to develop a program that allows employers in certain \nregions to receive credits for reduced vehicle-miles-traveled if that \nemployer allows workers to telecommute. Section 365 was not in the \nHouse-passed bill. Section 365 was not in the Senate-passed bill. There \nhave been no hearings on the provision in either the House or the \nSenate. I, for one, believe that the airport and surface transportation \nsafety programs could far better use that half a million dollars than \nthe Environmental Protection Agency.\n  I have asked the following question before and I will continue to on \nother appropriations bills. I ask my colleagues, why are the \nappropriators so reluctant to permit projects to be awarded based on a \ncompetitive and meritorious process that would be fair for all the \nstates and local communities? I ask my colleagues, why are the \nappropriators so quick to slip in provisions creating brand new \nauthorizations. I suspect it is due to the fact they may doubt the \nmerits and worth of the very projects they are earmarking and of the \nprograms they are authorizing.\n  I have only mentioned a few of the examples of earmarks and special \nprojects contained in this measure and I will not waste the time of the \nSenate going over each and every earmark. However, a detailed listing \nof the many earmarked projects proposed in this bill and committee \nreport are available from my office and can also be obtained from my \nwebsite.\n  Finally, I would like to express my grave concerns over a provision \nthat would prevent certain very critical motor carrier safety functions \nfrom being administered by the Federal Highway Administration. Such a \nprohibition could be of grave consequence to the road traveling public \nand is short-sighted at best.\n  Last year an attempt was made by the House Appropriations Committee \nto strip FHWA from its authority over\n\n[[Page S11846]]\n\nmotor carrier safety matters. As Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, which has jurisdiction over most \nfederal transportation safety policies, including motor carrier and \npassenger vehicle safety, I opposed this proposal, in part because it \nhad never been considered by the authorizing committees of \njurisdiction. The provision was ultimately not enacted and I pledged \nthat I would work to address motor carrier safety concerns in this \nCongress. I have lived up to this commitment.\n  At my request, the Inspector General of the Department of \nTransportation conducted a comprehensive analysis of federal motor \ncarrier safety activities. Serious safety gaps have been identified, \nand as such, the authorizing Committees of jurisdiction have been \nworking to move legislation to improve motor carrier safety. The \nCommerce Committee held a hearing on my specific safety proposal and we \nexpect to mark up that measure during the next Executive session. \nIndeed, we are working to move legislation through the regular \nlegislative process.\n  In my opinion, it is very short-sighted and a serious jeopardy to \npublic safety if Congress shuts off funds for motor carrier safety \nactivities within the Department of Transportation. For example, under \nthe conference agreement, the Department would not be permitted to \naccess civil penalties for motor carrier safety violations. According \nto DOT, ``this provision would effectively shut down our safety \nenforcement program.'' While I am aware safety improvements are \nnecessary and am working to accomplish those needed improvements, \nstipping critical authority is not in the interest of truck safety. I \nwould urge the President to veto this legislation due to this unwise \nand unsound provisions and permit the authorization process to proceed \nresponsibly.\n Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to address an issue of great \nimportance for our Nation's environment and economic security.\n  Today the Senate will pass the fiscal year 2000 Transportation \nAppropriations bill. In that bill, for the fifth year in a row, is a \nHouse-passed rider that would block the Department of Transportation \nfrom conducting a legislatively-mandated study of Corporate Average \nFuel Economy Standards.\n  The current CAFE standard for passenger cars is 27.5 miles per \ngallon, while the standard for so-called ``light trucks'', including \nSUVs and minivans, remains at just 20.7 miles per gallon. Today, with \nSUVs and minivans accounting for almost half of all new cars sold in \nthe United States, we need to give serious consideration to improving \nfuel economy standards for these vehicles. By doing so, we could cut \nharmful air pollution, help curb global warming, and reduce the amount \nof gasoline we consume. The existing CAFE standards save more than 3 \nmillion barrels of oil every day. Improving these standards, \nparticularly for light trucks, is especially important when our nation \nis importing increasing amounts of oil every year.\n  For the past four years, Congress has denied the American people \naccess to existing technologies that could save them thousands of \ndollars at the gas pump, technologies that the auto industry could \nimplement with no reduction in safety, power, or performance.\n  The House rider blocking consideration of improved CAFE standards was \nattached to the DOT spending bill without any hearings or debate. While \nI will not object to passage of this important appropriations measure \ntoday, I want to state in the strongest terms my disappointment, shared \nby many of my colleagues, that the statutory requirement to study ways \nto improve fuel efficiency standards is being blocked.\n  We should lift this gag order and give the Department of \nTransportation the opportunity to consider this important \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I now withdraw the committee amendments.\n  The committee amendments were withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1891\n\n    (Purpose: To authorize appropriations for the Federal Aviation \n                Administration, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send a substitute amendment to the desk \nfor Senator McCain, myself, and Senator Rockefeller and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mr. McCain, \n     for himself, Mr. Gorton, and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1891.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. FITZGERALD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold for a moment.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to and considered as original text for the purpose of further \namendment.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An objection is heard.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we will take such measures as are \nnecessary to see whether or not the objection can be withdrawn or we \nwill simply go ahead and debate the substitute amendment. Let me add \nthree other matters.\n  First, we will attempt to get a unanimous consent agreement on the \nfiling of amendments as early and as promptly as we possibly can so \ndebate can be carried forward.\n  Second, as Senator Rockefeller pointed out, there are two additional \namendments to this substitute amendment that can be put up whether or \nnot the substitute amendment has been agreed to. One has to do with the \nair traffic control system and its modernization.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I and many others, as the Senator from West \nVirginia pointed out, have worked diligently in that connection, and we \nbelieve that proposal now is not controversial, though it is of vital \nimportance and we hope it can be agreed to promptly.\n  The other amendment, of course, is the amendment dealing with slots \nat the four or five busiest airports in the country. There may be some \ncontroversy in connection with that amendment. In any event, we hope \nthat each of those amendments will be adopted relatively promptly. \nMembers are urged to bring their amendments to the floor or to speak to \nthe managers about concerns they have that may be solved relatively \neasily.\n  Under the statement made earlier today when this session of the \nSenate began, it is at least possible there will be further votes on \nthis bill today after the vote on the Transportation appropriations \nbill at 5:30 p.m. In any event, there certainly will be by tomorrow. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \nmanager of the bill and also the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia. One thing I want to make clear, contrary to the statement of \nthe Senator from West Virginia, is that at least this Senator from \nIllinois does not believe he was involved in any of the negotiations, \ncertainly not with respect to this last-minute attempt to entirely lift \nthe high density rule that has governed three of our Nation's most \ncrowded and congested airports since the late 1960s.\n  Going back to the 1960s, the FAA has had a rule in effect that limits \noperations at Chicago O'Hare International Airport to 155 operations an \nhour. The reason for that rule was that the airport was at capacity and \nadding more operations per hour would add to delays and jeopardize the \nsafety of the flying public.\n  This original bill had an exemption for 30 new slots that the FAA \ncould grant at O'Hare. I had misgivings about even those 30 exemptions \nfor new flights at O'Hare, and I had been working with the chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee on that issue, going back several months. But \nthis was at the last minute. In fact, I read it in the newspaper today \nthat a deal had been cut behind the scenes to go ahead and lift the \nhigh density rule altogether.\n\n[[Page S11847]]\n\n  I think that is a grave mistake that could jeopardize the safety of \nour flying public in the United States. I fly out of O'Hare \nInternational Airport every week. In fact, I live 12 miles from it. As \nI grew up, that airport grew up. It grew into the busiest airport in \nthe world. Anybody who has been there this year knows that it is so \ncrowded and congested that there are constant delays at O'Hare. In \nfact, a report that came out earlier this year suggested there are more \ndelays at O'Hare International Airport than at any other major airport \nin the country.\n\n  In 1995, when Congress considered lifting the high density rule, the \nFAA commissioned a study to look into what would happen if they lifted \nthe high density rule. That study concluded it would be a great mistake \nto lift the high density rule because it would further add to delays at \nO'Hare and some of the Nation's other slot-controlled airports.\n  When there are massive delays at O'Hare, it pressures the air traffic \ncontrollers to hurry up and get more flights in the air to alleviate \nthose delays. Sometimes there are 100 flights waiting to take off at \nO'Hare International Airport. Lifting the high density rule says that \nmaybe sometimes we will have 200 flights waiting to take off on the \nrunways at O'Hare. With that kind of pressure on the air traffic \ncontrollers, certainly there is the possibility to do something unwise \nand to make too many flights take off too close to each other, which \ncould risk the lives of passengers in this country.\n  I am here to tell you that if one passenger dies in the United States \nbecause this Congress, going along with pressure from United and \nAmerican Airlines, which already have 80 percent of the market in \nChicago O'Hare and want more of it and are trying to block the \nconstruction of a third airport in Chicago because they do not want \nanybody else to have any of the market in Chicago, if in responding to \npressure from those airlines, we are going to add so many more flights \nat O'Hare that we jeopardize the life of just one passenger in this \ncountry, then we have made a horrible, grave mistake.\n  Thus, I will be here everyday this bill is up, and I will fight doing \nthat. I look forward to working with the managers of the bill to \npossibly address my concerns.\n  I was elected, in part, on this issue, and my predecessor, Carol \nMoseley-Braun, in fact, last year when there was a proposal to add just \n100 more slots at O'Hare, fought that. She thought she had an agreement \nto lower that to 30 more slots that could be sparingly granted by the \nFAA, if all sorts of certain criteria were met.\n  Now it appears there is an effort on the part of those who have \nnegotiated this bill to run roughshod over all those conversations with \nSenators from Illinois and go ahead and say the sky is the limit at \nO'Hare.\n  It is interesting; last week, Mayor Daley from Chicago was trying to \nfly to Washington. We had a Taste of Chicago party on the House side of \nthe Capitol. It was a huge party. There were 500 people from Chicago \nwilling to celebrate the Taste of Chicago in Washington. Unfortunately, \nthe mayor of Chicago was stuck on the tarmac at O'Hare for 4 hours \nbecause of delays. It is too crowded and it is too congested.\n\n  Fortunately, thus far, the air traffic controllers have managed the \ntraffic and the delays there, and they have not felt pressured into \ndoing something unwise. But it is very possible that we could put so \nmuch pressure on those air traffic controllers and those pilots that a \nmistake could be made and we could jeopardize the safety of the flying \npublic.\n  So I will be here to fight the lifting of those caps at O'Hare. We \nhave to come up with some other solutions. I do agree we want \ncompetition amongst our airlines. Certainly with the situation at \nO'Hare, where you have two airlines, United and American, that control \n80 percent of the slots, they don't want anybody else to cut into their \nmonopoly there. Thus, they don't want any more air capacity outside of \nO'Hare in Chicago. I understand that. That has created problems. I want \nto work to solve those problems with the Members of this body. But I do \nnot think we should do it in such a way that we cause more delays at \nO'Hare, which puts more pressure on our air traffic controllers, our \npilots, and our whole infrastructure in aviation, and potentially \njeopardizes the safety of the flying public.\n  Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of S. 82, \nthe Air Transportation Improvement Act of 1999. This measure will \nenhance the safety and efficiency of our air transportation system. The \nresidents of Hawaii, a State that is perhaps more dependent on air \ntransportation than any other, stand to benefit significantly from this \nlegislation.\n  Today I want to speak to title VI of the bill which addresses the \nissue of air tour operations at national parks. Title VI establishes a \ncomprehensive regulatory framework for controlling air tour traffic in \nand near units of the National Park System. The legislation requires \nthe Federal Aviation Administration, in cooperation with the National \nPark Service and with public input from stakeholders, to develop an air \ntour management plan for parks currently or potentially affected by air \ntour flights.\n  Under this process, routes, altitudes, time restrictions, limitations \non the number of flights, and other operating parameters could be \nprescribed in order to protect sensitive park resources as well as to \nenhance the safety of air tour operations. An air tour plan could \nprohibit air tours at a park entirely, regulate air tours within half a \nmile outside the boundaries of a park, regulate air tour operations \nthat impact tribal lands, and offer incentives for the adoption of \nquieter air technology.\n  S. 82 also creates an advisory group comprising representatives of \nthe FAA, the Park Service, the aviation industry, the environmental \ncommunity, and tribes to provide advice, information, and \nrecommendations on overflight issues.\n  As embodied in the air tour management plan process, this bill treats \noverflights issues on a park-by-park basis. Rather than a one-size-\nfits-all approach, the legislation establishes a fair and rational \nmechanism through which environmental and commercial aviation needs can \nbe addressed in the\n\n[[Page S11848]]\n\ncontext of the unique circumstances that exist at individual national \nparks.\n  In other words, an air tour management plan for Yosemite in \nCalifornia may differ significantly from a plan for the Florida \nEverglades, in order to take into account differences in terrain, \nweather, types of resources to be protected, and other factors. What is \nimportant about this bill is that it establishes a uniform procedure, \nwith common regulatory elements, that will address overflight issues on \na consistent basis across the nation, while allowing for local \nvariations.\n  I am pleased that this procedural approach, in addition to \nrequirements for meaningful public consultation and a mechanism for \npromoting dialogue among diverse stakeholders, mirrors key elements of \nlegislation--the National Parks Airspace Management Act, cosponsored by \nmy colleagues Senator Inouye and Senator Frist--that I promoted in \nseveral previous Congresses.\n  Title VI also reflects the hard-won consensus developed by the \nNational Parks Overflights Working Group, a group comprising industry, \nenvironmental, and tribal representatives, which worked for many months \nto hammer out critical details embodied in the pending measure.\n  Adoption of this bill is essential if we are to address effectively \nthe detrimental impacts of air tour activities on the National Park \nSystem. Air tourism has significantly increased in the last decade, \nnowhere more so than at high profile units such as Grand Canyon, Great \nSmoky Mountains, as well as Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes national \nparks in my own State. A major 1994 Park Service study indicated that \nnearly 100 parks experienced adverse park impacts. That number has \nassuredly risen since then. Such growth has inevitably conflicted with \nattempts to preserve the natural qualities and values that characterize \nmany national parks, in some instances seriously.\n  While air tour operators often provide important emergency services, \nenhance park access for special populations such as the handicapped and \nelderly, and offer an important source of income for local economies--\nnotably tourism-dependent areas such as Hawaii--unregulated overflights \nhave the potential to harm park ecologies, harm wildlife, and impair \nvisitor enjoyment of the park experience. Unrestricted air tour \noperations can also pose a safety hazard to air and ground visitors \nalike. The tragic crash of an air tour on the Big Island of Hawaii last \nweek which killed nine people, is a stark reminder of the dangers \ninherent in air travel.\n  It is therefore vital that we develop a clear, consistent national \npolicy on this issue, one that equitably and rationally prioritizes the \nrespective interest of the aviation and environmental communities. \nCongress and the administration have struggled to develop such a policy \nsince enactment of the National Parks Overflights Act of 1987, \nCongress's initial, but ultimately limited, attempt to come to grips \nwith the overflights issue. S. 82 will finish where the 1987 act left \noff, providing the FAA and Park Service with the policy guidance and \nprocedural mechanisms that are essential to balancing the needs of air \ntour operators against the imperative to preserve and protect our \nnatural resources.\n  The overflights provisions of this bill are the consequence of good \nfaith efforts on the part of many groups and individuals. They include \nmembers of the National Parks Overflights Working Group. whose \nconsensus recommendations form the underpinnings of this legislation; \nrepresentatives of aviation and environmental advocacy organizations \nsuch as Helicopter Association International, the U.S. Air Tour \nAssociation, the National Parks and Conservation Association, and the \nWilderness Society; and, officials of the FAA and Park Service.\n  From the Park Service, in particular, I recognize Jackie Lowey, Wes \nHenry, Marv Jensen, Sheridan Steele, Ken Czarnowski, and Dave Emmerson, \nall of whom worked directly on this legislation. And I would be remiss \nif I did not recognize the unsung contributions of Ann Choiniere of the \nCommerce Committee staff and Steve Oppermann, formerly of my staff and \nmore recently a consultant to the Park Service, who spent countless \nhours shaping the details in this bill.\n  However, title VI is, above all, the product of the energy and vision \nof my friend and colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain. As the author \nof the 1987 National Parks Overflights Act, Senator McCain was the \nfirst to recognize the adverse impacts of air tours on national parks, \nand the first to call for a national policy to address this problem. \nSince then, he has been relentless in his quest to impel progress on \nthis subject. For his leadership in writing the overflights provisions \nof this bill, and for his decade-long fight to preserve natural quiet \nin our national parks, Senator McCain deserves the lasting appreciation \nof all those who believe in maintaining the integrity of the National \nPark System.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I am pleased to have been involved in \ndeveloping legislation that promotes aviation safety, enhances the \nviability of legitimate air tour operations, and protects national \nparks from the most egregious visual and noise intrusions by air tour \nhelicopters and other aircraft. Left unchecked, air tour activities can \nundermine the very qualities and resources that give value to a park, \nresources that must be protected at all costs. I believe that title VI \nof the pending measure reasonably and prudently balances these \nsometimes opposing considerations, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business for not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/04/senate-section/article/S11848-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11848-S11851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE PANAMA CANAL\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, there are a lot of things \ngoing on in the world. Sometimes there is so much going on that we \nforget some of the more important things. What I would like to do is to \nremind my colleagues and the American people that, as of today, there \nare 88 more days before the United States of America loses its right to \nthe Panama Canal.\n  It is also interesting to point out that these little flags on this \nchart--in case someone may not know what they are--are Communist \nChinese flags. So I am going to place another one over October 4 and \nnote that in 88 days the Chinese Communists are going to have control \nover both ends of the Panama Canal.\n  It is amazing to me that in the Presidential debates--not formal \ndebates but in the discussions of Presidential politics--we did not \neven hear anything about this. Yet here we are, the nation that is \nprobably the largest threat to the United States of America is now \ngoing to control the Panama Canal and not a whimper comes from this \nadministration.\n  So I am going to be on the floor of the Senate almost every day I \ncan--at least every day that is a business day--to remind the American \npeople and the administration that we are now going to allow the \nCommunist Chinese flag to be hoisted over that canal, which we once \ncontrolled, which we, unfortunately, gave away during the Carter \nadministration.\n  The Panama Canal Treaty requires the U.S., by the date of December \n31, 1999, to relinquish its bases in Panama.\n  The Panama Canal--a monument to American engineering, American \nconstruction, American ingenuity--is among the world's most strategic \nwaterways and remains critical to U.S. trade and national security.\n  In case anybody is interested, the United States has invested $32 \nbillion of taxpayer dollars in that canal since its inception. It \nremains a critical artery for our Navy and Merchant Marine, with an \nestimated 200 Navy passages a year going through that canal.\n  On December 31, the Communist Chinese flag will control both ends of \nthat canal.\n  Mr. President, 15 to 20 percent of total U.S. exports and imports \ntransit\n\n[[Page S11849]]\n\nthe canal, including approximately 40 percent of all grain exports.\n  Before the canal was constructed, the voyage around Cape Horn \nrequired 4 or 5 months. The Colombian Government was assessing \ndifferential duties which made transisthmian travel prohibitive, even \nunder ordinary circumstances.\n  Traveling the United States from coast to coast took 8 or 9 months \nand sometimes fighting Indians. That was how long ago. Today, that \ncanal saves 8,000 miles and 2 weeks over the Cape Horn route.\n  Public opinion in the United States towards construction of a canal \nwas galvanized by the voyage of the battleship U.S.S. Oregon from the \nPacific around Cape Horn, joining Admiral Sampson's fleet in battle \nagainst the Spanish fleet of Cuba in 1898. The Oregon arrived just in \ntime to engage in the last naval battle of the Spanish-American War, \nthe Battle of Santiago.\n  In Teddy Roosevelt's first message to Congress, he described the \ncanal as the path to a global destiny for the United States and said:\n\n       No single great work which remains to be undertaken on this \n     continent is of such consequence to the American people [as \n     the Panama Canal].\n\n  In 1918, Teddy Roosevelt warned against internationalism of the \ncanal:\n\n       . . . we will protect it, and we will not permit our \n     enemies to use it in war. In time of peace, all nations shall \n     use it alike, but in time of war our interest at once becomes \n     dominant.\n\n  There has been lots of talk about the potential perils of Y2K, which \nis also going to take place on January 1 or at the end of this year. \nFor me, the complete transfer of the Panama Canal by December 31 is the \nbiggest Y2K challenge facing America, and the clock is ticking. There \nis the countdown--88 days until we lose not only the canal but the \naccess, coming in and out of that canal.\n  This August, President Clinton awarded former President Jimmy Carter \nthe Presidential Medal of Freedom. Now the Carter foreign policy \nlegacy, the giveaway of the Panama Canal and normalized relations with \nthe Communist People's Republic of China, has come full circle with \nominous consequences.\n  Panama City's deputy mayor, Augusto Diaz, states:\n\n       If Red China gets control of the canal, it will get control \n     of the government. . . . The Panama Canal is essential to \n     China . . . if they control the Panama Canal, they control at \n     least one-third of world shipping.\n\n  Already the PRC is the largest goods provider into Panama's free \nzone, at $2 billion a year. The People's Republic of China is the \nlargest user of the canal, after the United States and Japan, with more \nthan 200 COSCO ships alone transiting the waterway annually.\n  The United States has already shut down its strategic Howard Air \nForce Base. Howard Air Force Base has also served as the hub of \ncounternarcotics operations with 2,000 drug interdiction flights a \nyear. By the approaching deadline, we will also have given up in Panama \nRodman Naval Station, the Fort Sherman Jungle Operations Training \nCenter, and other important facilities.\n  The Clinton administration was supposed to be working towards \nnegotiating an arrangement with Panama that would have allowed for a \ncounterdrug center, but even that option has fallen apart. In \nSeptember, the administration announced the collapse of 2 years of \ntalks on a multinational counternarcotics center.\n  More than 2 decades ago, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nAdmiral Thomas Moorer warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nthat the U.S. withdrawal from Panama would occasion a dangerous vacuum \nthat could be filled by hostile interests. His comments were very \nprophetic.\n\n  In 1996, while China was illegally secreting millions of dollars \nthrough conduits into the Clinton reelection coffers, it is alleged \nthat it was simultaneously funneling cash to the Panamanian politicians \nto ensure that Chinese front companies would control the Panama Canal.\n  When is America going to wake up? When are the American people going \nto wake up?\n  Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong company controlled by Chinese \noperatives, will lease the U.S.-built port facilities at Balboa, which \nhandle ocean commerce on the Pacific side, and Cristobal, which handle \ncommerce on the Atlantic side. A Hong Kong company will control--\nremember, Hong Kong is now part of the PRC. Its chairman is Li Ka-\nshing, who has close ties to the Chinese Communist leaders and a de \nfacto working relationship with the People's Liberation Army. Li is a \nboard member of the Chinese Government's primary investment entity, \nCITIC, China International Trust & Investment Corporation, run by PLA \narms trafficker and smuggler Wang Jun. That is the Hong Kong company \nthat will control this canal in 88 days.\n  Insight magazine published an article maintaining that Li serves as a \nmiddleman for PLA business operations, including financing some of the \ncontroversial Hughes and Loral deals which transferred weapons \ntechnology to the PRC. He has also been an ally of Indonesia's Riady \nfamily and the Lippo Group, so deeply implicated in the illegal \nChinese/Clinton fundraising scandal.\n  Hutchison Whampoa's subsidiary runs the Panama Ports Company which is \n10-percent owned by Chinese Resources Enterprise. CRE was identified by \nthe Senate Governmental Affairs Committee as a vehicle for espionage--\neconomic, political, and military--for China. Does anybody care? One of \nthe favorite expressions among preachers is: Hello. Does anybody care? \nIs anybody listening? This is Communist China in the Panama Canal that \nwe built, that we maintained, for $32 billion. Not a whimper. Nobody is \ntalking about it, let alone doing anything about it. Nobody cares. \nWhere is the administration?\n  In addition to concerns about Chinese objectives in securing Balboa \nand Cristobal ports, Panama is in the front lines of the U.S. fight \nagainst narcoterrorism principally exported by the FARC, revolutionary \narmed forces of Colombia, in Colombia. A week after closure of Howard \nAir Force Base, heavily armed FARC members were interviewed in full \ncombat regalia on Panamanian television, operating in Panamanian \nterritory.\n  U.S. Southern Command Chief, General Charles Wilhelm, testifying \nbefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in June, said Panamanian \nsecurity forces were undermanned and ill equipped to deal with growing \nthreats from Colombian guerrilla incursions and drug traffickers. \nColombia is the source of an estimated 80 percent of the world's supply \nof cocaine and the source of 75 percent of heroin seized in the United \nStates. The FARC is known to have ties to the Russian mafia. That canal \nwill be a great opportunity for them.\n  Public opinion polls in Panama indicate that between 70 and 80 \npercent of the Panamanian people support an ongoing U.S. security \npresence in their country. Alternative sites for counterdrug \noperations, the so-called FOLs, or forward operating locations, are \nexpected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars for infrastructure \nbuilding and fees. We have no assurance that even if we build the \ninfrastructure, we can stay in the designated FOLs for any extended \ntime.\n\n  Another issue that must be raised is that of the corrupt and unfair \nbidding process surrounding the 25-year-plus leasing arrangement, with \nan option for another 25 years, with Hutchison Whampoa. The then-U.S. \nAmbassador to Panama, William Hughes, protested this corrupt bidding \nprocess, and American and Japanese firms lost out because of the \nstacked deck. No help from the administration.\n  Ambassador Hughes came close to being declared persona non grata for \nprotesting the rigged deal 3 years ago. It should be noted that Hughes \nis now parroting the administration's line on Panama and the PRC. \nPresident Clinton then appointed Robert Pastor, architect of the 1977 \ncanal surrender. He appointed him, and Pastor's nomination was blocked \nby Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms.\n  Six U.S. Senators, in May 1997, charged in a letter to the Federal \nMaritime Commission that there were irregularities in the bidding \nprocess, which denied U.S. firms an equal right to develop and operate \nterminals in Panama. The Commission acknowledged that the port award \nprocess was unorthodox and irregular by U.S. standards.\n  In 1996, Panama asked a Seattle-based company to withdraw a \nsuccessful bid for Cristobal--a successful bid--\n\n[[Page S11850]]\n\non the grounds that it would give the U.S. firm a monopoly because of \nits existing business in Balboa. In 1997, Panama gave the leasing deal \nto Hutchison Whampoa for both ports. With the introduction of Hutchison \nWhampoa, there follows real concern that Chinese organized criminal \norganizations involved in drug trafficking, guns, and smuggling of \nillegal aliens will ensue. COSCO, mentioned earlier--another Chinese-\nrun firm that tried to lease the Long Beach Naval Shipyard--owned the \nship which entered Oakland containing smuggled AK-47s intended for the \nstreet gangs of Los Angeles. And we almost had that firm in control of \nthe Long Beach Naval Shipyard. Two firms with ties to the PLA and the \nChinese Government were under Federal investigation for the smuggling \nattempt. While the U.S. Government is equipped to deal with this type \nof threat, Panama, with no standing army, is not.\n\n  The United States and Panama have security provisions in existing \ntreaties under which we could negotiate joint security initiatives to \naddress our common interests.\n  Eighty-eight days, Mr. President. Eighty-eight days. That is what we \nhave left to get it done.\n  The major obstacle appears to be an unwillingness of this \nadministration to preserve a presence in Panama and a tendency to \ndownplay the significance of Chinese acquisition of the twin ports.\n  The 1977 treaty gives the United States the right to defend the \nPanama Canal with military force. The United States attached a \ncondition, known as the DeConcini condition, which stated that if the \ncanal were closed, or its operations interfered with, the United States \nand Panama would have the right to take steps necessary, including use \nof military force, to reopen the canal or restore operations in the \ncanal. This modification was never ratified in Panama and met with \nprotest by the Torrijos regime. Panama's version of the treaty denies \nunilateral defense rights to the United States. Some believe that \nPanama and the United States cloaked the differences in order to avoid \na Senate vote on the issue and a plebiscite in Panama. In fact, the \nSenate turned back a series of amendments that would have required the \ntreaties to be renegotiated and resubmitted to the Panamanians for \nanother referendum.\n  The DeConcini condition, because it was attached to the Neutrality \nTreaty, remains in force permanently. But as former Admiral and Joint \nChiefs Chairman Thomas Moorer noted, how does the ``right'' to go into \nthe canal with force compare to the advantage of defensive bases that \ncould prevent the takeover of the canal by an enemy?\n  A new Panamanian law gives this company, Hutchison Whampoa, the \n``first option'' to take over the U.S. Naval Station Rodman and other \nsites. Panamanian law also gives the Chinese company the right to pilot \nall vessels transiting the canal. Admiral Moorer warned the Senate last \nyear that our Navy vessels could be put at risk since Hutchison Whampoa \nhas the right to deny passage to any ship interfering with its \nbusiness, including U.S. Navy ships.\n  It is of interest to note a 25-percent leap in immigration to Panama \nfrom the PRC over the past few years--a 25-percent increase in \nimmigration to Panama from the PRC. Beijing has used large-scale \nemigration as the basis for future intelligence recruits, with Panama a \nkey target. Stanislav Lunev, a defector and former Soviet military \nintelligence colonel, claimed Chinese intelligence succeeded because of \ntheir ability to exploit the vast emigration of Chinese to communities \nacross the world.\n  Eighty-eight more days, Mr. President. Eighty-eight more days.\n  The Congressional Research Service's August 1999 Issue Brief on China \naddresses a Chinese immigrant scandal. Panamanian visas were sold for \nas much as $15,000 to Chinese citizens who would fly from Hong Kong to \nCosta Rica, where smugglers would guide them through Central America \nand Mexico into the United States. Then President Balladares fired his \nhead of intelligence as a result of the scandal--another issue which \ncauses consternation among Americans with regard to Panama's ability to \ndeal with its China problem.\n\n  If I could put it bluntly, this administration has dropped the ball \nbig time. The House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere stated in \nMarch 1995 that over 80 percent of Panamanians favor some sort of U.S. \nmilitary presence in their country. A September 1997 poll found that 70 \npercent believe that some U.S. bases should remain after the end of \nthis year.\n  Eighty-eight more days.\n  More recently, a May 1998 poll showed that 65 percent of Panamanians \nsupport the concept of a multinational counterdrug center.\n  Despite public support--as high as three-fourths of the people in \nPanama wishing for the United States to stay in some capacity--this \nadministration appears wedded to an unconditional pullout, an \nunconditional surrender toward a ``cooling off'' period that could \nallow the PRC to consolidate a new strategic toehold in Panama.\n  The Panama Canal Treaty was negotiated between President Carter and \nPanamanian dictator Omar Torrijos. It doesn't reflect public opinion in \nPanama. It did not, arguably, reflect public opinion in the United \nStates.\n  When Operation Just Cause was launched in 1989, following the deaths \nof American soldiers and civilians in Panama, the United States \nintervened to safeguard American lives, to defend democracy in Panama, \nto combat drug trafficking, and to protect the integrity of the Panama \nCanal Treaty. It would be a shame if, because we fail now to protect \nPanama and the common security interests of the United States, to risk \nmilitary intervention in the future.\n  Finally, a Pentagon spokesman has dismissed the notion that the \nUnited States should even worry about Chinese encroachment in Panama. \nDon't worry about it. According to an AP story, Admiral Craig Quigley \nsaid:\n\n       We have nothing to indicate that the Chinese have the \n     slightest desire to somehow control the Panama Canal. . . . \n     And we don't consider this a security issue at all. It is a \n     business issue.\n\n  Hello. Is anybody listening out there in the administration? What are \nwe saying? Eighty-eight more days and they will control both ends of \nit. But, according to Quigley:\n\n       We have nothing to indicate that the Chinese have the \n     slightest desire to somehow control the Panama Canal. . . . \n     And we don't consider this a security issue at all. It is a \n     business issue.\n\n  That is what he says: ``It is a business issue.'' Yes, it is a \nbusiness issue all right--between the Chinese Government and Panama, to \nour detriment. There isn't any private business in China. It is all \ndone by the Government. That is business as usual in the Clinton White \nHouse. This is a serious mistake that will in the future cost us dearly \nin terms of our national security.\n  This is the same Red China that has labeled us their ``No. 1 enemy;'' \nthe same China that has sought to steal all of our nuclear weapons \nsecrets from our DOE labs; the same China that sought to buy the 1996 \nPresidential election, and massacred students at Tiananmen Square; the \nsame China which has committed genocide in Tibet and which is supplying \nstate sponsors of terrorism in Iran, Libya, Syria, and North Korea; the \nsame China that has provided missiles and other weapons of mass \ndestruction and technology to be sent around the world; the same China \nthat threatened a nuclear attack on California and which has implied it \nwould use the neutron bomb against Taiwan.\n  Here is the flag right here. Eighty-eight more days. In 88 more days, \nit will be hanging on a mast over that canal. That is the flag. That is \nalso the flag of a country to which, right here in this Senate, a \nmajority of my colleagues, I regret to say, said we should provide \nmost-favored-nation status.\n  In conclusion, the United States should re-engage the new government \nof Moscoso on the issue of a continued U.S. presence. General \nMcCaffrey, the drug czar, has shown a renewed interest on what he now \ncalls an emergency situation in Colombia, albeit several years after \nthe State Department and the Clinton administration stalled, thwarted, \nand blocked congressional efforts to assist Colombia's antinarcotics \npolice in its fight against the FARC.\n  Despite these differences over tactics in the drug war, McCaffrey \nstands out in the Clinton administration as someone who cares about the \ndrug problem.\n\n[[Page S11851]]\n\n But this is bigger than drugs. This is drugs--there is no question \nabout it--but it is also the national security of the United States.\n  We could also urge the new Panamanian Government to conduct a \nreferendum on maintaining a U.S. presence. No one is talking to them \nabout that. We could urge reopening of the bidding process to be more \nfair and equitable, and to ensure that no hostile powers are permitted \nto bid. We are not doing that either.\n\n  The canal was built at a tremendous expense--$32 billion--and at the \nsacrifice of thousands of American lives. What a pity, the good working \nrelationship that has developed between Panama and the United States to \nbe lost because of the ineptitude and indifference of people in the \nState Department and the Defense Department of this administration. If \nthis administration remains blind to the threat facing Panama, it is \nincumbent upon this Congress to make the case to the American people, \nto the new government in Panama, and to the Panamanian people.\n  That is exactly what I intend to do on this floor every day that I \ncan get the time and the floor to do it between now and December 31. I \nam going to be posting another flag each day to remind the American \npeople that we are getting closer and closer and closer to the People's \nRepublic of China--Communist China--controlling both ends of the Panama \nCanal--the country that has trampled the rights of Tibetans, that \nthreatened to run over its peaceful protesters with tanks, that has \nstolen our nuclear secrets, that funneled money into our Presidential \ncampaigns, and purchased or stolen other targeting devices to target \nour cities, and, frankly, threatened the country of Taiwan, and even \nthreatened California if we step in. What do we do on the Senate floor? \nNot only do we let them take the canal, but we also give them most-\nfavored-nation status.\n  At some point, the American people are going to have to wake up. I \ndon't know when it is going to be. But I hope it is not too late.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/04/senate-section/article/S11851-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I am going to explain this amendment in \nsome detail, as it has been the subject of both long negotiations and \nmuch controversy internally in the Commerce Committee in the almost 7 \nmonths since the Commerce Committee bill was reported to the floor, and \ntoday.\n  I will say right now, for my friend and colleague from Illinois, \nafter I have spoken on the amendment and Senator Rockefeller has made \nany remarks on the amendment that he wishes, at the reasonable request \nof the Senator from Illinois, after any remarks he wishes to make, we \nwill not take further action on this amendment today. The Senator from \nIllinois may have an amendment to this amendment. He may simply debate \nagainst and speak against the passage of this amendment. He prefers to \ndo that tomorrow. At least informally, I will undertake that it will be \nthe first subject taken up tomorrow. I am not certain I can give him \nabsolute assurance of that, but I believe it should be the first \nsubject taken up tomorrow, the debate to take place on it, and the \npositions of the Senator from Illinois presented.\n  There are other Members of the body who may also wish to amend this \namendment. This amendment is central to this overall debate. Once we \nhave completed action on this amendment, I suspect most of the other \namendments to the bill will require much less time and will be much \nless controversial.\n  In any event, the background to the high density rule that is the \ncentral subject of this amendment is this: In 1968, that is to say, 31 \nyears ago, the Federal Aviation Administration established a regulation \nto address serious congestion and delay problems at five of the \nnation's airports. That regulation, known as the high density rule and \nimplemented in 1969, governed the allocation of capacity at Chicago \nO'Hare, Washington National, and JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark airports in \nthe New York City area. Newark was later exempted from the rule, so it \nnow applies only to four airports.\n\n  The high density rule allocates capacity at the four airports by \nimposing limits on the number of operations (takeoffs or landings) \nduring certain periods of the day. The authority to conduct a single \noperation during those periods is commonly referred to as a ``slot.''\n  The Gorton/Rockfeller amendment consolidates all of the negotiated \nagreements to lift the high density rule, the slot rule, at Chicago \nO'Hare, LaGuardia, and JFK, and to ease the high density rule and the \nperimeter rule restrictions at Reagan National.\n  With respect to Chicago O'Hare, the amendment would eliminate the \nhigh density rule at O'Hare, effective April 1, 2003.\n  Regional jets and turboprops would be exempt from slot requirements \neffective January 1, 2000, for service to airports with fewer than 2 \nmillion annual enplanements. There are two additional conditions that \nwould have to be met before carriers could take advantage of this \ninterim regional jet/turboprop exemption. First, there could be no more \nthan one carrier already providing nonstop service to that airport from \nO'Hare. Second, the exemption would only be available for new service \nin the market, such as when a carrier is adding a frequency to the \napplicable market, or upgrading the aircraft that provides its existing \nservice in the market from a turboprop to a regional jet.\n  Regional jets would be defined as aircraft having between 30 and 50 \nseats.\n\n[[Page S11852]]\n\n  Limited incumbent air carriers would also be exempt from the slot \nrequirements at O'Hare, effective January 1, 2000. The terms ``new \nentrant'' and ``limited incumbent'' air carrier are often used \ninterchangeably. Limited incumbent air carriers are currently defined \nas those carriers that hold or operate 12 or fewer slots at a high \ndensity airport. The Gorton/Rockefeller amendment would redefine \nlimited incumbents as those carriers that hold or operate 20 or fewer \nslots at a high density airport. The limited incumbent would be exempt \nfrom the high density rule only if they were providing new service, or \nservice that they were not already providing in a market\n  The Department of Transportation would be required to monitor the \nflights that are operated without slots under the exemption from the \nhigh density rule. If a carrier was operating a flight that did not \nmeet the specified criteria, the Department of Transportation would be \nrequired to terminate the authority for that flight.\n  O'Hare is currently slot controlled from 6:45 a.m. to 9:15 p.m. The \namendment would reduce the slot controlled window at O'Hare from 2:45 \np.m. to 8:15 p.m., effective April 1, 2002.\n  International service to O'Hare would be exempt from the slot \nrequirements beginning April 1, 2000, except or foreign carriers where \nreciprocal access to foreign airports for United States carriers is not \navailable.\n  Carriers would be required to continue serving small hub and nonhub \nairports where the carrier ``provides air transportation of passengers \n. . . on or before the date of enactment'' of the bill using slot \nexemptions. This period of required service at O'Hare would last until \nMarch 31, 2007. A carrier could get out from under these requirements \nif it could demonstrate to DOT that it is losing money on the route.\n\n  The amendment would terminate the high density rule at LaGuardia and \nJFK, effective calendar year 2007.\n  Regional jets would be eligible for slot exemptions for service to \nairports with fewer than two million annual enplanements. There are two \nadditional conditions that would have to be met before carriers could \nget a regional jet slot exemption. First, there could be no more than \none carrier already providing nonstop service to that airport from \nLaGuardia or JFK. Second, the exemption would only be available for new \nservice in the market, such as when a carrier is adding a frequency to \nthe applicable market, or upgrading the aircraft that provides its \nexisting service in the market from a turbo-prop to a regional jet.\n  Regional jets would be defined as aircraft having between 30 and 50 \nseats.\n  Limited incumbent air carriers would also be eligible for slot \nexemptions at LaGuardia and JFK. Limited incumbent air carriers are \ncurrently defined as those carriers that hold or operate 12 or fewer \nslots at a high density airport. The Gorton/Rockefeller amendment would \nredefine limited incumbents as those carriers that hold or operate 20 \nor fewer slots at a high density airport.\n  The amendment would ease the current criteria that enable new \nentrant/limited incumbent air carriers to acquire slot exemptions. The \nDepartment of Transportation is currently authorized to grant these \nslot exemptions when to do so would be in the public interest, and when \ncircumstances are exceptional. On most occasions, DOT has interpreted \nthe ``exceptional circumstances'' criterion to mean that there is no \nnonstop service in the route proposed to be served. In other words, DOT \nwould grant an exemption only when there is no service between the city \nproposed to be served and the high density airport. The amendment would \neliminate the ``exceptional circumstances'' criterion.\n  The amendment would establish a 45-day turnaround for all slot \nexemption applications submitted to the Department of Transportation. \nIf the Department does not act on the application within 45 days, it \nwould be deemed to be approved and consequently the carrier could \ninitiate the proposed service.\n  Carriers would be required to continue serving small hub and nonhub \nairports where the carrier ``provides air transportation of passengers \n*  *  * on or before the date of enactment'' of the bill using slot \nexemptions. This period of required service at LaGuardia and JFK would \nlast until calendar year 2009. A carrier could get out from under these \nrequirements it it could demonstrate to DOT that it is losing money on \nthe route.\n  Next Reagan National. The amendment would establish 12 perimeter \nrule/slot exemptions for service beyond the 1,250-mile perimeter. To \nqualify for beyond-perimeter exemptions, the proposed service would \nhave to provide domestic network benefits or increase competition by \nnew entrant air carriers.\n  The amendment would establish 12 slot exemptions for service within \nthe perimeter. Carriers could only apply to serve medium hubs or \nsmaller airports from Reagan National.\n  The amendment would establish a 45-day turnaround for all slot \nexemption and perimeter rule exemption applications submitted to the \nDepartment of Transportation. If the Department does not act on the \napplication within 45 days, it would be deemed to be approved and \nconsequently the carrier could initiate the proposed service.\n\n  On another subject, safety and delays, the Department of \nTransportation concluded in a 1995 report entitled, ``Report to the \nCongress: A Study of the High Density Rule'', that changing the high \ndensity rule will not affect air safety. According to DOT, today's \nsophisticated traffic management system limits demand to operationally \nsafe levels through a variety of air traffic control programs and \nprocedures that are implemented independently of the limits imposed by \nthe high density rule. The Department report makes assurances that Air \nTraffic Control, ATC, will continue to apply these programs and \nprocedures for ensuring safety regardless of what happens to the high \ndensity rule.\n  Many improvements have been made in infrastructure and air traffic \nmanagement in the 30 years since the high density rule was first \nimplemented, which should allow for additional operations without \nadditional delays.\n  Improvements on the ground, including high speed runway turnouts, \nadditional taxiways, and larger holding areas at the ends of the \nrunways allow more efficient utilization of the gates and ground \nfacilities and thus increase the capacity at high density airports.\n  Enroute, approach and departure air traffic management improvements \nhave increased the air space capacity above high density airports.\n  In 1968 there were no ``flow control'' measures. Aircraft stacked up \nin the air rather than being planned and routed for arrival. Modern ATC \nflow control has significantly increased the airspace capacityu, while \nimproving safety.\n  Greater precision radar has decreased aircraft spacing requirements, \nthus increasing capacity without sacrificing safety. Further \nimprovements are expected with the existing Global Positioning System, \nGPS, Technology, allowing for additional capacity increases.\n  Future initiatives at Chicago's O'Hare and New York's LaGuardia and \nJFK will permit growth without undue operational delays.\n  Airspace redesign, essentially the rethinking of the approach, \ndeparture and routing of aircraft, was proven effective in a recent \npilot project a Dallas-Fort Worth. Redesign efforts are currently \nunderway for the Chicago area and other airports.\n  Other FAA programs, such as RNAV (area navigation) and the National \nRoute Program, already in use in some locations, will further enhance \nenroute and terminal capacity.\n  Technology improvements such as digital data transfer between \ncontrollers and pilots, automation tools for managing traffic flows, \nand precision location devices such as GPS will greatly increase \ncapacity throughout the national airspace system.\n  The recent ATC problems were due in part to the unique combination of \nadverse weather and the introduction of new systems at key airports. \nThe gradual phaseout of the high density rule will allow time to fix \nthese problems, and for the growth in capacity to match the increased \nair traffic control capability.\n  The amendment allows 7 years before the slot rule is removed for the \nNew York airports, and more than 3 years for Chicago. This phaseout \nallows adequate time for the FAA's initiatives to be in place.\n  Even if there is some increase in delays, in both Chicago and New \nYork,\n\n[[Page S11853]]\n\ncompetitive nearby airports such as Midway and Islip provide a natural \nsafety valve.\n  Many new entrant carriers operating point-to-point have found that \nusing nearby secondary airports is a profitable way to offer service to \nmajor cities. If delays and the associated costs do increase in Chicago \nand New York's major airports, more operations will naturally move to \nthese secondary airports.\n  Madam President, that is an explanation both of the details of this \namendment and the rationale for the amendment. Again, in connection \nwith the bill as a whole, this represents the level of partnership \nbetween Senator Rockefeller and myself, but as broad consultation and \nas much agonizing discussion over the details as can possibly be \nimagined under circumstances on a subject so important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I fully agree with my colleague \nfrom Washington. In fact, I have a whole series of pages about various \nStates, various airports, various Senators, and the problems they had--\nand in one case may still have--with whom we worked out agreements. \nThis was a very arduous process.\n  An airport is a very large employer when one is talking about the \nnumber of planes that can fly in and fly out. Every flight, in fact, \nrepresents two slots, a landing and a takeoff. It was a very \ncontroversial subject. This is probably the most controversial subject, \nbut we worked a long time to try to work this out. We did it, as the \nSenator indicated, with an expedited review process in certain places, \nwe did it in good faith, we did it slowly, and we did it over a period \nof time. We did it, we thought, trying to accommodate as much as \npossible the needs of individual Senators who, quite naturally, take \nthese things particularly seriously. The Presiding Officer and I wish \nwe had problems of this sort, but for those who do, it is a real \nproblem. We recognized that, and we tried to deal with it in a fair \nmanner.\n  First, I will not give the full explanation my colleague did, but I \nwill say it is carefully crafted, it is based on compromise, and it \nbalances both the questions of congestion and of noise. There are those \nwho feel strongly about both or one or the other in various \nproportions. Obviously, all of them represent high-density airports, \nalthough it should be said there are a lot more than four high-density \nairports. Atlanta, for example, is neck and neck with O'Hare in terms \nof its density, but is not included in the high-density treatment.\n  I thought the handling of Reagan National was good because we went \nfrom 48 slots to 24 slots; 12 outside the perimeter and 12 inside the \nperimeter. That is good for the Presiding Officer and the present \nspeaker because that allows more entrants into National, and that is \ndesirable.\n  It also is a fact that this was in the original bill, and it was \nretained in the substitute. That speaks to something within the \nauthorizing context. In other words, people on the Commerce Committee \noverwhelmingly believed this was a very important and fair treatment.\n  We did not make the treatment of every airport exactly the same in \nterms of the phasing out of the high density rule because not every \nairport is the same. We did not do it as a collection of our own air \ngenius or mathematical equations; we did it because the FAA advised us \nvery carefully as to what we ought to do on that according to their \nbest calculations. The idea was, instead of gradually phasing out the \nhigh density rule altogether, to, rather, establish some interim rules \nto allow small communities--this is a very important point--to allow \nsmall communities and to allow new entrants to get a head start on this \nprocess.\n  If you come from rural America and if you believe in a competitive \nmarket system, that becomes extremely important. Small communities do \nget a head start to add flights and fill capacity in this compromise \nwhich has been worked out.\n  I have explained the Reagan Airport situation.\n  The amendment, again, specifically protects service to small \ncommunities--which is of interest to many of us--under slot exemptions \nthat were previously granted by the Department of Transportation.\n  It requires that airlines continue the service until 4 years after \nthe lifting of the high density rule at O'Hare--until the year 2007--\nand 2 years after the lifting of the high density rule at Kennedy and \nLaGuardia for that purpose.\n  Understandably, some Members were very concerned. When we began to \ntalk about this, they were very worried it would come off that the \nairlines, therefore, would have no incentive to keep any of their \nbusiness in smaller communities or in smaller markets; that they could \nsimply pick up their slots and take them elsewhere.\n  This amendment prevents them from doing that. It prevents them from \nabandoning these markets unless, as Senator Gorton indicated, they can \nprove to the Department of Transportation--which will be under the \nmajority of this body, which is rural or part rural in nature; a lot of \npressure--that they are suffering, as they say, substantial losses on \nthese routes. So that is a clear effort to protect service for small \ncommunities, and that is something which I value very much.\n  As Senator Gorton also explained, this amendment expands the \ndefinition of a ``limited incumbent.'' These carriers are already \nserving one of the four high-density airports, but do so with only a \nvery few number of flights. This was of particular value to many of our \nMidwestern colleagues. There are a whole series of them who, I think, \nare quite happy as a result of this.\n  The new definition will give more low-fare, new-entrant carriers \naccess to these major airports. Again, I go back to the philosophy of \nall of this that, after all, we do have 15, 18 major airports in the \ncountry, but fundamentally we are a hub-and-spoke system. And the \nPresiding Officer and the junior Senator from West Virginia come from \nStates that are spokes; we are not hubs. We never will be. We depend \nupon carriers that are in the hubs coming out, as they compete in this \nmost competitive of all businesses--in our market system--to compete \nfor new passengers. So they, in classic fashion, have to increasingly \ncome out into the rural areas to draw passengers into their hubs. There \nwill be an amendment about the nature of these hubs to attract them, so \nthey can put them into the bloodstream, so to speak, the flow stream of \ntheir business.\n\n  In my opening statement, when I talked about the enormous increase in \nnew regional jets which will be taking place in the next number of \nyears, that is one of the reasons the number of these regional jets \nwill be increasing--because they are being sent from hubs out to the \nsmaller areas to pick up passengers, to bring them into the larger hub \nairports, and then going on to wherever they wish from there.\n  One very important thing. I am not sure the Senator from Washington \nsaid this or not; he probably did, knowing him. There is an important \ncaveat for any change in the high density rule. This is not just \nsomething the Congress has such power to decide that we just abrogate \nor pretend the FAA does not have ultimate understanding of what \nconstitutes safety in a system.\n  The FAA retains the ultimate authority for air traffic operations, \nand they have the ability to step in because of safety or delay. They \ncan intervene. They can intervene when they think there is a problem or \na crisis. And they can do so on a unilateral basis.\n  In addition, I might add, both the General Accounting Office and a \nnumber of economists, over a lot of years, have pointed out that slot \nrules, in effect, act as a major barrier to airline competition. That \nnew entry at four airports--there are a lot of people who cannot get \ninto those airports because of the slot rule. Again, the FAA would have \nto maintain the sureness of safety, and the rest of it, but you want \npeople to be able to get in and out of airports.\n  As to new technology, if we would only make available the money, they \nhave all kinds of new ways now of charting courses for airplanes, be \nthey commercial or private, which allow a more efficient use of \nairspace, which we cannot now do because we do not have the technology. \nEach computer in all of these many centers across the country does not \nhave the ability to differentiate the altitudes or whatever some of the \nother details are that allow the plotting of air courses. So there is \nroom for more, and in not only the four\n\n[[Page S11854]]\n\nhigh-density airports but also generally speaking.\n  Then, finally, this amendment does require noise studies. Noise is a \nfactor. Noise is not the only factor in life, but it is a factor. It \ngives priority to high-density airports. There is the allocation of \nmoney for those noise abatement studies.\n  So I think it is a very good amendment. It certainly is a long-\nworked-at amendment. I urge my colleagues to join in the adoption of \nthis amendment.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, does the Senator from Illinois wish to \nmake any remarks now or should we just go on to another subject?\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, if I could just take a moment now, I \nsay to the Senator from Washington, I would be happy to take my time \ntomorrow when we consider the amendment on lifting the high density \nrule. But if I could just reiterate my opposition to lifting the high \ndensity rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. As was noted earlier, the FAA imposed the high \ndensity rule back in the late 1960s. It was an internal FAA rule. I \nguess I am a little perplexed as to why Congress would come in and \nrewrite, with statute, an FAA rule.\n  If the FAA thinks it is a good idea to lift the slot rules at O'Hare, \nif they think it is safe to do that, they are confident it will not add \nto any delays at the most congested, most delay-filled airport in the \ncountry, then the FAA can go in and do that. So I guess the threshold \nissue is, I am perplexed why we would come in and write a statute that \noverrides a Federal Aviation Administration rule.\n  I do believe, while the proponents of this proposal have good \nintentions; they would like to increase competition and access to the \nChicago market; and certainly it could be argued that would benefit the \nwhole Nation and could even benefit Chicago--a basic law of physics \nsays that you cannot have two objects occupying the same space at one \ntime.\n  Right now, O'Hare, which has over 900,000 operations a year, is \nalready at capacity. The FAA commissioned a study in 1995. That study \nconcluded that the absolute maximum number of flights or operations one \ncould have at O'Hare in an hour was 158. Today, we are at 163 \noperations at O'Hare in an hour. This proposal before the Senate is to \nlift any restrictions at all.\n  A flight lands and takes off every 20 seconds at O'Hare. If we want \nto cram more flights into O'Hare International Airport, are we going to \nclose that 20 seconds that divides each flight going in and out of \nO'Hare? What is a safe amount of time? Ten seconds between flights? How \nwould you like to be coming in 10 seconds behind the plane in front of \nyou with another flight 10 seconds behind you? Would you feel safe \nflying that jumbo jet in that compact air space?\n  Going into O'Hare right now, one can look in every direction and see \nplanes lined up as far as the eye can see waiting to land at O'Hare. In \nthe morning hours at O'Hare, there are typically as many as 100 flights \nwaiting to take off.\n  I hope the Members of this body will give thought to what we are \ndoing. With this lifting of the high density rule, we are saying it is \nsafe to cram more flights into the most congested airport in the \ncountry; that it is not endangering the safety of the flying public and \nthat it won't add delays.\n  I never did take physics in high school. I have to admit it. I was a \nclassics major. I majored in Latin and Greek. I took a lot of \nhumanities courses and my great interest was not science. But I am \ngoing to be interested to hear whether there is some scientific \nevidence that we can keep packing more and more flights into the most \ncongested, dense, delay-filled, crowded air traffic space in the world. \nI will be interested to learn why other Members of this body think that \nis a good policy and why it would be safe.\n\n  With that, I look forward to being afforded the opportunity to speak \non this matter tomorrow. I thank the distinguished Senators from West \nVirginia and the State of Washington for conferring with me this \nafternoon. I look forward to being given the time to address this \nmatter to the full Senate body tomorrow. Hopefully, at that time, more \nof my colleagues will have arrived, many of whom will have passed \nthrough O'Hare and probably some, quite a few, who will have incurred \ndelays on their way passing through O'Hare.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all first-\ndegree amendments to S. 82 be filed at the desk by 10 a.m. tomorrow, \nTuesday, with all other provisions of the consent agreement of \nSeptember 30 still in effect. This has been cleared on all sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk for \nSenator Rockefeller and myself, and I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside so we may consider this one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for himself and \n     Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered 1893.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, last Friday, I joined my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Rockefeller, in introducing S. 1682. This measure is \nthe culmination of input from a broad range of aviation interests. \nSenator Rockefeller and I have been holding a series of meetings with \nindustry representatives searching for input on how we can make a \npositive legislative impact on the current air traffic control system.\n  Three common themes emerged from these meetings: First, there will be \na crisis in the aviation industry if we continue to experience the \ndelays that plagued the system this summer. Second, the Federal \nAviation Administration is doing a better job of responding to these \nproblems under Administrator Garvey. The third point is, incremental \nchanges are probably the best approach to take in reforming the system, \nas much as the Senator from West Virginia and I might very well prefer \na more drastic reform.\n  The amendment we have just introduced is the text of that S. 1682.\n  Madam President, by now I am sure you have heard the analogy that \nfixing the air traffic control system is similar to trying to change a \nflat tire while traveling down the highway at 60 miles per hour. While \nI don't view the problem as being that daunting, I certainly think we \ncan use a few good mechanics to help get the FAA back on the right \ntrack. I think the legislation Senator Rockefeller and I have \nintroduced is a step in the right direction. While I am in favor of an \nend result that goes much further, positive action is needed. At this \ntime, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n  Our approach would attack the problem from the management side. It is \nno secret that the FAA has a history of problems controlling costs and \nschedules on large-scale projects. We hope the creation of the chief \noperating officer position, with responsibility for running and \nmodernizing our air traffic control system, will inject the necessary \ndiscipline into that system. S. 1682, the current amendment, would also \ncreate a subcommittee of the Management Advisory Committee to oversee \nair traffic control services. Of course, in order for there to be a \nsubcommittee of the MAC, we must first have an MAC. I am assured by the \nFAA that the Management Advisory Committee will be appointed soon. Let \nme assure you that this subcommittee chairman will not look favorably \non any further delays on this question.\n  As we prepare to move into the 21st century, the NAS must be prepared \nto\n\n[[Page S11855]]\n\nmeet the challenges of increasing demand on an already strained system. \nA blueprint for this system should be a top priority for the FAA. S. \n1682, this amendment, authorizes $12 million a year for the FAA to \ndevelop a long-term plan to provide direction. The most radical portion \nof this bill and the amendment deal with an innovative financing pilot \nproject. This provision would set up a mechanism to establish public-\nprivate joint ventures to purchase air traffic control equipment. Ten \nprojects for ATC modernization equipment will be selected, $5 million \nper project, with a total cap of $500 million. FAA seed money would be \nleveraged, along with money and input from the airports and airlines, \nmore quickly to purchase and field ATC modernization equipment.\n  As I stated earlier, this is not the final solution to our air \ntraffic control system woes. We hope, however, that this will be the \nfirst step in a long journey to ensure Americans continue to enjoy the \nsafest, most efficient aviation system in the world. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this amendment.\n\n  An oversight committee for air traffic control: The bill and the \namendment provide the FAA Administrator with authority to create a \nsubcommittee of the current Management Advisory Committee, a 15-member \npanel appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, to oversee air traffic control services.\n  A COO for air traffic: The bill and the amendment create a new chief \noperating officer position with responsibility for running and \nmodernizing air traffic control services, developing and implementing \nstrategic and operational plans, and the budget for air traffic \nservices. The COO reports to and serves at the pleasure of the \nAdministrator for a 5-year term. Compensation is comparable to the \nAdministrator's but with the possibility of up to a 50-percent \nperformance bonus at the discretion of the Administrator.\n  Performance bonus for the FAA Administrator: The bill and the \namendment provide a performance bonus for the FAA Administrator at the \ndiscretion of the Secretary of Transportation of up to 50 percent of \nthe Administrator's salary.\n  National Airspace Review and Redesign: The bill and the amendment \nmandate a review and redesign of the entire country's airspace. They \nauthorize $12 million per year to carry out the project, require \nindustry and State input, and impose periodic reporting.\n  Cost allocation milestones report: The bill and the amendment require \nthe FAA to provide a report on the progress it is making on the cost \nallocation system.\n  ATC joint venture: The bill and the amendment set up a mechanism to \nestablish public-private joint ventures to purchase air traffic control \nequipment. Ten projects for air traffic control modernization equipment \nwill be selected, $50 million per project, with a total cap of $500 \nmillion. FAA seed money will be leveraged, along with money and input \nfrom the airports and airlines, more quickly to purchase and field ATC \nmodernization equipment. A portion of the passenger facility charge, 25 \ncents, could also be used for financing.\n\n  That is a brief explanation of the bill and, of course, of this \namendment. The Senator from West Virginia and I believe we will \nprobably be able to accept this amendment by a voice vote tomorrow. But \nwe do want it before the body at the present time, so that if anybody \nhas any questions about it or about any of the provisions of the \namendment, they may contact us before the proposal comes back up \ntomorrow. My present intention would be to bring this up for discussion \nand vote after we have disposed of the early amendment on slots and any \namendments to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I agree with everything my \ncolleague from Washington has said. I should say that he and I began \nworking on this amendment in earnest a number of months ago when we \nwere in the midst of the summer and the headlines were full of all the \nproblems of the air traffic control system, which were becoming \nmanifest to anybody reading a newspaper, watching television, or \nlistening to the radio.\n  When I use the word ``troubled'' to describe our air traffic system, \nI need to be very careful and clear because the FAA, our air traffic \ncontrollers, the pilots, and flight attendants in this country have had \nan air safety record that is extraordinary. It is not only safe but it \nis a very secure air traffic operation. So people say: Fine. Then why \nworry about the future?\n  As I explained in my opening statement, the future is going to bring \ndouble, or triple, or quadruple virtually everything--whether it is air \ncargo, letters, passengers, numbers of aircraft, international traffic, \nand the rest of it.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that the word ``troubled'' is not about \nsafety, although we always have to keep our eye on that, but it is \nabout productivity, about capacity, about efficiency, about outdated \nequipment, about insufficient runways, and insufficient runways that \nare insufficiently distant from one another; if there happen to be two, \nor if they happen to be parallel, you can't use them efficiently to \nland two airplanes at the same time. It is about surging traffic \ndemand, about fractured organizational structure, and it is about us in \nthe Congress; it is about a highly unpredictable, highly irregular \nprocess of funding.\n  Funding the FAA and its air traffic control operation is not at all \nunlike running IBM or Dell Computer. You are meant to have a business \nplan, a 5-year outlay of budget, and you are meant to know what kind of \nequipment you can buy 1 year from now, 2 years from now, 3 years from \nnow, so you can begin to prepare for that. We in this Congress, have \nspecialized in declining to make that ability available to the people \nwho fly 2 million of our people around every day. So what Senator \nGorton and I have done today is not to offer, as he indicated, dramatic \nreform or restructuring of the FAA, because we know there is a lot to \nbe worked through, that it would be premature to do that today.\n  In fact, on the floor of this body and in the Halls of this Congress, \nthere is very little discussion, if any, on what ought to be discussed \nat great length about the FAA--about equipment, about computers, about \nwhat is the state of stress, or lack of stress, for the people who are \nin our towers, whom both the Senator from Washington and I have \nvisited.\n  So we are trying to decide how best to proceed on FAA restructuring, \nand we have decided to try to get as much consensus from the Congress \nand industry and across the Nation as we can. Now, some believe we \nshould create an independent FAA, a privatized FAA. Some believe we \nshould privatize air traffic altogether. Some believe user fee funding \nis the key to improving efficiency. Some believe the FAA is slow and \ncumbersome because it is a Federal agency. And some believe they are \nkind of on the right track already, so why intervene--again, no \ncatastrophic actions.\n  In any event, despite the fact that we are not ready to enact--\nSenator Gorton and I--a so-called big-bang solution, in no way is there \nreason to do nothing. It is to take steps to make air traffic control \nnext year better than this year or next year for the FAA to be better \nthan this year. It is clear that the FAA needs interim reform and \ninterim direction and encouragement. So as the Senator indicated, we \nare offering a package of incremental reforms that will, in a sense, \nsend the FAA both the tools and the message to improve current \nmanagement and operation of the system without prejudging what the \nfinal long-term broad change might be.\n\n  The Air Traffic Improvement Act of 1999 is focused in two key areas, \nas my colleague discussed. The first is internal FAA management \nreforms, and the second is modernization of equipment and technology. \nBoth are enormously important. On the management side, the bill builds \non reforms enacted in 1996. It uses the management advisory committee, \nor MAC as it is called, which I will have to say the administration has \nnot set records in putting in place, i.e., they have not. But they have \nsaid they are going to send the nominations for it very soon and \ndesignate a subcommittee to advise and oversee air traffic control \nservices.\n  We create in this amendment a chief operating officer position, and \nthat is very important. There isn't any corporation of any size that \ndoesn't have\n\n[[Page S11856]]\n\nthat kind of person. You have the person who runs it, the CEO, and you \nmight have the chief financial officer, but you always have a chief \noperating officer. We don't. The FAA has 55,000 people for whom it is \nresponsible. That is a very large corporation. We believe that, \ntogether, the chief operating officer and the ATC Subcommittee will \nhave central responsibility for running and modernizing air traffic \ncontrol, developing a strategic plan, and implementing it.\n  I personally have enormous respect for the FAA and believe in and \ntrust in the judgment, instincts, and actions of our Administrator, \nJane Garvey. I think she is absolutely first class. I have spent a lot \nof time with her and talked a lot with her. She ran Boston airport. If \nyou run Boston airport, you know what you are doing. She knows what she \nis doing. She has a strategic way of thinking. She listens a lot. She \nis around the country visiting people a great deal. We are very lucky \nto have her. But putting together a budget for air traffic services is \nvery important and calls for a chief operating officer.\n  Having said that, let me say the Administrator will continue to \nalways have the final say and always the accountability for air \ntraffic. This is not a dilution of responsibility; it is simply making \nan organization more efficient, with no dilution of responsibility for \nthe Administrator. We have to make sure we can attract and maintain the \nhighest caliber leadership in our system. Again, I make the comparison \nto IBM or Dell Computer, which are very large corporations. Public \nservice does not pay very well.\n\n  Senator Gorton and I believe it is very important that we have the \nhighest caliber and that we retain the highest caliber leadership in \nrunning our system. That means including the possibility of a \nperformance bonus for the chief operating officer and for the FAA \nAdministrator at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation. \nThat is a very important point. Some people will say: Oh, that is going \nto be more salary.\n  Again, I remind you that there are 50,000 people, 2 million \npassengers, and all of these airplanes going all over the country. I \nhave a chart, which I will not hold up because I don't believe in \ndisplaying charts on the Senate floor. I never have, and I hope I never \ndo. But if I did, I would show you a chart which is basically the \nentire United States colored in red. The red is made up of very fine, \nlittle red lines, each one representing a flight. At a specific hour of \na specific day--if you pick, for example, 5 o'clock in the morning, I \nam not one who would eagerly seek the opportunity to fly at 5 o'clock \nin the morning, but there are many Americans who do--if you look even \nat the west coast, it is colored red. If you look at 8 o'clock in the \nmorning, you might as well forget anything in the country other than \nthe color red.\n  I raise the suspicion that they must have left out West Virginia \nbecause we don't have a lot of flights at 5 o'clock or 8 o'clock in \nWest Virginia. The point was made in clear logic that these are planes \nthat are flying over the State of West Virginia and perhaps the State \nof Maine in the process.\n  In any event, I believe in the idea, when you have a system that is \ncomplicated requiring that much technology, requiring that much \nefficiency, and requiring planning, that you get and you retain the \nbest people possible. That means, in my judgment, and in Senator \nGorton's judgment, the possibility of a performance bonus for the chief \noperating officer and the FAA Administrator.\n  The bill also makes clear that the Administrator should use her full \nauthority to make organizational changes to improve the efficiency of \nthe system and the effectiveness of the agency. That is kind of a bland \nsentence, but within it is a lot of power.\n  It is a little bit similar to HCFA. I have dealt now with I don't \nknow how many HCFA Administrators. But they all say: Just give me four \nor five good lieutenants and I will be able to control this agency. \nThey all failed because there are 4,000 health care experts in HCFA who \nlook upon each HCFA Administrator as somebody who is going to be there \nfor 2 years, and they are usually right; and be gone within 2 years, \nand they are usually right; that they will be there forever, and they \nare usually right. They know about health care. But they choose not to \nmake decisions rapidly or efficiently. That means the Administrator and \nthe chief operating officer, if we have one, need to have a lot more \nauthority in a sense to shake up the system.\n  Senator Gorton and I would encourage that because we think that \nefficiency within the system is tremendously important. We set \ndeadlines. We set milestones. We can't tell you right now in this \ncountry how much it costs for an airplane to fly from Boston, MA, to \nDallas, TX. Ask us that question. Ask the FAA that question. How much \ndoes it cost? What is the cost of that flight? Nobody can give you an \nanswer. That is inexcusable. This is one of the things that has to be \ndone. It is one of the things that the FAA desperately wants to be able \nto do. What does it cost to run the air traffic control system in order \nto allow that flight to take place? We need to know those answers so we \ncan allocate these costs fairly among users.\n\n  That is a very important principle. Not all airlines are the same. \nNot all airlines use the same approaches or have the same number of \npeople or charge the same. There are differences in what they pay. \nTheir obligations to the system, in terms of financial input, have to \nbe based upon what their costs are. Therefore, we need to know what \nthose costs are.\n  With respect to air traffic modernization, the bill calls for a \ncomprehensive review and design of our airspace on a nationwide basis. \nAre we using it effectively? Are there more creative ways of routing a \nplane safely? You can do that if you have new technology. They have the \ntechnology at Herndon, VA. But do they have it in all of the air \ntraffic control centers across this country? The answer is no, they \ndon't. Until they do, that is going to be hard.\n  But Senator Gorton and I have an obligation to push, to push the \nCongress and to push the Senate to want to focus on these problems: \none, to care about these problems; and, second, to do something about \nthis.\n  We have 29 million miles of national airspace. I don't know how many \ntimes that is around the world, but it is a lot. Twenty-nine million \nmiles of airspace is an incredible amount. It is divided into more than \n700 individually managed sectors. There are 25,000 of the 50,000 \nemployees that I mentioned who use 575 facilities that run these \nindividually managed sectors. And the air traffic control system \nmanages 55,000 flights and almost 2 million passengers every day. That \nis an enormous management problem. In fact, it is quite a lot more \ndifficult, I would think, than running Dell Computers or running IBM. \nYes, they are international operations. I am talking about their \nnational operations. There is so much more at stake. The life, the \nsafety, the economy, and the convenience of passengers is what is at \nstake. There is so much more at stake in arranging for the planes to be \nflown safely and properly.\n  Having said all of this, of course, I add on, as I always should, \nthat the capacity is going to double in the next decade. We are looking \nat an ever increasing problem. The FAA has already begun to redesign \nthe process. They are not sitting around. They are working hard. They \nhave established a dedicated airspace redesign office.\n  Thanks to Senator Lautenberg, they received $3 million last year to \nget started with the redesign work in the New York airspace. That in \nitself is a national service because it is far and away the most \ncongested airspace in the Nation. Is $3 million going to do that even \nfor the New York area? No, but again, it is a start. It is not the Big \nBang theory. But $3 million is enough to get going. Once you start \nmoving, then people start taking a little bit more notice.\n  We need a nationwide approach to this problem--not just in New York \nbut across the country--rather than doing it on a piecemeal basis, \nespecially since segmented thinking is considered by many, in fact, to \nbe a part of the problem; that we do things by chunks or segments of \nthe country rather than thinking of the country as a whole and how we \ncan best provide a safe air carrier service for people, for packages, \nfor letters, and the rest of it.\n  The amendment we have offered would do all of this. That makes me \nhappy. It makes me feel that it is a very good amendment.\n\n[[Page S11857]]\n\n  We direct the FAA to engage in comprehensive nationwide space \nredesign. We insist that there be industry and stakeholder input. \nStakeholder is not shareholder necessarily. Stakeholder means people \nwho ride on these airplanes. And we give them the resources they need \nto complete the work in a timely fashion.\n  To realize the full potential of an airspace redesign, we have to \nhave all of the advanced air traffic control equipment in place. Of \ncourse, we don't. We are very slow in that today, partly because of the \ntechnology development and procurement problems the FAA needs to fix \ninternally. We talk a lot with Jane Garvey about that. She is acutely \naware of that and has been working to change that. It is partly because \nof the vagaries of Congress; that is, the Federal budget process. We \nare impossible. We have been through so many extensions of a couple of \nmonths. It is like we are going out of our way to drive the whole \nprocess of this planning and the FAA crazy.\n  That is why Senator Gorton and I are so glad we have these 2 days, \nhopefully, to even discuss this. A month and a half ago I wouldn't have \nbet that we would even be able to take this up this year. And we \nare. That is a gift to the nation, I think.\n\n  If we can't bring it up, then the FAA obviously cannot make budget \nchanges. We are on our way. Our amendment puts in place what Senator \nGorton referred to earlier, a new financing mechanism. This is a \ncreative, good thing in this amendment. It is for more rapid purchase \nof sought-after air traffic control equipment. The amendment sets up a \npilot program to facilitate public-private joint ventures for the \npurpose of buying air traffic control equipment. It is not for profit. \nIt is the Air Traffic Modernization Association. It is a three-member \nexecutive panel representing the FAA, commercial carriers, and primary \nairports.\n  A lot of airports are very aggressive. I suspect there are several in \nthe State of Maine that want to get going and are being held up. Maybe \nthey have a little bit set aside. Perhaps they want to use some of \ntheir passenger service fee. Maybe they want to take 25 cents of that \nand leverage it into a rather large purchase for some air traffic \ncontrol equipment which, in their judgment, they need. This allows them \nto do that. Don't wait for the priority list to come to Bangor, ME, or \nCharleston, WV. If they have the gumption, they can save up or they can \nuse part of the passenger service fee, say, 25 cents of it, and \nleverage it and buy modern equipment and jump ahead of the pack. That \nis what this is about.\n  Obviously, the FAA will continue to oversee that process. This will \nnot be just a creative exercise by a few happy souls. All projects \nwould have to be part of the FAA's capital plan. There is a cap of $50 \nmillion in FAA funding per project. That is pretty good. Most won't use \nthat much. Sponsoring airports can use a portion of their passenger \nfacility charge to meet the commitment. I think that will be very \nimportant.\n  I am sure the Senator from Washington remembers, I got in great \ntrouble on this side of the aisle. I talked with Jane Garvey, Liddy \nDole, and others. They said they spent 25 percent of their time as FAA \nAdministrators working solely on concessionaire problems and \nnegotiation problems at Dulles and National. If that was an \nexaggeration, give them 5 percent. That is when I broke away from our \npack and said set up an independent, quasipublic-private authority and \nlet National and Dulles go to the bond market; they will certainly get \ntriple-A rating. They certainly did. We can see what happened to both \nairports. Dulles will have to do it all over again because they are so \nsuccessful.\n  That is what an airport needs to believe they can do. If an airline \nand its hub airport want new instrument landing equipment, six more \nprecision runway monitors, and aren't on the FAA's list for that \nequipment or are still years away on the funding schedule, maybe they \nwill decide to get together with the ATM Association on the proposal, \nthe FAA will put up seed money and the airports will do the same. They \ngo to the bond market, get financing for the whole project, and use 25 \ncents--the PFC charge--to pay for it over 5 or 10 years. That is a \ngreat idea.\n  I am excited about this approach as I am sure is obvious. We have \nonly heard positive feedback from all parties--the industry and the \nairport community. They say, given the change, they are ready to go if \nwe pass the amendment.\n  Finally, the Air Traffic Management Improvement Act also includes \nauthorization up to $100 million to speed up purchases and fielding of \nmodernization equipment and technologies. I am happy to note we have \ndropped that provision because of the agreement reached with the \nmajority--thank you to the majority--to increase authorization for FAA \nequipment and facilities by $500 million annually.\n\n  We are on the move if we pass this. Over time, we will have to spend \neven more of our Federal dollars on air traffic control and \nmodernization effort. I know we will be considering some ideas for \nsolving FAA's budgetary problems when we go to conference.\n  I--and I suspect I differ with my friend and colleague across the \naisle from me--am supportive of Congressman Shuster's idea of off-\nbudget. I don't think we can mess around with this situation; it is \nfraught with danger, and catastrophe is around the corner if we are not \nwilling to spend the money we need to spend. We did it with the highway \ntrust fund. We can put up a firewall, do it off-budget. There are ways \nto do it. A person can go to some of the air traffic control facilities \nand see what they are doing, see the stress under which they are \nworking. We have 2 million people in the air, and we want them to be \nsafe.\n  I am glad we are able to make a strong, tangible commitment to the \nneeds of the system. I think these problems are all shared. We all bear \nsome responsibility for them. We all need to step up to the plate to \nfix them. The FAA does a very commendable job with a very difficult \ntask. They have a terrific safety record to show for it. I don't want \nto press their luck, ours, or the system's. The system, as it stands \nnow, is not working as well as it could be or as it ought to be. We \ncan't wait to do something about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, we have now a unanimous consent \nagreement pursuant to which all amendments must be filed by 10 a.m. \ntomorrow. We appreciate the managers being apprised of those amendments \nto determine whether or not we can agree with some of them, unchanged \nor with modifications. We will probably go back to the fundamental \namendment on slots to which the Senator from Illinois has objected and \nto which at least one Senator from Virginia, if not other Senators, \nhave amendments to propose first thing tomorrow when we return to this \nbill.\n  If, however, there are amendments that can be agreed to relatively \nquickly, we may do that later on this evening after the votes at 5:30.\n  We will not debate either the Department of Transportation \nappropriations bill or nominations, so Members can come with amendments \nto this bill until 5:30 this afternoon. If they do, we will attempt to \ndeal with them. If they don't, we will begin tomorrow. I know the \nleadership and certainly the managers of the bill want to finish this \nbill some time tomorrow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 1893 \noffered by the Senator from Washington, Mr. Gorton, for himself, \nSenator Rockefeller, and others.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1898\n\n    (Purpose: To require the reporting of the reasons for delays or \n                     cancellations in air flights)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1898.\n\n\n[[Page S11858]]\n\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . REPORTING OF REASONS FOR DELAYS OR CANCELLATIONS IN \n                   AIR FLIGHTS.\n\n       In addition to the information required to be included in \n     each report filed with the Office of Airline Information of \n     the Department of Transportation under section 234.4 of title \n     14, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act), each air carrier subject to the \n     reporting requirement shall specify the reasons for delays or \n     cancellations in all air flights to and from all airports for \n     which the carrier provides service during the period covered \n     by the report.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I am offering today an amendment to \naddress what I believe is a complicated and growing problem for all \nAmericans--flight delays and flight cancellations.\n  The problem is not that delays and cancellations occur. Of course \nthey do. That is only natural. But with different weather conditions, \nand with the country as large and complicated as it is, and airlines \ntrying to maintain a tight schedule, it is only obvious that schedule \ncan sometimes be deeply affected--by weather or equipment problems--so \nwe must expect occasional delays and occasional cancellations.\n  Right now, it is always a mystery why these delays and cancellations \nhappen. We can guess. We can conjecture. Perhaps it is because of \nweather. Perhaps it is because of mechanical problems. Perhaps it is \nthe fault of air traffic controllers. There are lots of reasons. But \nnobody knows--at least the public does not know--precisely the reasons \nfor these delays and for these cancellations.\n  Why is that? It is very simple. The airlines do not have to tell you. \nThere is no requirement. So when you are stuck in an airport in the \nmiddle of the night, the airlines might let you know what is going on \nor they might not tell you. And after you finally reach your \ndestination there's a pretty good chance that you are never going to \nknow why it was you were stranded thousands of miles away from home, or \nwhy you missed that important business meeting. The airlines are not \nrequired to tell you the reasons for the delays and cancellations.\n  You are probably wondering: Why does this matter? If you are stuck, \nyou are stuck. So what is the big deal? What is the difference? The big \ndeal is that it does matter. It does make a difference, a great deal of \ndifference. Speed and efficiency are not only in the interest of the \nairline, they are also in the interest of all Americans in this modern \nsociety.\n  Time really is money. Flights are often canceled or delayed for \neconomic reasons, and not for mechanical or weather-related reasons. \nAnd when these economic delays or cancellations occur, it's usually \nrural America that gets the short end of the stick.\n  This is no secret. Domestic airlines sometimes have delays not only \nfor mechanical reasons, not only for reasons caused by air traffic \ncontrollers, not only for weather reasons, but for purely economic \nreasons. They do not want that plane to go because it is not filled up \nenough; it is not economical enough. The airlines do not have to tell \nyou that.\n  I have the headline of an article written by Christene Meyers from \nthe front page of the Billings Gazette last week. The headline reads: \n``Enduring Plane Misery, Montana Air Passengers Often Grounded by \nEconomics.''\n  Let me read you a hypothetical situation from the article, a \nsituation that is not so hypothetical and is happening with increasing \nfrequency:\n\n       You fly out of Los Angeles at 6:10 p.m., arriving at Salt \n     Lake City at 9 p.m., a minute earlier than estimated. You are \n     delighted and hurry to your gate, to catch the last flight to \n     Billings.\n\n  It happens all the time.\n\n       You watch, astonished, as the Billings plane is moved from \n     the gate. You're told that your flight is canceled. You're \n     told that your plane has a mechanical problem.\n\n  How often have we heard ``mechanical problems'' given to us by the \nairlines as the problem?\n\n       Further investigation discloses that the ``mechanical \n     problem'' business was untrue. Truth is your perfectly \n     functional plane was appropriated for a larger market. There \n     were fewer people going to Billings than going to San Diego. \n     You overnight from Salt Lake City and arrive the next day in \n     Billings--12\\1/2\\ hours late.\n\n  That is if you are lucky because very often the next plane is booked; \nthe next flight after that is booked; the next flight after that is \nbooked; the next flight after that is booked.\n\n  I am not giving you isolated instances; this happens often in \nMontana. Montana depends primarily on two major carriers. When a flight \nis canceled or excessively delayed, there are big consequences. That \nflight may have been your only chance to get in or out of Montana that \nday. Again, the plane is not there. It is canceled. You say: OK. Book \nme on the next flight the next day.\n  Sorry. It is all booked up. It is overbooked.\n  Book me on the next flight.\n  Sorry. Can't.\n  I have talked to people in my State who had to wait 4 days--4 days--\nat Salt Lake City waiting for the next available flight. The same \noccurs in Minneapolis. People tell me they are there with several other \npeople trying to get on a plane from Salt Lake City, and they say: \nWell, gee, why can't we just rent a car? Can Delta Airlines pay for the \ncar rental? We'll drive from Salt Lake City to our home in Bozeman.\n  No. Sorry. It is against airline policy to do that.\n  So people frequently have to take another flight to another city in \nMontana and then drive or make some other connection. That is not \nuncommon.\n  Further into this article, a Delta agent from Salt Lake states:\n\n       If we have 40 people waiting for a flight for Billings and \n     120 waiting to go to San Francisco, it's a no-brainer. . . . \n     It costs less for us to put 30 people up and send them on to \n     Billings than it does to send 100 California-bound people to \n     a hotel.\n\n  It is economics. That is wrong. That is not fair. That is not right. \nIf flights are canceled for economic reasons, passengers deserve to \nknow the truth. Let's not fool ourselves. This is not just an \ninconvenience for rural America; it is much more than an inconvenience. \nThere is also a very direct, strong economic impact.\n  As my home State of Montana, my neighbors in North and South Dakota \nand Wyoming and Idaho can attest, what business is going to relocate to \nan area where flight service is not reliable? It is a very basic \nquestion. There is a pretty obvious answer. Businesses around the \ncountry are going to think twice if reliable flight service cannot be \nguaranteed.\n  There are delays and cancellations in other parts of the country, but \nhere is the difference. In other parts of the country, in urban parts \nof the country, there are other flights, there are other airlines; not \nso for Montana, for the Dakotas, and for Wyoming. There are not that \nmany daily flights, and because the flights have less economic benefit, \nairlines often cancel flights for economic reasons; and it is not \nright.\n  Montana ranks near the bottom of per capita individual income right \nnow. I am not saying it is because of airlines, but I am saying it is a \nfactor which tends to discourage businesses from locating or expanding \nin Montana. How can we improve if we cannot guarantee a minimum \nstandard of quality air service? This is not just a matter of \ninconvenience; it is a matter of jobs. It is a matter of income.\n  My amendment simply requires that airlines provide all flight \ninformation that they currently report and specify the reason why these \nflights were delayed or canceled. Today, airlines must provide to the \nDepartment of Transportation on a monthly basis if an airline flight is \ndelayed, either on arrival or departure. They do not have to give the \nreasons. They have to disclose that fact.\n  So I am suggesting--not that they have to write a whole big book on \nthe reasons for the cancellations or the reasons for the delays--that \nthey just say why. What caused the cancellation? What caused the delay?\n  So in addition to the information shown on the left-hand side of this \nchart: the name of the airline; the flight number; the aircraft tail \nnumber; the origin and destination airport codes; and the date and day \nof week of flight--but that in addition--it can also indicate whether \nthe cancellation or delay was caused by air traffic control, caused by \nmechanical failure or\n\n[[Page S11859]]\n\ndifficulty, caused by an act of God, caused by weather, or caused by \neconomics.\n\n  It is a very simple amendment. It does not regulate airlines. It is \nnot imposing new regulations; it is just simply a matter of \ndisclosure--simply giving the reasons why an airline flight is delayed \nover 15 minutes or just outright canceled.\n  I realize that simply reporting the reasons for cancellations and \ndelays is not going to stop the practice of delaying and canceling \nflights for economic reasons because airlines are businesses. They may \nstill want to go ahead and cancel or delay a flight for economic \nreasons. But I do think the public has the right to know the reason for \nthe cancellation or the delay.\n  If airlines have to start reporting the reasons for missed \nconnections and disrupted lives, consumers will soon see that rural \nAmerica is grounded so that the rest of the country can go about its \nbusiness.\n  It may turn out that as a consequence there will be fewer \ncancellations for economic reasons. That is very much my hope, because \nfor many parts of the country, particularly rural America, the \nairlines' actions are having a disproportionately adverse effect in \nparts of the country that don't have as much airline service as other \nparts of the country.\n  That is my amendment.

Mr. President, it was on September 16 that Hurricane Floyd \ncrashed into the North Carolina coast dumping 20 inches of rain that \nresulted in devastating floods. The region of Eastern North Carolina \nmost affected was visited by another 4-6 inches of rain just a week \nlater, making an already catastrophic situation even worse.\n  So I noted with great interest when President Clinton paid a visit to \na group of elite international financiers at the annual World Bank and \nIMF meeting 13 days later (September 29) to make an important \nannouncement. It was there that he disclosed with great fanfare his \nproposal to forgive 100 percent of the debt owed by some 40 foreign \ncountries to the United States--and much of their debt owed indirectly \nto the U.S. through the World Bank and the IMF.\n  Thirteen days after Hurricane Floyd arrived, and when many \ncommunities in my state were still literally under water, President \nClinton decided it was appropriate to make the following plea on behalf \nof debt relief to foreign governments--he said: ``. . . I call on our \nCongress to respond to the moral and economic urgency of this issue, \nand see to it that America does its part. I have asked for the money \nand shown how it would be paid for, and I ask the Congress to keep our \ncountry shouldering its fair share of the responsibility.''\n  No wonder my constituents are puzzled as to why, in the words of John \nAustin of Tryon, North Carolina, ``we can help everyone else--but not \nour own people.'' North Carolinians understand instinctively that there \nis something odd about our national priorities when we have spent \nmore--$27.9 billion--on foreign aid in the past two years than the \n$27.7 billion FEMA has expended in the past ten years. That's right: \ngovernment aid through FEMA for such wide-ranging disasters as the \nNorthridge earthquakes in California, Hurricane Andrew in South Florida \nand the catastrophic Midwestern floods doesn't even measure up to the \npast two years of foreign aid.\n  Now, I have been in constant communication with the Majority Leader, \nthe Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, members on the other side \nof the aisle, and countless federal agencies seeking relief for \nthousands of North Carolinians who have been ruined by Hurricane Floyd. \nHelping these victims is the number one priority for those with whom I \nhave spoken. And for the record, I am gratified by their cooperation \nand their determination to help.\n  With respect to the President's plan to forgive the debts of foreign \ngovernments, I remind Senators that every one of the governments whose \ndebt the President proposes to forgive has no one to blame but \nthemselves for pursuing socialist and statist policies, and often \noutright theft, that drove them in a hole in the first place.\n  Just how much is being taken away from victims in my state to fund \nthe President's proposal? The Administration calculates that it will \ncost $320 million to forgive the $5.7 billion in mostly uncollectible \ndebts owed to the U.S. Additionally, Uncle Sam is being asked to \nunderwrite debt forgiveness to the World Bank and the IMF to the tune \nof $650 million.\n  That's a total of $970 million which North Carolina and \nother devastated regions desperately need, but will not get because \nmoney used to forgive the debts of foreigners is money that cannot and \nwill not be used to assist hurricane victims.\n\n  Bear in mind, Mr. President, that the United States has already \nprovided approximately $32.3 billion in foreign aid to just these \ncountries since the end of World War II. And the U.S. Government has \nalready provided $3.47 billion in debt forgiveness to these countries \nin the past several years alone.\n  If Senators study the list of countries, it turns out that the \nPresident seeks to reward governments who keep their people in economic \nand political bondage, and he proposes to do it at the expense of \nsuffering Americans. The human rights organization Freedom House \ndetermined that only eight of the 36 proposed beneficiaries are \n``free'' in terms of political expression. At least one on the World \nBank's list of countries eligible to receive debt forgiveness is a \nterrorist state, and that's\n\n[[Page S11860]]\n\nSudan. Also included are the communist dictatorships in Angola, Vietnam \nand the military dictatorship Burma.\n  The Heritage Foundation determined that none of the countries in \nquestion are ``free'' economically. (The economies of the vast majority \nof the countries judged are either ``repressed'' or ``mostly unfree'' \naccording to the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom.) Some \ncountries on the World Bank's list do not even have functioning \ngovernments, such as Somalia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.\n  Only one of 36 countries voted with the United States more than half \nof the time at the United Nations in 1998 (that is Honduras, which \nsupported the U.S. only 55 percent of the time). Make no mistake about \nit: this proposal diverts assistance from Hurricane Floyd victims to \ncorrupt, economically and politically repressed foreign countries--many \nof whom are not even friendly to the United States.\n  Mr. President, my office has received a steady stream of visitors and \nmail urging Congress to support the ``Jubilee 2000'' debt forgiveness \nplan, which now includes the President's proposal. It has been a well-\norchestrated lobbying campaign.\n  But since the day Hurricane Floyd slammed into the North Carolina \ncoast and dumped 20 inches of rain on the eastern third of my state, \nthe phone calls and mail from North Carolina in support of debt \nforgiveness to foreign governments has dried up. The reason is clear: \nwe have a natural disaster unlike any seen in 500 years here at home, \nand our duty is to help suffering Americans first.\n  Mr. President, I'm putting the Administration on notice here and now \nthat the first priority shall be helping victims of Hurricane Floyd. \nNot until sufficient resources are dedicated to this effort by the \nfederal government will I agree to Senate consideration of President \nClinton's debt forgiveness to foreign governments proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/04/senate-section/article/S11860-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I was fascinated when I saw in the \nWashington Post this Sunday the front-page headline reading: ``CIA \nUnable to Precisely Track Testing: Analysis of Russian Compliance with \nNuclear Treaty Hampered.''\n  The first paragraph of the story below that headline said it all:\n\n       In a new assessment of its capabilities, the Central \n     Intelligence Agency has concluded that it cannot monitor low-\n     level nuclear tests by Russia precisely enough to ensure \n     compliance with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. . . . \n     Twice last month the Russians carried out what might have \n     been nuclear explosions at its . . . testing site in the \n     Arctic. But the CIA found that data from its seismic sensors \n     and other monitoring equipment were insufficient to allow \n     analysts to reach a firm conclusion about the nature of \n     events, officials said. . . . \n\n  This surely was devastating news for a lot of people at the White \nHouse. Our nation's Central Intelligence Agency had come to the \nconclusion that it cannot verify compliance with the CTBT.\n  Mercy. I can just see them scurrying around.\n  But more amazing than this was the response of the White House spin \nmachine. I've seen a lot of strange things during my nearly 27 years in \nthe Senate, but this is the first time I have ever seen an \nadministration argue that America's inability to verify compliance with \na treaty was precisely the reason for the Senate to ratify the treaty. \nBack home that doesn't even make good nonsense.\n  Yet this is what the White House has been arguing all day today. This \nrevelation is good news for the CTBT's proponents, they say, because \nthe CTBT will now institute an entirely new verification system with \n300 monitoring stations around the world.\n  Madam President, I am not making this up. This is what the White \nHouse said.\n  I say to the President: What excuse will the White House give if and \nwhen they spend billions of dollars on a ``new verification system with \n300 monitoring stations around the world''--and the CTBT still can't be \nverified? Talk about a pig in a poke. Or a hundred excuse-makers still \non the spot!\n  If the Administration spokesman contends that the CTBT's proposed \n``International Monitoring System,'' or IMS, will be able to do what \nall the assets of the entire existing U.S. intelligence community \ncannot--i.e., verify compliance with this treaty--isn't it really just \na matter of their having been caught with their hands in the cookie \njar?\n  Let's examine their claim. The CTBT's International Monitoring System \nwas designed only to detect what are called ``fully-coupled'' nuclear \ntests. That is to say tests that are not shielded from the surrounding \ngeology.\n  But the proposed multibillion-dollar IMS cannot detect hidden tests--\nknown as ``de-coupled'' tests--in which a country tries to hide the \nnuclear explosion by conducting the test in an underground cavern or \nsome other structure that muffles the explosion.\n  ``Decoupling'' can reduce the detectable magnitude of a test by a \nfactor of 70.\n  In other words, countries can conduct a 60-kiloton nuclear test \nwithout being detected by this fanciful IMS apparatus, a last-minute \ncover up for the administration's having exaggerated a treaty that \nshould never have been sent to the U.S. Senate for approval in the \nfirst place.\n  Every country of concern to the U.S.--every one of them--is capable \nof decoupling its nuclear explosions. North Korea, China, and Russia \nwill all be able to conduct significant testing without detection by \nour country.\n  What about these 300 ``additional'' monitoring sites that the White \nHouse has brought for as a illusory argument in favor of the CTBT? They \nare fiction. The vast majority of those 300 sites already exist. They \nhave been United States monitoring stations all along--and the CIA \nnonetheless confesses that it cannot verify.\n  The additional sites called for under the treaty are in places like \nthe Cook Islands, the Central African Republic, Fiji, the Solomon \nIslands, the Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Niger, Paraguay, Bolivia, Botswana, \nCosta Rica, Samoa, etc. The majority of these will add zero, not one \nbenefit to the U.S. ability to monitor countries of concern. The fact \nis if U.S. intelligence cannot verify compliance with this treaty, no \nInternational Monitoring System set up under the CTBT will. This treaty \nis unverifiable, and dangerous to U.S. national security.\n  If this is the best the administration can do, they haven't much of a \ncase to make to the Senate--or anywhere else--in favor of the CTBT. The \nadministration is grasping at straws, looking for any argument--however \nincredible--to support an insupportable treaty.\n  We will let them try to make their case. As I demonstrated on the \nfloor last week, the Foreign Relations Committee has held 14 separate \nhearings in which the committee heard extensive testimony from both \nsides on the CTBT--113 pages of testimony, from a plethora of current \nand former officials. This is in addition to the extensive hearings \nthat have already been held by the Armed Services Committee and three \nhearings exclusively on the CTBT held by the Government Affairs \nCommittee.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold its final hearings \nthis Thursday to complete our examination of this treaty. We will \ninvite Secretary Albright to make her case for the treaty, and will \nhear testimony from a variety of former senior administration officials \nand arms control experts to present the case against the treaty.\n  I have also invited the chairman of the Senate Armed Service \nCommittee, Senator Warner, to present the findings of his distinguished \npanel's review of this fatally flawed treaty.\n  Finally, the facts are not on the administration's side. This is a \nill-conceived treaty which our own Central Intelligence Agency \nacknowledges that it cannot verify. Approving the CTBT would leave the \nAmerican people unsure of the safety and reliability of America's \nnuclear deterrent, while at the same time completely unprotected from \nballistic missile attack. That is a dangerous proposal, and I am \nconfident that the U.S. Senate will vote to reject this dangerous arms \ncontrol pact called the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/04/senate-section/article/S11861-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11861-S11862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11861]]\n     MEDICARE BENEFICIARY ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am speaking in support of the Medicare \nBeneficiary Access to Quality Health Care Act of 1999.\n  Congress faces historic choices in the next few weeks: managed care \nreform, campaign finance legislation, whether to increase the minimum \nwage, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But the problem is, Congress is \nlong on disagreement and short on time. In all my years of Congress, I \nhave scarcely seen a more partisan and divisive atmosphere than that \nwhich prevails today.\n  One area where Congress appeared ready to act this year is in \naddressing changes to the Balanced Budget Act, otherwise known as BBA, \nof 1997. I am disappointed that we have not yet done so. Rural States \nsuch as Montana have long battled to preserve access to quality health \ncare. I daresay that the State so ably served by the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins, is in somewhat the same condition.\n  By and large, and against the odds, it is a battle we have generally \nwon. Through initiatives such as the Medical Assistance Facility and \nthe Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant Program, Montana and other \nrelatively thinly populated States have providers who have worked \ndiligently to give Medicare beneficiaries quality health care, but now \nthese providers face a new challenge--the impact of BBA Medicare cuts.\n  From home health to nursing homes, hospital care to hospice, Montana \nfacilities stand to take great losses as a result of the BBA. Many \nalready have. One hospital writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Baucus:\n       The BBA of 1997 is wreaking havoc on the operations of \n     hospitals in Montana. Our numbers are testimony to this. The \n     reduction in reimbursements of $500,000 to $650,000 per year \n     is something our facility cannot absorb.\n\n  Another tells me:\n\n       Senator Baucus: An early analysis of the negative impact to \n     [my] hospital projects a decrease in reimbursements amounting \n     to an estimated $171,200. My hospital is already losing money \n     from operations and these anticipated decreases in \n     reimbursements will cause a further immediate operating loss. \n     If enacted and implemented, I predict that we will have no \n     choice but to reduce or phase out completely certain services \n     and programs. . . .\n\n  Home health agencies report to me that in a recent survey, 80 percent \nof Montana home health care agencies showed a decline in visits \naveraging 40 percent. Let me state that again. Of the home health care \nagencies in my State, 80 percent report a decline in visits averaging \n40 percent. These are some of the most efficient home health care \nagencies in the Nation. It simply is not fair that they are punished \nfor being good at managing costs.\n  As for skilled nursing care in Montana, I saw the effects firsthand \nin a visit to Sidney Health Center in the northeast corner of my State. \nA couple of months ago, I had a workday at Sidney. About every month, \nevery 6 weeks, I show up at someplace in my home State with my sack \nlunch. I am there to work all day long. I wait tables. I work in \nsawmills. I work in mines--some different job. This time it was working \nat a hospital. Half of it is a skilled nursing home; the other half an \nacute care center.\n  At the skilled nursing center, I changed sheets. I took vitals. I \nworked charts. They even had me take out a few stitches. After a while, \nI felt as if I was a real-life doctor doing my rounds with my \nstethoscope casually draped around my neck. One patient actually \nthought I was in medical training; that is, until I treated that \npatient. They also had me read to about 20 old folks for about a half \nhour. I must confess that all but five immediately fell asleep.\n\n  At the end of the day, I had to turn my stethoscope in for a session \nwith the administrators. The financial folks showed me trends in \nMedicare reimbursement over the last couple of years. They believe as I \ndo, that the BBA cuts have gone too far.\n  So what do we do about it? Over the next few weeks, the Senate \nFinance Committee is likely to consider legislation to restore some of \nthe funding cuts for BBA. Anticipating this debate, I introduced \ncomprehensive rural health legislation earlier this year. The bill now \nhas over 30 bipartisan Senate cosponsors.\n  Last week, I joined Senator Daschle and the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, as well as Senator Rockefeller, in \nsupport of a comprehensive Balanced Budget Act fix, a remedy to try to \nundo some of the problems we caused. The Medicare Beneficiary Access to \nQuality Health Care Act addresses problems the BBA has caused in \nnursing home care, in home health care, among hospitals and also \nphysical therapy, as well as some other areas. In particular, I draw my \ncolleagues' attention to section 101 of the bill.\n  Medicare currently pays hospital outpatient departments for their \nreasonable costs. To encourage efficiency, however, the BBA called for \na system of fixed, limited payments for outpatient departments. This is \ncalled the outpatient prospective payment system, known as PPS. Thus \nfar, it appears this PPS will have a very negative impact on small \nrural hospitals. HCFA estimates--the Health Care Financing \nAdministration--that under this law, Medicare outpatient payments would \nbe cut by over 10 percent for small rural hospitals. I don't have the \nchart here, but hopefully it is coming later. If you look at the chart, \nyou will see some of the projected impacts on hospitals in my State.\n  Prospective payment is the system of the future, and Congress is \nright to use it where it works. But in some cases, prospective payment \njust doesn't work. Consider what happened with inpatient prospective \npayment about 15 years ago. In 1983, Congress felt, much as it does \nnow, that Medicare reimbursements needed to be held in check. It \nimplemented prospective payment for inpatient services. Enacting that \nlaw, it also recognized that for some small, rural facilities, there \nshould be exceptions to prospective payment.\n  The basic reason is simple, because prospective payment is based upon \nthe assumption that the efficient hospitals will do well and survive, \nand the nearby inefficient hospitals not doing well will fail, but that \nis OK because people can always go to the surviving efficient hospital. \nAnd the assumption, obviously, is invalid for sparsely populated parts \nof America because if there is a hospital in a sparsely populated part \nof America that fails under undue pressure because of reimbursement, \nthere is no other hospital or health care facility for somebody in \nrural America. That is the essential failing in the assumption behind \nPPS.\n  Congress called these facilities ``sole community hospitals,'' and 42 \nof the 55 hospitals in my State enjoy that status--that is, the \nsecurity of being named a sole community provider or medical assistance \nfacility.\n  Section 101 of the bill we introduced last week would provide similar \nsecurity for outpatient services, and it should be enacted right now.\n  Just last week, the health care research firm, HCIA, and the \nconsulting firm, Ernst and Young, released a study showing that \nhospital profit margins could fall from their current levels of about 4 \npercent to below zero by the year 2002. We must act now to ensure that \nthis does not happen.\n  I might say, however, time is running out. We are already in the \nmidst of a 3-week stopgap measure to keep the Government running. If we \ndon't sit down and iron out our differences soon, we risk going home \nnot having acted on the BBA and not correcting this problem, which I \nthink is irresponsible.\n  Despite the partisan atmosphere that has prevailed here over the last \nseveral months, Congress does have a record of success in dealing with \nimportant health care issues in a bipartisan way.\n  A few years ago, we passed the Health Insurance Portability Act to \nprevent people from losing health insurance when they change jobs.\n  In 1997, we worked together--Members of all stripes--in passing the \nChildren's Health Insurance Plan, legislation to provide children of \nworking families with health insurance. Just last week, children in my \nState started enrollment in that program.\n  With some common sense on both sides of the aisle and with fast \naction on the issue, Congress can come together to solve some of the \nproblems caused by the so-called BBA of 1997. We ought to do so, and we \nought to do it right now.\n  Mr. President, you might be interested in what some of the conditions \nof\n\n[[Page S11862]]\n\nthe BBA 1997 are in the State of the Presiding Officer. In Maine, the \nhospital in Bangor would lose 24 percent of payments it would otherwise \nreceive. Booth Bay Harbor would find about a 38-percent reduction. That \nis somewhat typical of hospitals of that size and in that situation \naround the country.\n  So I hope that at the appropriate time we can work with dispatch and \nexpeditiously solve this problem before we adjourn.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Medicare \nBeneficiary Access to Care Act.\n  I have traveled around my State of Michigan and I have heard from all \ntypes of health care providers. I consistently hear one message: all \nhealth care providers, big and small, are reeling from the cuts \nmandated under the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA).\n  When Congress passed the BBA, it was estimated that it would save \n$112 billion in Medicare expenditures. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas reestimated those savings at $206 billion. It is clear that the BBA \nhas gone further than we intended.\n  This bill addresses some of the problems the health care community is \nfacing. The bill provides some measure of relief to providers by \ncommitting $20 billion dollars towards addressing some of the BBA \nproblems.\n  Here are some of the bill's provisions:\n  Medicare currently pays hospital outpatient departments for their \nreasonable costs, subject to some limits and fee schedules. To create \nincentives for efficient care, the BBA included a prospective payment \nsystem (PPS) for hospital outpatient departments. HCFA expects to \nimplement this system in July 2000. When implemented, it is expected to \nreduce hospital outpatient revenues by 5.7 percent on average. Michigan \nhospitals have told me that this payment system will reduce annual \nhospital payments for out patient services by $43 million for Michigan \nhospitals.\n  This bill would protect all hospitals from extraordinary losses \nduring a transition period. Each hospital would compare its payments \nunder the PPS to a proxy for what the hospital would have been paid \nunder cost-based reimbursement. In the first year, no hospital could \nlose more than 5% under the new system. This percentage would increase \nto 10% in the second year and 15% in the third year.\n  Prior to the BBA, a hospital's inpatient payments increased by 7.7% \nif the hospital had one intern or resident for every 10 beds. This \npercentage was cut to 7.0% in 1998, and phased down to be set \npermanently at 5.5% by 2001. This bill freezes Indirect Medical \nEducation (IME) payments at the current level of 6.5% for 8 years.\n  Due to concern that Medicare+Choice managed care plans were not \npassing along payments for Graduate Medical Education (GME) to teaching \nhospitals, the BBA carved out payments for GME and IME from Medicare + \nChoice rates and directed them to those hospitals. However, the carve \nout was phased in over several years. This bill contains a provision \nthat would speed up the carve-out, ensuring that teaching hospitals get \nadequate compensation for the patients they serve.\n  Teaching hospitals are critically important to Michigan. There are 58 \nteaching hospitals in Michigan, which constitutes one of the nation's \nlargest GME programs.\n  The BBA reduced disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments by 1% \nin 1998, 2% in 1999, 3% in 2000, 4% in 2001, and 5% in 2002. This bill \nwould freeze the cut in disproportionate share payments at 2% for 2000 \nthrough 2002.\n  The BBA created a prospective payment system (PPS) for skilled \nnursing facilities. There has been a concern that the PPS may not \nadequately account for the costs of high acuity patients. This bill \nincludes a number of provisions to alleviate the problems facing \nskilled nursing facilities. Importantly, this bill repeals the \narbitrary $1500 therapy cap that was mandated under the BBA.\n  The BBA mandated a 15% cut to home health payments. Last year \nCongress delayed this cut to October 2000. Our bill would further delay \nthis 15% cut for two years. In addition, our bill creates an outlier \npolicy to protect agencies who serve high cost beneficiaries.\n  The BBA phased out cost based Medicaid reimbursement for rural health \nclinics and federally qualified health centers but did not replace it \nwith anything to assure that these clinics would be adequately funded. \nOur bill creates a new system for clinic payments.\n  In summary, these provisions are vitally important to the health care \ncommunity of Michigan, both providers and beneficiaries. We cannot \nafford to allow our health care system, the best in the world, to \ndecline.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/04/senate-section/article/S11862-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11862-S11867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                        2000--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (H.R. 2084) making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2084) have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 30, 1999.)\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate has the \nopportunity to consider the conference agreement for the Fiscal Year \n2000 Transportation Appropriations bill, and expect that we will \nreinforce the Senate's strong support for this legislation, which was \npassed just 18 days ago by a vote of 95 to 0.\n  The Transportation Appropriations bill provides more than $50 billion \nfor transportation infrastructure funding, and for safe travel and \ntransportation in the air and on our nation's highways, railroads, \ncoasts and rivers. I am pleased that we have reached an accommodation \nbetween the House and the Senate Conferees on the Transportation \nappropriations bill. The House didn't win on every issue, the Senate \ndidn't win on every issue, the Administration didn't get everything \nthat they wanted--there was a fair amount of give and take on the part \nof all interested parties and I am confident that the result is a \nbalanced package that is responsive to the priorities of the Congress \nand of the administration.\n  The 302(b) allocation was tight and constrained our ability to do \nsome things that I would have liked to do-- but we have stayed within \nthe allocation agreed to by the House and the Senate and we have a bill \nthat the Administration will sign. I believe this bill represents a \nbalanced approach and a model for how appropriations bills should be \nconstructed. It stays within the allocation, it stays pretty close to \nthe budget request with the exception of denying new user fee taxes and \nmaking some firewall shifts that the authorizing committee objected to, \nit adheres to the commitment made in TEA-21 on dedicated funding for \nHighways and Transit, it provides adequate--but constrained--levels for \nFAA, it maintains a credible Coast Guard capital base and operational \ntempo, and it continues to focus on making further strides in \nincreasing the safety of all our transportation systems.\n  At the same time, Chairman Wolf, Ranking Member Sabo, the senior \nSenator from New Jersey and I have gone to great lengths to craft a \nbill that accommodates the requests of members and funds their \npriorities. Scarcely a day passes where one member or another does not \ncall, write, or collar me on the floor to advocate for a project, a \nprogram, or a particular transportation priority for their state. I \nreceived over 1,500 separate Senate requests in letter form over the \nlast six months. This bill attempts to respond to as many of those \nrequests as possible.\n  As many of you know, the current fiscal constraints were especially \nfelt in the transit account, where demand for mass transit systems is \ngrowing in every state, but funding is fixed by the TEA-21 firewall. I \nwon't belabor that point other than to say we did the best we could \nunder very difficult circumstances.\n\n[[Page S11863]]\n\n  It has been a constant challenge this year to ensure adequate funding \nfor FAA operations, facilities, equipment and research, and for the \nAirport Improvement Program; for the Coast Guard operations and capital \naccounts; and for operating funds for the National Highway \nTransportation Safety Administration. This clearly illustrates the \npitfalls of firewalls and the disadvantages of trying to manage annual \noutlays in multi-year authorization legislation. Our experience this \nyear with this bill is one of many reasons the Congress should reject a \nproposal to establish more budgetary firewalls around trust fund \naccounts in the future.\n\n  I want to mention one other issue that has been the topic of many \nconversations over the past couple of weeks. That is, the Senate \nprovision concerning the release of personal information by state \ndepartments of motor vehicles. My concern is that private information \nis too available. The proliferation of information over the Internet \nmakes it easy and cheap for almost anyone to access very personal \ninformation.\n  I think members would be shocked by what virtually anyone--including \nwierdos or stalkers--can find out about you, your wife, or your \nchildren with only a rudimentary knowledge of how to search the \nInternet.\n  I believe that there should be a presumption that personal \ninformation will be kept confidential, unless there is compelling state \nneed to disclose that information. Most states, however, readily make \nthis information available, and because states sell this information, a \nlot of information about you effectively comes from public records.\n  Section 350 of the conference protects personal information from \nbroad distribution by requiring express consent prior to the release of \ninformation in two situations. First, individuals must give their \nconsent before a state is able to release photographs, social security \nnumbers, and medical or disability information. Of course, this \nexcludes law enforcement and others acting on behalf of the government. \nSecond, individuals must give their consent before the state can sell \nor release other personal information when that information is \ndisseminated for the purpose of direct marketing or solicitations. I \nwant to be clear: this applies only when the state sells your name, \naddress, and other such information to people who are using that \ninformation for marketing purposes.\n  We recognize that states may need time to comply with this provision. \nAnd we've proposed to delay the effective date 9 months. In addition, \nthere was concern expressed about this provision being tied to \ntransportation funds under this bill, and the conference agreement \neliminates the sanction language and expressly states that no states' \nfund may be withheld because of non-compliance with this provision. In \naddition, the Congressional Budget Office has performed a cost estimate \nanalysis of this provision, and found that the total implementation \ncost for States is well below $50 million nationally.\n  I believe that the general public would be as shocked as my \ncolleagues in the Senate if they learned that states were running a \nbusiness with the personal information from motor vehicle records.\n  There are a few people I would particularly like to thank before we \nvote. My Ranking Member, Senator Lautenberg, has been a valued partner \nin this process, and I'm sorry that we only have one more year to do \nthis together. Senators Stevens and Byrd have provided guidance \nthroughout the year, and made a successful bill possible by ensuring an \nadequate allocation for transportation programs. My House counterpart, \nCongressman Frank Wolf and his staff: John Blazey, Rich Efford, \nStephanie Gupta and Linda Muir, have been professional, accommodating, \nand collegial. This last week has been a blueprint for how conference \nnegotiations should be conducted. Senator Lott and his staff have been \ngracious and extremely helpful in moving this legislation forward. And \non the Appropriations Committee staff, I want to recognize Steve \nCortese and Jay Kimmitt for their invaluable assistance and advice.\n  I look forward to passing this bill and sending it to the President. \nI ask unanimous consent that the letter from OMB relating to this \nconference report be printed in the Congressional Record at the end of \nmy remarks and after the table regarding federal highway aid. From the \nOMB letter, it is my expectation that the President will sign the bill \nin its current form.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to include the following \ntable for the Record which shows the estimated fiscal year 2000 \ndistribution of Federal highway fund obligational authority. This table \nillustrates the state-by-state distribution of non-discretionary \nhighway funds under the conference agreement. It is important to note \nthat none of the discretionary programs, including public lands \nhighways, Indian reservation roads, park roads and parkways, or \ndiscretionary bridge are included in this distribution, as these funds \nare granted on an individual application basis. In addition, these \nfigures do not include the carryover balances from prior years, the \nfinal computation of administrative takedown, or the final minimum \nguarantee adjustments. However, these figures are very close to the \nactual state distribution that will be made by the Federal Highway \nAdministration based on the agreement outlined in the conference \nreport.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION--ESTIMATED FY 2000 DISTRIBUTION OF

             Washington, DC, September 29, 1999.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation and Related \n         Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, United States \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The purpose of this letter is to provide \n     the Administration's views on the Transportation and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 2000, as passed by the House \n     and by the Senate. As the conferees develop a final version \n     of the bill, we ask you to consider the Administration's \n     views.\n       The Administration appreciates the House and Senate's \n     efforts to accommodate many of the Administration's \n     priorities within their 302(b) allocations and the difficult \n     choices made necessary by those allocations. However, the \n     allocations of discretionary resources available under the \n     Congressional Budget Resolution are simply inadequate to make \n     the necessary investments that our citizens need and expect.\n       The President's FY 2000 Budget proposes levels of \n     discretionary spending that meet such needs while conforming \n     to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings \n     proposals in mandatory and other programs available to help \n     finance this spending. Congress has approved and the \n     President has signed into law nearly $29 billion of such \n     offsets in appropriations legislation since 1995. The \n     Administration urges the Congress to consider other, similar \n     proposals as the FY 2000 appropriations process moves \n     forward. With respect to this bill in particular, the \n     Administration urges the Congress to consider the President's \n     proposals for user fees.\n       Both the House and Senate versions of the bill raise \n     serious funding concerns. First, both versions of the bill \n     underfund the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) \n     operations and modernization programs, reduce highway and \n     motor carrier safety, and underfund other important programs. \n     The conferees could partially accommodate the funding \n     increases recommended below for these programs by adhering \n     more closely to the President's requests for the Airport \n     Improvement Program, High Speed Rail, Coast Guard Alteration \n     of Bridges, Coast Guard capital improvements, and other \n     programs.\n       In addition, both the House and Senate have reduced \n     requested funding for important safety, mobility, and \n     environmental requirements. The Administration proposes to \n     meet these requirements through the reallocation of a portion \n     of the increased spending resulting from higher-than-\n     anticipated highway excise tax revenues. Under this proposal, \n     every State would still receive at least as much funding as \n     was assumed when the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \n     Century was enacted. The conferees are encouraged to consider \n     the Administration's proposal as a means to fund these \n     important priorities.\n       The Administration's specific concerns with both the House \n     and Senate versions of the bill are discussed below.\n\n\n                   aviation safety and modernization\n\n       The funding provided by the House and the Senate is not \n     sufficient to meet the rising demand for air traffic \n     services.\n  The Administration strongly urges the conferees to fully fund the \nPresident's request for FAA Operations. The request consists of $5,958 \nmillion to maintain current operations and $81 million to meet \nincreased air traffic and safety demands. Neither bill provides \nsufficient resources to maintain current service levels, let alone meet \nincreased demands.\n       The Administration urges the conferees to provide at least \n     the House level for the FAA's Facilities and Equipment \n     account. The Senate reduction, including the rescission, \n     would seriously compromise the FAA's ability to modernize the \n     air traffic control system. At the Senate level, safety and \n     security projects would be delayed or canceled, and \n     critically-needed capacity enhancing projects would be \n     postponed, increasing future air travel delays. In addition, \n     the conferees are urged to provide the requested $17 million \n     in critically-needed funds for implementation of a Global \n     Positioning System (GPS) modernization plan to help enable \n     transition to a more efficient, GPS-based air navigation \n     system. This is a top priority, and the conferees are asked \n     to fund this in addition to the FAA's other capital needs.\n       The Administration supports the decision, in both Houses, \n     to eliminate the General Fund subsidy for FAA Operations and \n     urges the conferees to enact the Administration's proposal to \n     finance the agency. Such a system would improve the FAA's \n     efficiency and effectiveness by creating new incentives for \n     it to operate in a business-like manner.\n\n\n                             cafe standards\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes, and urges the \n     conferees to drop, the House bill's prohibition of work on \n     the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. These \n     standards have resulted in a doubling of the fuel economy of \n     the car fleet, saving the Nation billions of gallons of oil \n     and the consumer billions of dollars. Because prohibitions \n     such as this have been enacted in recent years, the \n     Department of Transportation has been unable to analyze this \n     important issue fully. These prohibitions have limited the \n     availability of important information that directly \n     influences the Nation's environment.\n\n\n                          livability programs\n\n       The Administration is very disappointed that both versions \n     of the bill fund transit formula grants at $212 million below \n     the President's request and the Transportation and Community \n     and Preservation Pilot Program at approximately $24 million \n     below the request. Further, the Administration is \n     disappointed that the House bill does not direct additional \n     funding to the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \n     Improvement program. These programs are important components \n     of the Administration's efforts to provide communities with \n     the tools and resources needed to combat congestion, air \n     pollution and sprawl. The Administration also objects to the \n     addition of unrequested and unreviewed projects within the \n     Transportation and Community and Privatization Pilot Program \n     formula grants. The conferees are strongly urged to fully \n     fund the President's request for these programs.\n\n\n                             highway safety\n\n       The Administration urges the conferees to provide funding \n     consistent with the recently enacted reauthorization for the \n     National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's operations \n     and research activities. This would provide an increase of \n     $20 million above the House and Senate funding levels. This \n     funding would allow expanded Buckle Up America and Partners \n     in Progress efforts to meet alcohol and belt usage goals. It \n     would also provide enhanced crash data collection, increased \n     defects investigations, and crucial research activities on \n     advanced air bags, crashworthiness, and enhanced testing to \n     make better car safety information more readily available to \n     the public.\n\n\n                          motor carrier safety\n\n       The Administration appreciates the Senate bill's funding of \n     $155 million, the amended request, for the National Motor \n     Carrier Safety Grant Program. This will allow the Office of \n     Motor Carrier and Highway Safety to undertake improvements in \n     the area of motor carrier enforcement, research, and data \n     collection activities that are designed to increase safety on \n     our Nation's roads and highways. The Administration strongly \n     urges the conferees to continue to provide this funding as \n     well as the additional $5.8 million requested for motor \n     carrier operations.\n\n[[Page S11865]]\n\n                     job access and reverse commute\n\n       The Administration is disappointed that both the House and \n     Senate would provide only $75 million--half of the amount \n     authorized and requested--for the Job Access and Reverse \n     Commute program. This program is a critical component of the \n     Administration's welfare-to-work effort and local demands far \n     exceed available resources. Demand is expected to increase \n     further as more communities around the country work together \n     to address the transportation challenges faced by families \n     moving from welfare to work and by other low income workers. \n     The Administration urges the conferees to provide full \n     funding at $150 million.\n\n\n                        office of the secretary\n\n       The Administration urges the conferees to provide the \n     President's request of $63 million for the Office of the \n     Secretary in a consolidated account and delete the limitation \n     on political appointees in both bills. This is necessary to \n     provide the Secretary with the resources and flexibility to \n     manage the Department effectively. In addition, we request \n     restoration of the seven-percent reduction to the Office of \n     Civil Rights contained in the Senate version of the bill. \n     This reduction would hamper the Department's ability to \n     enforce laws prohibiting discrimination in Federally operated \n     and assisted transportation programs.\n\n\n                          language provisions\n\n       The conferees are requested to delete provisions in both \n     bills that would restrict the Coast Guard's and Federal \n     Aviation Administration's user fee authority. User fees can \n     help the Coast Guard and Federal Aviation Administration by \n     providing resources to meet their operating and capital needs \n     without significantly reducing other vital transportation \n     programs.\n       The conferees are requested to delete provisions in both \n     versions of the bill that would impose DOT-wide reductions in \n     obligations to the Transportation Administrative Service \n     Center. These reductions, which are particularly severe in \n     the Senate, would impose significant constraints on critical \n     administrative programs.\n       The conferees are requested to delete Section 316 of the \n     Senate bill, which would extend the traditional anti-lobbying \n     provision in DOT appropriations acts to State legislatures. \n     This broad, ambiguous provision would chill the informational \n     activities of the Department and limit the ability of the \n     Department to carry out its safety mandate. The existing \n     requirements of Section 7104 of TEA-21 adequately address \n     this issue.\n       There are several provisions in both bills that purport to \n     require congressional approval before Executive Branch \n     execution of aspects of the bill. The Administration will \n     interpret such provisions to require notification only, since \n     any other interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court \n     ruling in INS versus Chadha.\n\n\n                         report language issue\n\n       The Administration is concerned with the House report \n     language that would not fund the controller-in-charge \n     differential, which was part of the carefully crafted air \n     traffic controller agreement research last year.\n       We look forward to working with the Committee to address \n     our mutual concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Jacob J. Lew, Director.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 2084, the Transportation appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2000.\n  I am pleased that during this, the first day of the first full week \nof the new fiscal year, we are sending a free-standing Transportation \nbill to the President for his signature. Earlier this year I would not \nhave predicted that we would succeed in getting a free-standing \nTransportation bill. Credit for his successful accomplishment belongs \nprimarily to our subcommittee chairman, Senator Shelby. This bill has \nhad a number of difficulties along the way--difficulties that sometimes \ndivided Senator Shelby and myself. But I think it is fair to say that \nthroughout the year, both Senator Shelby and I showed a willingness to \nlisten, as well as a willingness to compromise. As such, many of the \nproblems that burdened this bill earlier this year have been worked out \nover time.\n  Senator Shelby consulted the Minority throughout this year's process. \nWe may not have agreed on every figure and every policy contained in \nthis bill, but there were never any surprises. His door was always open \nto me and to the other minority members of the subcommittee. I \nespecially want to thank Senator Shelby for his attention to the unique \ntransportation needs of my home state of New Jersey, the most congested \nstate in the nation. Our congestion problem makes New Jersey the most \ntransit-dependent state in the nation and Senator Shelby recognized \nthis fact by working with me to provide substantial investments in \nprojects like the Hudson-Bergen waterfront, the Newark-Elizabeth rail \nlink, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, the West Trenton line, and a \nfeasibility study of a new transit tunnel under the Hudson River.\n  The Transportation Subcommittee faced a very tight allocation. These \nfunding difficulties were made more challenging by the spending \nincreases mandated for the Federal Highway Administration and the \nFederal Transit Administration under TEA-21. These mandated increases \nput extraordinary pressure on the non-protected programs in the Coast \nGuard, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration.\n  The funding level provided for Amtrak represents the largest single \ncut in this bill below the fiscal year 1999 level. Amtrak is funded at \na level fully 6 percent below last year's level. It is to Amtrak's \ncredit, however, that Amtrak's financial turn-around has generated the \nkind of revenue that will allow the corporation to absorb this cut \nwithout any notable service reductions.\n  Funding for the operations budget within the Federal Aviation \nAdministration is another area of concern. While this bill funds FAA \nOperations at a level fully 6 percent above last year's level, the \namount provided remains 2.3 percent below the level requested by the  \nAdministration. Also, funding for highway safety within the operations \nand research account in the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration is 19 percent below the President's request. In this \ninstance, the Administration's budget request depended upon the \nenactment of a new authorization bill raising the authorization \nceilings for NHTSA. Unfortunately, by the time that authorization bill \nwas enacted, our subcommittee ceiling had already been established and \nwe did not have the funding to accommodate these funding increases for \nNHTSA. Mr. President, if I could identify one serious flaw with the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), it would be \nthe fact that several trust funded programs for highway construction \nare granted guaranteed increases over the next several years, while the \nsafety programs from the trust fund are not granted similarly \nprivileged budgetary treatment. We need to do better for these critical \nsafety programs, both in the FAA and in NHTSA. I have not given up on \nthe chance to do better for these programs. I intend to work with the \nAdministration to see if additional funds can be included in an omnibus \nappropriations bill or, perhaps, in a Supplemental Appropriations bill.\n\n  In the area of truck safety, I am disappointed that this bill does \nnot include the $50 million that I added during full committee markup \nfor grants within the Office of Motor Carrier Safety. The tight funding \nallocation burdening the subcommittee just made it impossible to \naccommodate this item in Conference. However, I have to say that while \nmoney is important to our efforts to maintain truck and bus safety, \nguts and determination on the part of the Administration is of even \ngreater importance. The Office of Motor Carrier Safety needs to be \nwilling to shut down the most egregious safety violators to protect bus \npassengers and the motoring public.\n  There have been several hearings regarding the deficiencies of the \nOffice of Motor Carriers this year. Within the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, we spent considerable time discussing the \nrecent series of fatal bus crashes within New Jersey. The Commerce \nCommittee also held hearings on the overall deficiencies with the OMC. \nThose hearings painted a very dismal picture of a largely impotent \nagency that is more interested in outreach than in ensuring safe truck \nand bus operations. More recently, we have seen indications of a new, \nmore serious attitude at the Office of Motor Carrier Safety. This \nappropriations bill mandates that that office can no longer be operated \nwithin the Federal Highway Administration. Perhaps this will make a \ndifference. In my view, the jury is still out on whether we have turned \nthe corner on improving truck and bus safety. Over the course of the \nnext year, we will need to review carefully whether the changes \nrecently announced by the Office of Motor Carriers represent a true \nchange in attitude or just a change in rhetoric.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I encourage all Members to vote in favor \nof this\n\n[[Page S11866]]\n\nconference report. The conference agreement is a balanced and \nbipartisan effort to meet the needs of our nation's transportation \nenterprise within a difficult funding envelope. I believe it deserves \nthe support of all Members.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 5:30 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will now proceed to vote on the \nadoption of the conference report accompanying H.R. 2084.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I commend Senators Shelby and Lautenberg \nfor this bill. It is really a monstrous bill, and they have come back \nwith a very good compromise, a bill with which we can all live.\n  The staff on this bill deserves a great deal of credit, too. To my \nright is Wally Burnett, staff director of the Transportation \nSubcommittee for the Senate. He handles the highway and aviation \naccounts. Wally tops at 205 pounds now, but we call him Little Wally in \nFairbanks. I thank him and Joyce Rose, who handles the railroad and \ntransit accounts. She spent a lot of time away from her young kids. \nPaul Doerrer handled the Coast Guard and NTSB accounts. He did a great \njob on his first bill. I also thank Peter Rogoff and Carole Geagley of \nthe minority. They have worked very hard on this bill. As I said, it is \nan extremely good bill.\n  I want to mention two items related to this bill. We do have a very \ndifficult problem in Alaska on aviation safety. We are, after all, the \nlargest State of the Union, one-fifth of the size of the United States. \nWe use aircraft as other people use taxis or buses or trains. Over 80 \npercent of our inter-city traffic is by air. Seventy percent of our \ncities can be reached only by air. As a consequence, safety is one of \nour major concerns.\n  This summer, Director Hall of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard came to Alaska. He met there with representatives of the Centers \nfor Disease Control and their National Institute for Occupational \nSafety and Health, NIOSH. There are resources provided in this bill to \nimplement the National Transportation Safety Board's recommendations \nand NIOSH's interagency initiative for aviation safety in my home State \nof Alaska. Senator Specter's bill, the Labor-HHS bill, provides the \nresources for NIOSH. They will have to be in the bill in order to put \nthis plan into action.\n  The NIOSH initiative for the air taxi industry in Alaska is modeled \nafter the highly successful 1993 helicopter logging study which \nproduced recommendations for changes that implemented safety plans \nwithout Federal regulation. NIOSH recommended crew rest and crew duty \nschedules along with changes in helicopter logging equipment, and that \nhas all but eliminated helicopter logging fatalities since those \nrecommendations were implemented.\n  It is my hope that the NIOSH study on aviation can produce the same \nresults--industry-led improvements to commuter aviation safety \noperations in Alaska--again, without the need for new Government-\nimposed mandates. The industry itself I believe will implement the \nNIOSH recommendations.\n  As the Senate knows, my family has known fatalities from airplane \ncrashes. And I have many friends who have been involved in such \ncrashes. As one who was lucky enough to walk away, it is my hope that \nthese studies will lead to greater safety considerations for all who \nfly in Alaska. I am grateful to the chairman and the ranking member, \nChairman Shelby and Senator Lautenberg, for including in this bill \nthese great, new safety initiatives.\n\n  I am happy to report on another matter. This bill ensures completion \nof the pedestrian footbridge that will span the Chena River in \nFairbanks. Fairbanks is Alaska's second largest city.\n  The Alaska River Walk Centennial Bridge is the brainchild of Dr. \nWilliam Ransom Wood. He is really the sage of Alaska. He is the \nexecutive director of Festival Fairbanks. This bridge is a small piece \nof an overall plan that Dr. Wood and the rest of the festival have \ndeveloped to beautify Fairbanks and make it pedestrian friendly.\n  At 95, Dr. Wood has been one of Alaska's major players. He served as \nthe president of the University of Alaska, mayor of Fairbanks, and on \nso many community councils and State task forces that I cannot here \nname them all. In honor of Dr. Wood's contribution to Fairbanks, the \nState of Alaska, and our Nation as a naval commander in World War II, \nSenator Murkowski and I join together in introducing a Senate \nresolution which will urge Secretary Slater to designate this \nfootbridge the William R. Wood Centennial Bridge.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to \nrespond to some of the things the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee just said, particularly his acknowledgment of \nthe hard work done by the staff on both sides, the majority staff and \nthe minority staff, and to say that I watch Senator Stevens in action; \nI see how difficult it is to get some of these allocations in the shape \nwe would like.\n  We are pleased that the Transportation bill was, if I may use the \nword, hammered out because there are still a lot of needs with which we \nhave to be concerned. One is the FAA, of course, and our safety \nprograms. I was pleased to hear the Senator mention that.\n  The other is the U.S. Coast Guard, in which Senator Stevens has such \nan active interest. I share that interest. The State of New Jersey has \na great deal of dependence--as well as the entire country--on the \nactivities of the Coast Guard. And the fact is that their funding is \npresently on the short side. But decisions are made when resources are \ntoo spare, and, inevitably, some hard decisions have to be made.\n  I commend the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for being able \nto ensure that the Transportation bill was moved along. I know how hard \nhe is working with some of the other bills that are still pending.\n\n[[Page S11867]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/04/senate-section/article/S11867-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING DR.

Mr. President, pursuant to the consent agreement of \nFriday, October 1, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed \nto executive session for the consideration of judicial nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nnominations will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             THE JUDICIARY\n\n       Ronnie L. White, to be United States District Judge for the \n     Eastern District of Missouri; Brian Theadore Stewart, to be \n     United States District Judge for the District of Utah; and \n     Raymond C. Fisher, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \n     Ninth Circuit.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have a number of judges to discuss \ntonight:\n  There is Brian Theadore Stewart--I see the distinguished Senator from \nUtah on the floor, who I am sure will be speaking of him.\n  There is Justice Ronnie L. White--I see the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri, who will be speaking about him and has specific reserved \ntime for that.\n  And there is the nomination of Raymond C. Fisher.\n  Utilizing some of the time reserved to me and the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will make sure that \nwhatever amount of time the distinguished Senator from Utah wishes will \nbe available to him.\n  I would like to start by mentioning how we got here. On Friday, the \nDemocratic leader was able to get an agreement from the majority leader \nscheduling an up-or-down vote on Ray Fisher, Ted Stewart, and Ronnie \nWhite tomorrow afternoon, with some debate this evening. I thank the \nDemocratic leader for his assistance in obtaining those agreements. I \nknow that it was not easy to obtain a date certain for a vote on the \nFisher nomination and I am especially grateful that at long last, after \n27 months, the Senate will finally be voting on the White nomination.\n  I begin with the Fisher nomination. Raymond Fisher is a distinguished \nCalifornian. After being confirmed by the Senate in 1977, he has served \nas Associate Attorney General of the United States. He served on the \nLos Angeles Police Commission from 1995 to 1997. He chaired it from \n1996 to 1997. In 1990, he was deputy general counsel for the \nIndependent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department, better \nknown as the Christopher Commission, chaired by Warren Christopher.\n  He received his undergraduate degree in 1961 from the University of \nCalifornia at Santa Barbara; And he received his law degree from \nStanford Law School in 1966, where he was president of the Stanford Law \nReview. Following law school, he clerked for the Honorable J. Skelly \nWright on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit and for the Honorable William Brennan on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. In other words, a lawyer's lawyer.\n\n  For almost 30 years, he was a litigation attorney in private practice \nin Los Angeles at Tuttle & Taylor and then as the managing partner of \nthe Los Angeles offices of Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe. He is a \nhighly respected member of the bar and a dedicated public servant.\n  He has the very strong support of both California Senators. He \nreceived a rating of well qualified--in other words, the highest \nrating--from the American Bar Association. He has the support of Los \nAngeles Mayor Richard Riordan, the Los Angeles police department, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, and the Fraternal Order \nof Police.\n  He was nominated back on March 15, 1999. He had a hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee and in July he was promptly and favorably reported. \nI do not know why his nomination was not taken up immediately and \nconfirmed before the August recess, but it is still here and will now \nreceive consideration. The Senate should vote to confirm him, as I \nfully expect we will.\n  I note that the Senate has before it ready for final confirmation \nvote two other judge nominees to the same court, the Ninth Circuit, \nJudge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. Also pending before the Judiciary \nCommittee are the nominations of Ron Gould, first nominated in 1997; \nBarry Goode, first nominated in June 1998; and James Duffy to the Ninth \nCircuit. It is a Court of Appeals that remains one quarter vacant with \n7 vacancies among its 28 authorized judges.\n  We should be voting up or down on the Paez and Berzon nominations \ntoday. I think we need to fulfill our duty not only to each of these \noutstanding nominees as a matter of conscience and decency on our part, \nbut also for the tens of millions of people who are served by the Ninth \nCircuit. Unfortunately, as was brought out Friday, a few Republican \nSenators--anonymously--are still holding up action on these other \nimportant nominations.\n  To his credit, the majority leader has come to the floor and said he \nwill try to find a way for the two nominations to be considered by the \nSenate. I know that if the majority leader wishes the nominees will \ncome to a vote. The way is to call them to a fair up-or-down vote. We \nshould find a way to do that as soon as possible.\n\n[[Page S11868]]\n\n  I certainly have tried to work directly and explain what I have done \non the floor in working with the majority leader on the nominations. I \nam happy to work with the Senators who are blocking them from going \nforward, but we do not know who they are. In fact, we had a policy \nannounced at the beginning of this year that we would no longer use \nsecret holds in the Senate. Unfortunately, Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon \nare still confronting a secret hold as their nominations are obstructed \nunder a cloak of anonymity after 44 months and 20 months, respectively. \nThat is wrong and unfair.\n  The distinguished Senators from California, Mrs. Boxer and Mrs. \nFeinstein, have urged continuously over and over again on this floor, \nin committee, in caucuses, in individual conversations with Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle, that the nominations of Berzon and Paez go \nforward. I see the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, \non the floor.\n  I think I can state unequivocally for her, as for Senator Feinstein, \nthat no Democrat objects to Judge Paez going forward. No Democrat \nobjects to Marsha Berzon going forward. If nobody is objecting on this \nside of the aisle to going forward, I strongly urge those who support--\nas many, many do--Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon's nominations, that they \ncall each of the 55 Senators on the other side of the aisle and ask \nthem: Are you objecting to them going forward? Would you object to them \ngoing forward? Find out who is holding them up. They are entitled to a \nvote.\n\n  To continue this delay demeans the Senate. I have said that I have \ngreat respect for this institution and its traditions. Certainly after \n25 years, my respect is undiminished. But in this case, I see the \ntreatment of these nominations as part of a pattern of what has \nhappened on judicial nominations for the last few years. If you are a \nminority or a woman, it takes longer to go through this Senate as a \njudicial nomination. That is a fact. It is not just me noting it, but \nimpartial outside observers have reported in the last few weeks that a \nwoman or a minority takes longer to be confirmed by the Senate as it is \npresently constituted.\n  The use of secret holds for an extended period is wrong and beneath \nthe Senate. We can have 95 Senators for a nominee but 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 \ncan stop that person--after 4 years with respect to Judge Paez; after 2 \nyears with respect to Marsha Berzon.\n  Let us vote up or down. If Members do not want either one of them, \nvote against them; if Members want them, vote for them. But allow them \nto come to a vote. Do not hide behind anonymous holds. Do not allow \nthis precedent to continue that we seem to have started that women and \nminorities take longer.\n  Judge Richard Paez is an outstanding jurist and a source of great \npride and inspiration to Hispanics in California and around the \ncountry. He served as a local judge before being confirmed by the \nSenate to the federal bench several years ago and is currently a \nFederal District Court Judge. He has twice been reported to the Senate \nby the Judiciary Committee in connection with his nomination to the \nCourt of Appeals and has spent a total of 9 months over the last 2 \nyears on the Senate Executive Calendar awaiting the opportunity for a \nfinal confirmation vote. His nomination was first received by the \nSenate in January 1996, 44 months ago.\n  Marsha Berzon is one of the most qualified nominees I have seen in 25 \nyears and the Republican Chairman of the Judiciary Committee has said \nthe same thing. Her legal skills are outstanding, her practice and \nproductivity have been extraordinary. Lawyers against whom she has \nlitigated regard her as highly qualified for the bench. Nominated for a \njudgeship within the Circuit that saw this Senate hold up the \nnominations of other qualified women for months and years--people like \nMargaret Morrow, Ann Aiken, Margaret McKeown and Susan Oki Mollway--she \nwas first nominated in January 1998, some 20 months ago.\n  The Atlanta Constitution noted recently:\n\n       Two U.S. appellate court nominees, Richard Paez and Marsha \n     Berzon, both of California, have been on hold for four years \n     and 20 months respectively. When Democrats tried * * * to get \n     their colleagues to vote on the pair at long last, the \n     Republicans scuttled the maneuver. * * * This partisan \n     stalling, this refusal to vote up or down on nominees, is \n     unconscionable. It is not fair, It is not right, It is no way \n     to run the federal judiciary. * * * This ideological \n     obstructionism is so fierce that it strains our justice \n     system and sets a terrible partisan example for years to \n     come.\n\n  It is against this backdrop that I, again, ask the Senate to be fair \nto these judicial nominees and all nominees. For the last few years the \nSenate has allowed 1 or 2 or 3 secret holds to stop judicial \nnominations from even getting a vote. That is wrong.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in January \nlast year:\n\n       Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time \n     for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. \n     * * * The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry \n     it should vote him up or vote him down.\n\n  At the time the Chief Justice issued this challenge, Judge Paez' \nnomination had already been pending for 24 months. The Senate received \nthe Berzon nomination within days of the Chief Justice's report. That \nwas almost 2 years ago and still the Senate stalls and refuses to vote. \nLet us follow the advice of the Chief Justice. Let the Republican \nleadership schedule up or down votes on the nominations of Judge Paez \nand Marsha Berzon so that the Senate can finally act on them. Let us be \nfair to all.\n  Recently, the Washington Post noted: ``[T]he Constitution does not \nmake the Senate's role in the confirmation process optional, and the \nSenate ends up abdicating responsibility when the majority leader \ndenies nominees a timely vote. All the nominees awaiting floor votes * \n* * should receive them immediately.''\n  Democrats are living up to our responsibilities. The debate over the \nlast couple of weeks has focused the Senate and the public on the \nunconscionable treatment by the Senate majority of selected nominees. \nThe most prominent examples of that treatment are Judge Paez and Marsha \nBerzon. With respect to these nominations, the Senate is refusing to do \nits constitutional duty and vote.\n  The Florida Sun-Sentinel wrote recently: ``The `Big Stall' in the \nU.S. Senate continues, as senators work slower and slower each year in \nconfirming badly needed federal judges. . . . This worsening process is \ninexcusable, bordering on malfeasance in office, especially given the \nurgent need to fill vacancies on a badly undermanned federal bench. . . \n. The stalling, in many cases, is nothing more than a partisan \npolitical dirty trick.''\n  A recent report by the Task Force on Judicial Selection of Citizens \nfor Independent Courts verifies that the time to confirm female \nnominees is now significantly longer than that to confirm male \nnominees--a difference that has defied logical explanation. The report \nrecommends that ``the responsible officials address this matter to \nassure that candidates for judgeships are not treated differently based \non their gender.'' Those responsible are not on this side of the aisle. \nI recall all too well the gauntlet that such outstanding woman nominees \nas Margaret Morrow, Ann Aiken, Margaret McKeown, Susan Oki Mollway, \nSonia Sotumayor were forced to run. Now it is Marsha Berzon who is \nbeing delayed and obstructed, another outstanding woman judicial \nnominee held up, and held up anonymously because she will be confirmed \nif allowed a fair up or down vote.\n  I likewise recall all too well the way in which other qualified \nnominees were held up and defeated without a vote. The honor roll of \noutstanding minority nominees who have been defeated without a vote is \nalready too long, including as it does Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Jorge \nC. Rangel, Anabelle Rodriquez and Clarence Sundram. It should not be \nextended further. Senate Republicans have chosen to stall Hispanic, \nwomen and other minority nominees long enough. It is wrong and should \nend.\n  Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed \nfor 2 and 3 and 4 years. I continue to urge the Republican Senate \nleadership to proceed to vote on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez \nand Marsha Berzon. There was never a justification for the Republican \nmajority to deny these judicial nominees a fair up or down vote. There \nis no excuse for their continuing failure to do so.\n\n[[Page S11869]]\n\n  I know the Senate will do the right thing and confirm Ray Fisher to \nthe Ninth Circuit tomorrow and that he will be an outstanding judge. I \nwill continue my efforts to bring to a vote the nominations of Judge \nRichard Paez and Marsha Berzon.\n  We also will get the opportunity tomorrow to vote on the nomination \nof Justice Ronnie White. As I reminded the Senate last Friday, he is an \noutstanding jurist and currently a member of the Missouri Supreme \nCourt. We have now a judicial emergency vacancy on the District Court \nof the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri while his \nnomination has been held up for 27 months.\n  Ronnie White was nominated by President Clinton in June of 1997--not \nJune of 1999 or 1998, but June of 1997. It took 11 months before the \nSenate would allow him to have a confirmation hearing. At that hearing, \nthe senior Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, and Representative Bill \nClay, the dean of the State's congressional delegation, came forward \nwith strong praise for the nominee. Senator Bond urged Members to act \nfairly on Judge White's nomination to the district court and noted \nJustice White's integrity, character, and qualifications, and concluded \nthat he believes Justice White understands the role of a Federal judge \nis to interpret the law, not to make law.\n  Once considered at a hearing, Justice White's nomination was reported \nfavorably on a 13-3 vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 21, \n1998. Senators Hatch, Thurmond, Grassley, Specter, Kyl, and DeWine were \nthe Republican Members voting for him, along with all Democratic \nMembers.\n  Even though he was voted out 13-3, the nomination was held on the \nSenate Executive Calendar without action until the Senate adjourned \nlast year, and returned to the President after 16 months with no Senate \naction. A secret hold had done its work and cost this fine man and \noutstanding jurist an up-or-down vote. The President renominated him \nback in January of this year. We reported his nomination favorably a \nsecond time this year a few months ago.\n  Justice White deserves better than benign negligence. The people of \nMissouri deserve a fully qualified and staffed Federal bench. He has \none of the finest records and experience of any lawyer to come before \nthe Judiciary Committee in my 25 years there. He served in the Missouri \nLegislature, the Office of the City Council for the city of St. Louis, \nand as a judge in the Court of Appeals for the Eastern District of \nMissouri before his current service as the first African American ever \nto serve on the Missouri Supreme Court.\n  I believe he will be an invaluable asset. I am pleased we are finally \nhaving a discussion, even though 27 months is too long to wait, too \nlong to wait for a floor vote, on this distinguished African American \njustice. Finally he will get the respect he should have from this body.\n  Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the \nSenate--and all of its Members--are obligated to fulfill. In its \nunprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees since the 104th \nCongress, the Senate is shirking its duty. That is wrong and should \nend.\n  Let us show respect to the federal judiciary and to the American \npeople to whom justice is being denied due to this unprecedented \nslowdown in the confirmation process. I am proud to support the \nnomination of Justice Ronnie White for United States District Judge for \nthe Eastern District of Missouri. I was delighted when last Friday, the \nDemocratic leader was able to announce that we had finally been able to \nobtain Republican agreement to vote on this nomination. I thank the \nDemocratic leader and all who have helped bring us to the vote tomorrow \non the nomination of Justice White. It has been a long time coming.\n  Tomorrow the Senate will act on the nomination of Brian Theadore \nStewart, who has not had to wait a long time with the others. I have \nsaid over the last few weeks that I do not begrudge Ted Stewart a \nSenate vote; rather, I believe that all the judicial nominations on the \nSenate Executive Calendar deserve a fair up or down vote. That includes \nJudge Richard Paez, who was first nominated 44 months ago and Marsha \nBerzon who was first nominated 20 months ago.\n  Tomorrow we will vote on the Stewart nomination but Senate \nRepublicans still refuse to vote on these two other qualified nominees \nwho have been pending far longer.\n  The Senate was able to consider and vote on the nomination of Robert \nBork to the United States Supreme Court in 12 weeks, the Senate was \nable to consider and vote on the nomination of Justice Clarence Thomas \nin 14 weeks. It is now approximately 2 months from the Senate's receipt \nof the Stewart nomination, and we are now about to vote on his \nconfirmation. I feel even more strongly that we should also be voting \non the nomination of Judge Richard Paez, which has been pending almost \n4 years, and that of Marsha Berzon, which has been pending almost 2 \nyears.\n  Despite strong opposition from many quarters from Utah and around the \ncountry, from environmentalists and civil rights advocates alike, I did \nnot oppose the Stewart nomination in Committee. I noted Mr. Stewart's \ncommitment to examine his role in a number of environmental matters \nwhile in the State government and to recuse himself from hearing cases \nin those areas. In response to questions from Chairman Hatch and \nSenator Feingold, Mr. Stewart committed to ``liberally interpret'' the \nrecusal standards to ensure that those matters would be heard by a fair \nand impartial judge and to avoiding even the appearance of impropriety \nor possible conflicts of interest.\n  I cooperated in Chairman Hatch's efforts to expedite Committee \nconsideration of the Stewart nomination with the expectation that these \nother nominees who have been held up so long, nominees like Judge \nRichard Paez and Marsha Berzon, were to be considered by the Senate and \nfinally voted on, as well. The Chairman and I have both voted for Judge \nPaez each time he was considered by the Committee and we both voted for \nand support Marsha Berzon.\n  I have tried to work with the Chairman and with the Majority Leader \non all these nominations. I would like to work with those Senators whom \nthe Majority Leader is protecting from having to vote on the Paez and \nBerzon nominations, but I do not know who they are. Despite the policy \nagainst secret holds, there are apparently secret Senate holds against \nboth Paez and Berzon. That is wrong and unfair.\n  As we prepare to vote on the nomination of Ted Stewart, the Senate \nshould also be voting on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and \nMarsha Berzon. The Stewart nomination has been pending barely 2 months, \nthe Berzon nomination has been stalled for almost 2 years and the Paez \nnomination has set a new, all-time record, having now been pending for \nalmost 4 years. The Paez nomination was referred to in the Los Angeles \nTimes recently as the ``Cal Ripken of judicial confirmation battles.'' \nWhat is most shameful is that the Senate is obstructing an up-or-down \nvote on these nominations without debate, without accountability and \nunder the cloak of anonymity.\n  Certainly no President has consulted more closely with Senators of \nthe other party on judicial nominations, which has greatly expanded the \ntime this Administration has taken to make nominations. The Senate \nshould get about the business of voting on the confirmation of the \nscores of judicial nominations that have been delayed without \njustification for too long. We should start by voting up or down on the \nPaez and Berzon nominations without further delay. That is the fair \nthing to do. The Majority Leader committed last Friday to finding a way \nto bring these two nominations to a vote. It is time for those votes to \nbe occur.\n  This summer, in his remarks to the American Bar Association, the \nPresident, again, urged us to action. We must redouble our efforts to \nwork with the President to end the longstanding vacancies that plague \nthe federal courts and disadvantage all Americans. That is our \nconstitutional responsibility. I continue to urge the Republican Senate \nleadership to attend to these nominations without obstruction and \nproceed to vote on them with dispatch. The continuing refusal to vote \non the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon demeans the \nSenate and all Americans.\n\n[[Page S11870]]\n\n  It is my hope that the example we set here tonight and tomorrow will \nmove the Senate into a new and more productive chapter of our efforts \nto consider judicial nominations. We are proceeding to vote on a \njudicial nominee that some Democratic Senators oppose in order to \ndemonstrate our commitment to fairness for all. There was never a \njustification for the Republican majority to deny any judicial nominees \na fair up or down vote. There is no excuse for their continuing failure \nto do so.\n  I will close with this. Let us move to a new and more productive \nchapter in our efforts to consider judicial nominations. Let us erase \nwhat has become a badge of shame for the Senate: You are a judicial \nnominee, and if you are a minority or a woman, no matter how good your \nqualifications are, you take much longer to go through this body than \ndoes a white male. That is a badge of shame on this great institution. \nBefore we finish this year, we should erase it. We should say the \nSenate does not have a gender or a race or ethnicity qualification for \njudges. The Senate will vote on men nominees; vote them up or vote them \ndown, but we will vote on them. We will not say if you are a woman or a \nminority you have to wait longer than anybody else because that is what \nthe Senate has been doing and it is wrong. It is shameful. It is \ninexcusable. It demeans this great and wonderful institution.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield time to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Missouri is going \nto speak, as will others. But I did want to follow the great Senator \nfrom Vermont, Mr. Pat Leahy, who has done such an admirable job as the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee in fighting for fairness. If \nyou listen to his remarks carefully, what he is basically saying is: \nBring to the floor of the Senate the nominees who have been voted out \nof the committee; let's debate them; let's talk about them; let's talk \nabout their merits. If you have a problem with them, put it out there. \nBut let's vote. That is the least we can do for these good people.\n  Every single one of these people who have gone through the committee, \nhas a current job. When they were nominated, and especially when they \nwere voted out of the committee, they assumed they would be going to a \nnew job, to be a judge. They had every reason to assume that because a \ngood vote out of that committee--getting the support of Senator Hatch \nand usually one or two or three more on the Republican side, and all \nthe Democrats--means you had the votes to get to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  As my friend has pointed out, it is very sad. We have had some bad \nsituations develop. I was very hopeful, in this new round of approvals \nwe have gone through--and I am grateful for the fact we have moved a \nfew judges through--I was hopeful we would break the logjam with Judge \nRichard Paez and with Marsha Berzon, for several reasons.\n  One, they are terrific people. They would make great judges. They \nwere voted out of the committee several times. They deserve a vote. \nThey have loving family members. I have had the wonderful opportunity \nto meet their families: In the case of Richard Paez, his wife and \nchildren; in the case of Marsha, her husband and children. They are \nwaiting for something to happen. This is not fair.\n  So while I am glad we are moving some court nominees--I am pleased we \nare doing that--I think we need to do more in the interests of the \ncountry. We need to do more. In the interests of fairness to these \npeople, we need to do more.\n  Let me go into a few details about Richard Paez. Currently, he serves \non the Federal bench as a district court judge in the Central District \nof California. He was first nominated by President Clinton to the court \nof appeals on January 25, 1996. Seven months later, on July 31, 1996, \nthe Judiciary Committee finally held a hearing on Judge Paez' \nnomination.\n  Let me point out something. This is the same Judge Paez who came \nright through this Senate when we supported him for district court. So \nhe is not a stranger to the Judiciary Committee. He is not a stranger \nto the Senate. We already approved him when he was nominated and took \nhis seat on the district court. So here we have a situation where it \ntook him 7 months to get his first hearing and then the Senate \nadjourned for the year without having reported the nomination. That was \n1996.\n  Now we get to 1997. The President nominates Judge Paez for the second \ntime. On February 25, the Judiciary Committee held a second hearing on \nthe nomination. That was 1997.\n  On March 19, 1998, 1 year and 2 months later, Judge Paez' nomination \nwas finally reported by the Judiciary Committee to the full Senate. But \nin the 7 months following, the Senate failed to act on the nomination, \nand it adjourned with that nomination still on the Executive Calendar.\n  Again, this year, for the third time, the President nominates Richard \nPaez to the Ninth Circuit Court. May I say, there are several vacancies \non that court, more than half a dozen. So we are looking at a court \nthat is not running at full speed. When there are 28 members is when \nthey are completely full. Now they have all these vacancies. So the \nnomination is reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee on July 29 \nof this year, but again the full Senate has failed to act.\n  So it brings us to this day, where we have a little bit of a \nbreakthrough. We are going to move forward five judges. I am glad we \nare doing it. But we have to be fair and look at this terrific judge, \nJudge Richard Paez.\n  I think we have an obligation to him and his family, and frankly, to \nthe President, who is the President who has nominated this gentleman \nseveral times.\n  Sure, if the shoe was on the other foot and we had a Republican \nPresident, I do believe my colleagues would be saying: Give us an up-\nor-down vote. I do not think that Richard Paez, the wonderful human \nbeing that he is, deserves to be strung out by the Senate--3\\1/2\\ years \nstrung out. I cannot understand why. I looked back through the record, \nand there is no one else who has been treated like this.\n  I say to my Republican friends, we do not know who has put a hold----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the Senator from Vermont \nhas expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What is the agreement because Senator Leahy's staff is \nsurprised his time has run out. Can the Chair tell me how much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was to be 45 minutes equally divided \nbetween the Senator from Vermont and the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, with an additional 15 minutes reserved for \nthe distinguished Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield an additional 2 \nor 3 minutes to the Senator from California so she may finish her \nstatement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Can the Senator from Utah make that 7 minutes since we \naccommodated the Senator from Missouri? If I may have 7 minutes, I can \nconclude.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I accede to the unanimous consent request for 7 \nadditional minutes, not coming off our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I will try to finish \nin 5. I have not gotten to Marsha Berzon yet.\n  We are setting a record of which we should not be proud. This man has \nbeen strung out for 3\\1/2\\ years. He is a good man. He has a solid \nrecord, and we have an obligation to him and his family, the members of \nthe legal and law enforcement communities, to the judicial system \nitself, and to the Latino community that is so very proud of him. \nAgain, the Senate approved him to the district court. He has served \nwith distinction there.\n  Judge Paez not only served in the district court, but he also served \n13 years as a judge on the L.A. Municipal Court, one of the largest \nmunicipal courts in the country. He is such a leader that his \ncolleagues elected him to serve as both supervising judge and presiding \njudge.\n  His support in the law enforcement community is pretty overwhelming. \nThe late Sheriff Sherman Block of Los Angeles, a Republican, supported \nhim. He is supported by Sheldon Sloan, the\n\n[[Page S11871]]\n\nformer chairman of the judicial selection committees for both Senators \nPete Wilson and John Seymour.\n  He is supported by Representative James Rogan, who was his colleague \non the municipal court. Those who know me and James Rogan know we do \nnot agree on a lot of things. We agree on Judge Paez.\n  He is supported by Gil Garcetti, district attorney for Los Angeles.\n  All these people have written wonderful things about him.\n  James Hahn, the Los Angeles city attorney, says ``his ethical \nstandards are of the highest caliber. . . .''\n  Peter Brodie, president of the Association of L.A. Deputy Sheriffs, a \n6,000-member organization, wrote to Chairman Hatch in support of Judge \nPaez's nomination.\n  The commissioner of the Department of California Highway Patrol says \nthat ``Judge Paez . . . [is very] well qualified,'' and ``his character \nand integrity are impeccable.''\n  We have a good man here. Let's vote him up or down. I know the Senate \nwill vote him in. I know that. I have not only spoken, I say to my \nfriend from Vermont, to Democrats, but I have spoken to Republicans who \nintend to support him. So he will win that vote.\n  The second nominee, Marsha Berzon, is another example of a \nlongstanding nominee who is being denied a vote by the full Senate.\n  In 1998--Senator Leahy laid it out--she received an extensive two-\npart confirmation hearing, written questions, written answers, and she \nextensively answered every question of the committee. In 1999, she was \nfavorably reported out of the committee.\n  Again, she is so well qualified. Marsha Berzon graduated cum laude \nfrom Radcliffe College in 1966, and in 1973, she received her Juris \nDoctor from UC Berkeley, Boalt Hall Law School, one of the greatest law \nschools in the country.\n  She has written dozens of U.S. Supreme Court briefs and has argued \nfour court cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. She has had extensive \nexperience appearing in Federal appeals courts, and it goes on and on.\n  She has received significant Republican support. Former Republican \nSenator James McClure of Idaho says:\n\n       What becomes clear is that Ms. Berzon's intellect, \n     experience and unquestioned integrity have led to strong and \n     bipartisan support for her appointment.\n\n  J. Dennis McQuaid, an attorney from Marin County, my opponent when I \nfirst ran for the House of Representatives in 1982, says of Marsha:\n\n       Unlike some advocates, she enjoys a reputation that is \n     devoid of any remotely partisan agenda.\n\n  W.I. Usery, a former Republican Secretary of Labor under President \nFord, has said that Marsha Berzon has all the qualifications needed, \nand he goes on.\n  Senator Specter has said very flattering things about Marsha Berzon. \nShe has strong support from both sides of the aisle.\n  We have lots of vacancies on this court, and we have two fine people \nwho are just waiting for the chance to serve. These people do not come \nalong every day.\n  I want to address myself to the question raised by my friend from \nVermont who has shared with me that there have been some independent \nstudies that show, sadly, that if you are a minority, or if you are a \nwoman, you do not seem to get looked at by the Senate; you do not seem \nto get acted on. You hang around; you wait around for a vote.\n  This is not a reputation the Senate wants. We want to give everyone a \nchance, and these are two candidates, a woman and a minority, who are \nso qualified that they were voted out in a bipartisan vote of the \ncommittee. I call on my friends on the other side of the aisle who may \nbe holding up these nominees--I do not know who they are. I thought we \nsaid you have to come out and identify yourself, but so far I do not \nknow who is holding these up.\n  I beg of you, in the name of fairness and justice and all things that \nare good in our country, give people a chance. If you do not think they \nare good, if you have a problem with something they said or did, bring \nit down to the floor. We can debate it. But please do not hold up these \nnominees. It is wrong. You would not do it to a friend. You would not \ndo it to someone of whom you thought highly, so do not do it to these \ngood people. They have families. They have jobs. They have careers. \nThey are good people.\n\n  All we are asking for is a vote. I do not want to see people \nthroughout the country coming to see us in our offices and claiming \nthat women and minorities are not getting fair treatment. That is not \nwhat we should be about, and I do not think that is what we are about. \nBut that is the kind of reputation this Senate is getting across this \nland.\n  We can fix it. We should follow the leadership of Senator Leahy from \nVermont because he has said very clearly for many months now: Bring \nthese good people forward.\n  I want to say a kind word about Senator Hatch. Senator Hatch has said \nto me from day 1: Senator Boxer, when you bring me a nominee, I want \nyou to make sure that not only are they well qualified, but that they \nhave bipartisan support.\n  He looked me in the eye, even though he is a foot taller, and said: \nYou promise me that.\n  I said: Senator Hatch, I will do that.\n  I have done that in these cases. These are two Ninth Circuit nominees \nwho were nominated by the President, but I have supported them and \nSenator Feinstein has supported them. They got the vote of Senator \nHatch because he knows we have been very careful to nominate people who \nhave mainstream support in the community. I promised him that. I have \ndone that. He has been fair to me. I hope all of the Senate will be \nfair to these two nominees.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Bennett for his kindness in giving me \nthe additional time. I look forward to moving forward with these \nnominees we have before us and certainly, at a minimum, on Marsha \nBerzon, Richard Paez, and the others who are waiting in the wings for \ntheir day. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I believe I have 15 minutes on the \nnomination of Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of \nJudge Ronnie White to the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri.\n  Confirming judges is serious business. People we put into these \nFederal judgeships are there for life, removed only with great \ndifficulty, as is evidenced by the fact that removals have been \nextremely rare.\n  There is enormous power on the Federal bench. Most of us have seen \nthings happen through judges that could never have gotten through the \nHouse or Senate.\n  Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 78, put it this way:\n\n       If [judges] should be disposed to exercise will instead of \n     judgment, the consequence would equally be the substitution \n     of their pleasure to that of the legislative body.\n\n  Alexander Hamilton, at the beginning of this Nation, knew just how \nimportant it was for us to look carefully at those who would be \nnominated for and confirmed to serve as judges.\n  A judge who substitutes his will or her will for the legislative \nwill, by displacing the legislative intent in enlarging the \nConstitution or amending it by saying, it is an evolutionary document \nand I am going to say now it has evolved to this state or that state, \nas opposed to an earlier state--that kind of judge is involved in what \nI call ``judicial activism.'' Judicial activism is simply the \nsubstitution of one's personal politics instead of the legislative will \nas expressed in our documents of the Constitution or in the law.\n  At no other place in our Republic do voters have virtually no \nrecourse. This is an important thing for us to consider as we evaluate \njudges and we seek to determine whether or not their confirmation would \nbe appropriate.\n  So as it relates to Judge Ronnie White, who serves now as a supreme \ncourt judge in the State of Missouri, upon his nomination I began to \nundertake a review of his opinions, and especially those circumstances \nand dissents where, as a judge on the Missouri Supreme Court, Judge \nWhite would have sought to change or otherwise extend or amend the law \nas it related to a variety of matters, especially in the area of \ncriminal law. I also heeded carefully his answers during his \nconfirmation\n\n[[Page S11872]]\n\nhearing and his answers to followup questions.\n  I believe Judge White's opinions have been and, if confirmed, his \nopinions on the Federal bench will continue to be procriminal and \nactivist, with a slant toward criminals and defendants against \nprosecutors and the culture in terms of maintaining order; he will use \nhis lifetime appointment to push law in a procriminal direction, \nconsistent with his own personal political agenda, rather than defer to \nthe legislative will of the people and interpret the law rather than \nexpand it or redirect the law.\n  I believe the law should be interpreted as written, as intended by \nthe legislature, not as amended or expanded by the courts. I believe \nJudge White will, as Alexander Hamilton so aptly described in \nFederalist 78, improperly ``exercise will instead of judgment.'' This \nis particularly true in the area of criminal law.\n  I am not alone in this view. Judge White's nomination has sparked \nstrong concerns from a large number of Missouri law enforcement \nofficials. Seventy-seven of the 114 sheriffs in the State of Missouri \nhave decided to call our attention to Judge White's record in the \ncriminal law. I do not take lightly the fact that 77 of these law \nenforcement, ground-zero sheriffs--people who actually are involved in \nmaking the arrests and apprehending those who have broken the law--\nwould ask us to look very carefully at this nominee. They cite specific \nopinions he has written and say these are the kinds of opinions that \ngive them great pause.\n  Anyone who knows something about Missouri's political system knows \nthat 77 out of 114 sheriffs would be a bipartisan delegation. As a \nmatter of fact, over 70 percent of all the public officials in Missouri \nwho are nominated and elected are Democrats. So you have 77 of the 114 \nsheriffs of Missouri on record saying: Look carefully. Evaluate very \ncarefully this nominee to the federal bench.\n  The Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs, an organization of police \nchiefs that spreads all across the State of Missouri, has indicated to \nus that we ought to tread very lightly here. As a matter of fact, they \nexpress real shock and dismay at the nomination. Prosecutors have \ncontacted me with their public letters. And, frankly, other judges in \nthe State have suggested to me I should think and consider very \ncarefully whether or not we proceed in this matter.\n\n  The letter from the Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs is very \ndirect. It says:\n\n       We want to go on record with your offices as being opposed \n     to his nomination and hope you will vote against him.\n\n  I want to express that the concern about Judge Ronnie White is far \nbroader than some of us in the Senate; it goes to a majority of the \nsheriffs in the State, with an official letter of expression from the \nMissouri Federation of Police Chiefs. There are prosecutors who have \ncome to me and asked me to think very carefully about the \nqualifications and the philosophy expressed by this nominee.\n  This opposition stems largely from Judge White's opinions in capital \nmurder cases. These opinions, and particularly his dissents, reflect a \nserious bias against a willingness to impose the death penalty.\n  Judge White has been more liberal on the death penalty during his \ntenure than any other judge on the Missouri Supreme Court. He has \ndissented in death penalty cases more than any other judge during his \ntenure. He has written or joined in three times as many dissents in \ndeath penalty cases, and apparently it is unimportant how gruesome or \negregious the facts or how clear the evidence of guilt. He has been \nvery willing to say: We should seek, at every turn, in some of these \ncases to provide an additional opportunity for an individual to escape \npunishment.\n  This bias is especially troubling to me because, if confirmed, Judge \nWhite will have the power to review the death penalty decisions of the \nMissouri Supreme Court on habeas corpus. In the seat of district court, \nJudge White's sole dissents are transformed into a veto power over the \njudicial system of the State of Missouri. I do not think that should \nhappen.\n  Let me give you an example of Judge White's sole dissent in the \nhighly publicized case of Missouri v. Johnson.\n  James R. Johnson was a brutal cop killer. He went on a shooting \nrampage in a small town called Carolina, MO. It sent shock waves across \nthe entire State in 1991--during the time I had the privilege to serve \nas Governor of the State. At that time, James Johnson stalked and \nkilled a sheriff, two sheriff's deputies, and Pamela Jones, a sheriff's \nwife.\n  Johnson first shot a deputy who had responded to a call about a \ndomestic dispute at Johnson's house. He shot the deputy in the back and \nthen walked over, as the deputy lay on the ground, and shot him in the \nforehead, killing him.\n  Johnson then reloaded his car with guns and drove to the local \nsheriff's home. There the sheriff's wife, Pamela Jones, was having a \nChristmas party. Johnson fired a rifle repeatedly through the window, \nhitting Mrs. Jones five times. Mrs. Jones died of those wounds in her \nhome in front of her family.\n  Then Johnson went to another deputy sheriff's home and shot him \nthrough a window as the deputy spoke on the phone. That deputy was \nlucky and survived.\n  Johnson then went to the sheriff's office, where other law \nenforcement officers had assembled to try to address the ongoing \nrampage that was terrorizing the town. Johnson lay in wait until \nofficers left the meeting and then opened fire on them, killing one \nofficer.\n  Then as another officer arrived on the scene in her car, Johnson shot \nand killed her. It was then that Johnson fled to the house of an \nelderly woman who he held hostage for 24 hours. She eventually \nconvinced Johnson to release her, and she notified the authorities who \napprehended Johnson. He was tried and convicted on four counts of first \ndegree murder and given four death sentences, convicted on all counts, \nreceived four separate death sentences. In a sole dissent urging a \nlower legal standard so that this convicted multiple cop killer would \nbe allowed a second bite at the apple to convince a different jury that \nhe was not guilty, Ronnie White sought to give James Johnson another \nchance.\n  Sheriff Jones, obviously, opposes this nomination. He is urging law \nenforcement officers to oppose it because he believes there is a \npattern of these kinds of decisions in the opinions and dissents of \nJudge White. He believes there is a pattern of procriminal opinions, \nand I think if one looks carefully, one might see that pattern.\n  Judge White was also the sole dissenter in a case called Missouri v. \nKinder. In that case, the defendant raped and beat a woman to death \nwith a lead pipe. White voted to grant the defendant a new trial, \ndespite clear evidence of guilt, including eyewitness testimony that \nKinder was seen leaving the scene of the crime at the time of the \nmurder with a pipe in his hand, and genetic material was found with the \nvictim. White dissented based on the alleged racial bias of the judge, \nwhich he urged was made evident by a press release the judge had issued \nto explain his change in party affiliation. The judge changed parties \nat sometime prior to this case, and the judge, in explaining his change \nof party, said he was opposed to affirmative action, discriminating in \nfavor of one race over another race. He left the one party he was in \nbecause he disagreed with their position on affirmative action. That \nwas the only basis for Judge White to provide a new opportunity for \nthis individual to get a second bite at the apple, not the evidence \nabout his conduct, the genetic material, or the eyewitness testimony.\n  Judge White's procriminal jurisprudence is not limited to murder \ncases. It extends to drug cases as well. In the case of Missouri v. \nDamask, Judge White's sole dissent in a drug and weapons seizure case, \nI think, reveals this same tendency on the part of this judge to rule \nin favor of criminal defendants and the accused in a procriminal matter \nand procriminal manner.\n  This was a case, Missouri v. Damask, about a drug checkpoint set up \nby the Missouri State police. The State police had erected a traffic \nsign on the highway in the middle of the night indicating ``drug \ncheckpoint ahead.'' The sign was placed just before a remote exit, one \nwhich only local residents would have cause to use. Those seeking\n\n[[Page S11873]]\n\nto avoid the ``drug checkpoint'' by exiting met with a real drug \ncheckpoint at the top of the exit ramp. There were no gas stations, no \nrestaurants or facilities at that exit. Motorists exiting at that exit \nwere stopped and asked why they exited. If police were able to \ndetermine from their answers that they were suitably suspicious to \nwarrant a search, they searched their cars. It was a very successful \nprogram, netting numerous arrests.\n  The Missouri Supreme Court upheld the practice as a reasonable search \nand seizure under the fourth amendment, consistent with many rulings of \nour Federal courts interpreting the fourth amendment.\n  Judge White was the sole dissenter in an opinion that seemed less \nconcerned with the established fourth amendment precedent than with \nwhether the search was intimidating. Judge White's opinion would have \nhamstrung this effective tool in the war on drugs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield the Senator an additional 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  It is these opinions and other opinions like them that have generated \nthe concern in the Missouri law enforcement community about Judge White \nand have caused me to conclude that I must oppose his confirmation. It \ndoesn't mean I oppose his coming to the floor. I am entirely willing to \nlet the Senate express itself in this respect. But I urge my fellow \nSenators to consider whether we should sanction the life appointment to \nthe responsibility of a Federal district court judge for one who has \nearned a vote of no confidence from so many in the law enforcement \ncommunity in the State in which he resides. Many of my fellow Senators \non the Judiciary Committee determined we should not and voted against \nhis nomination.\n  I ask my fellow Senators to review Judge White's record carefully. \nKeep in mind that he will not only sit for life, but he will still have \noccasion to vote on death penalty cases reviewed by the Missouri \nSupreme Court.\n  Again, as a district judge, he will be able to hear habeas corpus \npetitions challenging death sentences that have been upheld by the \nMissouri Supreme Court; only, as a district judge, his sole dissenting \nvote will be enough to reverse a unanimous opinion by the Missouri \nSupreme Court. He will have a veto over the Missouri Supreme Court in \ndeath penalty cases. And based on Judge White's track record, this is \nnot a situation that the law-abiding citizens of Missouri should have \nto endure.\n  As I conclude my remarks, I will read some of the text of \ncommunications I have received concerning this nominee. Sheriff Kenny \nJones, whose wife was murdered by James Johnson, put it this way: Every \nlaw enforcement and every law-abiding citizen needs judges who will \nenforce the law without fear or favor. As law enforcement officers, we \nneed judges who will back us up and not go looking for outrageous \ntechnicalities so a criminal can get off. We don't need a judge such as \nRonnie White on the Federal court bench.\n  I quote again from another paragraph: The Johnson case isn't the only \nantideath penalty ruling by Judge White. He has voted against capital \npunishment more than any other judge on the court. I believe there is a \npattern here. To me, Ronnie White is clearly the wrong person to \nentrust with the tremendous power of a Federal judge who serves for \nlife.\n  A letter from a prosecutor: Judge White's record is unmistakably \nantilaw enforcement, and we believe his nomination should be defeated. \nHis rulings and dissenting opinions on capital cases and on fourth \namendment issues should be disqualifying factors when considering his \nnomination.\n  A letter from the Missouri Sheriffs Association: Attached please find \na copy of the dissenting opinion rendered by Missouri Supreme Court \nJudge Ronnie White in the case of State of Missouri v. James R. \nJohnson.\n  Then a recitation of how James Johnson murdered Pam Jones, the wife \nof the Moniteau County sheriff, Kenny Jones. And then: As per attached, \nthe Missouri Sheriffs strongly encourage you to consider this \ndissenting opinion in the nomination of Judge Ronnie White to be a U.S. \ndistrict court judge.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. President, will \nthe Senator from Missouri yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is my understanding that Justice White has voted 17 \ntimes for death penalty reversals. Is that the understanding of the \nSenator from Missouri?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I don't have the specific count.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The numbers I have seen are that he has voted 17 times for \nreversal. Justice Covington, however, has voted 24 times for reversal \nin death penalty cases; Justice Holstein, 24 times; Justice Benton, 19 \ntimes; and Justice Price, 18 times. It would appear to me that at least \nJustices Covington, Holstein, Benton and Price, all on the Supreme \nCourt, have voted many more times to reverse death sentences than \nJustice White has. Are these numbers similar to what the Senator from \nMissouri has?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I think I can go to the question here \nthat I think the Senator is driving at. I will be happy to do that. The \njudges that the Senator from Vermont has named have served a variety of \ntenures, far in excess of the tenure of Judge White.\n  The clear fact is that, during his tenure, he has far more frequently \ndissented in capital cases than any other judge. He has, I believe, \nparticipated in 3 times as many dissents as any other judge. To try to \ncompare a list of dissents or items from other judges from other \ntimeframes, longer intervals, and a variety of different facts, with \nthe tenure that Judge Ronnie White has served is like comparing apples \nand oranges. And the numerics thereof, without that additional aspect \nof the situation being revealed, may appear to cause a conclusion that \nwould be different.\n  With that in mind, if you will think carefully about what I said, I \nbelieve I thought carefully when I said ``Judge White's record during \nhis tenure''; that is what you have to be able to compare, judges \nduring the same interval of time. With that in mind, during that same \ninterval of time, he has been the champion of those dissenting in death \npenalty cases and has dissented in ways which, very frankly, have \noccasioned an outcry from the law enforcement community in Missouri. \nNone of the other judges that I know of have been the recipients of \nthat kind of outcry.\n  There is one final point that I will make. Those are other notable \njudges and they have records and serve on the Missouri Supreme Court. \nThey are not persons against whom the law enforcement community has \nraised issues. But they are also not persons who have been nominated \nfor service on the U.S. District Court, a court which could set aside \nthe verdicts of the Missouri Supreme Court in habeas corpus cases. So \nwhile I think those particular judges are important--and if they are \nnominated for the Federal Court, I think we ought to look carefully at \ntheir work product.\n  So there are two points to be made here. One, the relevance of the \nnumbers is only relevant in the context of the interval. To suggest \nthat the numbers are out there, without defining the interval, would be \ninappropriate and misleading. So I would not do that.\n  Secondly, I think the relevance of a record that is unsatisfactory is \ndirectly appropriate to the judge who has been nominated. So we are not \nhere to talk about other judges so much as we are to talk about whether \nor not Ronnie White ought to be confirmed as a member of the U.S. \nDistrict Court. In my judgment, the law enforcement community in \nMissouri has expressed serious reservations about his lean toward \ndefendants, and I think we should not vote to confirm him. I urge my \ncolleagues not to vote to confirm Judge White, based on this \nunderstanding of the Missouri law enforcement community and a reading \nof his judicial papers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield me 30 seconds?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I just note that Justice Ronnie White is far more apt to \naffirm a death penalty decision than to vote as one of many members of \nthe Supreme Court to reverse it. He has voted\n\n[[Page S11874]]\n\nto affirm 41 times and voted to reverse only 17 times.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama has asked for 5 \nminutes. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nleadership in this matter. I want to share a few thoughts with Members \nof this body. I do believe in the rule of law. I believe that we ought \nto maintain it. I practiced full time in Federal Courts throughout my \ncareer, for almost 17 years. I respect Federal Judges and Federal law \ndeeply. When appropriate, I have tried to support President Clinton's \nnominees for Federal Judgeships, because I believe a President should \nhave some leeway in deciding who should serve on the Federal bench.\n  But I want to say a couple things about the Ninth Circuit. Since I \nhave been in this body--a little over 2 years now--having left the \npractice of law as a full-time Federal prosecutor, I have had an \nunderstanding of the Ninth Circuit better than a lot of other people. I \nsee Ninth Circuit criminal cases cited in Alabama and other areas very \nfrequently because they are usually very pro-defendant. There will be \nno other criminal case in America that has been partial to a defendant \nin a given situation--for example a search and seizure, or something \nlike that--and they will find a pro-defendant case in the Ninth \nCircuit.\n  I can say with confidence, from my experience, that the Ninth Circuit \nauthorities are not well respected by the other circuits in America. \nThey are out of the mainstream. In fact, the Supreme Court has begun to \nreally rap their knuckles consistently. In 1996 and 1997, 28 cases from \nthe Ninth Circuit went up to the U.S. Supreme Court for review, and 27 \nof them were reversed. In 1997 and 1998, 13 out of 17 were reversed. In \n1998 and 1999, it was 14 out of 18. In the past, the numbers have been \nequally high--for over a decade.\n  The New York Times recently wrote that a majority of the members of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court consider the Ninth Circuit to be a ``rogue'' \ncircuit, a circuit out of control based on the history of their \nreversal rates. This is not me making this up; that is according to the \nNew York Times.\n  I have been urging the President of the United States to nominate \nmainstream judges for the Ninth Circuit. That is what we are asking \nfor. Let's get this circuit back into line so that we can have the \nlargest circuit in America give the 20 percent of the people in the \nUnited States who are under the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction justice \nconsistent with the other circuits in America. These people are \ncurrently denied this justice because of their extremely liberal, \nactivist circuit. There is no other way to say it. There was an Oregon \nBar Bulletin article that studied this issue. The article examined the \nquestion of why the Ninth Circuit was being reversed so much in 1997. \nThe article says: ``There is probably an element of truth to the claim \nthat the Ninth Circuit has a relatively higher proportion of liberal \njudges than other circuits.'' It goes on to note how many are Carter \nand Clinton nominees. Already, a substantial majority--12 of the active \n21 judges--were Carter or Clinton nominees. There is nothing wrong with \nthat per se, however the nominees the White House has been sending to \nus from California have been even more liberal than the nominees \nPresident Clinton has nominated in other circuits. I don't see this \nkind of activism in nominees to other circuits. So the way I see this \nthing--and this is important for the members of this Senate to \nrealize--we have the responsibility of advice and consent on judicial \nnominations. That is a responsibility given to us. We have to exercise \nit.\n\n  What I have been saying to President Clinton is, Mr. President, \nlisten to us. Let's get this circuit--this rogue circuit--back into \nline. Give us mainstream nominees.\n  Mr. Fisher is, in my view, a fairly liberal Clinton appointee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If I could have 1 more minute.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield the Senator an additional minute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is part of our responsibility to advise and consent. \nIt is our duty to examine the state of justice in America, and to tell \nPresident Clinton that we are not going to continue to approve activist \nnominees for the Ninth Circuit. We have to have some mainstream legal \ntalent on that circuit, not ACLU members or the like. And, if he will \ngive us that, we will affirm them. If he does not, this Senator will \noppose them.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield my time to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am somewhat unfamiliar with the \nassignment of handling judicial nominees, that being the daily bread of \nmy senior colleague, Senator Hatch. He is unable to be here, and \ntherefore has asked me to step in in his place. I am glad to do \nwhatever I can to help.\n  Ted Stewart has a background that, in my view, qualifies him to be a \nFederal judge, a view shared by the American Bar Association that has \nlabeled him as qualified, and by a large number of Utahans of both \npolitical parties.\n  I first met Ted Stewart when I decided to run for the Senate. I found \nthat he had beat me in that decision and was already in the field. I \nknew little or nothing about him. But I quickly learned as we went \nthrough the process of traveling the State in tandem with the other \ncandidates that he was a man of great wisdom, an articulate man, and a \nman of good humor. We became fast friends even though we were opponents \nfor the same seat.\n  One of the proudest moments in my campaign was the fact that after \nthe State convention had narrowed the candidates to two, eliminating \nTed Stewart, his organization became part of my organization. He \nmaintained an appropriate judicial neutrality between me and the other \ncandidate. But our friendship was established and has gone forward \nuntil this day.\n  I point out that judicial neutrality because it is typical of Ted \nStewart. I know he had a personal preference. I will not disclose what \nit was. He was appropriately judicial, however, in keeping that \npersonal preference to himself and taking the position that was right \nand proper under those circumstances. That demonstrates what we hear \nreferred to around here from time to time as ``judicial temperament.''\n  The Senator from Alabama has talked about the reversal rate of the \nNinth Circuit. We have had experience with the reversal rates in the \nState of Utah from Federal judges.\n  I remember on one occasion where I was in the presence of a young \nwoman who had served on a jury of a highly celebrated case in the State \nof Utah and had voted in a way that was reversed when the case got to \nthe circuit court. I asked her about it because it was interesting to \nme. She said: Well, I didn't want to vote that way, and neither did any \nother member of the jury, but the charge we received from the judge \nmade it impossible for us to vote any other way.\n  After the trial was over, she said she and the other members of the \njury were visiting with the lawyer who had supported the losing side, \nand they apologized to him for voting against him. They said: We \nthought you had the best case. But under the charge we were given by \nthe judge, we had no choice but to vote against you. The lawyer smiled, \nand said: I know. And I expected that to happen because the judge in \nthis case has such a high record of reversal that I didn't want to run \nthe risk of having won a trial in his court. I knew my chances of \nwinning on appeal were far greater if I had this judge on record \nagainst me.\n  Those who know this judge rated him as one of the most brilliant men \never appointed to the bench. He may have had that great intellect, but \nhe did not have the common sense and the judicial temperament that made \nit possible for him to do his job. Tragically, the circuit court did \nhis job for him again and again and again at great expense and \ninconvenience not only to the judicial system but to those plaintiffs \nand defendants who came before him.\n  I cite that because I am convinced in Judge Stewart's court you will \nnot find that kind of bullheadedness and determination to have his own \nway as we saw in this other court.\n  In Judge Stewart's court, you will find the kind of levelheadedness, \nthe desire to find the right answer, and the\n\n[[Page S11875]]\n\nwillingness to work things out wherever possible as he has demonstrated \nthroughout his career up to this point.\n  He has already had experience on a commission that required him to \ndemonstrate that kind of judicial temperament. He handled his \nassignment there in such a way as to win him the endorsement of \nDemocrats as well as Republicans.\n  I know there is some controversy surrounding him because he is the \nGovernor's chief of staff. There are many people who, looking at the \nthings he has done in his loyalty to the Governor, have said: Well, his \nopinions are not acceptable to us.\n  They have been critical of him. They do not know the man if they \nmaintain that criticism because he will never depart from his \nconviction that the law comes first. He has demonstrated loyalty to \nthose who have appointed him. But he has also demonstrated a capacity \nto handle the law and handle the regulations that he is charged with \nenforcing in a way that will make all Americans proud.\n  I am happy to join my senior colleague in endorsing the nomination of \nTed Stewart for the Federal bench. I look forward with great enthusiasm \nto voting for him tomorrow.\n  I am grateful to the senior Senator from Vermont for his announcement \nthat he, too, will vote for Ted Stewart. I hope, with both the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee solidly in Judge \nStewart's behalf, that we will have an overwhelmingly positive vote for \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/04/senate-section/article/S11875-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11875-S11876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NOMINATIONS OF RAY FISHER, MARSHA BERZON, AND RICHARD PAEZ\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to first thank our minority \nleader for all of his effort in bringing public attention to the plight \nof pending judicial nominees.\n  Thanks to Senator Daschle's efforts, we have made some progress. Jim \nLorenz, a fine California attorney who served seven years on my \njudicial selection committee, was confirmed on Friday along with Victor \nMarrero of New York.\n  Jim Lorenz's confirmation will help address a desperate shortage of \njudges in the Southern District of California. I have spoken several \ntimes with Marilyn Huff, Chief Judge of the Southern District of \nCalifornia, about the District's caseload crisis.\n  A recent judicial survey ranked the Southern District as the most \noverburdened court in the country. The weighted average caseload in the \nSouthern District is 1,006 cases per judge, more than twice the \nnational average.\n  It is also a significant step forward for the Senate that we will \nhave a vote tomorrow on Associate Attorney General, Ray Fisher, to be a \nCircuit Judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal.\n  Ray Fisher is an extraordinary nominee who will add some support to \nthe skeleton crew of judges currently presiding on the Ninth Circuit.\n  Currently, the Ninth Circuit has seven vacancies, which is 25 percent \nof the total judgeship positions on the circuit.\n  Each one of these judicial vacancies qualifies as a judicial \nemergency. The Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit reports that the \nCircuit could handle 750 more cases right now if the vacancies were \nfilled.\n  Prior to his appointment as Associate Attorney General, Ray Fisher \nwas considered one of the top trial lawyers in Southern California. His \nlegal skills are so highly regarded that he recently was inducted into \nthe American College of Trial Lawyers, an honor bestowed on only the \ntop one percent of the profession.\n  During his 30 year career in private practice, Ray Fisher specialized \nin the toughest of cases, complex civil litigation, and in alternate \ndispute resolution. In 1988, he founded the Los Angeles Office of \nHeller Ehrman, White and McAullife, an office that has grown from 6 \nattorneys to 48.\n  The Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary of the American Bar \nAssociation has deemed Mr. Fisher ``Well Qualified'' for appointment as \nJudge of the United States Court of Appeals.\n  Ray Fisher graduated from Stanford Law School in 1966, where he was \npresident of The Stanford Law Review and awarded the Order of the Coif. \nFollowing law school, he served as a law clerk for Judge J. Skelley \nWright of United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit and Supreme Court Justice William Brennan.\n  I am confident Ray Fisher's acute interest in public service, \nspecifically in public safety, and his overarching concern for fairness \nwill serve the Ninth Circuit well.\n  However, I am disappointed that the Senate could not confirm other \npending Ninth Circuit nominees. Ray Fisher is a start, but six \nvacancies remain on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Two of those vacancies should be filled by Marsha Berzon and Judge \nRichard Paez.\n  It is a disturbing fact that women and minority nominees are having a \ndifficult time getting confirmed by the Senate.\n  A report by the independent, bipartisan group Citizens for \nIndependent Courts released last week found that during the 105th \nCongress, the average time between nomination and confirmation for male \nnominees was 184 days, while for women it was 249 days--a full 2 months \nlonger.\n  This disturbing trend continues this year. Women and minorities \nconstitute over 55 percent of the President's nominees in 1999; by \ncontrast, only 41 percent of the nominees confirmed this year by the \nSenate are women or minorities.\n  All we have ever asked for Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez is that \nboth nominees get an up-or-down vote. If a Senator has a problem with \nparticular nominees, he or she should vote against them. But a nominee \nshould not be held up interminably by a handful of Senators.\n  Let me assure my colleagues, this does not mark the end of a fight. \nAt some point, legislation is not going to move until Marsha Berzon and \nJudge Richard Paez get an up-or-down vote. Let me take a moment to \ndiscuss the nominations process that these two nominees have \nexperienced.\n  Judge Richard Paez, the first Mexican-American District judge in Los \nAngeles, was nominated on January 25, 1996--almost four years ago. He \nstill hasn't made it to the Senate Floor for a vote. Any problem with \nhis nomination can't be with his legal background.\n  He has 17 years of judicial experience. The American Bar Association \nfound him to be ``well-qualified.'' He is also strongly supported by \nthe legal community in Los Angeles including Gil Garcetti, the District \nAttorney, the Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' Association and the \nAssociation for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. Judge Paez has described \nthis interminable nominations process as a ``cloud'' hanging over his \nhead. Litigants in his court constantly query him if the case is going \nto be continued, if his case is going to be assigned to someone else, \nor if Judge Paez is going to keep it. No nominee should have to face \nthis uncertainty. His family has been thrust into the public limelight, \nand for four years every action he has taken has been subject to \nmicroscopic scrutiny.\n  Marsha Berzon was nominated almost a year and a half ago. She had her \nfirst hearing on July 30, 1998, and a second hearing in June 1999. Only \nin July 1999 was she reported out of committee and her nomination is \npending before the Senate. Nationally renowned appellate attorney with \nover 20 years of appellate practice, she clerked for Supreme Court \nJustice Brennan and U.S. Court of Appeals Judge James Browning. She \ngraduated Order of the Coif from Boalt Hall, has the support of law \nenforcement including the National Association of Police Organizations \n(NAPO) and the International Union of Police Organizations, has strong \nbipartisan support including former Idaho Senator James Mclure and \nformer EPA Administrator William D. Ruckelshaus.\n  The slow pace of this nomination has caused an incredible burden on \nMarsha Berzon both personally and professionally. Due to uncertainty \nover her future, she has significantly curtailed her private practice, \nand no longer is representing clients before the Supreme Court or the \nNinth Circuit.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist recently said that ``[t]he Senate is surely \nunder no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the \nnecessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.''\n  Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon do not deserve to have their \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S11876]]\n\ncareers and personal lives held in limbo. Our institutional integrity \nrequires an up-or-down vote.\n  Until Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez get votes, this nominations \nprocess will remain tainted.\n  I assure my colleagues in the Senate that the nominations of Marsha \nBerzon and Richard Paez will not fade away. We will keep pressing for \nthese nominees until they get the vote they deserve.\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure for me to \nsupport--on the Senate floor--the confirmation of a judicial candidate \nwho is the epitome of good character, broad experience, and a judicious \ntemperament.\n  First, however, I think it appropriate that I spend a moment to \nacknowledge the minority for relenting in what I consider to have been \nan ill-conceived gambit to politicize the judicial confirmations \nprocess. My colleagues appear to have made history on September 21 by \npreventing the invocation of cloture for the first time ever on a \ndistrict judge's nomination.\n  This was--and still is--gravely disappointing to me. In a body whose \nbest moments have been those in which statesmanship triumphs over \npartisanship, this unfortunate statistic does not make for a proud \nlegacy.\n  My colleagues--who were motivated by the legitimate goal of gaining \nvotes on two particular nominees--pursued a short term offensive which \nfailed to accomplish their objective and risked long-term peril for the \nnation's judiciary. There now exists on the books a fresh precedent to \nfilibuster judicial nominees whose nominations either political party \ndisagrees with.\n  I have always, and consistently, taken the position that the Senate \nmust address the qualifications of a judicial nominee by a majority \nvote, and that the 41 votes necessary to defeat cloture are no \nsubstitute for the democratic and constitutional principles that \nunderlie this body's majoritarian premise for confirmation to our \nfederal judiciary.\n  But now the Senate is moving forward with the nomination of Ted \nStewart. I think some of my colleagues realized they had erred in \ndrawing lines in the sand, and that their position threatened to do \nlasting damage to the Senate's confirmation process, the integrity of \nthe institution, and the judicial branch.\n  The record of the Judiciary Committee in processing nominees is a \ngood one. I believe the Senate realized that the Committee will \ncontinue to hold hearings on those judicial nominees who are qualified, \nhave appropriate judicial temperament, and who respect the rule of law. \nI had assured my colleagues of this before we reached this temporary \nimpasse and I reiterate this commitment today.\n  This is not a time for partisan declarations of victory, but I am \npleased that my colleagues revisited their decision to hold up the \nnomination. We are proceeding with a vote on the merits of Ted \nStewart's nomination, and we will then proceed upon an arranged \nschedule to vote on other nominees in precisely the way that was \nproposed prior to the filibuster vote.\n  Ultimately, it is my hope for us, as an institution, that instead of \nsignaling a trend, the last two weeks will instead look more like an \naberration that was quickly corrected. I look forward to moving ahead \nto perform our constitutional obligation of providing advice and \nconsent to the President's judicial nominees.\n  And now, I would like to turn our attention to the merits of Ted \nStewart's nomination. I have known Ted Stewart for many years. I have \nlong respected his integrity, his commitment to public service, and his \njudgment. And I am pleased that President Clinton saw fit to nominate \nthis fine man for a seat on the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Utah.\n  Mr. Stewart received his law degree from the University of Utah \nSchool of Law and his undergraduate degree from Utah State University. \nHe worked as a practicing lawyer in Salt Lake City for six years. And \nhe served as trial counsel with the Judge Advocate General in the Utah \nNational Guard.\n  In 1981, Mr. Stewart came to Washington to work with Congressman Jim \nHansen. His practical legal experience served him well on Capitol Hill, \nwhere he was intimately involved in the drafting of legislation.\n  Mr. Stewart's outstanding record in private practice and in the \nlegislative branch earned him an appointment to the Utah Public Service \nCommission in 1985. For 7 years, he served in a quasi-judicial capacity \non the commission, conducting hearings, receiving evidence, and \nrendering decisions with findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  Mr. Stewart then brought his experience as a practicing lawyer, as a \nlegislative aide, and as a quasi-judicial officer, to the executive \nbranch in state government. Beginning in 1992, he served as Executive \nDirector of the Utah Departments of Commerce and Natural Resources. And \nsince 1998, Mr. Stewart has served as the chief of staff of Governor \nMike Leavitt.\n  Throughout Mr. Stewart's career, in private practice, in the \nlegislative branch, in the executive branch and as a quasi-judicial \nofficer, he has earned the respect of those who have worked for him, \nthose who have worked with him, and those who were affected by his \ndecisions. And a large number of people from all walks of life and both \nsides of the political aisle have written letters supporting Mr. \nStewart's nomination.\n  James Jenkins, former president of the Utah State Bar, wrote, ``Ted's \nreputation for good character and industry and his temperament of \nfairness, objectivity, courtesy, and patience [are] without blemish.''\n  Utah State Senator, Mike Dmitrich, one of many Democrats supporting \nthis nomination, wrote, ``[Mr. Stewart] has always been fair and \ndeliberate and shown the moderation and thoughtfulness that the \njudiciary requires.''\n  And I understand that the American Bar Association has concluded that \nTed Stewart meets the qualifications for appointment to the federal \ndistrict court. This sentiment is strongly shared by many in Utah, \nincluding the recent president of the Utah State Bar. For these \nreasons, Mr. Stewart was approved for confirmation to the bench by an \noverwhelming majority vote of the Judiciary Committee.\n  To those who would contend Mr. Stewart has taken so-called anti-\nenvironmental positions, I say: look more carefully at his record. Mr. \nStewart was the director of Utah's Department of Natural Resources for \n5 years, and the fact is that his whole record has earned the respect \nand support of many local environmental groups.\n  Indeed, for his actions in protecting reserve water rights in Zion \nNational Park, Mr. Stewart was enthusiastically praised by this \nadministration's Secretary of the Interior.\n  And consider the encomiums from the following persons hailing from \nUtah's environmental community:\n  R.G. Valentine, of the Utah Wetlands Foundation, wrote, ``Mr. \nStewart's judgment and judicial evaluation of any project or issue has \nbeen one of unbiased and balanced results.''\n  And Don Peay, of the conservation group Sportsmen for Fish and \nWildlife, wrote, ``I have nothing but respect for a man who is honest, \nfair, considerate, and extremely capable.''\n  Indeed, far from criticism, Mr. Stewart deserves praise for his major \naccomplishments in protecting the environment.\n  Ultimately, the legion of letters and testaments in support of Mr. \nStewart's nomination reflects the balanced and fair judgment that he \nhas exhibited over his long and distinguished career. Those who know \nTed Stewart know he will continue to serve the public well.\n  On a final note, Ted Stewart is needed in Utah. The seat he will be \ntaking has been vacant since 1997.

Mr. President, on September 24 I introduced a new \nAfrica trade bill--S. 1636, the HOPE for Africa Act--a bill that will \ninvigorate commercial relationships between the United States and \nAfrican trading partners, with healthy results for both.\n  It expands trade between Africa and the United States, offers United \nStates companies new opportunities to invest in African economies, and \npromises new HOPE for the people of Sub-Saharan Africa themselves, who \nare struggling against daunting odds to gain a foothold in the global \nmarketplace and embrace the growth and stability it will bring.\n  It's important to say here that everyone proposing Africa trade \nlegislation has the same goal--we all want to help expand trade and \ndevelopment with Africa in a way that is also good for American \ncompanies and workers--but it's equally important to point out how we \ndiffer in approach, and what those differences will mean for African \neconomies.\n  For years Africa has gotten short shrift in the attention of the \nAmerican public and of American policymakers, and I am very encouraged \nthat there has been renewed interest in expanding opportunities for \nUnited States business in Africa.\n  But Congress shouldn't make up for those years of neglect by passing \nweak legislation that will have little impact on United States-Africa \ntrade.\n  As a member of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa for more than 6 \nyears, and its ranking Democrat for more than four, I know that now is \nthe time for foresight and bold action, because Africa today is \nbrimming with both tribulations and potential.\n  I offer this bill today because unfortunately, other proposals fall \nshort of their goals by providing only minimal benefits for Africa and \nfor Africans.\n  First and foremost, they fail to address two crises that are hobbling \nAfrica's ability to compete--the overwhelming debt burden, and the \ndeadly HIV/AIDS epidemic, both of which are so corrosive to African \naspirations.\n  My legislation, which is similar in many respects to the HOPE for \nAfrica bill introduced recently by Representative Jesse Jackson, Jr., \nin the House of Representatives, takes a more comprehensive approach to \nour current trade relationship with Africa--the only kind of approach \nthat can generate the kind of dramatic progress Africa needs to become \na more viable partner in the global economy.\n  My HOPE for Africa legislation offers broader trading benefits than \nthe other pending proposals, and just as importantly, it takes steps to \naddress the debt burden and AIDS crisis that handicap African \neconomies.\n  My bill extends trade benefits to selected African countries on a \nbroader variety of products--and does not rely narrowly on textiles, as \nother proposals do. Broader benefits give African businesses and \nworkers a better chance to establish sustainable trade-generated \neconomic development.\n  My bill includes strong protections against the backdoor tactic of \nillegal transshipment of goods from China and other third countries \nthrough Africa to the United States, that would cheat workers and \ncompanies here and in Africa of hard-earned opportunities.\n  Provisions of my bill will help deter the influx to the African \ncontinent of lower-wage workers from outside Africa, ensuring that \nAfricans themselves will be the ones to benefit from the provisions of \nthis bill.\n  Another centerpiece of this bill is that it requires strict \ncompliance with internationally-recognized standards of worker and \nhuman rights and environmental protections. The rights of Africa's \npeoples and the state of its environment may seem removed from life \nhere in the United States. But if we are wise we will all remember that \nwe are all affected when logging and mining deplete African rainforests \nand increase global warming, and we all reap the benefits of an Africa \nwhere freedom and human dignity reign on the continent, creating a \nstable environment in which business can thrive. American ideals and \nsimple good sense require that we be vigilant in this regard.\n  The bill takes crucial steps to support the fight against the \ncrushing HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has had a devastating impact in Sub-\nSaharan Africa. Of the 33.4 million adults and children living with \nHIV/AIDS worldwide in 1998, a staggering 22.5 million live in the 48 \ncountries of sub-Saharan Africa. Since the onset of the worldwide HIV/\nAIDS crisis, more than 34 million sub-Saharan Africans have been \ninfected, and more than 11.5 million of those infected have died. Since \nthe onset of the HIV/AIDS crisis, approximately 83 percent of AIDS \ndeaths have occurred in Africa. The vast tragedy of HIV/AIDS in Africa \nis daunting, overwhelming, but it must be overwhelmed with a massive \neffort that will have to be integrated with any Africa trade regime \nthat hopes to succeed.\n  Finally, the bill provides for substantial debt relief for Sub-\nSaharan African nations. Debt, debt, debt is the finger on the scales \nthat keeps that rich continent from achieving its economic potential \nand embracing a freer, more prosperous future. In 1997, sub-Saharan \nAfrican debt totaled more than $215 billion, about $6.5 billion of \nwhich is owed to the United States government. The debt of at least 30 \nof the 48 Sub-Saharan African countries exceeds 50 percent of their \ngross national products. The international community must find a \nreasonable way substantially to reduce this debt burden so that the \ncountries of sub-Saharan Africa can invest scarce dollars in the \nfutures of the most precious of their natural resources--their people.\n  My HOPE for Africa bill can establish a framework to achieve these \ngoals by relieving Sub-Saharan African nations of a significant piece \nof their current debt, supporting environmental protections and human \nrights in these developing economies, and giving African businesses--\nincluding small and women-owned businesses--a chance to share in the \nburgeoning global economy.\n  I was pleased to announce my intention to offer this legislation at a \npress conference recently in Milwaukee along with several \nrepresentatives of the state legislature and the local business \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, the current level of trade and investment between the \nUnited States and African countries is depressingly small.\n  It is called the magic 1 percent. Africa represents only 1 percent of \nour exports, one percent of our imports, and 1 percent of our foreign \ndirect investment.\n  That is a tragic 1 percent, the fruit of missed opportunities, wasted \npotential and simple neglect.\n  The history of U.S. trade on the African continent is a litany of \nlost opportunity with a smattering of bright spots concentrated among a \nfew countries.\n  United States trade in Africa is not diversified. In 1998, 78 percent \nof U.S. exports to the region went to only five countries--South \nAfrica, Nigeria, Anglola, Ghana, and Kenya, and the vast majority of \nimports that year came only from Nigeria, South Africa, Angola, Gabon, \nand Cote d'Ivoire.\n  In 1998, major U.S. exports to the region included machinery and \ntransport equipment, such as aircraft and parts, civil engineering, \nequipment, data processing machines, as well as wheat.\n  Major United States imports from Africa include largely basic \ncommodities such as crude oil which is the leading import by far, and \nsome refined oils,  minerals and materials, including platinum and \ndiamonds, and some agricultural commodities such as cocoa beans.\n\n  U.S. exports were much more diversified than U.S. imports.\n  The top 5 import items represent 75 percent of all U.S. imports from \nthe region.\n  That dire lack of diversity is discouraging, but the holes in the \nUnited States-Africa trade picture tell also of a wealth of \nopportunity.\n  The investment picture is no better.\n  United States foreign direct investment in Africa, including northern \nAfrica, at the end of 1997 was $10.3 billion, or 1 percent of all \nUnited States foreign direct investment.\n  Over half of the United States direct investment in Africa was in the \npetroleum sector. South Africa received the largest share of United \nStates foreign direct investment in sub-Saharan Africa, and \nmanufacturing accounted for the largest share of that investment.\n  Nigeria received the second largest share of United States foreign \ndirect investment in Sub-Saharan Africa, and petroleum accounted for \nalmost all of that investment.\n\n[[Page S11878]]\n\n  What is missing here is the coherent development that can make the \ncountries of Africa into a growing dynamic economic power with a \nhealthy appetite for American products.\n  I hope my bill will help spark that development and drive up all of \nthese meager trade statistics.\n  First, if offers trade benefits on a wider variety of products than \nis covered under competing proposals.\n  These provisions are designed to help African economies diversify \ntheir export base.\n  that's good for Africa, and good for us.\n  Second, as I have noted, my bill addresses the two biggest barriers \nto economic development in Africa--HIV/AIDS and debt.\n  In addition, it helps infuse into African economies a powerful engine \nof economic growth--small business.\n  The bill gives special attention to small- and women-owned businesses \nin Africa and it ensures that existing United States trade promotion \nmechanisms are made available to American small businesses seeking to \ndo business in Africa.\n  That kind of attention to the economic fundamentals also is good for \nAfrica and good for us.\n  My bill authorizes the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, OPIC, \nto initiate one or more equity funds in support of infrastructure \nprojects in sub-Saharan Africa, including basic health services, \nincluding HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, hospitals, potable water, \nsanitation, schools, electrification of rural areas, and publicly-\naccessible transportation.\n  It specifically requires that not less than 70 percent of equity \nfunds be allocated to projects involving small- and women-owned \nbusinesses with substantial African ownership, thus ensuring that \nAfrica truly gains from the provision.\n  It also specifies that a majority of funds be allocated to American \nsmall business.\n  Good for Africa and good for America.\n  This measure also ensures that the benefits of economic growth and \ndevelopment in Africa will be broad enough to allow African workers and \nAfrican firms to buy American goods and services.\n  My bill explicitly requires compliance with internationally \nrecognized standards of worker and human rights and environmental \nprotections in order for countries to receive the additional trade \nbenefits of the legislation.\n  The requirements are enforceable and allow for legal action to be \ntaken by United States citizens when an African country fails to \ncomply.\n  The bill also includes strong protections against the illegal \ntransshipments of goods from their countries through Africa, and \nauthorizes the provision of technical assistance to customs services in \nAfrica.\n  Transshipment is frankly a sneaky practice employed by producers in \nChina and other third party countries, especially in Asia.\n  Here's how it works: they establish sham production in countries \nwhich may export to the United States under more favorable conditions \nthan those producers enjoy in their own countries.\n  Then they ship goods made in their factories at home and meant for \nthe United States market to the third country, in this case an African \ncountry, pack it or assemble it in some minor way, and send it on to \nthe United States marked ``Make in Africa,'' with all the benefits that \nlabel would bring.\n  If that happens in Africa, it will undermine our objectives--it will \nbe bad for Africa, bad for the United States, and simply unjust.\n  These provisions are intended to ensure that the trade benefits in \nAfrica accrue to African workers rather than non-African producers.\n  There is more talk of Africa in the Halls of Congress than we have \nheard in a long time.\n  I welcome that because we have hope for this kind of attention on the \nSenate Subcommittee on Africa for the seven years I have served on that \ncommittee.\n  The prospect of expanding trade with Africa has inspired many members \nto educate themselves about the changes taking place on the continent.\n  Now they have to accept the opportunity and the challenge those \nchanges present.\n  Now they have to fix our trading relationship with Africa.\n  In our zeal to expand our trading relationship with selected \ncountries, we must be mindful to do it in a manner that is sustainable.\n  I fear that some of the other alternatives that are out there are \ninsufficient to meet and sustain the goals that we all share.\n  A better trade relationship for Africa has to be for the long term \nbecause its richest rewards will come in the long term.\n  Lasting, equitable, and effective expansion of commercial ties to the \neconomies and peoples of Africa will require bold steps.\n  This legislation represents the first of those steps. I urge my \ncolleagues to take up the tools we have to help the Nations of Africa \nbuild a more prosperous and just place on their continent. It is the \nright thing to do and the smart thing to do for America. Please join me \nin supporting the HOPE for Africa bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/04/senate-section/article/S11878-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11878-S11879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CHANGES TO THE BUDGETARY AGGREGATES AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE \n                               ALLOCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

A bill to make technical changes to the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 Rural Alaska Access Rights Act of 1999\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce \nlegislation to make technical amendments to the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA).\n  This legislation is a Rural Alaska Bill of Rights.\n  This legislation is the direct result of no less than six hearings I \nhave held on this issue since becoming chairman of the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  During these hearings I was continuously assured by the \nadministration that many of the frustrations Alaskans face because of \nthe interpretation of ANILCA could be dealt with administratively. \nUnfortunately, many of the problems remain unresolved today.\n  Some background on this issue is appropriate.\n  Nineteen years ago Congress enacted ANILCA placing more than 100 \nmillion acres of land out of 365 into a series of vast parks, wildlife \nrefuges, and wilderness units.\n  Much of the concern about the act was the impact these Federal units, \nand related management restrictions, would have on traditional \nactivities and lifestyles of the Alaskan people.\n  To allay these concerns, ANILCA included a series of unique \nprovisions designed to ensure that traditional activities and \nlifestyles would continue, and that Alaskans would not be subjected to \na ``Permit Lifestyle,'' as the\n\n[[Page S11880]]\n\nsenior Senator from Alaska has often said.\n  It is for these reasons that ANILCA is often called ``compromise \nlegislation'' and indeed it was--part of the compromise was that lands \nwould be placed in CSU's and the other part was that Alaskans would be \ngranted certain rights with regard to access and use in these units.\n  These rights were not only granted to the individuals that live in \nAlaska but were designed to allow the State itself to play a major role \nin the planning and use of these areas.\n  However, the Federal Government has not lived up to its end of the \nbargain--many of the Federal managers seem to have lost sight of these \nimportant representations to the people of Alaska, specifically on \nissues such as access across these areas and use in them.\n  Federal managers no longer recognize the crucial distinction between \nmanaging units surrounded by millions of people in the Lower 48 and \nvast multi-million acre units encompassing just a handful of \nindividuals and communities in Alaska.\n  The result is the creation of the exact ``permit lifestyle'' which we \nwere promised would never happen.\n  The delegation and other Members of this body warned this could be \nthe case when the legislation passed.\n  As one Member of this body noted in the Senate report on this bill:\n\n       This Piece of Legislation, if enacted will prove to be the \n     most important legislation ever affecting Alaska . . . While \n     we in Congress may be reading the provisions one way . . . \n     regulatory tools are all laid out in the bill to give rise to \n     future bureaucratic nightmare for the people of Alaska . . . \n     Frankly, I am expecting the worst . . . the use of massive \n     conservation system unit designations to block exploration, \n     development, and recreation of these lands and on adjacent \n     non-federal lands.\n\n  How prophetic!\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has held extensive \nhearings in Alaska on the implementation of ANILCA in Anchorage, \nWrangell and Fairbanks.\n  In these hearings we have heard from nearly 100 witnesses--\nrepresenting every possible interest group.\n  Four clear themes have emerged from those hearings:\n  Federal agencies have failed to honor the promises made to Alaskans \nwhen ANILCA was passed into law;\n  Agencies are not providing prior and existing right holders with \nreasonable use and access in the exercise of their property right;\n  Agency personnel manage Alaska wilderness areas and conservation \nunits the same way that similar units are being managed in the Lower \n48--contrary to the intent of Congress; and\n  Agencies, while stating their willingness to address complaints, fail \nto act in a reasonable and timely fashion when it comes to dealing with \nspecific issues.\n  Some of the specific issues identified include such absurdities as:\n  Indivdiuals and corporations are asked to pay hundreds-of-thousands \nof dollars to do an EIS for access to their own properties when none is \nrequired by law.\n  Millions of acres of public lands are closed to recreationists \nwithout ever having identified a resource threat.\n  When a tree falls on somebody's cabin or a bear destroys it Federal \nregulators will not let a person make reasonable repairs.\n  At field hearings the administration asked for time to address these \nproblems--we gave them time--and little has happened.\n  We have not ``jumped'' to a legislative solution, rather we have \nacknowledged that oversight has failed to produce meaningful \nadministrative change.\n  Does it make sense that:\n  When land managers are assigned to Alaska they are not required to \nhave any formal ANILCA training?\n  When a tree falls on somebody's cabin or a bear destroys it that \nFederal regulators will not let a person make reasonable repairs.\n  People are told they will have to pay ridiculous sums of money to \naccess their inholdings?\n  The answer to all these questions is clearly no. These are some of \nthe problems that have to be resolved and are included in this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1684.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1684\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Golden Spike/Crossroads of the West \nNational Heritage Area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n golden spike/crossrods of the west national heritage area act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday which authorizes the creation of the Golden Spike/Crossroads of \nthe West National Heritage Area in Ogden, Utah.\n  Utah has a rich railroad heritage that stems from the earliest days \nwhen the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroads met at Promontory \nPoint, Utah in 1869 and completed the transcontinental railroad. With \nthe coming of the railroad, Utah's mining industry boomed and our \neconomy grew and the once isolated Desert Kingdom became forever \nconnected to the rest of the United States. Diverse peoples and \ncultures would come to or through Utah. Mormon immigrants from Europe, \nChinese laborers working for the Central Pacific Railroad and Greek \ncoal miners on their way to the coal fields in Central Utah. All of \nthem would pass through the rail station in Ogden on their way to \nsettle the Intermountain West. It truly is a heritage area for us all.\n  Fire destroyed the original rail station first built in 1889. In 1924 \nthe current Union Station Depot was then built and remained the hub of \ntranscontinental rail traffic for another 40 years. The current \nbuilding, which is a registered historic site, has been refurbished and \nis an outstanding example of reuse and redevelopment of industrial \nareas. The facilities at Union Station also house some of the finest \nmuseum collections in the West including the Browning Firearms Museum \nand the Utah State Railroad Museum.\n  It is the intent of this legislation to preserve the historical \nnature of the area, increase public awareness and appreciation for the \npivotal role Ogden played in the settlement of the Intermountain West. \nBy general standards, this will be a very small Heritage Area, \nencompassing just a few city blocks around the Union Station building. \nWhile it may be small, it also has a very colorful history. There were \nno businesses which were more famous, or infamous than those that \ndotted 24th and 25th Streets.\n  The legislation would allow Ogden City to operate as the management \nentity for the area, working in closely with the National Park Service. \nThe City will be responsible for developing a management plan which \nwill present comprehensive recommendations for the conservation and \nmanagement of the area while the National Park Service will work \nclosely with the partners to help with interpretation and the \nprotection of this valuable cultural and historical resource. Working \nwith railroad enthusiasts from all over the country we can develop a \nlong-term management plan which will provide better interpretation of \nthe historical and cultural opportunities.\n\n[[Page S11881]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues will support me in sponsoring this legislation. \nCongressman Hansen has introduced similar legislation and I look \nforward to working with him and my friends on the Energy Committee to \nhold hearings and eventually move this bill through the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S.J. Res. 35. A joint resolution disapproving the Legalization of \nMarijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1998; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, pursuant to the order of section 602 of the \nDistrict of Columbia Home Rule Act.\n\n\n   disapproving the legalization of marijuana for medical treatment \n                           initiative of 1998\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint \nresolution that will prevent the implementation of an initiative in the \nDistrict of Columbia that would allow the use of marijuana for medical \ntreatment.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the voters of the District of Columbia \npassed a ballot initiative--Initiative 59--last November that would \nlegalize marijuana use for ``medicinal'' purposes.\n  Supported by the Mayor and many elected officials in the District, \nInitiative 59 would permit marijuana use as a treatment for serious \nillness including ``HIV/AIDS, glaucoma, muscle spasms, and cancer.''\n  Because physicians are not allowed to prescribe marijuana under \nfederal law, Initiative 59 would allow individuals to use marijuana \nbased on a doctor's ``written or oral recommendation.'' The initiative \nwould also allow the designation of up to four ``caregivers'' who would \nbe able to cultivate, distribute and possess marijuana for the purpose \nof supplying an individual with marijuana for medicinal purposes.\n  Proponents of the D.C. initiative, and similar initiatives elsewhere \nin the country, have argued that marijuana is the only way that \nindividuals can cope with the effects of chemotherapy and AIDS \ntreatments.\n  However, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), \nindividuals who are using marijuana for AIDS, cancer or glaucoma may \nactually be doing damage to themselves:\n\n       AIDS: Scientific studies indicate marijuana damages the \n     immune system, causing further peril to already weakened \n     immune systems. HIV-positive marijuana smokers progress to \n     full-blown AIDS twice as fast as non-smokers and have an \n     increased incidence of bacterial pneumonia.\n       Cancer: Marijuana contains many cancer-causing substances, \n     many of which are present in higher concentrations in \n     marijuana than in tobacco.\n       Glaucoma: Marijuana does not prevent blindness due to \n     glaucoma.\n\n  In addition, Dr. Donald R. Vereen, Jr., Deputy Director of the Office \nof National Drug Control Policy (commonly referred to as the office of \nthe ``Drug Czar''), in an article titled, ``Is Medical Marijuana an \nOxymoron?'' and printed in Physicians Weekly on February 1, 1999, \nstated:\n\n       No medical research has shown smoked marijuana to be safe, \n     effective, or therapeutically superior to other substances. \n     Synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary \n     psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, has been available for \n     fifteen years in pill form (Marinol) to treat HIV Wasting \n     Syndrome and chemotherapy-induced nausea. A legal drug, \n     Marinol is the real ``medical marijuana.'' It is available in \n     measured doses and guaranteed purity without the adverse \n     side-effects of smoking tars, hydrocarbons, and other \n     combustibles. Furthermore, newer drugs like ondansetron and \n     grenisetron work better than Marinol, as clinical practice \n     has demonstrated.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire article by Dr. \nVereen be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  In an attempt to prevent this initiative from going into effect, last \nOctober, Congress passed and the President signed into law the fiscal \nyear 1999 D.C. Appropriations bill which included a provision that \nblocked the District government from releasing the vote results of \nInitiative 59.\n  The provision was challenged in court, and last month, the \nprohibition was overruled by a federal judge and the results were made \npublic.\n  Meanwhile, as the battle over releasing the ballot figures was being \nfought, Congress re-emphasized its opposition to Initiative 59 in the \nfiscal year 2000 D.C. Appropriations bill by prohibiting the use of \nfunds to ``enact or carry out any law, rule or regulation to legalize \nor otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession use or \ndistribution of any Schedule I substance under the Controlled \nSubstances Act.''\n  Mr. President, under federal law, marijuana is a controlled \nsubstance, and as such, possession, use, sale or distribution is \nillegal and is subject to federal criminal sentences and/or fines. \nPossession of marijuana is a crime in the District as well, with the \npossibility of 6 months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n  Congress merely sought to uphold current law by saying no to the \nimplementation of Initiative 59, and no to the use of marijuana.\n  Nevertheless, the President vetoed the D.C. Appropriations bill last \nTuesday, issuing a statement that stressed that Congress was \n``prevent(ing) local residents from making their own decisions about \nlocal matters.''\n  However, there appears to be some confusion over the Administration's \ndirection on such legalization initiatives.\n  Last Wednesday, before the House D.C. Appropriations Subcommittee, \nDr. Donald R. Vereen, Jr. of the Drug Czar's office stated that:\n\n       The Administration has actively and consistently opposed \n     marijuana legalization initiatives in all jurisdictions \n     throughout the nation. Our steadfast opposition is based on \n     the fact that: such electoral procedures undermine the \n     medical-scientific process for establishing what is a safe \n     and effective medicine; contradict federal regulations and \n     laws; and in the Office of National Drug Control Policy's \n     view, may be vehicles for the legalization of marijuana for \n     recreational use.''\n\n  I refuse to believe that the President wants the American people to \nthink that he is more concerned about not violating Home Rule than he \nis about upholding federal law, particularly when experts within the \nadministration are opposed to legalization.\n  In a June 29th article in the Washington Post, Director of the Office \nof National Drug Control Policy, Barry McCaffrey stated that:\n\n       The term ``drug legalization'' has rightfully acquired \n     pejorative connotations. Many supporters of this position \n     have adopted the label ``harm reduction'' to soften the \n     impact of an unpopular proposal that, if passed, would \n     encourage greater availability and use of drugs--especially \n     among children.\n\n  This past June, in testimony before the House Subcommittee on \nCriminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources, Donnie Marshall, \nDeputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) stated ``I \nsuspect that medical marijuana is merely the first tactical maneuver in \nan overall strategy that will lead to the eventual legalization of all \ndrugs.'' He went on to say ``whether all drugs are eventually legalized \nor not, the practical outcome of legalizing even one, like marijuana, \nis to increase the amount of usage of all drugs.''\n  Indeed, according to the DEA, 12-17 year olds who smoke marijuana are \n85 times more likely to use cocaine than those who do not. Sixty \npercent of adolescents who use marijuana before age 15 will later use \ncocaine. If these usage figures are occurring now, I shudder to think \nwhat they will be if we expand marijuana's usage.\n  Assistant Chief Brian Jordan of the D.C. Metropolitan Police \nDepartment testified last Wednesday before the House D.C. \nAppropriations Subcommittee that ``the Metropolitan Police Department \nopposes the legalization of marijuana. Marijuana remains the illegal \ndrug of choice in the Nation's Capital, and crime and violence related \nto the illegal marijuana trafficking and abuse are widespread in many \nof our communities.''\n  According to D.C. government estimates, Washington currently has \n65,000 drug addicts. There are 1,000 individuals on a drug treatment \nwaiting list who are likely continuing to abuse drugs right now.\n  I believe the loose wording of the initiative--which again, would \nlegalize an individual's right to possess, use, distribute or cultivate \nmarijuana if ``recommended'' by a physician--would present an \nenforcement nightmare to police in the District of Columbia, and would \nserve as a de facto legalization of marijuana in D.C., increasing its \nprevalence and the number of addicts citywide.\n  In the simplest of terms, illegal drug use is wrong. The District \ngovernment and the United States Government\n\n[[Page S11882]]\n\nshould never condone it, regardless of the professed purpose.\n  That is why I am introducing this joint resolution. It's quite \nsimple. It says that the Congress disapproves of the legalization of \nmarijuana for medicinal purposes and prevents Initiative 59 from going \ninto effect. Period.\n  It is identical to legislation that the House will likely take-up \nnext week.\n  I agree with DEA Deputy Administrator Donnie Marshall that once \nsociety accepts that it's alright for individuals to smoke marijuana \nfor, quote ``medical purposes'' unquote, we will start on the path \ntowards greater social acceptance and usage of marijuana, which experts \nagree will lead to the use of harder drugs.\n  Mr. President, marijuana is an illegal drug according to federal, \nstate and local laws. It would be unconscionable for the United States \nCongress not to exercise its Constitutional duty and prevent the \nDistrict from going forward with this initiative no matter how well-\nintentioned the motive.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this resolution, and \nI urge its speedy adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the joint resolution \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 35\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     Congress hereby disapproves of the action of the District of \n     Columbia Council described as follows: The Legalization of \n     Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1998, approved \n     by the electors of the District of Columbia on November 3, \n     1998, and transmitted to Congress by the Council pursuant to \n     section 602(c) of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   [Physicians Weekly, Feb. 1, 1999]\n\n                   Is Medical Marijuana an Oxymoron?\n\n (By Dr. Donald Vereen Deputy Director, White House Office of National \n                          Drug Control Policy)\n\n       No medical research has shown smoked marijuana to be safe, \n     effective, or therapeutically superior to other substances. \n     Synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary \n     psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, has been available for \n     fifteen years in pill form (Marinol) to treat HIV Wasting \n     Syndrome and chemotherapy-induced nausea. A legal drug, \n     Marinol is the real ``medical marijuana.'' It is available in \n     measured doses and guaranteed purity without the adverse \n     side-effects of smoking tars, hydrocarbons, and other \n     combustibles. Furthermore, newer drugs like ondansetron and \n     grenisetron work better than Marinol, as clinical practice \n     has demonstrated.\n       Objections about pills being difficult to swallow by \n     nauseated patients are true for any antiemetic. If sufficient \n     demand existed for an alternate delivery system, Marinol \n     inhalants, suppositories, injections, or patches could be \n     developed. Why isn't anyone clambering to make anti-nausea \n     medications smokable? Why choose a substance and delivery \n     system (smoking) that is more carcinogenic than tobacco when \n     safer forms of the same drug are available? Patients deserve \n     answers to these germane questions instead of being blind-\n     sided by the ``medical marijuana'' drive.\n       The American Medical Association (AMA), American Cancer \n     Society, National Multiple Sclerosis Association, American \n     Academy of Ophthalmology, and National Eye Institute, among \n     others, came out against ``medical marijuana'' initiatives as \n     did former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Anecdotal support \n     for smoked marijuana reminds me of the laetrile incident \n     where a drug derived from apricot pits was believed to cure \n     cancer. Scientific testing disproved such testaments. How do \n     we know that testimonials touting marijuana as a wonder \n     drug--on the part of patients under the influence of an \n     intoxicant, no less!--may not simply demonstrate the placebo \n     effect?\n       We shouldn't allow drugs to become publicly available \n     without approval and regulation by the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH). \n     Such consumer protections has made our country one of the \n     safest for medications. A political attempt to exploit human \n     suffering to legalize an illicit drug is shameful and \n     irresponsible.

AMENDMENTS TO TITLE 49, UNITED STATES CODE.\n\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided, whenever in this \n     Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an \n     amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision of \n     law, the reference shall be considered to be made to a \n     section or other provision of title 49, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Department of Transportation.\n\n     SEC. 4. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The nation's air transportation system is projected to \n     grow by 3.4 percent per year over the next 12 years.\n       (2) Passenger enplanements are expected to rise to more \n     than 1 billion by 2009, from the current level of 660 \n     million.\n       (3) The aviation industry is one of our Nation's critical \n     industries, providing a means of travel to people throughout \n     the world, and a means of moving cargo around the globe.\n       (4) The ability of all sectors of American society, urban \n     and rural, to access and to compete effectively in the new \n     and dynamic global economy requires the ability of the \n     aviation industry to serve all the Nation's communities \n     effectively and efficiently.\n       (5) The Federal government's role is to promote a safe and \n     efficient national air transportation system through the \n     management of the air traffic control system and through \n     effective and sufficient investment in aviation \n     infrastructure, including the Nation's airports.\n       (6) Numerous studies and reports, including the National \n     Civil Aviation Review Commission, have concluded that the \n     projected expansion of air service may be constrained by \n     gridlock in our Nation's airways, unless substantial \n     management reforms are initiated for the Federal Aviation \n     Administration.\n       (7) The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for \n     safely and efficiently managing the National Airspace System \n     365 days a year, 24 hours a day.\n       (8) The Federal Aviation Administration's ability to \n     efficiently manage the air traffic system in the United \n     States is restricted by antiquated air traffic control \n     equipment.\n       (9) The Congress has previously recognized that the \n     Administrator needs relief from the Federal government's \n     cumbersome personnel and procurement laws and regulations to \n     take advantage of emerging technologies and to hire and \n     retain effective managers.\n       (10) The ability of the Administrator to achieve greater \n     efficiencies in the management of the air traffic control \n     system requires additional management reforms, such as the \n     ability to offer incentive pay for excellence in the employee \n     workforce.\n       (11) The ability of the Administrator to effectively manage \n     finances is dependent in part on the Federal Aviation \n     Administration's ability to enter into long-term debt and \n     lease financing of facilities and equipment, which in turn \n     are dependent on sustained sound audits and implementation of \n     a cost management program.\n       (12) The Administrator should use the full authority of the \n     Federal Aviation Administration to make organizational \n     changes to improve the efficiency of the air traffic control \n     system, without compromising the Federal Aviation \n     Administration's primary mission of protecting the safety of \n     the travelling public.\n\n     SEC. 5. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM DEFINED.\n\n       Section 40102(a) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (5) through (41) as \n     paragraphs (6) through (42), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following:\n       ``(5) `air traffic control system' means the combination of \n     elements used to safely and efficiently monitor, direct, \n     control, and guide aircraft in the United States and United \n     States-assigned airspace, including--\n       ``(A) allocated electromagnetic spectrum and physical, \n     real, personal, and intellectual property assets making up \n     facilities, equipment, and systems employed to detect, track, \n     and guide aircraft movement;\n       ``(B) laws, regulations, orders, directives, agreements, \n     and licenses;\n       ``(C) published procedures that explain required actions, \n     activities, and techniques used to ensure adequate aircraft \n     separation; and\n       ``(D) trained personnel with specific technical \n     capabilities to satisfy the operational, engineering, \n     management, and planning requirements for air traffic \n     control.''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, the Communist party celebrated \nthe fiftieth anniversary of the People's Republic of China on October \n1. Unfortunately, many Chinese people had little reason to celebrate. \nIndeed, this was not a celebration of the Chinese people but an \norchestrated celebration of the Communist party--a party of purges.\n  From the formative decade of Yenan, where the party was \nheadquartered, and Mao Tse-tung soundly crushed challenges to his \npower, to the killing of hundreds of landlords in the 1950s; to the \nanti-rightist purging of half a million people following the Hundred \nFlowers period and during the Great Leap Forward; to the Cultural \nRevolution, during which millions were murdered or died in confinement; \nto the massacre at Tiananmen square just ten years ago--the Communist \nparty under Mao Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping sustained its existence not \nby the consent of the people, but through the violent elimination of \ndissent.\n  Even today, we see the party of purges in action on a daily basis. \nThe Communist party under Jiang Zemin is deeply engaged in a piercing \ncampaign to silence the voices of faith and freedom--to purge from \nsociety, anyone they see as a threat to their power. The Chinese \ngovernment continues to imprison members of the Chinese Democracy \nParty. In August, the government sentenced Liu Xianbin to thirteen \nyears in prison on charges of subversion. His real crime was his desire \nfor democracy. Another Democracy Party member, Mao Qingxiang, was \nformally arrested in September after being held in detention since \nJune. He will likely languish in prison for ten years because of his \ndesire to be free. I could go on, but some human rights groups estimate \nthat there could be as many as 10,000 political prisoners suffering in \nChinese prisons. The party is determined to purge from society those \npeople it finds unsavory.\n  And the Chinese government will not tolerate people worshiping \noutside its official churches. So when it began cracking down on the \nFalun Gong meditation group, which it considers a cult, the government \nused this inexcusable action to perpetrate another--an intensified \nassault on Christians. In August, the government arrested thirty-one \nChristian house church members in Henan province. Henan province must \nbe a wellspring of faith because over 230 Christians have been arrested \nthere since October. Now I am concerned that eight of these House \nchurch leaders may face execution if they are labeled and treated as \nleaders of a cult. Let me say clearly and unequivocally that the eyes \nof the international community are watching. I hope that these peaceful \npeople will be released.\n  In the months leading up to this fiftieth anniversary celebration, \neverything and everyone were swept aside to cast a glamorous light on \nthe Communist party. But the reality was quite ugly. Hundreds of street \nchildren, homeless, and mentally and physically disabled people were \nrounded up and forced into Custody and Repatriation centers across the \ncountry. There they were beaten, they were given poor food in \nunsanitary conditions, and they had to pay rent.\n  In fact, only 500,000 carefully selected citizens were allowed to \nparticipate in the celebration in Beijing. Non-Beijing residents could \nnot enter the city and migrant workers were sent home. They did not see \nthe Communist Party in all its glory, as it displayed the DF-31 \nintercontinental ballistic missile and other arms, nor did they see the \ntanks rolling past Tiananmen Square. And Tibetans in Lhasa, who \ncertainly did not want to celebrate, were forced to participate under \nthreat of losing their pay or their pensions. Mr. President, this was a \ncelebration of the party, not the people.\n  But this gilded celebration will not obscure the corrosion beneath. \nWe must recognize the nature of this corrupt regime. We must never turn \na blind eye or a deaf ear to cries of those suffering in China. We must \nface reality when we deal with the Chinese government.\n  So when Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin courts President Jiang \nZemin even when Time Magazine's China issue is banned, when our top \nexecutives are silent on human rights, when we put profit over \nprinciple, we are shielding our eyes from the stark reality of \npersecution in China. As Ronald Reagan said, ``. . . we demean the \nvalor of every person who struggles for human dignity and freedom. And \nwe also demean all those who have given that last full measure of \ndevotion.''\n  It is my sincere hope and desire that in the next fifty years, the \nChinese people will truly have something to celebrate. I hope that they \nwill no longer be suppressed by a regime that extracts dissent like \nweeds from a garden, but that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of \na government accountable to the people.
