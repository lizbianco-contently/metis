Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately begin \nconsideration of H.R. 4578, the Interior appropriations bill. I see \nthat the chairman of the subcommittee is here and ready to proceed. \nOpening statements will be made and amendments are expected to be \noffered during today's session.\n  At 3:30 today, however, it will be my intention to turn to the \nexecutive nomination of Madelyn Creedon to be Deputy Administrator of \nthe National Security Administration. This was included in an earlier \nagreement, that we would complete debate and have a vote on this \nnomination prior to Wednesday of this week. I thought it was best we do \nit today. The vote will occur on her confirmation at 5:30 p.m. today.\n  During the Senate's consideration of the Interior bill, those \nSenators who have amendments should work with the bill managers in an \neffort to complete action on the bill as soon as possible. I commend \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior for the work they have \ndone on this legislation. Many areas could have been added that would \nhave been controversial and would have made it difficult to complete \nthe bill. They were not included. I hope, therefore, that in a \nrelatively short period of time we can complete action on this very \nimportant Interior appropriations bill.\n  Members should be on notice that it will be the leadership's intent \nto debate amendments to the DOD authorization bill during the evening \nsessions this week. That was agreed to before we went out for the \nFourth of July recess. There was a unanimous consent agreement entered \ninto that limits Senators to relevant amendments to the Department of \nDefense authorization bill. I believe all amendments had to be filed by \nthe close of business that day, which was Friday of the week before \nlast. Any amendment votes ordered during the DOD authorization bill \nwill be postponed to occur the next morning. We are hoping we can \nproceed under that agreement so that Monday night, Tuesday night, and \nWednesday night, if necessary, we can go to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill around 6:30 or 7 o'clock each night so we can \ncomplete action on this very important bill.\n\n  I emphasize again that this Department of Defense authorization bill \nhas been pending in one form or another before the Senate for quite \nsome time. A number of nongermane amendments were offered and voted on \nthat are connected to this bill. They have been dealt with in one way \nor another now. We are ready to complete action on the underlying \nDefense authorization bill itself. It has a lot of very important items \nfor the future of our military. Included among those are significant \nimprovements in the health care provisions for our military men and \nwomen and their families and for our retirees and their families. This \nis important legislation. Hopefully, we can complete it under this \nprocedure of taking up amendments each night and having votes at the \nbeginning of the session the next morning.\n  As a remainder, cloture was filed on the motion to proceed to the \ndeath tax legislation prior to the July recess. Pursuant to rule XXI, \nthat cloture vote will occur 1 hour after the Senate convenes tomorrow, \nunless an agreement is reached where we don't have to have a recorded \nvote on the motion to proceed, that we can pass that by voice vote and \nmove straight to the bill itself. We haven't worked that out yet. That \nis always a possibility. Otherwise, though, we will have that vote 1 \nhour after we come in on Tuesday morning.\n  The Senate is expected to return to the reconciliation bill, which \nhas a statutory time limitation of 20 hours, the latter part of this \nweek. Of course, that is the reconciliation bill for the marriage \npenalty tax relief. Votes will occur each day of the Senate's session, \nwith late nights and possibly a late Friday or Saturday session in \norder to complete the reconciliation bill.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention. I emphasize that point \nagain. It is our hope to go to the reconciliation bill on the marriage \npenalty tax Thursday, and complete action on that bill before the end \nof the session this\n\n[[Page S6302]]\n\nweek. Since we could take up to 20 hours under the reconciliation \nprovisions--and of course amendments at the end of that process don't \ncount against the 20 hours--we could very easily go into the afternoon \non Friday, Friday night, or Saturday. I hope Members are aware of that \nand prepare their schedule accordingly.\n  Since we only have 3 weeks before we recess for the August period for \nthe national conventions, I think it is safe to say we will be having \nvotes throughout the day, and we will have votes on Monday and Fridays \nfor the 3 weeks we have remaining. We have a lot of work to do. I \nappreciate the support and cooperation of all Senators.\n  I hope Members had a good Fourth of July recess period in the \nNation's Capital or back home with constituents. We are prepared to \nwork hard and get a lot of the people's business done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6302-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl).

Mr. President, while the leader is on the floor, I state \nfor the minority, we are here; we are ready to work; we understand the \ntremendous load of work that we have. We only have about 35 legislative \ndays until we adjourn this Congress.\n  In addition to the appropriations bills, there are other pieces of \nlegislation we can move along. The leader has indicated a couple of \nthings he is interested in accomplishing this week. We are happy to \nwork on those. It is also important that we don't lose sight of the \nfact we have a number of matters in conference. We have to complete the \nconference committee reports so we can come back and vote on those. We \nhave issues that are out there, not the least of which are the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, prescription drugs, gun safety, a minimum \nwage increase for families around America, and education. I hope we \nalso can focus on some of these issues during the next 35 legislative \ndays.\n  The minority is here; we are ready to move. I think we have worked \nvery hard on these appropriations bills in the last 6 weeks. I think \nthe last week we were able to get a lot done, including the emergency \nsupplemental, which is so important. We would also direct the leader's \nattention to the fact that there are other matters originally contained \nin the supplemental we need to complete in the immediate future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6302-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6302-S6323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

No timber sale in Region 10 shall be advertised \n     if the indicated rate is deficit when appraised under the \n     transaction evidence appraisal system using domestic Alaska \n     values for western red cedar: Provided, That sales which are \n     deficit when appraised under the transaction evidence \n     appraisal system using domestic Alaska values for western red \n     cedar may be advertised upon receipt of a written request by \n     a prospective, informed bidder, who has the opportunity to \n     review the Forest Service's cruise and harvest cost estimate \n     for that timber. Program accomplishments shall be based on \n     volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2001, the \n     annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale quantity \n     called for in the current Tongass Land Management Plan in \n     sales which are not deficit when appraised under the \n     transaction evidence appraisal system using domestic Alaska \n     values for western red cedar, all of the western red cedar \n     timber from those sales which is surplus to the needs of \n     domestic processors in Alaska, shall be made available to \n     domestic processors in the contiguous 48 United States at \n     prevailing domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal \n     year 2001, less than the annual average portion of the \n     decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current \n     Tongass Land Management Plan in sales which are not deficit \n     when appraised under the transaction evidence appraisal \n     system using domestic Alaska values for western red cedar, \n     the volume of western red cedar timber available to domestic \n     processors at prevailing domestic prices in the contiguous 48 \n     United States shall be that volume: (i) which is surplus to \n     the needs of domestic processors in Alaska; and (ii) is that \n     percent of the surplus western red cedar volume determined by \n     calculating the ratio of the total timber volume which has \n     been sold on the Tongass to the annual average portion of the \n     decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current \n     Tongass Land Management Plan. The percentage shall be \n     calculated by Region 10 on a rolling basis as each sale is \n     sold (for purposes of this amendment, a ``rolling basis'' \n     shall mean that the determination of how much western red \n     cedar is eligible for sale to various markets shall be made \n     at the time each sale is awarded). Western red cedar shall be \n     deemed ``surplus to the needs of domestic processors in \n     Alaska'' when the timber sale holder has presented to the \n     Forest Service documentation of the inability to sell western \n     red cedar logs from a given sale to domestic Alaska \n     processors at price equal to or greater than the log selling \n     value stated in the contract. All additional western red \n     cedar volume not sold to Alaska or contiguous 48 United \n     States domestic processors may be exported to foreign markets \n     at the election of the timber sale holder. All Alaska yellow \n     cedar may be sold at prevailing export prices at the election \n     of the timber sale holder.\n       Sec. 329. None of the funds appropriated by this Act shall \n     be used to propose or issue rules, regulations, decrees, or \n     orders for the purpose of implementation, or in preparation \n     for implementation, of the Kyoto Protocol which was adopted \n     on December 11, 1997, in Kyoto, Japan at the Third Conference \n     of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on \n     Climate Change, which has not been submitted to the Senate \n     for advice and consent to ratification pursuant to article \n     II, section 2, clause 2, of the United States Constitution, \n     and which has not entered into force pursuant to article 25 \n     of the Protocol.\n       Sec. 330. The Forest Service, in consultation with the \n     Department of Labor, shall review Forest Service campground \n     concessions policy to determine if modifications can be made \n     to Forest Service contracts for campgrounds so that such \n     concessions fall within the regulatory exemption of 29 CFR \n     4.122(b). The Forest Service shall offer in fiscal year 2001 \n     such concession prospectuses under the regulatory exemption, \n     except that, any prospectus that does not meet the \n     requirements of the regulatory exemption shall be offered as \n     a service contract in accordance with the requirements of 41 \n     U.S.C. 351-358.\n       Sec. 331. A project undertaken by the Forest Service under \n     the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program as authorized by \n     section 315 of the Department of the Interior and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, as amended, \n     shall not result in--\n       (1) displacement of the holder of an authorization to \n     provide commercial recreation services on Federal lands. \n     Prior to initiating any project, the Secretary shall consult \n     with potentially affected holders to determine what impacts \n     the project may have on the holders. Any modifications to the \n     authorization shall be made within the terms and conditions \n     of the authorization and authorities of the impacted agency.\n       (2) the return of a commercial recreation service to the \n     Secretary for operation when such services have been provided \n     in the past by a private sector provider, except when--\n       (A) the private sector provider fails to bid on such \n     opportunities;\n\n[[Page S6315]]\n\n       (B) the private sector provider terminates its relationship \n     with the agency; or\n       (C) the agency revokes the permit for non-compliance with \n     the terms and conditions of the authorization.\n     In such cases, the agency may use the Recreation Fee \n     Demonstration Program to provide for operations until a \n     subsequent operator can be found through the offering of a \n     new prospectus.\n       Sec. 332. Section 801 of the National Energy Conservation \n     Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8287(a)(2)(D)(iii)) is amended by \n     striking ``$750,000'' and inserting ``$10,000,000''.\n       Sec. 333.

From funds previously appropriated in Public Law \n     105-277, under the heading ``Department of Energy, Fossil \n     Energy Research and Development'', the Secretary of Energy \n     shall make available within 30 days after enactment of this \n     Act $750,000 for the purpose of executing proposal #FT40770.\n       Sec. 344. (a) In addition to any amounts otherwise made \n     available under this Act to carry out the Tribally Controlled \n     College or University Assistance Act of 1978, $1,891,000 is \n     appropriated to carry out such Act for fiscal year 2001.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     amount of funds provided to a Federal agency that receives \n     appropriations under this Act in an amount greater than \n     $20,000,000 shall be reduced, on a pro rata basis, by an \n     amount equal to the percentage necessary to achieve an \n     aggregate reduction of $1,891,000 in funds provided to all \n     such agencies under this Act. Each head of a Federal agency \n     that is subject to a reduction under this subsection shall \n     ensure that the reduction in funding to the agency resulting \n     from this subsection is offset by a reduction in travel \n     expenditures of the agency.\n       (c) Within 30 days of enactment of this Act, the Director \n     of the Office of Management and Budget shall submit to the \n     Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate a \n     listing of the amounts by account of the reductions made \n     pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of the Interior \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001''.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate \nthe Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year \n2001. The bill totals $15.474 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, an amount that is more than $600 million over the current \nyear level but almost $1 billion lower than the administration's budget \nrequest. The bill is right at its 302(b) allocation, and as such any \namendments must be fully offset.\n  Drafting this bill is always a great challenge, in large part because \nit funds programs and activities that have a direct and tangible impact \non the constituents that we represent. This is particularly true for \nthose of my colleagues from western States that contain large amounts \nof Federal and tribal lands. But aside from the usual challenges posed \nby the Interior bill, this year's version has been especially difficult \ngiven the lofty expectations raised by the administration's rather \nextravagant budget. The administration's request amounts to an increase \nof 11 percent overall--a hefty increase in light of our ongoing efforts \nto maintain some degree of control over Federal spending. The bill \nbefore the Senate contains a more reasonable increase of about 5 \npercent--an amount that I think is appropriate as we attempt to fashion \nan overall budget that protects Social Security and Medicare, reduces \nthe national debt, and provides for sensible tax relief.\n  Despite the more modest funding levels contained in this bill, I can \nassure my colleagues that the bill is a responsible product that is \nresponsive to the most pressing needs of the land management agencies; \nthe agencies that provide health, education and other services to \nIndian people; the several cultural institutions under the \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction; and a number of Department of Energy \nprograms that are particularly relevant today in light of the recent \nrise in gasoline prices.\n  In drafting this bill in consultation with the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Byrd, I have followed a number of basic \nprinciples.\n  First, the bill provides nearly 100 percent of the money required to \nfund increases in fixed costs such as pay and benefits. These are cost \nincreases over which the subcommittee has little or no control. Failure \nto provide these funds simply means agencies must reduce services or \nprogram delivery from current year levels. For the Interior bill as a \nwhole, these fixed cost increases total more than $300 million in FY \n2001. Providing this amount simply to maintain current levels of \nservice takes a large bit out of the overall increase in the \nsubcommittee's allocation.\n  Second, I have placed a high priority in those agencies and functions \nfor which the Federal Government has sole or primary responsibility. \nProviding for the core operating needs of the land management agencies \ncontinues to be a central priority in this bill. We have also tried to \nprovide adequate sums for the operation and maintenance of the \nSmithsonian, the National Gallery, and the Kennedy Center--institutions \nthat are our direct responsibility. Finally, we have done our very best \nto provide for the core needs of the Indian peoples for whom we have \ntrust responsibility--partiuclarly in the area of health services and \neducation.\n  The third major principle that has guided me in developing this bill \nreally flows from the second. For years, I\n\n[[Page S6316]]\n\nhave listened to Senator Domenici, Senator Dorgan, Senator Campbell, \nand others talk in hearings, markups, and casual conservation about the \nneed for major investment in the construction and repair of Indian \nschools. I have been shown pictures of Indian schools in other States \nto which none of us would want to send our own children, and am aware \nof schools in my own State that are in desperate need of repair or \nreplacement. Much like Department of Defense schools, these Indian \nschools are the direct responsibility of the Federal Government. In \nmany cases, however, they look very little like Department of Defense \nschools, and are not in a condition that we would allow to occur within \nthe DOD school system.\n  As chairman of the Interior subcommittee, it has been frustrating to \nnot be able to respond to such a pressing need in anything more than an \nincremental manner. But given the difficult spending constraints under \nwhich the committee has been operating for a number of years, it has \nbeen impossible to make significant progress on this issue without it \nbeing identified as a priority in administration budget requests. This \nyear, however, the administration has responded to the pleas of my \ncolleagues--a development that apparently was spurred by the \nPresident's recent visit to Indian country. The FY 2001 budget request \nincludes dramatic increases for both new school construction and repair \nand rehabilitation of existing schools. While the bill before you does \nnot provide 100 percent of the request, it does provide an increase of \n$143 million for BIA school construction and repair. This amount is \nenough to complete the next six schools on the construction priority \nlist, as well as provide an $84 million increase for the repair and \nrehabilitation account. Maintaining these funding levels will be one of \nmy highest priorities in conference with the House.\n\n  Adhering to these fundamental principles while remaining within the \nsubcommittee's 302(b) allocation did not leave a great deal of room for \nother program increases. As a result, there is perhaps less in this \nbill for land acquisition, grant programs, and specific member projects \nthan some would like. I think, however, that the bill reflects the \nright set of priorities. I have attempted to allocate available \nresources to the most compelling needs identified in agency budget \nrequests, as well as to the particular priorities identified to me in \nthe more than 2,000 individual requests I have received from Members of \nthis body. I regret not being able to do more of the things that my \ncolleagues have asked me to do, but want to assure Members on both \nsides of the aisle that I have made every effort to treat these \nrequests in a fair and even-handed manner.\n  While I do not wish to belabor the details, I do want to take a \nmoment to point out a few highlights of the bill for the benefit of my \ncolleagues who have not had a chance to review it closely. For the land \nmanagement agencies, the bill provides significant increases for core \noperational needs.\n  The bill provides an increase of $80 million for operation of the \nNational Park System, including more than $25 million for increases in \nthe base operating budgets of more than 80 parks and related sites, \nincluding the U.S. Park Police. These increases build on similar \nincreases that have been provided for the past several years. The bill \nalso provides an increase of $11 million for the National Park Service \nto continue efforts to research and document fundamental scientific \ninformation on the biological, geological, and hydrological resources \npresent in our park system.\n  For the Bureau of Land Management, the bill fully funds the request \nfor noxious weed control, fully funds the budget request for annual and \ndeferred maintenance, and provides an increase of $7.2 million for \nrecreation programs. The bill also provides a $10 million increase for \nPayments In Lieu of Taxes, continuing the committee's steady effort to \nraise PILT funding toward the authorized level.\n  For the Forest Service, the bill provides increases of $10.5 million \nfor recreation programs, and provides level funding for the timber \nprogram to prevent further erosion of timber offer levels. The bill \nalso fully funds firefighting preparedness, provides all the funds \nrequested to address survey and manage issues under the Northwest \nForest Plan, and provides increases over the President's budget request \nfor both road and trail maintenance.\n  For the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the bill provides increases \nof $17 million for refuge operations and maintenance to continue \nefforts to bolster the Service's basic operational capabilities. The \nbill also includes increases of $15 million for endangered species \naccounts, and $5 million for law enforcement programs that have been \nflat-funded for a number of years.\n  With respect to the cultural agencies funded in this bill, I am \npleased to note that funding for the National Endowment for the Arts is \nincreased by $7 million, and funding for the National Endowment for the \nHumanities is increased by $5 million. While these increases are fairly \nmodest, they are indicative of the widespread support that these two \nagencies have within the Senate. The increases also reflect the degree \nto which the Endowments have responded to congressional concerns about \nthe types of activities being funded, and the way in which project \nfunding decisions are made. While last year we were not able to \nmaintain the higher Senate funding levels in conference with the House, \nI fully intend to maintain the increases provided for the Endowments in \nthe final FY 2001 bill. I will put the leadership of the other body on \nnotice now that the Senate has no intention of receding on this matter.\n  This bill also provides funding for a portion of the Department of \nEnergy, including programs that support research on energy conservation \nand fossil energy development. This research is critical to reducing \nour Nation's dependence on foreign oil, and to reducing harmful \nemissions from vehicles, power plants and other sources. The bill \nprovides targeted increases for the most effective of these programs. \nOf particular not is the $11 million increase over the request level \nfor oil technology research and development. This program, which is \ndesigned to enhance oil production from domestic sources and to develop \ncleaner petroleum-based fuels, was inexplicably slated for a large \nreduction the administration's budget request. In light of the recent \nand alarming rise in the price of gasoline, such a reduction seems \nhighly imprudent at this time. The bill also provides increases for \nresearch on cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicles, including additional \nfunding for the Partnership for a Next Generation of Vehicles. This \nprogram was eliminated by the other body during floor debate--something \nwhich also seems imprudent in light of our growing dependence on \nforeign oil, and the potentially disastrous impact that rising oil \nprices could have on our economy.\n\n  Among the many Indian programs funded in this bill, I have already \ndiscussed the high priority that has been placed on education programs. \nThe bill provides increases for other Indian programs, however, \nincluding an increase of $143 million for Indian Health Services. This \namount includes a $41 million program increase for additional clinical \nservices, a $20 million increase for contract health services, and a \n$25 million increase for facilities construction and improvement. The \nbill continues the committee's efforts to help the Department of the \nInterior reform its abysmal trust management system. As many of my \ncolleagues are aware, the Department is making a concerted effort to \ndeal with a trust management mess that has been building for decades, \nif not the entire 20th century. This bill provides the full \nadministration request for the Office of Special Trustee, which is \ncharged with overseeing the trust reform initiative. The bill also \nprovides an increase of $12.5 million for trust reform activities \nwithin the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  On a more parochial level, I would like also to talk about what this \nbill means for the people of Washington State. The land management \nagencies funded through the Interior Appropriations bill have a \ndramatic impact on the ecological and economic health of the Pacific \nNorthwest. With more than 25 percent of the land in Washington State \nowned by the Federal Government, I have taken a special interest in \nassuring that we have the resources and policies that promote \nrecreational and economic opportunities, and environmental \npreservation.\n  In preparing the FY 2001 Interior appropriations bill, I focused on \nthree\n\n[[Page S6317]]\n\nkey issues for Washington State: restoring the health of our salmon \nruns, providing recreational opportunities, and promoting a clean \nWashington State.\n  The salmon crisis has reached new heights in the past 6 months. While \ngreeted by the good news that some returning Columbia River runs are at \ntheir highest levels in more than a decade, the cause of decline and \nthe goals for recovery remain a mystery. The clash between local \ngovernments and the Federal agencies responsible for addressing the \nlisting of these species has grown increasingly tense.\n  Fortunately, most can agree that homegrown efforts to recover salmon \nwill be the foundation for addressing the species' future. In this \nyear's Interior bill, I have continued and increased the Federal \nGovernment's investment in funding volunteer salmon recovery groups \nthat have the best track record for identifying and restoring crucial \nstream and river habitat for salmon.\n  Increasingly, the role of fish hatcheries in the larger effort to \nrestore naturally spawning runs of salmon has come under scrutiny. A \ngroup of key scientists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \nNational Marine Fisheries Service, Northwest Indian Fisheries \nCommission, and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife have joined \nforces to develop standards for the more than 100 hatcheries located in \nthe State. I have secured funding to continue this effort to redesign \nhatchery practices and retrofit the facilities to ultimately enhance \nsalmon runs rather than detract from the larger recovery goals.\n  The Northwest continues to be a hot spot for recreation. Whether you \nare a day hiker from downtown Seattle or a back country horseman from \nOkanogan, all of us have a desire to preserve and enhance the \nrecreation opportunities on our public lands. This year, I have focused \nmy attention on improving camping and hiking opportunities in the \nMiddle Fork Snoqualmie Valley and preserving the history of Ebey's \nLanding on Whidbey Island.\n\n  Finally, the health and beauty of our public lands are assets we \ncannot ignore. The diversity of wildlife that resides in our forests, \nrefuges and parks must be preserved in the future. I have dedicated \nfunding to acquiring key tracts of land that will provide connective \nhabitat in the Cascade Range. Our children deserve a clean Washington \nState, and the fiscal year 2001 Interior appropriations bill makes a \nstrong investment in the public lands we depend on for ecological and \neconomic stability.\n  In the interests of expediting debate on this bill, I will not spend \nmore of the Senate's time describing its many noteworthy features. I \ndo, however, wish to make one final observation regarding the bill as a \nwhole. The bill will soon be open to amendment. Any Senator may offer \nan amendment to move funding from one program to another. Some of these \nproposals I may support, as I do not claim to know all there is to know \nabout programs funded in this bill. Many such amendments I will oppose, \nhowever, because I think the bill before you represents an appropriate \nbalance among competing priorities. But whatever the case, the point is \nthat the process of amendment is available to us--to all Senators.\n  The administration's budget request includes a proposal that would \ngreatly diminish the right of Senators to offer amendments to change \nspending priorities in this bill. The ``Lands Legacy'' initiative would \nfence off a significant number of the programs in this bill and provide \na set amount of funding for those programs. An amendment to move \nfunding from this Lands Legacy pot to other programs would not be \npossible. For instance, one could not propose to shift funds from Urban \nand Community Forestry to Tribally Controlled Community Colleges, or \nfrom the Cooperative Endangered Species Fund to the National Park \nService operations account. Regardless of what individual Senators \nmight think about such amendments, to prohibit the simple offering of \nthe amendment is absurd. That is why the committee has rejected the \nadministration proposal entirely. And that is why this Senator is \nvehemently opposing efforts being made elsewhere in Congress to take \nland acquisition and a handful of favored grant programs off budget, \nthereby preventing the Appropriations Committee and the Senate as a \nwhole from weighing the merits of those programs against the other \ncritical--but sometimes less visible or popular--activities funded in \nthis bill.\n  On one further matter, I know several of my colleagues have inquired \nabout emergency items that were included in the supplemental portion of \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill, but which were not included in the \nsupplemental title of the military construction bill that was sent to \nthe President prior to the recess. This category includes funding for \nhurricane damage to National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService facilities, and funding championed by Senator Grams that would \naddress a major timber blowdown in Minnesota and Wisconsin. While I can \nnot now say exactly how we will address these issues, I want to assure \nmy colleagues that this senator is committed to seeing that these \npreviously identified emergency needs are addressed.\n  Before I turn to Senator Byrd for his opening remarks, I want to \nstate for the record how much I continue to enjoy working with him in \nputting this bill together year after year. He is a forceful and \neloquent advocate for the interests of the State of West Virginia, as \nwell as for the interests of Members on his side of the aisle and I may \nsay, my side of the aisle. He is always cognizant, however, of the need \nto put forward a well balanced bill that adequately addresses the \npressing national priorities that come under the subcommittee's \njurisdiction. It is a great pleasure to work with him and his able \nstaff. I also want to thank my own staff for the many hours they have \nput into this bill. It is often a grueling process, and I know I speak \nfor all Senators in expressing appreciation for the work that has been \ndone to get us this far.\n  With that, I will only add the comment that I hope we will be able to \ndeal with this bill relatively promptly and deal with it within the \nparameters set by the bill itself. I think it is not nearly as \ncontroversial a proposal as sometimes has been the case in the past. \nThe House has, of course, already passed its Interior appropriations \nbill, and I have every hope we can finish our task relatively promptly \nand send not only an acceptable but an absolutely first-rate bill to \nthe President of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure to join with the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington in presenting this bill. He is an \nextraordinarily fine chairman. I have chaired this subcommittee now \nfor, oh, a good many years, but Senator Gorton is really one of the \nbest subcommittee chairmen in this Senate. I say that without any \nhesitation. I have no compunctions about saying he is one of the finest \nchairmen with whom I have ever served in these 42 years in the \nSenate. I mean every word of it.\n\n  I have found him always to be very courteous, very considerate, very \ncooperative; and he is this way with all Senators--not just with me but \nwith all of our colleagues. I could not hope to have a better chairman \nthan he. And if it were not for the honor that goes along with the \nchairmanship, I would just as soon he kept this. But there is a certain \nhonor with it, so I look forward to the time when I will be chairman of \nthe full committee and subcommittee again. But my hat is always off to \nthis chairman, Senator Gorton.\n  This is an important piece of legislation that provides for the \nmanagement of our natural resources, undertakes important energy \nresearch, supports vital Indian health and education programs, and \nworks to protect and preserve our national and cultural heritage. It is \na bill on which Senator Gorton and I cooperate very closely on a \nbipartisan basis. We know no party in our relationship in this Senate. \nAnd that is said without any reservations whatsoever. There is no \nRepublican Party, no Democratic Party where Slade Gorton and I are \nconcerned in working on this subcommittee. And I can say the same with \nrespect to the full committee with respect to Ted Stevens, the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska. There is no party line in that \ncommittee.\n\n[[Page S6318]]\n\n  The programs and activities funded under the jurisdiction of the \nsubcommittee are treated in a fair and balanced way, as is customary \nfor the annual Interior appropriations bills under the chairmanship of \nSenator Slade Gorton. He is one of the best--if not the best--\nsubcommittee chairman with whom I have had the opportunity to serve. \nThe bill was reported unanimously by the committee, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support its passage.\n  I will not repeat the summary of the bill just provided by the \nsubcommittee chairman, except to say that, as it currently stands, this \nmeasure provides $15.4 billion in new discretionary budget authority. \nThis amount, while less than the administration's request, is \nnevertheless $628 million above last year's enacted level. The bill, as \nreported by the committee, has fully utilized the subcommittee's entire \n302(b) allocation of $15.4 billion in discretionary budget authority. \nConsequently, to remain consistent with the Budget Act, any amendments \nthat propose increased funding will have to be fully offset.\n  So if any Senator has any amendment in mind that seeks to add money, \nthat Senator or his staff, or both, should busy themselves about \nfinding an offset because Peter is going to have to pay Paul in this \ninstance. It is going to come out of somebody's funding, and I am \ndetermined it will not be mine. So I suggest that Senators look for an \noffset because they have to have it.\n  In terms of total spending, the Interior bill is by no means the \nlargest of the 13 annual appropriations measures. Yet, despite its \nrelatively modest size, the Interior appropriations bill commands \nsignificant attention from Members of the Senate. As is the case every \nyear, the subcommittee received more than 2,000 Member requests seeking \nconsideration of a particular project, or account, or activity under \nthe jurisdiction of one agency or another in this bill. All of these \nrequests are very important to our colleagues and the people that they \nrepresent. Unfortunately, because of the constrained spending level \nunder the allocations provided to the Congress, it is not possible to \nadequately respond to all of these requests. That is what makes the \ncrafting of this bill so difficult. Trying to balance the specific \nneeds addressed by the Member requests on one hand, while remaining \nwithin the budgetary allocations on the other hand, is an arduous task, \nindeed--not as arduous, perhaps, as the problem that Solomon had, but \nsometimes I wonder.\n  Nevertheless, it is our responsibility--the responsibility of our \nchairman and myself--to undertake that very difficult assignment, and I \ncommend him for his splendid efforts in meeting the highest priority \nneeds of all Senators. For months now, he has gone to great lengths to \nwork with me and to keep me informed, and to work with my staff to keep \nmy staff informed, of his recommendations throughout the process of \nmarking up and reporting this bill. Throughout this process, Senator \nGorton's graciousness--that word is key, ``graciousness''--and his \ndedication to duty have never wavered, and I am personally grateful to \nhim for all his courtesies.\n  I also express my appreciation to the fine staff members on the \nmajority staff side, as well as members on the minority staff side. We \nhave a new staff person on this side of the aisle--Peter Kiefhaber, \nGerman to the core, smart as they come, and hard working. That is what \nI like about him. He is hard working, he is courteous, and he is \nextremely efficient.\n  So with that, I think I shall join my chairman in asking Senators, if \nthey have them, to bring their amendments to the floor. It would be my \nhope, as I used to do when I was chairman, to urge, with the approval \nof the chairman of the subcommittee, our floor staffs to contact \nSenators and see if they have any amendments. If they have them, let's \ndraw up a list. Let's know which Senators have what amendments, and \nlet's draw up a list. It would be my hope that at a time not too far \naway we could get unanimous consent that that be a finite list. Then we \ncould go from there.\n  But I will not suggest that at the moment. I have not discussed that \nwith the chairman. Whenever he is ready to ask his staff on that side \nof the aisle, I will do the same over here. We will have our leadership \nmake calls to Senators and let us know if we are to anticipate any \nproblems from them. If we are to anticipate such, let us know about it. \nAnd because we do have other business, we must get on with it.\n  I again thank my chairman, Mr. Gorton. I thank our staffs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, once again, I thank my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Byrd, not only for his kind words but substantively \nfor the fact that I believe we have brought to the floor a bill that \ncan command wide respect and that is not likely to be faced with \nprofound amendments that change the direction or the philosophy of the \nbill itself.\n  We have put together a list of rumored amendments as well as some en \nbloc amendments that we can accept in closing. It is relatively modest \nin length. It will be good if some of them can be brought today, of \ncourse, in the course of the next less than 2 hours. But I do hope that \nby tomorrow we will be in a position to get a unanimous consent \nagreement for a finite number of amendments and can develop a way in \nwhich to deal with them very promptly.\n  The majority leader has told us how much he has to accomplish for the \nweek. It will be a wonderful tribute to us, and a great help to us, if \nwe are able to be in conference on this committee well before the week \nis over.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington \nand Senator Byrd, who I know want to expedite the matter, for allowing \nme to speak about an amendment that I am now drafting. I want to make \nsure this works out well. This is in response to something, as the \nSenator mentioned, that is a priority for both myself and Senator \nGrams. What happened is that we in Minnesota were hit with a once-in-a-\nthousand-years storm, literally. It was on July 4, 1999. Over 400,000 \nacres in Minnesota were damaged, including the Boundary Waters Canoe \nArea Wilderness, as well as the Gunflint Corridor, in Superior National \nForest. This started in the Boundary Waters Wilderness area, which is \nreally a national treasure.\n  What we are worried about is the blow-down to which Senator Gorton \nreferred. We had a hearing in Grand Rapids on Friday. Senator Craig \nchaired the hearing, and I thought he did a superb job. Basically, what \npeople are focused on right now is how to deal with this blow-down and \nthe possibility of a conflagration. Everybody is very worried about \nwhat could happen. The Forest Service--I think there was also consensus \non this--is doing a very good job. I think that is what people across \nthe spectrum were saying.\n  What happened is we had $9.2 million in emergency funding that came \nout of the Senate Appropriations Committee, however we lost much of \nthat funding when the MILCON bill got put together. The funding went \nfrom $9.2 million to $2 million. This additional $7.2 million--and I \nknow you heard from Senator Grams on this as well--is critically \nimportant to us. It is important also for some of the work that the \nForest Service is trying to do just by way of education.\n  It is incredible how few minor fires we have had; people have been \npaying very careful attention and are doing everything they can to \nprevent them. It also goes to the whole question of how we deal with \nthe trees that are down and the underbrush and whether or not we can do \nthe prescribed burns on what kind of schedule. This is critically \nimportant to my State of Minnesota.\n  So what I want to do is take 10 minutes or so to outline what we are \ndealing with in Minnesota, and then I will have an amendment that I \nwill send to the desk, or I can get it to staff and Senators and see \nwhether we can just reach some agreement.\n  Again, this was an unbelievable storm that hit our State. In many \nways, what I think has happened is that it has brought Minnesotans \ntogether; it has brought the best out in people. We are talking about \nour beloved national forests. This is a critically important area; \n400,000 acres in 7 counties were hit by a storm that damaged as much as \n70 percent of the trees in certain areas and wiped out numerous rows. \nThe damage of this storm has\n\n[[Page S6319]]\n\npresented unbelievable challenges, not only to land managers but all \nMinnesotans--people who depend on the national forest for their jobs, \nfamily incomes, industrial materials such as paper and pulp, and family \nvacations and recreation.\n  Mr. President, I do think that the Forest Service, as I said, has \nbegun to implement a significant and important effort. In particular, \nwhat they are trying to deal with is the dead and downed timber, which \nis a great threat to people in the State, and really, I think, a great \nthreat to the country because we are talking about a crown jewel \nwilderness area.\n  My intention is to have an amendment--we are working on it right now, \ndrafting it in such a way that we clearly make the case for emergency \nfunding, which I think we can. We really should have had this \nadditional money. I want to make sure it is OK with colleagues on both \nsides. And then later on maybe we will have a vote or maybe it can be \naccepted. I hope we can get an agreement on this amendment. I wanted to \nsignal my intention to you and spell out what I want to do.\n\n  Mr. President, I heard my colleague refer to this blow-down \namendment. I wonder whether he might respond.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes, but I would like to hold the floor a few more \nminutes. I yield temporarily.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the emergency, the task, the unprecedented \nnature of the storm damage that is described by the Senator from \nMinnesota is absolutely correct. There is not a single thing he has \nsaid that meets with any resistance or disagreement on the part of this \nSenator.\n  I wish that money had been included in the bill that is now law. As I \nbelieve the Senator knows, it remains in the Agriculture appropriations \nbill. I guess, procedurally at least, the principal challenge or \nprincipal question is which one of these two bills is going to get to \nthe President and actually be signed first because I know the Senator \nfrom Minnesota wishes to have this money in hand.\n  I make this suggestion to the Senator from Minnesota. If he would get \ntogether in just the next few hours or over the evening with the junior \nSenator from Minnesota and present us with a joint project, I will \ndiscuss the matter with Senator Byrd and with the leadership and tell \nthe Senator that I think he is absolutely right; I want to get this job \ndone as quickly as I possibly can. I will be delighted--and I am sure \nSenator Byrd will be delighted as well--to see to it that we do this in \na way in which it becomes law and the money becomes available as \nquickly as possible.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the Senator's \ncomments. As far as I am concerned, this request should come from both \nSenators. I would be delighted if Senator Grams joined me. We will get \nthe wording of the amendment to you. We will do this together. We want \nto just get it done for our State. I think the Senator from Washington \ncan appreciate that sentiment. That is his modus operandi. I will let \nother Senators come forward with amendments now. I will get the \namendment to you. We will have Senator Grams join in, and we will try \nto get it done on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk \nabout the energy conservation programs in this Interior appropriations \nbill that we are now considering. First, I want to thank Chairman \nGorton and Senator Byrd for their fine work on this bill. In \nparticular, I am very glad to see that funding for energy conservation \nis 5 percent above last year's level. I firmly believe that every \ndollar spent on research and development for energy efficiency pays \nback many times in the real value for the American consumer. These \nprograms are saving the Nation an estimated $20 billion per year in \nenergy costs at this time.\n  I would like to focus my comments today on one particular program in \nthe energy conservation budget, and that is, the Partnership for a New \nGeneration of Vehicles. This is generally referred to as PNGV. It is a \ncost-shared, industry-government partnership.\n  It is working to improve the fuel economy of passenger cars with the \nultimate goal of developing midsized cars that will get up to 80 miles \nper gallon.\n  Talking about energy efficiency in the transportation sector I \nbelieve is especially timely given the high gasoline prices that we are \nall concerned about throughout the Nation. I believe every Senator \nneeds to understand why gasoline prices are rising, why the days of \ncheap oil are unlikely to return anytime soon, and why programs such as \nPNGV are so important to our economic competitors.\n  During the last couple of weeks, we have heard a lot on the Senate \nfloor about the decline in domestic oil production and various \nproposals to stimulate new production. But production is only one side \nof the coin. A far more important factor in the long-term increase in \noil prices is the dramatic upsurge in worldwide demand for petroleum \nproducts. The steep increase in consumption here in the United States \ncompounds the worldwide situation.\n  Today, the U.S. transportation sector--this includes air, boat, rail, \nand highway travel, all of our transportation sector--is 95-percent \ndependent on oil. Transportation accounts for two-thirds of our \nNation's oil consumption and a quarter of our total energy use. While \nover the last 25 years the residential, the commercial, and industrial \nsectors have all been able to reduce their dependence on oil, the \ntransportation sector consumption of oil has skyrocketed.\n  I show you this chart. This shows petroleum use increases mainly \noccurring in the transportation sector. This chart goes back 30 years--\nfrom 1970 to the year 2000--and then forward for 20 years. If you look \nat these other areas, it tries to show the industrial use, and the \nresidential, commercial, or electric generation use of petroleum \nproducts. They are all relatively stable. The increases are not \nexcessive in those areas. In fact, there are declines in electric \ngeneration and residential and commercial. But in transportation the \nincrease is very substantial.\n\n  From the first gas price shock in 1973 until 1998, oil use for \ntransportation grew an astounding 37 percent. If that is not bad \nenough, according to this chart from the Energy Information Agency--let \nme show you this second chart. The demand for oil in the transportation \nsector is anticipated to increase another 46 percent over the next 20 \nyears.\n  Another key point from the chart is that over half of our oil \nconsumption for transportation is used for light-duty vehicles; that \nis, passenger vehicles and pickup trucks. Today, more people are \ndriving more miles in vehicles that use more fuel per mile. As you can \nsee, unless something is done, our passenger cars will consume half \nagain more fuel in 2020 than they do today.\n  I think all Senators agree on the need to reduce our dependence on \nimported oil. Today, America imports more than half of its oil. The \ncost of importing oil is a dangerous drag on our economy.\n  Reducing our dependence on imported oil is a daunting and long-term \nchallenge that will require a variety of measures. Surely efforts to \nincrease domestic production need to play a role in that strategy. \nHowever, I am afraid there is no silver bullet. Increased domestic \nproduction alone will not meet America's skyrocketing demand for oil.\n  With transportation accounting for two-thirds of our oil use, I \nbelieve the key is to reduce transportation demand through a wide range \nof measures, including technology advances that squeeze more useful \nenergy out of every drop of oil.\n  That's where PNGV comes in. Started in 1993, PNGV brings together the \nexpertise of the nation's colleges and universities, government \nagencies, national laboratories, suppliers, and the auto industry in a \n10-year effort to dramatically improve the fuel efficiency of passenger \nvehicles. PNGV research efforts are focused on developing breakthrough \ntechnologies that are key to improving fuel economy. Work is underway \non lightweight materials, aerodynamics, tires, power electronics, \nenergy storage, combustion science, fuel cells, and hybrid propulsion \nsystems.\n  The long-term goal of the program is to develop mid-size passenger \nsedans with up to three-times better fuel economy in a vehicle that \nretains all the\n\n[[Page S6320]]\n\nperformance, comfort, safety, and cost of today's comparable models.\n  In the past seven years, a number of PNGV's innovations have started \nto improve the fuel economy of today's production vehicles. Many of \nthese innovations originated in our national laboratories. I am pleased \nto see our laboratories are playing a major role in PNGV. Let me cite a \nfew examples of recent accomplishments:\n  One automaker is now using a technology developed at Sandia National \nLaboratories in Albuquerque, in my state of New Mexico, to produce axle \nshafts that are stronger, lighter, and less expensive.\n  The Pacific Northwest Laboratory in the Chairman's home state of \nWashington helped develop a hydroforming technique that is being used \nto shape door, deck and hood panels in current model vehicles.\n  Using analytical methods developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, \nautomakers are now producing pickup truck boxes from lightweight \ncomposite materials.\n  And Los Alamos National Laboratory, also in my state, is one of the \nworld leaders in fuel cell technology. Through PNGV, the lab's unique \ncapabilities are being brought to bear on what may well be the \nautomobile technology of the future. A fuel cell offers the highest \npossible efficiency with near zero emissions--certainly a goal worth \nstriving for.\n  In addition to producing immediate fuel savings, PNGV is a program \nthat is meeting its milestones. Earlier this year, and on schedule, all \nthree domestic automakers rolled out high efficiency concept vehicles: \nthe Ford Prodigy, DaimlerChrysler's ESX-3, and GM's Precept. These cars \ndemonstrated, for the first time, the technical feasibility of a 5-\npassenger, 80-mile per gallon vehicle. This is truly a remarkable \nachievement.\n  I believe all Senators agree that the views of the National Academy \nof Sciences carry considerable weight in this body. Just last month, \nthe Academy's National Research Council completed its sixth annual \nreview of PNGV. It had this to say about the program:\n\n       Though confronted with enormous technological problems, \n     PNGV has made significant progress in meeting its objectives, \n     and reaching the 2000 milestones represents an outstanding \n     effort.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the National Research \nCouncil's sixth report on PNGV be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the NRC's report went on to describe the \nmajor challenges that remain in the final four years of the program. \nPNGV's goal is ambitious but achievable: to develop production vehicles \nthat meet all safety and emissions standards while simultaneously \nmaintaining current vehicle cost levels. The increase in federal \nfunding in the bill before us today will help ensure that PNGV can meet \nits goal.\n  Last month, Chairman Gorton lead a debate here on the Senate floor \nabout fuel efficiency standards, and I want to thank him for his \neffort. I do believe it is an important issue. How ever that debate \neventually plays out, it should be clear that we are not going to be \nable to reduce our dangerous dependence on imported foreign oil without \nvehicles that are more efficient. And the American public is not going \nto stand for vehicles that do not provide the same levels of safety, \ncomfort, and performance they've come to expect. That's exactly what \nPNGV is all about.\n  I'd like to make one last point. Both Europe and Japan have recently \ntaken steps to raise the average fuel economy of their vehicles. In \nEurope, automakers are committed to increasing fuel economy by 33 \npercent by 2008. In Japan, fuel economy levels are set to increase 23 \npercent by 2010. I do believe fuel efficiency is an issue of \ninternational economic competitiveness. We must aggressively pursue \nefforts like PNGV, or risk falling behind in the global automotive \nmarket.\n  In closing, I am pleased that the Senate bill provides adequate \nfunding for PNGV. However, I am concerned this year about maintaining \nthe Senate's funding level for PNGV in conference. In what I believe \nwas a very wrongheaded action, the House all but eliminated funding for \nthis vital program. Mr. President, this is not the time to reduce our \ncommitment to cutting-edge research that offers the promise of dramatic \nreductions in our need for oil. I hope all senators will want to work \nwith the committee to maintain the Senate's funding level for PNGV as \nthe bill moves to conference.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Secretary \nRichardson opposing the House's actions be printed the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, PNGV represents the best of America's \nminds working together on one of the most important issues we face \ntoday.\n  I again thank Chairman Gorton, and Senator Byrd for their work on \nthis bill and especially for the funding they've provided for energy \nconservation and PNGV.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n              [From the National Academies, June 15, 2000]\n\n    Fuel Economy, Cost May Be Compromised To Meet Tougher Emission \n                   Standards in Next-Generation Cars\n\n       Washington.--A public-private partnership to create a \n     highly fuel-efficient car reached a major milestone earlier \n     this year with the unveiling of concept vehicles, but the \n     ability to meet both fuel-economy objectives and emission \n     standards by a 2004 deadline remains a monumental challenge, \n     says a new report from the National Academies' National \n     Research Council.\n       The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's new emissions \n     standards for vehicle exhaust, which will be phased in \n     beginning in 2004, are significantly more stringent than \n     those that were in place when the public-private program, \n     called the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles \n     (PNGV), was initiated six years ago. All of the demonstrated \n     concept vehicles--DaimlerChrysler's ESX3, Ford's Prodigy, and \n     GM's Precept--use hybrid electric technology, which \n     incorporates electric power from a battery with a small \n     diesel engine. While the concept vehicles can achieve a fuel \n     economy in the range of 70 to 80 miles per gallon, none meet \n     the new emission standards.\n       ``Though confronted with enormous technological problems, \n     PNGV has made significant progress in meeting its objectives, \n     and reaching the 2000 milestone represents an outstanding \n     effort,'' said Trevor O. Jones, chair of the committee that \n     wrote the report and chairman and chief executive officer of \n     Biomec Inc., Cleveland. ``As the program moves toward the \n     2004 deadline to introduce production prototype vehicles, \n     major attention will need to be devoted to meeting the new \n     emissions standards while simultaneously attaining cost and \n     fuel economy objectives, which continue to elude PNGV \n     engineers.''\n       In the committee's judgment, EPA's ``Tier 2'' standards for \n     nitrogen oxides and particulate matter will delay the use of \n     the diesel engine--and its significant fuel-economy benefit--\n     until systems can be developed that meet the new standards. \n     PNGV also may have to shift its attention to other internal \n     combustion engine designs with greater potential for \n     extremely low emissions and high fuel efficiency.\n       The partnership should develop models that can predict the \n     type and amount of emissions for a variety of engines and \n     exhaust treatment systems in different versions of hybrid \n     electric vehicles, the report says. These efforts will assist \n     researchers in evaluating the feasibility of meeting the Tier \n     2 standards and provide data that could then be used to \n     establish an appropriate plan for the next phase of the \n     program.\n       Currently, fuel cells--an alternative power source--have \n     the greatest potential to meet emissions standards and \n     energy-efficiency requirements. All of the vehicle \n     manufacturers are building concept vehicles powered by \n     fuel cells that are estimated to get up to an equivalent \n     of 100 mpg. Though notable progress has been made, the \n     automotive fuel cell remains a long-range development \n     facing significant hurdles, including the need to \n     substantially reduce costs, which are running about five \n     times higher than the program projected. The fuel cells \n     are targeted for production automobiles sometime after \n     2004 by some vehicle builders.\n       New types of fuel and the infrastructure of refineries, \n     distribution systems, and service stations are extremely \n     important considerations in developing both internal \n     combustion engines and fuel cells. The committee recommends \n     that PNGV and the petroleum industry more fully address fuel \n     issues and strengthen their cooperative programs.\n       As the program moves closer to commercially viable \n     vehicles, the National Highway and Traffic Safety \n     Administration should support major safety studies to \n     determine how lightweight cars perform in collisions with \n     heavier vehicles, the report says. These activities are \n     critically important because PNGV vehicles, although similar \n     in size to today's vehicles, will weigh much less with \n     lighter bodies, frames, interior components, and window \n     glass.\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\n       Although substantial accomplishments have been made, high \n     cost is a serious problem in almost every area of the PNGV \n     program, the committee said. The costs of most components of \n     the concept vehicles are higher than their target values. For \n     example, research continues to be conducted on aluminum and \n     other composite materials for use in major vehicle \n     components, but costs still are not competitive with steel. \n     Battery costs are at least three times greater than the \n     program's target. And DaimlerChrysler has estimated that its \n     ESX3 concept vehicle would cost $7,500 more than a \n     traditional vehicle in its class.\n       Given the complexity of the assignment and the tight \n     timeline, the committee lauded PNGV's technical teams for \n     their overall achievements and effectiveness in meeting \n     project goals and their ability to develop solid industry-\n     government-academia working relationships despite their \n     competitive positions. And while the individual car \n     manufacturers took different approaches in building their \n     concept vehicles, all have made significant contributions and \n     benefited by using technologies developed through the \n     collaborative program. Further, many of the technologies--\n     such as lightweight body materials--are being incorporated \n     into vehicles that are in production today.\n       The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles is an \n     alliance of U.S. government agencies and the U.S. Council for \n     Automotive Research (USCAR), whose members are the country's \n     three major automakers--DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and General \n     Motors. PNGV was formed in late 1993 to develop an affordable \n     midsize vehicle by 2004 with a fuel economy of up to 80 mpg--\n     three times more efficient than today's vehicles--while \n     meeting or exceeding government safety and emission \n     requirements. Since 1994, the Research Council has conducted \n     annual reviews of the program's goals and progress at the \n     request of the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n       The study was sponsored by the U.S. departments of \n     Commerce, Energy, and Transportation. The Research Council is \n     the principal operating arm of the National Academy of \n     Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. It is a \n     private, nonprofit institution that provides independent \n     advice on science and technology issues under a congressional \n     charter.

Ralph Regula,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies, \n         Committee on Appropriations, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express my concern \n     regarding yesterday's House action to effectively terminate \n     Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) \n     activities. I thank you for your efforts to defeat this \n     amendment. I know you agree that especially now, during this \n     current spike in energy prices, is not the time to reduce the \n     U.S. commitment to cutting-edge research and development that \n     will reduce our dependence on petroleum.\n       The Sununu amendment virtually eliminates the entire budget \n     for the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). \n     This is a matter of great concern to the Department, since \n     PNGV has been a highly successful program aimed at reducing \n     our country's growing consumption of petroleum products for \n     transportation. As gasoline prices exceed $2.00 per gallon in \n     the mid-west, we are reminded that the United States has \n     become increasingly vulnerable to oil price shocks and supply \n     disruptions. Other impacts of this growing petroleum \n     consumption are greater air pollution and increasing \n     greenhouse gas emissions.\n       Technologies from PNGV results have already appeared in \n     cars available for sale today. Earlier this year, the three \n     PNGV year 2000 concept cars demonstrated the technical \n     feasibility of 80 mile per gallon 5-passenger sedans. Each of \n     these cars represents a unique approach to the challenges \n     addressed by PNGV and showcases the progress made in advanced \n     technology research and development through the partnership. \n     The work is not finished, however.\n       Major challenges remain to be addressed during the final \n     four years of this program, especially the size, weight, cost \n     and emissions performance of individual components. The \n     reliability of these technologies, both individually and in \n     the context of a system, also needs to be demonstrated.\n       In its sixth review of the PNGV, released today, the \n     National Research Council (NRC) notes that, measured against \n     the magnitude of the challenge, ``PNGV is making good \n     progress.'' The NRC characterizes meeting the PNGV 2000 \n     concept vehicle milestone as ``an outstanding . . . effort.''\n       Given projections of substantial growth in the number of \n     vehicles worldwide in the years ahead, combined with \n     uncertainty about the ability of worldwide petroleum \n     production to keep up, it would be extremely unwise to \n     terminate this program that is key to developing high energy \n     efficiency vehicles without compromising the features that \n     make them attractive to U.S. consumers.\n       Also, it is vital, during a period of increasing worldwide \n     competition to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles, that we \n     maintain support for U.S. producers. In view of significant \n     support being provided by governments in Europe and Japan, it \n     seems particularly ill-advised for us to abandon our \n     leadership. Any reduction in PNGV funding would jeopardize \n     achievement of our objectives.\n       I appreciate your leadership in protecting energy research \n     and development funding. If you have further questions, you \n     may contact me or have a member of your staff contact Mr. \n     John C. Angell, Assistant Secretary for Congressional and \n     Intergovernmental Affairs, at (202) 586-5450.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                  Bill Richardson.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from New Mexico \non his presentation and I ask if he will return to the two charts.\n  I appreciate the kind words of the Senator from New Mexico on this \ngeneral field. My own view is we do need to do what we can to produce \nmore petroleum products from sources that are within the control of the \nUnited States. I am convinced we also, in meeting this challenge, need \nto move aggressively toward the development and increased use of \nalternative fuels for our automobiles. Even if we are relatively \nsuccessful in both of those courses of action, the challenge of an \nincreased dependence and increased use of fossil fuels in \ntransportation, or of even alternative fuels, is simply going to \ncontinue to grow.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, in stressing the importance of a greater \ndegree of efficiency in the use of energy for transportation purposes, \nis directly on point. As he stated, this appropriations bill includes a \nmodest increase in its appropriation for the Partnership for a New \nGeneration of Vehicles, a program I have supported ever since I took \nthe chairmanship of this subcommittee. I think it is very important to \nthe country as a whole. I think it is a constructive partnership \nbetween government and the private sector.\n  I am delighted to have a Member speak on this specific element of the \nbill that I had to pass over rather quickly. The top line on the chart \nindicates the nature of the problem.\n  The Senator from New Mexico also mentioned my effort in a different \nappropriations bill, once again, to go back to mandated, better fuel \nefficiency standards on the part of automobiles and small trucks. That \nis at least a first cousin, if not closer, to the proposition to which \nthe Senator from New Mexico is speaking.\n  If we are to be successful, if we are to turn that rapidly rising \nline in the chart and even flatten it out, it seems\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\nto me we have to engage in all of these. The subject about which he \nspoke is particularly important.\n  I can assure the Senator from New Mexico that in a conference \ncommittee with the House on this subject, I will hold out as eloquently \nas I possibly can for the full Senate appropriation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I respond by thanking the Senator from \nWashington for his comments and indicate that I think his leadership on \nthis issue is extremely important, particularly so given the \nwrongheaded action the House of Representatives has taken in their bill \nof essentially zeroing out the funding for this very important program \nafter 6 successful years of progress in a 10-year program.\n  I am encouraged by the Senator's statements. I will certainly do \nanything I can to assist the Senator in seeing to it that this is \nadequately funded in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I take a few minutes to comment on the \nbill and some of the areas of particular concern.\n  First, I recognize and thank the chairman and Senator Byrd for their \ngood work. It is a tough job on any appropriations bill to hold down \nspending and keep it within the budget. Yet it is very difficult to set \nthe priorities. This is one of the hardest jobs in the Congress. I \nappreciate the work they have done.\n  Particularly in this Interior bill, it is very hard to put together a \nbill that gets support throughout the entire Congress, representing all \nthe States in the country, when a large part of the activity goes on, \nof course, in the public land States.\n  I want to comment on a few of those areas that are of particular \nconcern to those who live in the West, where much of the State is owned \nby the Federal Government, ranging from 25 to nearly 90 percent of some \nStates belonging to the Federal Government. Our economy, our future, \nall those things are tied very closely to what happens with the \nmanagement of Federal lands. Much of that is within this budget of \nInterior.\n  I am particularly pleased, as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nNational Parks, that the funding for national parks is in this budget, \nas well. Certainly we would all like to see as much support as possible \nfor parks, but there is an increase here, as there has been over the \npast several years. There are some 379 parks in this country, national \nparks, all of which are quite different--from Yellowstone to the Statue \nof Liberty--parks that are unique.\n\n  The idea, of course, is to have the basic support for parks come from \nappropriations. We have developed over the past several years some \nalternative support, supplemental sources of funding that are not meant \nto replace, of course, but simply to supplement. These are such things \nas demonstration fees, which are then used in the park in which they \nare collected, or highway funds which come from the highways and go to \nthe parks. I am thinking particularly in this case of Yellowstone Park, \nwhere highways are a very important part of their funding. Much of that \ngoes there. We encourage contributions that can be made from the \nprivate sector.\n  There are several areas of concern, of course. One of them is PILT--\npayment in lieu of taxes. This is a program designed for a county where \nmuch of the land is owned by the Federal Government, where they would \nnormally have real estate taxes that would come in through the \noperations of the county. Of course, when the Federal Government owns \nthe land, those taxes are not collected and therefore this is a \nreplacement and one that has been there for a very long time. It is \nquite important. It is very important because, in most cases, the \ncounties provide the kinds of services on the public lands that they \nwould provide on the private lands, even though the Federal Government, \nby its nature, does not pay the taxes. So these are payments that are \nmade in lieu of.\n  There are some increases in this budget over the last year, but not \nnearly equal to the taxes that would be collected if the Federal \nGovernment did not own the land. So to the extent that is some \nmeasurement of fairness, then we are still quite below where we ought \nto be in the PILT area. We raised the authorization a number of years \nago. Now it is tied to some kind of growth in the economy. We are, of \ncourse, quite below what the authorized level would be. We have some \nincreases. We would like to have some consideration given to them.\n  Large amounts of land in Wyoming belong to the Federal Government--in \nthe entire West. It creates some responsibility. Last week I met with \ncounty commissioners in Big Horn, WY, and their primary concern was \nwhat we are going to do with PILT because much of their county is \nFederal land. We have a unique relationship with the Federal \nGovernment. The Government depends on local communities to provide this \ninfrastructure. Without the support of these counties, the Federal \nGovernment would be unable to manage theirs. I am talking about \nhighways; I am talking about police protection; I am talking about \nhealth care and emergency care. All these things are provided without \nthe basis of support that is usually there. So that is what the payment \nin lieu of taxes is all about. I know it is very difficult, but I think \nit is a program that merits some consideration and perhaps we will have \nthe opportunity to increase those payments somewhat.\n  Actually, it is not confined to Western States. About 49 different \nStates participate in the PILT program throughout the country, \nincluding the District of Columbia and three territories, so, of \ncourse, it is widespread in support.\n  Earlier this year, we had 57 Senators join in a letter supporting an \nincrease in PILT funding. I will submit, a little later, for \nconsideration some opportunity perhaps to give a little boost to that \nkind of funding. It is something that has a real meaning.\n\n  Let me give a little example. We have 23 counties in my State of \nWyoming. Teton County is 96 percent Federally owned, Park County, 82 \npercent federally owned, on down the line; in Big Horn County, which I \nmentioned a little while ago, 80 percent of that county belongs to the \nFederal Government. It goes on. So I think there is a great deal of \ninterest in that, and in the question of fairness.\n  Let me say, too, even though the appropriations are not actually the \narea where these kinds of decisions are often made, I think it is \nimportant to recognize this administration has made a drive towards the \nend. I understand the President is seeking to change the legacy to be \none of a sort of Theodore Roosevelt thing, with land acquisition, the \nproposal to have 40 million acres roadless, in addition to the \nAntiquities Act and other things. This is going on currently.\n  One of the difficulties is not so much the idea of controlling roads. \nI have no problem with that. There should not be roads everywhere; we \nneed to take a look at them. I am more concerned about the method in \nwhich it has been undertaken. Rather than having a major decision made \nby bureaucrats in Washington, we ought to go through the process. We \nhave what are called forest studies over several years, and we have \nforest planning. That is where it ought to be done, so the people \nlocally can participate.\n  We have talked about all the meetings we have had, and I have \nattended some of them, but the problem is, because this was done on a \nnationwide basis, hardly anyone who came to the meetings knew what they \nwere talking about, including many of the people from the Forest \nService. So there needs to be some real input. Perhaps there is \nsomething we can do to slow down that area.\n  Going back to parks, there are some 27 or 28 parks where one of the \naccess functions that people enjoy is using snow machines in the \nwintertime in places such as Teton Park and Yellowstone Park and in \nMinnesota--there are a number there. Now we have another one of these \nbureaucratic knee-jerk responses that we are going to eliminate the use \nof snowmobiles in national parks.\n  I do not argue there ought not be some control. There should be, and \nthere can be. There ought to be some control over the machines \nthemselves. The manufacturers have said they are willing to do that, to \nlower the noise and do something about the emissions. The problem is \nthe EPA has never set up any standards with which they need to comply. \nI understand if you are going to put a great deal of money into\n\n[[Page S6323]]\n\nresearch to change these machines, you have to know where you need to \nbe to be able to comply. We have never done this.\n  In addition, even though it seems as if a lot of people are using \nthem, there are many fewer using the facilities in the wintertime. So \nit would have been possible, if the park had managed the snow machines \nrather than just letting them go, to separate the uses if they conflict \nwith one another. If you have snow machines conflicting with cross-\ncountry skiers, in most parts you can have some space in between them. \nThe park is never managed. Instead of seeking to manage these kinds of \nthings, they simply say: Now we are going to do away with them.\n  The real issue there is access. Parks and public lands at least have \ntwo major functions. One is to preserve the resource. The second is to \ngive the owners, who are the taxpayers, an opportunity to enjoy them. \nOne of the ways of enjoying them is, in this case, a snow machine. \nRather than simply eliminate it, it seems to me we ought to take a \nlittle bit more time and find some ways to fit that into what we are \ndoing, whether it is used for hunting or hiking or sightseeing.\n\n  We were talking about energy over here. One of the reasons we are \nhaving energy problems is that our domestic production is down. One of \nthe reasons it is down is we have made it more difficult to have access \nin the public lands. In Wyoming, that is a real problem because half \nthe land belongs to the Federal Government.\n  So I think there are a lot of things we can do to be able to still \nprotect the resource yet provide for multiple use of those resources.\n  Finally, there is grazing. A year ago, the Senate bill had language \nin it that if the Bureau of Land Management, didn't have the resources \nto go in and investigate and take a look at a grazing allotment--if the \nBLM did not get there, as they were supposed to, then they could cancel \nthe allotment of this grazing. All we are saying is, when the BLM can't \nget to it, until they are able to, they ought to be able to go on as \nthey have before, under their original contract. That is language that \nshould be there. We would like to make sure it is there as we go \nthrough this.\n  Finally, there is a wild horse problem. We have a large number of \nwild horses in Wyoming. Not many people have to deal with that problem. \nThe administration has requested $9 million for the next 4 years as \npart of an effort to bring the wild horses back to manageable levels. \nAs a matter of fact, in the Red Desert of Wyoming, about 10 years ago, \nthere was a lawsuit which required that these numbers be brought down. \nThe BLM has never done that. Now they say: We can't do it unless we \nhave some additional funding. The House funded the administration's \nrequest, but an amendment on the floor brought it down to $5 million. \nThe Senate bill does not fund the administration's request. Now we have \nthe possibility of BLM taking money away from other uses unless they \nhave some more resources to handle these wild horses.\n  I hope we can talk about some of these issues. I understand they are \nunique problems. I do not think there are many wild horses in Rhode \nIsland, but they are in other places. This is the kind of bill where we \nhave to deal with the unique things that happen in the West.\n  Again, I appreciate very much the work of the chairman. I know he \ncomes from a western State with a considerable amount of unique and \npublic resources as well. I also know that he is very interested in \ndealing with them fairly.\n  I compliment that effort. I want to work with him to see if we can \ndeal with some of these other unique problems that arise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My colleague from Missouri is very gracious and I can \ndo this in 30 seconds.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3772\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for emergency expenses resulting from \n                              wind storms)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mr. Grams, proposes an amendment numbered 3772.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 165, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n       For an additional amount for emergency expenses resulting \n     from damage from windstorms, $7,249,000 to become available \n     upon enactment of this Act and, to remain available until \n     expended: Provided, That the entire amount shall be available \n     only to the extent that the President submits to Congress an \n     official budget request for a specific dollar amount that \n     includes designation of the entire amount of the request as \n     an emergency requirement for the purposes of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. \n     900 et seq.): Provided further, That the entire amount is \n     designated by Congress as an emergency requirement under \n     section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901(b)(2)(A)).\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment, again, is to restore \n$7.2 million in emergency funding. My colleague from Washington made a \nhelpful suggestion. Senator Grams is coming back from Minnesota today. \nI believe we can do this together. I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment be laid aside, and when Senator Grams comes back, we will \ntalk tonight. We will both come out together.

Mr. President, on a number of occasions, I have come to \nthis floor to talk about the importance of women-owned businesses. \nWomen-owned businesses employ more than 27.5 million people and \ngenerate over $3.6 billion in sales and have grown by 103 percent in \nthe past 4 years.\n  As one of the fastest growing segments of the economy, women-owned \nsmall businesses are essential to America's future prosperity, as well \nas the prosperity and the well-being of the individual communities and \nparticularly the families of those women who own businesses.\n  In recognition of this growth and contribution to our economic life, \nI convened with a bipartisan group of policymakers a national women's \nsmall business summit entitled ``New Leaders for a New Century,'' which \nwas held in Kansas City, MO, on June 4 and 5 of this year. The \ncosponsors of that conference were my ranking member on the Small \nBusiness Committee, Senator John Kerry, along with Senators Dianne \nFeinstein, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Olympia Snowe, and Mary Landrieu.\n  Today I am very pleased to announce that we are releasing a report of \nthe recommendations of the women who attended this summit. Copies will \nbe available in every office. It will be available through the Small \nBusiness Committee, and later I will also ask that portions be printed \nin the Record.\n  Because the conference was designed to elicit directly the views, \nconcerns, and policy recommendations of women business owners, we \nlearned more about the obstacles women entrepreneurs face and the \nspecific issues which are of the utmost importance to them.\n  It is interesting; what we learned is this: Despite the advances \nwomen have made in the entrepreneurial area, their top priorities \nremain, first, procuring their fair share of Federal contracts. We have \nalready dealt with that on this floor, and in a bipartisan, \noverwhelming vote on a resolution said the Federal Government needs to \nlive up to its legislatively mandated responsibility to set aside 5 \npercent of small\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\nbusiness contracts for women small business owners. They have not even \ncome halfway to the goal.\n  Second, the women business owners who met with us are very much \nconcerned about taxes. They said their top priority was getting rid of \nthe death tax. Small business owners do not know when they will owe the \nestate or death tax or how much they will owe, so they have enormously \nhigh compliance costs.\n  A survey by the National Association of Women Business Owners found \nthat the estate tax imposed almost $60,000 in death-tax-related cost on \nwomen business owners. That is not taxes imposed; that is how much it \ncost the average woman-owned small business to figure out what the \ndeath tax implication would be.\n  As a congressman colleague in Missouri once said, there ought be no \ntaxation without respiration. That was the overwhelming view of the \nwomen in this conference.\n  In addition, the report outlines the women's views on what the \nFederal Government can do to help women entrepreneurs in areas such as \naccess to capital, pensions and retirement, expanding markets, and \nhealth care. By asking women small business owners themselves to \nidentify their professional concerns and make corresponding policy \nrecommendations, we as policymakers, as legislators, should be able to \ncraft our agenda much more effectively, and that agenda is oversight of \nthe Small Business Administration and other Government agencies \ncomplying with the law, as well as legislative recommendations. This, \nwe think, should facilitate even greater success on the part of current \nwomen small business owners and also offer incentives to more women to \nconsider becoming business owners themselves.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the conclusion of the \nreport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The Summit participants were a diverse group of experienced \n     women business owners who presented their candid views in \n     response to the challenge from the Summit's sponsors. The \n     participants' discussions focused on a vast number of wide-\n     ranging issues and problems in seven areas confronting women-\n     owned small businesses. There was no script directing the \n     agenda. The Summit was participant-driven--the participants \n     identified problems, they formulated solutions, and they put \n     the recommendations in priority order.\n       Each participant brought a unique perspective to the \n     Summit. One half of all participants had companies that had \n     been in business for at least 10 years. Eighty-six percent of \n     the women small-business owners were between the ages of 35 \n     and 64. These seasoned executives and entrepreneurs brought \n     years of experience to the table, and they are the best \n     source for ideas on and solutions to the pressing problems \n     confronting women-owned businesses in America today.\n       The issue singled out as the top priority by the Summit \n     participants were Federal procurement. The participants at \n     the highly attended Procurement session made a series of 13 \n     recommendations. From this list, the participants' number one \n     priority was that Federal agencies must begin awarding 5% of \n     their contract dollars to women-owned small businesses. This \n     5% goal was established by Congress in 1994, and Federal \n     agencies have failed to reach even one-half of the goal--\n     2.5%--every year since the goal was enacted into law.\n       The second highest-ranked priority area for women business \n     owners was the availability of capital, with a particular \n     emphasis on their inability to raise equity investment \n     capital. For start-up and fast-growing companies, the ability \n     to raise equity capital is often critical to building a \n     successful business. Equity infusions are designed to \n     strengthen a company's balance sheet, which enables it to \n     borrow money from banks and other commercial lenders in order \n     to meet the company's day-to-day operating needs. The door to \n     equity capital has been effectively shut and locked for the \n     vast majority of women business owners.\n       The Summit's goal was to ensure that the recommendations \n     from the participants receive serious scrutiny from the 107th \n     Congress and the new Administration as they are sworn-in this \n     coming January. New incentives should be developed in some \n     areas to help women-owned small businesses continue to \n     thrive. But in other areas, government must simply stay out \n     of the way and let these entrepreneurs do what they do best--\n     run successful companies. At the same time, the heads of \n     Federal agencies need to be held accountable when their \n     agency fails to do its part under the law, such as with the \n     requirement that the Federal government must award 5% of its \n     contracts to women-owned small businesses.\n       With all of the participants' specific recommendations in \n     each of the respective topic areas, the Congress and the \n     Executive Branch have a new mandate--listen to what women \n     shall-business owners have said and answer their call to \n     action. In that vein, this report will be distributed to \n     every Member of the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives and to the President of the United States in \n     order to ensure that the Summit's recommendations are in the \n     forefront of what needs to be done to help small businesses. \n     The major issues singled out by the Summit participants must \n     be the focus of the Congress and the Administration as they \n     work to support and assist women-owned small businesses, \n     which are so critical to the continued economic prosperity of \n     this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6324-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                            2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, tucked into a sheltered green valley in \nSouthern West Virginia is a magical place, a place where fascinating \nhistory, natural majesty, and sumptuous comfort have combined since the \nfirst days of our nation's founding to create a spot that is justly \nworld-renowned. That place, Mr. President, is called The Greenbrier, in \nWhite Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. It has been a special place for \nseveral decades now, overflowing with game for the Shawnee Indians, a \nspa since colonial days, a place of high society idylls and balls, \nfought over during the Civil War, a World War II diplomatic internment \nsite and then a rest and recuperation hospital for wounded soldiers, \nand a secret government relocation site--all cloaked behind the well-\nbred, white-columned face of a grand southern belle of a resort.\n  Mr. President, in May, my wife Erma and I celebrated our 63rd \nanniversary. Erma is my childhood sweetheart, the former Erma Ora \nJames. We have written a lot of history together over the past 63 \nyears, and I could not ask for a better coauthor.\n  This year, as we have in the last several years, we celebrated at the \nfabled Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs. I am certainly not \noriginal in my inspiration to celebrate moments of marital bliss \nthere--President John Tyler, the first President to be married in \noffice, spent part of his 1844 honeymoon in White Sulphur Springs. \nActors Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher spent part of their 1955 \nhoneymoon there, and Mr. and Mrs. Joseph P. Kennedy arrived at the \nGreenbrier on October 11, 1914, for a two-week honeymoon. Many, many, \nother famous names are inscribed in the Greenbrier's guest register. \nThe history that Erma and I have created together is a blink of the eye \ncompared to that of The Greenbrier, whose healing waters were first \nenjoyed by hardy colonists in 1778, as they had been by Shawnee Indians \nfor untold years before that.\n\n  The Greenbrier has been a resort almost since the day in 1778 that \nMrs. Anderson, one of the first homesteaders in the Greenbrier area of \nthe ``Endless Mountains,'' as the region was identified on colonial \nmaps, first tested the wondrous mineral waters on her chronic \nrheumatism. Word of Mrs. Anderson's recovery spread rapidly, and \nnumerous log cabins were soon erected near the spring. The ``summer \nseason'' at the spring was born, albeit in a somewhat primitive state.\n  Still, the fame of the spring along Howard's Creek continued to \nspread. Thomas Jefferson mentioned ``Howard's Creek of Green Briar'' in \nhis\n\n[[Page S6325]]\n\n``Notes on the State of Virginia'' in 1784; that same year, George \nWashington focused the Virginia legislature's attention on the \ncommercial prospects of the ``Old State Road'' running between the \nKanawha River valley, through The Greenbrier's lands, to the piedmont \nand tidewater sections of Virginia. Along the route of today's roadway \nbetween the hotel and the golf clubhouse stands a monument to this \nvision. The Buffalo Trail monument commemorates the point at which the \npre-colonial Indian Buffalo Trail crossed the Allegheny Mountains on \nits way from the Atlantic Coast to Ohio. This trail became the James \nRiver and Kanawha Turnpike, which for over a century carried commerce \nand development from the settled East to the future states of West \nVirginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. By 1809, a \ntavern with a dining room, a barn, a stable, mills, and numerous cabins \nconstituted a hospitable stopping place along the still-rugged route \nWest. And rheumatism sufferers were joined at this watering hole by \nothers more interested in the creature comforts and social interaction \nthan in relieving joint pain.\n  By 1815, the first spring house was built over the spring head, and a \nthriving resort was attracting visitors who typically stayed for \nseveral weeks at a time. A hotel and many surrounding cottages, some \nquite sumptuous, were erected over the years. Commodore Stephen \nDecatur, hero of the Barbary Wars, brought his wife for a 16-day stay \nin 1817, and Henry Clay of Kentucky, Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, spent some time at White Sulphur Springs during \nseveral summers over some 30 years. The cool mountain breezes under the \nshelter of ancient oaks, combined with stylish fans and gentle rocking \nchairs on a shady porch, made the Greenbrier a comfortable spot in \nthose sweltering summers before air conditioning.\n  In many ways, the Greenbrier has changed little over the years. The \ngracious sweep of lawn, the stately trees, the ranks of white cottages \nand imposing hotel facades hark back to that earlier era. Many of the \ncottages, most too sumptuous to be called merely ``cottages,'' have \ntheir own special histories. One of the cottages was owned by Jerome \nNapoleon Bonaparte, who was a nephew of the French Emperor. General \nJohn J. Pershing, Commander of the Allied Forces in World War I \ncompleted his memoirs in the cottage named ``Top Notch.'' Early morning \nhorseback rides are still popular, and Erma and I recently enjoyed the \nromantic carriage ride through the grounds. Hunting, fishing, and even \nfalconry are still practiced. But more golf courses, tennis courts, and \nswimming pools encourage a more active lifestyle than in those early \ndays. The Greenbrier is justly famous for its golf and for the Sam \nSnead Golf School. Though I do not play, I still enjoy the beautifully \nlandscaped courses with their wide sweeps of lawn and water dotted with \nsandy island obstacles. The partaking of the sulfur water, that \nelemental component of the original spa experience, is now complemented \nby health and beauty facilities and services that pamper every part of \nyou. A visit to the Greenbrier has grown ever more restorative over the \nyears.\n  Henry Clay, that great man from Kentucky, the State of the Senator \nwho now presides over the Senate with a dignity and degree of charm and \nskill and poise as rare as a day in June, often visited at the \nGreenbrier, as I have said.\n  Henry Clay was an early political fan of the Greenbrier, surely the \nmost gracious and comfortable stopping place on his many trips between \nWashington and his home in Kentucky. Other well-known figures and \nluminaries who visited the resort prior to the Civil War were \nPresidents Martin Van Buren, Andrew Jackson, Millard Fillmore, Franklin \nPierce, and James Buchanan. I have already noted that President John \nTyler honeymooned at the Greenbrier. Dolly Madison, Daniel Webster, \nDavy Crockett, Francis Scott Key, and John C. Calhoun, and many other \npolitical notables have also contributed to engrossing dinner \nconversations there in more recent years, including Senate greats such \nas Everett Dirksen, Sam Ervin, Jacob Javits, and Barry Goldwater. Other \npoliticians preferred the outstanding golf at the resort, including \nPresident Eisenhower, President Nixon (as a Vice President), and Vice \nPresident Hubert Humphrey. President Woodrow Wilson has also graced the \nGreenbrier, though I do not know if he was a golfer.\n  The Greenbrier has always been a favorite spot of other celebrities, \nas well. The Vanderbilts, Astors, Hearsts, Forbes, Luces, DuPonts, and \nthe Kennedys have sojourned there, as did Prince Ranier and Princess \nGrace with their children Albert and Caroline. The Duke and Duchess of \nWindsor danced the night away in the grand ballroom. Bing Crosby has \nsung there, and Johnny Carson, Steve Allen, Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, \nRudi Valle, Art Buchwald, Dr. Jonas Salk, Cyrus Eaton, and the Reverend \nBilly Graham have all made mealtime conversations there sparkle more \nthan the crystal chandeliers in the dining room. Babe Ruth and Lou \nGehrig are just two of the sporting greats who have autographed the \nguest register. Clare Booth Luce wrote the first draft of her most \nenduring play, ``The Women'', during a three-day stay in 1936. Like \nTennyson's brook, the fascinating list of notables could go on and on \nforever. People watching--that is watching people--has always been a \nspectator sport at Greenbrier functions!\n  The Greenbrier has experienced trauma as well as galas. During the \nCivil War, the Greenbrier's location astride a strategic rail line into \nRichmond, Virginia, put her in the line of fire. Troops were billeted \nin her guest rooms, but both sides spared a favorite pre-war vacation \nsite and fighting raged along the Greenbrier River. Being in what \nbecame Southern West Virginia, during the debate over succession in \n1863, the Greenbrier's fate as a West Virginia or a Virginia citizen \nwas uncertain. I am surely glad that West Virginia was the winner!\n  During Reconstruction, the hotel's healing waters also helped to heal \nthe wounds of war, as grand society from both sides of the conflict \ncontinued to meet at the Greenbrier. General Robert E. Lee was a \nfrequent visitor. In General Robert E. Lee's single post-war political \nstatement, he led a group of prominent Southern leaders vacationing at \nthe Greenbrier in drafting and signing what became known as ``The White \nSulphur Manifesto'' of 1868. This document, widely reprinted in \nnewspapers across the country, declared that, in the minds of these \nmen, questions of secession from the Union and slavery ``were decided \nby war,'' and that, upon the reestablishment of self-governance in the \nSouth, the Southern people would ``faithfully obey the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States, treat the Negro populations with kindness \nand humanity and fulfill every duty incumbent on peaceful citizens, \nloyal to the Constitution of their country.'' The war was truly over.\n\n  In 1869, one of the most famous photographs ever taken at White \nSulphur Springs included Robert E. Lee and a group of former \nConfederate Generals, among them Henry Wise of Virginia, P.G.T. \nBeauregard of Louisiana, and Bankhead Magruder of Virginia. Other ex-\nConfederate officers who visited the resort were Alexander Lawton of \nGeorgia, Joseph Brent of Maryland, James Conner of South Carolina, \nMartin Gary of South Carolina, and Robert Lilley of Virginia. Former \nUnion General William S. Rosecrans visited General Lee while Lee was \nvacationing one summer at the Greenbrier.\n  The Greenbrier has served the nation well in two other wars, as \nwell--World War II and the Cold War. At the outbreak of World War II, \nthe hotel served as a rather gilded cage for several thousand foreign \ndiplomats and their families, from Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, \nand, later, Japan. It was then taken over by the federal government for \nthe Army's use as a rest and recuperation hospital for wounded \nsoldiers, before returning, like the soldiers it housed, to civilian \nlife.\n  Much has been made, in recent years, of the Greenbrier's secret life \nas a covert agent of the U.S. government. In 1992, the existence of an \nemergency government relocation center built secretly deep beneath the \nGreenbrier was revealed. The result of an extraordinary partnership \nbetween the CSX Corporation and the federal government, the bunker \ncontained facilities to house and operate the entire United States \nCongress in the event of nuclear attack. It had its origin in plans \ncreated by President Eisenhower to ensure\n\n[[Page S6326]]\n\nthe survival of the constitutional system of checks and balances. The \nPresident had to convince Congressional leaders, including Senate \nMajority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, to go along with the plan, which was \ncarried out in the greatest secrecy for over forty years. The secrecy \nwas necessary, because the bunker at the Greenbrier was not designed to \nwithstand a direct hit, but, rather, to ensure security through a \ncombination of physical design and camouflage. The remote shelter of \nthe West Virginia hills proved a perfect combination of cover, \nconcealment, and denial.\n  Now, the bunker is open to the public for tours. It is fascinating to \nsee the level of detail that was included in the bunker, but it is also \nsobering to reflect upon the real fear of Armageddon that existed in \nthis country during those years and which justified this kind of \ncontingency planning. As you finish the tour and return to the sunlit \nworld of golf, lazy country walks, luxurious settings, and fine dining \nthat is the hallmark of the Greenbrier experience, it is difficult to \nrecall those not-so-distant times when school children practiced hiding \nunder their desks in the event of a conventional or nuclear exchange.\n  I encourage my fellow Senators, and, indeed, anyone listening, to \nvisit the Greenbrier, to tour the bunker, and to relish the history and \nthe service that are so much a part of this precious piece of West \nVirginia. Avoid the current high gas prices and road congestion, and \ntake the train as so many have before you. Leave steamy, contentious, \nWashington behind for a time, and step out at the Greenbrier's rail \ndepot wondering at the beauty, the cool breezes that smell of fresh, \nclean air and wildflowers. Allow yourself to be swept along by the \nattentive, unobtrusive service of an earlier age and be deposited in a \nbright, flower-bedecked room before a pre-dinner stroll about the \ngrounds. You will be walking with the celebrities of the past as you \nwrite a wonderful new chapter in your own history.\n\n  I was mentioning the Amtrak train. My recollection went back to a \ntime in England when the distinguished Senator from Washington, Slade \nGorton, and his nice wife Sally, and Erma and I rode the train from \nLondon up to York. Oh, my, what a wonderful time we had in York, \nvisiting through the countryside with its narrow roads and its hedges \nand having our meetings with the British. Those were most enjoyable \ndays and memorable ones.\n  But riding the train in itself is a real treat. I like to ride \ntrains, and I know Slade Gorton does, too. Has he ever told about his \nbicycle journey across the United States? He and his wife and their \nchildren traveled by bicycle, a bicycle odyssey, across the United \nStates of America, all the way from the Pacific to the Atlantic. That \nwould be something worth reading about. Better still, talk with him in \nperson about it.\n  I close with the immortal words and images of the poet William \nWordsworth, who lived from 1770 to 1850, when the Greenbrier was yet in \nits early days. But his lines eloquently capture the sights one can now \nhappen upon when strolling through the magical grounds of this \nwonderful outpost of gentle civilization amid the mountains, and they \ncapture the happiness such beauty inspires:\n\n     I wandered lonely as a cloud\n     That floats on high o'er vales and hills,\n     When all at once I saw a crowd,\n     A host, of golden daffodils;\n     Beside the lake, beneath the trees,\n     Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.\n\n     Continuous as the stars that shine\n     And twinkle on the milky way,\n     They stretched in never-ending line\n     Along the margin of a bay:\n     Ten thousand saw I at a glance,\n     Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.\n\n     The waves beside them danced; but they\n     Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:\n     A poet could not but be gay,\n     In such a jocund company:\n     I gazed--and gazed--but little thought\n     What wealth the show to me had brought:\n\n     For oft, when on my couch I lie\n     In vacant or in pensive mood,\n     They flash upon that inward eye\n     Which is the bliss of solitude;\n     And then my heart with pleasure fills,\n     And dances with the daffodils.\n\n  Like the Greenbrier, the forests in West Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I say to the Senator from West \nVirginia how much I appreciate that rendition and bringing us back to a \nbetter reality here from time to time.\n  I remember the comments by that same poet who once said:\n\n     Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers,\n     Little we see in nature that is ours.\n\n  I don't think anyone can ever say that about the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. He said, ``we lay waste our powers.'' But I can assure you \nthat the Senator from Tennessee doesn't lay awaste his powers. He is a \nbusy man, and he serves his country and his State in a great fashion.\n  I thank the Senator for his kind words.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I appreciate that very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6326-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6326-S6328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I rose on the floor on June 22 to \naddress a matter of great concern to everyone, the issue of \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  A couple of years ago, I was watching late night television and ran \nacross a seminar being conducted by former Senator Sam Nunn. Someone \nasked him during a question and answer period what he considered to be \nthe greatest threat to the United States of America. He mentioned \nterrorism and the new emerging threat of weapons of mass destruction.\n  A short time after that, I was watching the Charlie Rose Show late \none night with former Secretary of State Warren Christopher. When asked \nthe same question, he gave the same answer: That post cold war, we have \nnot concerned ourselves perhaps very much with some of these issues but \nthat we should, and there are emerging threats out there.\n  I think the Senator from West Virginia is contemplating a proposal \nthat deals with this very issue.\n  I have been specifically concerned with that issue with regard to \nChina for a couple of reasons: One, they continue to lead the nations \nof the world in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \naccording to our intelligence community; two, because we are now \ngetting ready to embark on the issue of permanent normal trade \nrelations with China.\n  Many of us are free traders; many of us believe in open markets; many \nof us want to support that. I think the majority of the Senate \ncertainly does. Is there not any better time, and is it not incumbent \nupon us in the same general timeframe and the same general debate, that \nwe couldn't, shouldn't, consider something so vitally important to this \ncountry as the issue of our nuclear trading partner, that we are being \nasked to embrace in a new world regime, that sits with us on the \nSecurity Council of the United Nations? Is it too much to ask of them \nto cease this dangerous proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nand the supplying of these rogue nations with weapons of mass \ndestruction--be they chemical, biological, or nuclear--which pose a \nthreat to us?\n  We are considering now the issue of the national missile defense \nsystem. Many people in this Nation, I think a majority of people in \nthis Congress, are very concerned that we have no defense against such \na terrorist attack, an accidental attack, an attack by a rogue nation \nwith weapons of mass destruction, and that we need such a missile \ndefense.\n  One of the primary reasons we need a national missile defense system \nhas to do with the activities of the Chinese and their supplying of \nrogue nations with these materials, expertise, capabilities, military \nparts that have nuclear capabilities which we are so concerned that, by \nthe year of 2005, could be turned against us. Must we not consider this \nas we consider permanent normal trade relations? As important as trade \nis, is it more important than our national security? I think that \nquestion answers itself.\n  I pointed out on June 22 that the Rumsfeld Commission reported in \nJuly\n\n[[Page S6327]]\n\nof 1998 that: China poses a threat as a significant proliferator of \nballistic missiles, weapons of mass destruction, and enabling \ntechnology. The commission went on to say China's behavior thus far \nmakes it appear unlikely that it will soon effectively reduce its \ncountry's sizable transfer of critical technologies, experts, or \nexpertise to the emerging missile powers.\n  A little later, on June 22 of this year, the Far Eastern Economic \nReview reported:\n\n       Robert Einhorn, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for \n     Nonproliferation, left Hong Kong on June 11 with a small \n     delegation bound for Beijing.\n\n  The article said:\n\n       Neither the American nor Chinese side reported this trip. \n     Einhorn is on a delicate mission to get a commitment from \n     Beijing not to export missile technology and components to \n     Iran and Pakistan.\n\n  It went on to say:\n\n       . . . U.S. intelligence reports suggest that China may have \n     begun building a missile plant in Pakistan. If true, it would \n     be the second Chinese-built plant there.\n\n  If that article is indeed true, it would certainly be consistent with \nwhat we know about other Chinese activities. There is a recent report \nthat there is growing Chinese support for Libya and their missile \nprogram. We know they have supported the Iranian missile program. We \nknow they have supported the North Korean missile program. So those are \nsome of the things we discussed back on June 22.\n  Let's bring ourselves up to date now. Just this last Sunday, Sunday a \nweek, July 2, the New York Times reported:\n\n       American intelligence agencies have told the Clinton \n     administration and Congress that China has continued to aid \n     Pakistan's effort to building long-range missiles that could \n     carry nuclear weapons, according to several officials with \n     access to intelligence reports.\n\n  The story goes on to say:\n\n       . . . how China stepped up the shipment of specialty \n     steels, guidance systems, and technical expertise to Pakistan \n     . . . since 1998.\n\n  That is very recent activity. Shipments to Pakistan have been \ncontinued over the past 8 to 18 months, according to this story.\n  This, of course, would be in violation of the Missile Technology \nControl Regime to which the Chinese Government agreed to adhere. \nStrangely enough, weeks ago, our Secretary of State praised the Chinese \nfor complying with the MTCR. It is pretty obvious now they are not \ncomplying. Some answers need to be forthcoming from the Secretary of \nState with regard to that.\n  But things are more serious than that because we now know, because of \nthese recent developments and, perhaps, because of some of the issues \nwe are considering in this Senate, the administration sent another \nenvoy to the Chinese for 2 days of talks concerning some of these \nproliferation problems. On July 9, we got a report back from that \nlatest trip, where our people went over there to plead with the Chinese \nto change their behavior at a time when we are about to consider \npermanent normal trade relations. We have gotten the results back. \nAccording to the New York Times on July 9, this visiting American \nofficial, who is Mr. J.D. Holum, adviser to the Secretary of State on \narms control, said:\n\n       After 2 days of talks, the Chinese would not allay concerns \n     about recent Chinese help for Pakistan's ballistic missile \n     program.\n\n  He is quoted here as saying:\n\n       We raised our concern that China has provided aid to \n     Pakistan and other countries . . .\n\n  That is according to Mr. Holum.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Some Chinese arms experts say that China is unlikely to \n     promise to end exports of missile technology anytime soon \n     because such trade, or the threat of it, gives China a \n     bargaining chip over the scale of American weapons sold to \n     Taiwan.\n\n  Apparently, what the Chinese Government is saying is that as long as \nwe assist Taiwan--which we are determined to do--for defensive purposes \nagainst the aggression of the Chinese Government, they are going to \ncontinue to assist these outlaw nations in their offensive designs that \nmight be targeted toward the United States.\n  That bears some serious consideration. The Chinese Government is \nsaying if you continue to be friendly with Taiwan and assist them in \ndefending themselves against us, we are going to continue to make the \nworld more dangerous for you and the rest of the world by continuing to \nassist these nations of great concern. We have to ask ourselves: Are we \nwilling to acquiesce to that kind of blackmail? We have a policy with \nregard to Taiwan. It is well stated. Are we going to withdraw our \nsupport for Taiwan, which might assist in doing something about this \nproliferation? I don't think so. I would certainly oppose it. I think \nmost every Member of this body would oppose that. So you can take that \noption off the table.\n  What are we going to do? The other option would be to continue to sit \npat, continue our policy, and see the continued proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. We will try to build a missile defense \nsystem that will catch them. While they are building up over there, we \nwill build up over here.\n  There is a third option, of course. That is to tell the Chinese \nGovernment that, yes, we will trade with you; yes, we want to engage \nwith you; yes, we will help you see progress in human rights and other \nissues; yes, we acknowledge you have taken a lot of people out of \npoverty and opened up your markets somewhat; yes, we will do all those \nthings, but if you continue to do things that pose a mortal threat to \nthe United States of America, we will respond to that in an economic \nway. There will be consequences to you.\n  It does not have to be directly related to trade. We can do some \nother things that would not hurt our people. For example, the Chinese \nhave access to our capital markets. They raise billions of dollars in \nour capital markets. It is free and open to them. It is not transparent \nat all. We don't know what they do with that money. Some people think \nthey use it to build up their army. But Chinese interests raise \nbillions of dollars in our capital markets. Should we allow them to \ncontinue to doing that when they are supplying these rogue nations with \nweapons that are a threat to us? It makes no sense at all.\n  Must we read in the paper someday that the North Koreans or the \nIranians, sure enough, have a missile and have the nuclear capability \nof send a nuclear missile to the United States of America?\n  People say: They know they would be wiped off the face of the Earth. \nWe could retaliate and they would never do something like that. No. 1, \nwe made a lot of mistakes in this country by assuming other people \nthink the same way we do. No. 2, I am not sure we are always going to \nbe able to detect the source of a missile such as that. The United \nStates would not likely, as some people say--having it trip off their \ntongue so easily--wipe a nation off the face of the Earth unless we \nwere absolutely sure. So there is no need to go down that road. We must \ndo something on the front end that will ameliorate the possibility of \nour ever getting into that situation and that condition. That is why 17 \nof my colleagues and I have proposed a bill called the \nChinese Nonproliferation Act, which basically calls for an annual \nassessment of the activities of the Chinese Government and Chinese \nGovernment-controlled entities within China, to see how they are doing \non a yearly basis in terms of their proliferation activity. Then, if \nthere is a finding that they continue their proliferation activity, the \nPresident has the authority to take action.\n\n  I believe that is the least we can do under the circumstances. Our \nbill has become quite controversial because many people think it \ncomplicates the issue of permanent normal trade relations with China. \nThey do not want to do anything--No. 1, they say--to hurt our \nexporters. We have made changes. No one can arguably say our bill hurts \nU.S. exporters now. We don't want to hurt our agricultural industry. We \nhave made changes to accommodate that concern. We are not designing \nthis in order to hurt our agricultural industry, so that is not an \nissue anymore.\n  When you get right down to it, the opponents of this bill are \nprimarily concerned about doing anything to agitate the Chinese at a \ntime in which we are trying to get permanent normal trade relations \npassed. I don't think we ought to gratuitously aggravate them. But if \nwe are not prepared to risk the displeasure of a nation that is doing \nthings that pose a mortal threat to our national security, what are we \nprepared to do?\n  What is more important than that? I am not saying let's cut off trade \nwith\n\n[[Page S6328]]\n\nthem. I am not saying let's take action against them for precipitous \nreasons or reasons that are not well thought out. I am saying we must \nrespond to these continued reports from the Rumsfeld Commission, from \nthe Cox Commission, from our biennial intelligence assessments, from \nthese reports from our own envoys coming back saying the Chinese are \nbasically telling us to get lost. We know what they are doing, and they \nare apparently not even denying it anymore. And we are going to approve \nPNTR without even taking up this issue?\n  We are trying to get a vote on this bill. So far we have been unable \nto do so. I ask my colleagues to seriously consider what kind of signal \nwe are going to be sending. We talk a lot about signals around here. I \nask what kind of signal we are going to be sending to the Chinese \nGovernment, to our allies, to the rest of the world, if we are not \nwilling to take steps to defend ourselves? A great country that is \nunwilling to defend itself will not be a great country forever.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6328-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I do believe we will be able to begin to \ndiscuss actual amendments fairly promptly tomorrow morning, but as the \nmajority leader said, in the evenings from now on, we will move to the \nDefense authorization bill. So Members who wish their amendments to be \nconsidered should notify both managers as promptly as possible, should \nfile those amendments as promptly as possible, and should begin to \narrange with the managers for times relatively convenient to all \nconcerned to bring them up.\n  The majority leader would like to finish this bill tomorrow.

Madam President, I welcome everyone back from our week \naway for the Fourth of July recess. I did not have an opportunity to \ntalk this morning with the majority leader, and I understand he was \nable to come to the floor and indicate there is a lot of work to be \ndone, and I share his view about the extent to which work should be \ndone.\n  I hope we can work as productively this coming work period as we \nworked in the last work period. We had an arrangement that I think \nworked very well following an unfortunate confrontation prior to the \ntime we went away for the Memorial Day recess. The cooperation and \npartnership that was demonstrated over this last work period is one \nthat I hope we can model again.\n  I say that because I am concerned about the precarious way with which \nwe are starting this week. Senator Lott has filed a cloture motion on \nthe motion to proceed to the estate tax, and then it is my \nunderstanding his intention is to file a cloture motion on the bill \nitself. I remind my colleagues that is exactly what got us into the \nposition we were in prior to the Memorial Day recess. I hope we can \nwork through that.\n  I have offered Senator Lott a limit on the number of amendments to \nthe estate tax bill and a time limit on the amendment. I am very \ndisappointed that we are not able to do what we have been able to do on \nso many bills, and that is reach some sort of accommodation for both \nsides. We still have some time this week, and I am hopeful that will \nhappen.\n  Let me also say that I am increasingly not only concerned but alarmed \nthat we have yet to schedule a date certain for the consideration of \npermanent normal trade relations with China. I had a clear \nunderstanding we would take up the bill this month. Yet I am told now \nthat at a Republican staff meeting today there was a good deal of \ndiscussion about the need to move it to September.\n  I inform my colleagues that we will ask unanimous consent to take up \nPNTR. If that fails, at some point this week, we will actually make a \nmotion to proceed to PNTR by a time certain this month. We cannot fail \nto act on that issue any longer. We must act. So we will make that \nmotion to proceed to PNTR if the majority leader chooses not to make \nthe motion for whatever reason.\n  I will also say that, as he has indicated, there is a good deal of \nbusiness left undone that, for whatever reason, has been blocked by \nsome of our colleagues on the other side. We will want to address those \nissues as well.\n  We will offer a motion to proceed to the Patients' Bill of Rights. We \nwill certainly want to do that, as well as prescription drugs, minimum \nwage, and a number of issues relating to common sense gun legislation, \nsuch as closing the so-called gun show loophole and dealing with the \nincremental approaches to gun safety that the Senate supported as part \nof the juvenile justice bill.\n  I will say, we will also want to move to proceed to the H-1B \nlegislation that passed in the House overwhelmingly. We want to be able \nto offer amendments. We would like to take it up. It should happen this \nweek; if not this week, next week. But we ought to take up H-1B as \nwell.\n  You could call this week the ``Trillion Dollar Week,'' the Trillion \nDollar Week because our Republican colleagues are choosing to ignore \nall of the legislation I have just noted, given the limited time we \nhave, and instead commit this country to $1 trillion in two tax cuts \nrelating, first, to the marriage penalty, which we are told by CBO \nwould cost a little over $250 billion over a 10-year period of time; \nand the estate tax repeal, which, over a fully implemented 10-year \nperiod, costs $750 billion.\n  That is $1 trillion dealing with just two issues: the estate tax and \nthe marriage penalty. It does not even go to the array of other tax-\nrelated questions that some of our Republican colleagues have addressed \nin the past. We could be up into $3 or $4 trillion worth of tax cuts if \nall of the tax proposals made by our Republican colleagues were \nenacted. But we may want to call this the ``Trillion Dollar Week'' if \nour Republican colleagues have their way: $750 billion on the estate \ntax; $250 billion on the marriage tax penalty--and, I will say, $1 \ntrillion, with very limited debate, with no real opportunity to offer \namendments, with no real suggestion about whether or not we ought to \nhave at least the right to offer alternatives to spending that much \nmoney.\n  The Democrats believe very strongly in the need to ensure that small \nbusinesses and farms are protected and that the ability is provided to \ntransfer small businesses and farms. But we can do that for a lot less \nthan $750 billion. We believe very strongly in the importance of the \nelimination of the marriage tax penalty. But we do not have to spend \n$250 billion to deal with it.\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\n  In fact, the regular order right now is the marriage tax penalty. We \nhave offered a limit on amendments, a limit on time on those 10 \namendments. We could take it up and deal with it this week--or could \nhave last week, last month, the month before. Instead, what our \nRepublicans colleagues are doing--and, I might add, all the time \ncalling for our cooperation--is saying: No, we are not going to do \nthat. We are not going to give you relevant amendments on the marriage \npenalty. We are going to go to the first reconciliation bill so you \ncan't have amendments. We are going to take up the bill that way. But \nwe still want your cooperation.\n  Now we are told that we will have an opportunity to vote on cloture \nbecause we are given the same mandate, the same ultimatum, when it \ncomes to amendments on estate taxes.\n  So let me end where I started. I really do hope that we can have as \nproductive a time this coming month as we had last month. I thought it \nwas a good month. But I must say, this is a precarious beginning with \nthis Trillion Dollar Week. It is a precarious beginning when, with all \nof the people's business the majority leader referred to, we are not \nactually going to deal with the people's business. We are going to deal \nwith 2 percent of the population affected by the estate tax, and we are \ngoing to deal with a marriage penalty bill that goes way beyond \nrepealing the marriage penalty, that actually gives a bonus to some \ntaxpayers, all the time denying Democratic Senators the right to offer \namendments on other directions that we might take.\n\n  So I look forward to talking and working with the majority leader, \nand I look forward to a good and rigorous debate about all of the \nissues having to do with the people's business.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield for a question before he yields the \nfloor?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield to the assistant Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. I have listened to the Democratic leader outline what we \nhave not been able to do. I fully support, as does the entire \nDemocratic caucus, what the Senator is trying to accomplish. The one \nthing the Democratic leader did not mention, though, I say to my \nleader--there has been a tremendous furor from the Republican side \nabout how they want to help the high-tech community, but the one thing \nthat has not been accomplished is a simple little bill to change the \nExport Administration Act so our high-tech industry can compete with \nthe rest of the world.\n  As we speak, we are losing our business position in the world in \nselling computers. We lead the world in building and selling high-tech \ncomputers. That is being taken from us as a result of four or five \npeople on the Republican side who are holding up this most important \nlegislation.\n  I say to my leader, I hope this is something on which we can also \nmove forward. We would be willing to debate it for 30 minutes, for an \nhour. There is all this talk about helping the high-tech industry. In \nmy opinion, the most important thing we could do is to get some \nattention focused on what has not been done regarding the high-tech \nindustry. H-1B visas, of course, that is important.\n  On the airplane ride back from Las Vegas, I had the good fortune to \nread a book the Democratic leader has already read and told me how much \nhe has enjoyed called ``The New New Thing.'' That book indicates how \nimportant it is that we have the people to do the work of this \nscientific nature. We need to change the H-1B. We agree there. But we \nalso need to change our ability to have more exports to improve our \nbalance of trade.\n  I close by saying, 44 Senators are willing to come in early in the \nmorning, to stay late at night, to give up our weekends, to do whatever \nis necessary these next 3 weeks to move this legislation the Democratic \nleader has outlined.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The assistant Democratic leader has made a very \nimportant point. The list I referred to certainly is not all inclusive. \nHe listed one important omission; that is the export administration \nbill. In fact, I do not know of anyone who has put more time in trying \nto get that bill scheduled than the assistant Democratic leader. I \nthank him publicly for his willingness to try to find a way with which \nto bring this legislation up.\n  He is absolutely right. As we consider our huge deficit in our \nbalance of payments, it is the only real black eye we have in an \notherwise extraordinary economic record. As we consider that, I cannot \nthink of anything more important than ensuring we stay competitive in \nthe international marketplace today. There is no better way to do that \nthan to address export enhancement legislation, as the assistant \nDemocratic leader has noted.\n  I also say to the assistant Democratic leader, today, again, the \npresident of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue, has called upon \nthe Senate to act. He has called upon the Senate to act on PNTR \nimmediately. I am sure he would also call upon the Senate to act on the \nexport administration bill.\n  But there is a growing crescendo of people out there concerned that \nthis is a Senate which has done little, which has blocked the people's \nbusiness, not enacted it. Prescription drugs, the Patients' Bill of \nRights, the minimum wage, effective gun legislation, China PNTR, and H-\n1B--all of those ought to be done. All of those ought to be done this \nmonth. We will have very little time left when we get back after the \nAugust recess. So we have to make every day count. We want to work with \nthe majority to make that happen.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6329-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      NOMINATION OF MADELYN R.

Madam President, tomorrow the Senate is expected to vote on \na motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the \nconsideration of the House-passed Death Tax Elimination Act, H.R. 8. I \nwant to take a few minutes today to explain a key element of that \nlegislation, one that wasn't discussed much during the House debate but \nwhich I think is critical to Senators understanding actually how the \nlegislation works.\n  The bill which passed the House on June 9 by a vote of 279-136--\nincidentally, 65 House Democrats joined Republicans in very bipartisan \nsupport for the bill--ultimately repeals the Federal estate tax. But \nthe change in policy is really more substantial than just that. The \ndetails are very important because they offer a way for both\n\n[[Page S6330]]\n\nsides of the aisle to bridge past differences with respect to the \nestate tax, specifically with respect to how transfers at death are \ntaxed.\n  Although it is true that H.R. 8, the bill that passed the House, \nwould repeal the estate tax at the end of a 10-year phaseout period, \nthe appreciation and inherited assets would not go untaxed. That is a \nvery important point, Madam President. This is a departure from \nprevious estate tax repeal proposals.\n  Under H.R. 8, a tax would still be imposed, but it would be imposed \nwhen the inherited property is sold; that is, after the income is \nactually realized, rather than at the artificial moment of death. The \nHouse bill, therefore, removes death from the calculation of the \nimposition of the tax. Earnings from an asset would be taxed the same \nwhether the asset were earned or inherited.\n  The plan broadens the capital gains tax base by using the decedent's \nbasis in the property to calculate the tax. That differs from current \nlaw where the basis can be stepped up to the fair market value at the \ntime of death. In exchange for the broader tax base, a lower tax rate \nwould apply. The capital gains tax rate would be the general rate that \nwould apply.\n\n  I also note that a limited step-up in basis would be preserved to \nassure that small estates bear no new tax liability as a result of \nthese changes.\n  What we have done is to ensure that nobody who would escape paying \nthe estate tax would ever have to pay a capital gains tax on that \namount of money, so everybody would be treated the same in terms of \navoiding liability from any tax; and only those who choose to sell an \nasset at a later point in time, after the property is inherited, would \npay a tax. They would pay a capital gains tax--a much lower rate than \nthe estate tax--and they would have the benefit of an exemption even \nmore generous from the estate tax today.\n  Here is how the bill would actually work. The estate tax would \nessentially be replaced by a capital gains tax. That tax would be \nimposed on the gain or the increase in value of the inherited property \nrelative to its original basis or cost, plus any cost of improvements. \nAs with the estate tax, as I said, there would be an amount of property \nexempt from taxation. In the case of the new capital gains tax, the \nexemption would be $1.3 million of gain. That is, the decedent's basis \nwould be exempt, whatever that amount of money is, plus $1.3 million. \nThat exemption would be divided among all of the heirs. Now, $1.3 \nmillion is the amount that can be currently shielded from the estate \ntax by family-owned businesses or farms. So we have provided a basic \nexemption here that is the same as the most generous exemption under \ntoday's law.\n  In addition to that, we provide an additional exemption. A surviving \nspouse will be entitled to $3 million more, in addition to the \nexemption I just mentioned; that means the decedent's basis--his cost \nof the property--plus $3 million for the property transferred by the \ndecedent to him or her. For married couples, there is an additional \n$1.3 million in exempt gains that can be added for the second spouse, \nfor a total exemption of $5.6 million above the decedent's basis in the \nproperty, $1.3 million for the first spouse, plus $1.3 million for the \nsecond spouse, plus $3 million for spousal transfers.\n  In each case, the exempt amount is added to the basis. It, of course, \ncannot exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of \ndeath. That is the way these exemptions add up. They provide a \nsignificant exemption from the payment of any capital gains tax even \nwhen the property was inherited and later sold.\n  Why is this change important? For one thing, it removes death as the \ntrigger for the tax. That is the object that most of us want to \nachieve--to take death out of the equation. It is an artificial event. \nPeople are certainly not making plans based upon death. I don't think \nanybody can justify death being a taxable event. Ordinarily, we see \ntaxable events as the earning of income, the gain of profit from an \ninvestment, the sale of property, and the result of income from that. \nThose are taxable kinds of events. Death is purely an artificial event \nwhich should not be a trigger for any payment of tax. In fact, we all \nappreciate that it creates a great hardship on families at the very \ntime of death.\n  For example, frequently the owner of the business--the person who \nstarted the business--has to figure out at that very difficult time in \ntheir life how to pay the estate tax. Frequently, the only way to do \nthat is actually to sell the business, sell the farm, or sell the \nassets in order to acquire enough liquid assets to pay the estate tax. \nIt takes death out of the equation.\n  That is the first object of this. I think it is the most important.\n  But a tax would be imposed on the beneficiaries of an estate just as \nit would have been imposed if someone had realized a capital gain \nduring his or her lifetime. The beneficiaries of an estate would not \nonly inherit assets but they would also inherit the decedent's tax \nbasis on that property. The trigger for the tax is, therefore, the sale \nof the assets and the realization of income. That is the appropriate \ntime to levy a tax--not when someone dies.\n  Advocates of the death tax often note that it serves as a backstop \nfor the income tax by imposing taxes at death on income that previously \nescaped taxation. They are referring to capital gains that have never \nbeen realized. It is theoretically possible for that to be the case, \nalthough it is ordinarily true that you have spent ordinary income to \nacquire an asset and you have already paid income taxes on that \nordinary income. But for someone who may have come into property in \nsome other way, there could theoretically be unrealized gains that \nwould escape taxation, except for the proposal that we have.\n  It is true that under current law those gains, but for the estate \ntax, would go untaxed forever because of the step-up basis. In other \nwords, under current law, you acquire the market value as of the date \nof death, and that is the value of the property. So if you later \ndispose of it, there is very little gain if you dispose of it quickly. \nBut of course you have to pay a 55-percent or lower percent death tax \non that property.\n  The House-passed bill addresses this concern of unrealized gains \nnever being taxed head on. It not only eliminates the death tax but \nalso the step-up basis. So unrealized gains will ultimately be taxed if \nand when the inherited property is sold off. Therefore, nothing escapes \ntaxation.\n  This concept, I must confess, was one which I heard Senator Moynihan \ntalking about when I first presented the death tax repeal to the \nFinance Committee. There was some concern. While we all appreciate that \nit is not good tax policy to impose a tax at the time of death, there \nhas to be some way to recapture a tax on these unrealized gains. This \nis the proposal that does that. Therefore, it is not only eminently \nfair but it conforms the tax policy for everyone--people who acquire a \ndecedents' estate or people who simply earn money--and it doesn't \ncontain this bad element of taxing at the time of death. Instead, when \nyou make the economic decision to sell property you have inherited--if \nyou make that decision--you know what the tax consequences are. You \nknow how much income you are going to receive. You can figure out how \nmuch tax you are going to pay. If you decide to go ahead and sell at \nthat point, then you pay a capital gains tax using the original basis. \nBut it is your decision based upon your timing and your economic \ncircumstance and not because of a fortuitous event of death.\n\n  It is interesting; President Clinton's fiscal year 2001 budget, on \npage 109 of the analytical perspectives, scores the existing step-up \nbasis in capital gains and death at $28.2 billion in fiscal year 2001, \nand a total of $152.96 billion over 5 years. So elimination of the \nstep-up basis as proposed in H.R. 8 can, therefore, be expected to \nrecoup a portion of the revenue lost from the death tax repeal. That \nreduces the cost of the death tax repeal substantially.\n  To say it another way, when you eliminate the death tax altogether, \nyou are eliminating all of that revenue. But if you come back and \ncollect a capital gains tax using the original basis on any of the \ninherited assets that are later sold, the Federal Government is at \nleast going to recoup some of that revenue. Will it be 40 percent? Will \nit be 30 percent? I don't know.\n  But it is interesting that the President's own people score the step-\nup\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\nbasis of capital gains at death at over $28 billion in fiscal year \n2001. That is roughly the amount of the estate tax that is going to be \ncollected.\n  So if you assume that all of the property would be immediately sold, \nthen the Government theoretically would recoup all of that money.\n  That won't happen. Obviously, people will wait a while to sell \nassets. But the point is that it illustrates the Government is not \ngoing to have a total loss of revenue as a result of the repeal of the \nestate tax. There will be revenue coming in from the capital gains tax \nthat replaces it.\n  I think whatever revenue losses are associated with repeal, of \ncourse, also needs to be put in perspective. This is the point that is \nmost important to me.\n  The President's budget, on page 2, estimates that revenues for 2001 \nwill amount to over $2 trillion, rising to $2.92 trillion--almost $3 \ntrillion--by the year 2010, the year that the death tax repeal would \nactually be implemented. In other words, by 2010, the Federal \nGovernment will collect an additional $840 billion in just that 1 year. \nSurely, with an $840 billion surplus in just that tenth year that the \nestate tax is repealed, we can afford to eliminate this unfair tax and \nstill satisfy pressing national needs with the additional $840 billion.\n  It is pretty clear when you put that in perspective that no one \nshould vote against estate tax repeal on the basis that the Federal \nGovernment can't afford it. Clearly, it can afford it.\n  One final point: I call Senators' attention to a letter that should \nbe reaching their offices from the National Association of Women \nBusiness Owners, or NAWBO as it is sometimes called. The organization \nis writing in very strong support of death tax elimination. They write \nthat women business owners in the country employ one out of every four \nworkers.\n\n  By the way, about half of the small businesses in the country are \nwomen owned. So this is a very important point to the National \nAssociation of Women Business Owners. It is one of the groups that very \nstrongly supported us when we had the White House conference, and \nrepeal of the death tax was No. 4 on the list of legislative items.\n  In any event, here is what they write with respect to the point that \none out of over four workers, or about 27 million workers in the United \nStates, are employed by women business owners:\n\n       When a woman-owned business has to be sold to pay the death \n     tax, jobs are lost.\n\n  This was written by president Barbara Stanbridge and vice president \nfor public policy, Sheila Brooks.\n  They say, ``on average, 39 jobs per business, or 11,000 jobs, have \nalready been lost due to the planning and payment of the death tax.''\n  It is not only the payments that will suffer, but it is also the \nplanning. The payments that go to the lawyers, estate planners, and \ninsurance also increases expenses and results in job loss.\n  NAWBO projects on average 103 jobs per business--or a total of 28,000 \njobs--will be lost as a result of the tax over the next 5 years.\n  Ms. Stanbridge and Ms. Brooks note that women businesses are just \nstarting to grow. Many are first-generation businesses, and they have \njust begun to realize that, due to the death tax, their business will \nnot be passed on to the next generation--at least not without a 55-\npercent estate tax and perhaps a 55-percent gift tax during life. Most \nof the businesses can't afford to pay the tax. As I said before, they \nare sold off frequently to big corporations that are not subject to the \ndeath tax.\n  Let me make this point.\n  I was asked by a reporter today what the original theory of death tax \nwas. The reporter said it doesn't seem to make any sense. It doesn't \nmake sense. But the original theory was they would prevent the \naccumulation of wealth. It was put in at a time when it was kind of the \nprogressive or populist time, and there was a feeling that we should \nprevent the accumulation of wealth.\n  Let me give you a story of a friend of mine in Phoenix, AZ. He came \nto Arizona from New York and built a printing business. Eventually, he \nemployed about 200 people. He was a very successful entrepreneur. A lot \nof people depended on Jerry Wisotsky, a pillar of the community, who \ncontributed huge sums of money to all kinds of causes. He was a very \nrough and gruff guy on the exterior. On the interior, he had a heart of \ngold. He could not turn down any request for a charity in town. He was \nvery generous. All of his family were. When he died, the family found \nthat everything had been plowed back into the business--the latest of \nprinting equipment and so on. He had no hard cash to pay the huge \nestate tax. They had to sell the business.\n  To whom did they sell it? It was some big conglomerate--a big German \ncompany, I think. But it was a big corporation.\n  So much for the death tax preventing the accumulation of wealth. It \ntook a whole bunch of wealth from one family in Phoenix, AZ, and \ntransferred it to a big international corporation.\n\n  It doesn't prevent the accumulation of wealth. It concentrates wealth \nin the big companies that end up being able to afford to buy the \nbusiness--frequently at bargain basement prices. It is unfair. It is \nnot good for communities.\n  I made the point about contributions of this one family. As I said, \nthat family used to contribute to every charity in Arizona. They are \nstill very generous, but they don't have the assets they used to have \nwhen Jerry owned the business. This argument that charities are going \nto suffer if we repeal the estate tax I know to be wrong.\n  I am waiting for the first executive director of some big charity \norganization in the community to come back to me and lobby against the \nrepeal of the estate tax on the grounds that it will hurt contributions \nto charity. I will immediately call every member of that person's board \nof directors and say: Do you know what your hired person is lobbying \nfor back here? They are lobbying to pay 55 percent of the estate tax to \nthe U.S. Government because it might be an incentive to contribute more \nto their charity.\n  I think these folks will turn tail and go home. The reality is people \nwho are big hearted will make big contributions, as the Wisotsky \nfamily, and they can do it if they have an income stream coming, rather \nthan if they have to sell the business to somebody else.\n  I talked about the women-owned businesses. Minority-owned businesses \nare in the same position, which is why we have strong support from \nvarious minority business organizations. However, the point of repeal \nof the estate tax is it is in keeping with the American dream. The \nAmerican dream is to work hard, be successful, and give your children a \ngreater opportunity than you had. That is the American dream. The \nestate tax works counter to the American dream, the ability to pass on \nsomething to your children and grandchildren after you have worked very \nhard during your lifetime to save that money.\n  That is another point. The death tax penalizes savers. We talk about \ntax policy and trying to promote savings and investment. The estate tax \nis exactly contrary to that. On the one hand, the Federal Government \nseeks to encourage people to save through IRAs, Roth IRAs, 401(k)'s, \neducation savings accounts, and lower tax rates on capital gains. Yet \non the other hand, it penalizes savers upon their death with death tax \nrates as high as 55 percent.\n  Consider two couples with similar lifetime earnings. One spends \nlavishly during their lifetime and leaves only a small estate. That \ncouple is not subject to the death tax. The second couple who foregoes \nlavish spending and sets money aside for family, for the future, for \ncontingencies in the future--as the Government policy seeks to have \nthem do--gets hit with a substantial tax on death degree. That is not \nright. It is not good tax policy or good national economic policy.\n  It is particularly not fair because there is a better way: Tax the \ngains when they are realized; don't tax at death. That is what the \nDeath Tax Elimination Act is all about. I urge Senators to take a very \nclose look at this when we have this issue of the cloture vote. Think \nvery carefully about not allowing us to proceed. There is some notion \nthat politically some people will want to use the death tax repeal \nlegislation to offer all kinds of nongermane amendments to make \nwhatever other points they may want to make. Everybody around here \nknows the Senate schedule is very tight. Everybody knows the death tax \nrepeal is\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\nextremely popular around the country. A very high percentage, 70 to 80 \npercent of the American people, support its repeal. It passed the House \nof Representatives. If everyone had been there, it would be a veto-\nproof vote. I believe it will be a veto-proof vote. It is pretty clear \nthe death tax repeal is going to pass. It will be successful if it \ncomes to a vote.\n\n  I don't know whether some people plan to play political games and use \nthis vehicle to score political points on totally unrelated matters. I \nurge those Members to think very carefully about that strategy. If we \nare not able to get the clean version of the House bill, H.R. 8, to a \nvote, I will be standing on the floor pointing fingers at those people \nwho have prevented the Senate from doing that. I think that is very \nfair. It is very appropriate.\n  The House of Representatives overwhelmingly repealed the death tax. \nThe American people want it repealed. We will have an opportunity to \nconsider it in the Senate. Those Senators who stand in the way of this, \nplaying parliamentary games, using amendment tactics with amendments \nthat are not germane to the estate tax, we are going to be on the floor \npointing out the results of their efforts. If they stop this with those \ntactics, they will have to accept the consequences of their actions. It \nis fine with me to have people try to amend the bill. I don't think \nthey will be successful. This bill, written by Chairman Bill Archer and \nRepresentative Dunn and others in the House of Representatives, \nincluding members of the minority, is very well put together. It \nreduces rates for the first 10 years and has a repeal at the end of the \n10-year period. By then it is all gone. That should give everybody time \nto adjust to the fact that it is going to be repealed, however it will \nbe repealed.\n  I hope my colleagues will not decide to try to derail the opportunity \nto repeal the death tax through a strategy either of denying cloture--\nin other words, the ability to bring the bill to a final vote on the \nfloor of the Senate--or alternatively, to require the majority leader \nto agree to nongermane amendments, which obviously would sink the ship.\n  It is my understanding from talking to the majority leader today that \nhe does not yet have an agreement to permit bringing the bill to the \nfloor with a limited number of germane amendments, with a clear vote \nbefore the end of this week. If that can't be accomplished, we will \nhave to move for cloture and we will have a cloture vote. I believe we \nwill get cloture. When we do, then only germane amendments are allowed. \nThere will be a vote by the end of the week. Members can't say they are \nfor repeal of the death tax and then engage in tactics which prevent \nthe Senate from ever getting to that vote.\n  Let me make a couple of other points. This is a very bipartisan \napproach both in terms of outside groups and the strong support we have \nhad both in the House and in the Senate from Members on both side of \nthe aisle. That is why I do not make a blanket action over who might \nuse dilatory tactics. Many members of the minority are cosponsors of \nthis legislation. When I originally developed this concept, Senator Bob \nKerrey of Nebraska was very supportive and immediately became a \ncosponsor of what is now known as the Kyl-Kerrey bill. We have 29 \ncosponsors. Frankly, we could have more. Nine are members of the \nminority party. The rest are members of the majority party.\n  Let me single out these members of the minority party who have been \nwilling to support us. I am sure there will be more, but cosponsors \ninclude Senators Bob Kerrey, John Breaux, Chuck Robb, Blanche Lincoln, \nRon Wyden, Mary Landrieu, Max Cleland, Evan Bayh, and Patty Murray. \nThese are all Senators who I think have studied this and realize there \nis a tax on the unrealized gains incorporated in this bill, so it \nbecomes a very fair bill just taking death out of the equation. I \nparticularly thank those Senators for putting aside any partisanship in \nrecognizing the importance of this repeal.\n  For those who are not totally familiar with the overall essence of \nthe bill, let me describe the key elements of it.\n  As amended, H.R. 8 would, first, in the year 2001 convert the unified \ncredit to a true exemption and repeal the so-called 5-percent bubble \nand expand the availability of qualified conservation easements. It \nwould also repeal rates in excess of 53 percent in that first year.\n  Between 2002 and 2009 it would phase down the estate tax rates by 1 \npercent to 2 percent each year.\n  Third, in 2010 it would implement the Kyl-Kerrey language eliminating \nthe death tax and implementing a carryover-basis regime, as I discussed \nearlier.\n  Over the Fourth of July, I had occasion to attend some ceremonies and \nhear our Founding Fathers quoted. Of course Benjamin Franklin is always \none of the most fun to quote, but he is one who, some 200 years ago, \nsaid: Nothing in this world is certain but death and taxes.\n  It should come as no surprise that after 200 years the Federal \nGovernment would find a way to put those two inevitabilities together \nto create a death tax which is not only confiscatory but also offensive \nto the American sense of fairness and also harmful to small business \nand to the economy. It was also harmful to the environment, and this is \nso because what happens is families find, in order to pay the tax, they \nhave to sell land they would like to keep in the family for its \nenvironmental value. But they find they have to sell it to generate \nincome. Inevitably what happens is the property is developed. That \ndevelopment is the reason why there are conservation groups who have \nalso joined us in opposition to the estate tax and in favor of its \nrepeal.\n  There is another point I want to mention. Opponents of our \nlegislation say this only affects a few people. First of all, it is not \ntrue; it affects a lot of people. It is true in the end only a few \npeople have to end up paying. But a lot of people have spent a lot of \nmoney preparing various tax shelters to escape the payment of the \nestate tax.\n  Who benefits, of course, are the lawyers and the estate tax planners \nand the insurance companies. I have nothing against any of those folks, \nbut I don't think we need to create tax policy just to create jobs for \nlawyers. I am a lawyer. I know I always had plenty to do without having \nto get into this. So I don't think any of those folks would have real \ngrounds for suggesting that in order to keep them in business we have \nto keep the estate tax. So it is not just the people who pay, it is \nalso the people who have to try to avoid paying.\n  There is another thing. The Chair is well aware of this because she \nand I share the same concern about this problem, as a result of which I \nunderstand either tomorrow or Wednesday there is going to be a hearing \nbefore the Aging Committee, talking about senior citizens who end up \ngetting bilked or scammed because of people who come to them and say to \navoid the death tax they have to give them a bunch of money to set up \nsome kind of trust to save their assets. Most of these people are \npeople who would not have to pay the tax; their estates are just not \nbig enough to be taxed. They fall within the exemption. But they are \nafraid. They have heard about this death tax and they are susceptible \nto these scams which take large amounts of money from them under the \nguise of estate planning which is not necessary for them.\n  So you not only have the people who have to pay the tax, you not only \nhave the people who have to pay not to pay the tax, but you also have \npeople who get scammed into paying some of these unscrupulous folks, \nsetting up trusts they do not need because they would never be subject \nto the tax.\n\n  You also find--again I go back to the example I cited before--when \nbusinesses are sold, frequently jobs are lost, and those jobs are also \naffected, as I pointed out, by the reduced income from the businesses \nthat have to prepare not to pay the tax. So it is just not true the tax \nonly affects a limited number of people. In fact, I believe it was 3 \nyears ago that we had the latest statistics for the amount of money \nspent to avoid paying the estate tax. It was almost exactly the same as \nthe amount of tax paid in that particular year. In effect, it is a \ndouble taxation and a very inefficient tax when you have to pay that \nmuch money to avoid paying the tax.\n  Edward McCaffrey--I don't think he would mind me putting this label \non him--who is a liberal, a professor of law at the University of \nSouthern California, put it this way.\n\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\n\n       Polls and practices show that we like sin taxes, such as on \n     alcohol and cigarettes. . . . The estate tax is an anti-sin, \n     or virtue tax. It is a tax on work and savings without \n     consumption, on thrift, on long-term savings.\n\n  He is exactly right. We may all be for sin taxes. But one of the \nreasons why the bulk of Americans, whether they will ever have to pay \nthe tax or not, oppose the estate tax is they realize it is contrary to \neverything we believe in America. It is not a tax on sin; it is a tax \non virtue--saving something for your kids when you die.\n  Let me also cite economists Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell, making \nthe very same point. Writing in a 1992 study, they said that death \ntaxes:\n\n       [H]ave failed to achieve their intended purposes. They \n     raise little revenue. They impose large excess burdens. They \n     are unfair.\n\n  As I noted, opinion polls constantly show between 70 percent and 80 \npercent of Americans favor repeal of the death tax. When Californians \nhad the chance to weigh in with a ballot proposition, they voted 2 to 1 \nto repeal their State's death tax. I think that is a very important \npoint because that vote was very recent.\n  The legislatures of six other States have enacted legislation since \n1997 that would either eliminate or significantly reduce the burden of \ntheir States' death taxes. In fact, the minority leader was here a \nmoment ago. I note on the ballot in the home State of the distinguished \nminority leader, South Dakota, there will be a proposition this fall \nfor the elimination of the death tax.\n  If you talk to the men and women who run small businesses around the \ncountry, if you talk to people who join in meetings, gatherings that I \ntalk to all the time, you will find very strong support for repeal of \nthe tax. Remember, it is a tax that is imposed on a family business \nwhen it is least able to afford the payment, on the death of the person \nwith the greatest practical and institutional knowledge of that \nbusiness' operations. That is the reason why so many businesses cannot \nmake it to the second generation or the third.\n  I mentioned before the women- and minority-owned businesses. Instead \nof passing hard-earned and successful businesses on to the next \ngeneration, many of these families have had to sell their companies in \norder to pay the death tax. That certainly stops the upward mobility \nthat is so important to some of these groups. It is why death tax \nrepeal is supported by groups such as the National Association of Women \nBusiness Owners, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the National \nBlack Chamber of Commerce, the National Indian Business Association, \nand the National Association of Neighborhoods.\n\n  This is a very wide spectrum of organizations representing a very \nbroad spectrum of the American community. I cannot think of a policy \nthat has come to the Senate in recent times that has a more broad \nappeal to it than the repeal of this very unfortunate and unfair tax.\n  I mentioned before the argument about concentration of wealth. I just \nwant to go back to that for a moment. There is a February 2000 study by \nthe National Association of Women Business Owners, the Independent \nWomen's Forum and the Center for the Study of Taxation combined. It \nfound the death tax costs female entrepreneurs nearly $60,000 on death \ntax planning, obviously money they could use to put back into their \nbusinesses. They report that 39 jobs were lost per business due to the \ncosts of death tax planning during the last 5 years. Think about that. \nWomen business owners report that the cost of death tax planning will \ncreate 103 new jobs per business in the next 5 years.\n  Think about that statistic. Most of the businesses we think about are \nmuch smaller than that to begin with, but we know small businesses can \ngrow to 200 or 300 employees if they are successful. These numbers are \nstaggering when you stop to think about the amount of job loss that \nresults, just from the costs of planning to avoid the estate tax. It is \nan incredible statistic.\n  There is a June 1999 survey of the impact of the death tax on family \nbusiness employment levels in upstate New York which found that the \naverage spending for death tax planning was as much as $125,000 per \ncompany. Think of that. For the 365 businesses surveyed, the total \nnumber of jobs lost already as a result of the cost of death tax \nplanning was over 5,100 jobs.\n  The average estimated number of jobs these businesses would lose over \nthe next 5 years if they actually had to pay the death tax exceeds 80 \nper business, with the numbers of jobs at risk at a minimum of 15,000 \njobs. This is just among something like 300 companies in upstate New \nYork. These are staggering statistics. If you expand that to the rest \nof the country, it is impossible to argue that the estate tax is not my \nproblem, that it is just for a few rich folks. It affects everybody in \nthis country.\n  What it suggests to me is that although it is paid by only a small \nnumber of individual taxpayers, it has a disproportionately large \nnegative impact on the economy. As someone said, it is the tax with the \nlongest shadow of any on the books.\n  The adverse consequences are compounded over time, too. A December \n1998 report by the Joint Economic Committee concluded that the \nexistence of a death tax in this century has reduced the stock of \ncapital in the economy by nearly half a trillion dollars.\n  Think about what a half of a trillion dollars of capital stock \ninfused into the economy in the future could mean. These surpluses that \nare projected now would be expanded even more significantly because the \ngrowth in capital would obviously provide a lot more return on \ninvestment.\n  It is really staggering when one stops to think about the impact of \nthis one tax and how pernicious it is, all the way from the individual \nminority-owned business to the economy of the United States losing half \na trillion dollars in capital stock. Just think, by repealing the death \ntax and putting those resources to better use, the joint committee \nestimates that as many as 240,000 jobs could be created just over a \nperiod of 7 years. Americans would have an additional $24.4 billion in \ndisposable personal income over that period of time. If we said to the \nAmerican people: We have a great deal for you; how would you like \nanother $25 billion in the next 7 years and all we have to do is repeal \nthis tax that does not bring in revenues to the United States \nproportionate to the cost that it imposes on the economy, I think they \nwould say that is a very good deal.\n  It seems to me almost all of the arguments for those who used to \nfavor the tax have been pretty well laid to the side, and the only \nquestion now is how we are going to get this to a vote in the Senate \nand how we are then going to be able to send it to the President.\n  I mentioned the cost to the environment a moment ago. Maybe those who \nhave in mind offering amendments would like to consider this for just a \nmoment: An increasing number of families who own environmentally \nsensitive lands, as I said before, have had to sell property for \ndevelopment to raise the money to pay the death tax, which destroys \nnatural habitats as a result. With that in mind, Michael Bean of The \nNature Conservancy observed that the death tax is highly regressive in \nthe sense that it encourages the destruction of ecologically important \nland. So maybe folks who were planning to speak in opposition to this \nwould like to take that into consideration.\n  Because it tends to encourage development and sprawl, a lot of \nenvironmental organizations have endorsed its repeal. Among those \norganizations: The Izaak Walton League, the Wildlife Society, Quail \nUnlimited, the Wildlife Management Institute, and the International \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.\n  Incidentally, pending repeal in 2010, as I noted before, H.R. 8 \nexpands the availability of qualified conservation easements, which is \nsomething I am sure all of these conservation organizations support.\n  For all of these reasons, it is going to be very hard to explain why \nwe would not support repeal of this tax. It overwhelmingly passed in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  The repeal portion of the death tax recaptures taxes on unrealized \ngains, something that had been a problem for some Members of the other \nside of the aisle. I understand why, and I was happy to include that \ncompromise in this legislation, and Representative Archer did the same.\n\n[[Page S6334]]\n\n  In the meantime, it enhances conservation easements, reduces rates. I \nreally cannot think of a good argument against this. And yet \nconstituents may ask: Why can't you get it to a vote? Why do you need \nto worry about this?\n  The reason is, frankly, because of the rules of the Senate, any \nSenator has the ability to raise nongermane matters until we have had a \ncloture motion voted on and approved. There are those who would like to \ntake advantage of this opportunity to raise their favorite issue in \nthat way. If enough people do that with these nongermane riders which \nwe have all heard so much about, it can sink the ship that otherwise \nwould carry the legislative business to the President for his \nsignature.\n\n  I hope that will not happen. I hope very much we can reach an \nagreement to quickly take up and consider any amendments and then vote \nfor the repeal of the estate tax, vote for the House-passed bill, H.R. \n8. I hope we can do that tomorrow at the very latest. If we cannot, \nthen obviously we are going to have to file cloture and have that vote \non Thursday.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to look at this legislation very \ncarefully because there is some misinformation about it. I know I \ntalked for some time today, but hopefully I have been able to answer \nsome of the questions that have been raised in my remarks. I stand \nready to work with Senators who want to understand better exactly what \nwe are trying to do here, what the effect of it will be, and what the \nmany organizations are that support this legislation because they are \nsignificant. I certainly hope they will make their feelings known \nduring the course of the next few days, too, because it is important \nfor our colleagues to understand the depth and breadth of support for \nrepeal of the estate tax.\n  I conclude by thanking Senator Levin, again, for allowing me to take \nthis time and to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 8, to agree to a \ntime agreement that will enable us to take it up in a timely fashion, \nto get it disposed of with germane amendments as quickly as possible so \nwe can have a vote on repeal sometime this week.\n  That is something the American people would feel very proud we \naccomplished. Everyone can go back to their constituencies and brag \nabout it. It is not partisan; it is bipartisan. Republicans cannot brag \nthey did it all alone because many Democrats in the House made it \npossible with a veto-proof margin. Without the support of our \nDemocratic colleagues in the Senate, I know we would not have gotten \nthis far today.\n  I am very hopeful people on both sides of the aisle will see not just \nthe fairness of it but the political benefit in responding to our \nconstituents, which is, after all, what we are supposed to be doing \naround here. We know they would like to see repeal, and I think it is \ntime for us to show them we can get something done here; we can do this \nand not hide behind all of the usual parliamentary maneuvers that are \nso common in the Senate.\n  I am very hopeful we will be able to finish this bill by the end of \nthis week, send it on to the President, and go back to our constituents \nand say we did something very important for them: We repealed the death \ntax.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6334-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6334-S6338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NOMINATION OF MADELYN R. CREEDON, OF INDIANA, TO BE DEPUTY \n     ADMINISTRATOR FOR DEFENSE PROGRAMS, NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY \n                       ADMINISTRATION--Continued\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the nomination of \nMadelyn Creedon to be Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs, \nNational Nuclear Security Administration.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am pleased to come to the floor today \nand support the nomination of a very talented and a highly qualified \nmember of the Armed Services Committee staff to be the Deputy \nAdministrator for Defense Programs of the newly created National \nNuclear Security Administration.\n  Madelyn Creedon has served her country for her entire professional \nlife in a variety of important national security positions. She has \nserved as Associate Deputy Secretary of Energy, working closely and \ndirectly with Deputy Secretary Charles Curtis. She was the general \ncounsel for the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, and \nshe has served as minority counsel to the Committee on Armed Services \nand counsel under my predecessor, Senator Sam Nunn. She spent 10 years \nas a trial attorney in the Department of Energy.\n  Madelyn Creedon's nomination for this important position was \nunanimously reported to the full Senate by the Armed Services Committee \non April 13. After working with her for more than 8 years on the Armed \nServices Committee, I know firsthand of her extraordinary understanding \nof the national security programs of the Department of Energy and of \nher passionate commitment to the success of these programs and to the \nnational security of the United States.\n  There are few people who have Madelyn Creedon's depth of experience \nand her knowledge in the nuclear weapons programs of the Department of \nEnergy.\n  Last month the Senate confirmed the nomination of Gen. John Gordon to \nbe the Under Secretary of the Department of Energy and the head of the \nnew National Nuclear Security Administration. All of us are aware of \nthe significant challenges General Gordon is facing in this position. \nThe Administrator of the new National Nuclear Security Administration \nis responsible for maintaining the safety, security and reliability of \nour Nation's nuclear warheads; for managing the Department of Energy \nlaboratories; for cleaning up some of the worst environmental problems \nin the country; and for addressing security problems that continue to \nundermine pubic confidence in the Department of Energy. As one of the \nsenior deputies in the National Nuclear Security Administration, \nMadelyn Creedon's knowledge and experience in all of these areas will \nbe of great assistance in helping General Gordon address the challenges \nhe is facing.\n  I had a discussion with General Gordon last week. He told me that he \nwants Madelyn Creedon to be his deputy Administrator for Defense \nPrograms, and he is anxious for Madelyn Creedon to get to work as his \nDeputy Administrator.\n  Madelyn Creedon is well known and respected by Senators on both sides \nof the aisle. Prior to her confirmation hearing in the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Warner and I received a letter from Senator Lugar. I \nwould like to quote just a few sentences from Senator Lugar's letter:\n\n       As you know, Mr. Chairman, I am a strong supporter of U.S. \n     nonproliferation efforts in the former Soviet Union. These \n     programs have continually garnered bipartisan support because \n     of the outstanding efforts of dedicated Members of Congress \n     and staff on both sides of the aisle. Madelyn's efforts in \n     this area have made tremendous contributions to the \n     successful implementation of these important programs. Her \n     oversight and legislative analyses of these programs have \n     improved our country's national security. I am confident that \n     she will provide the same level of expertise and dedication \n     if confirmed as Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs at \n     the Department of Energy.\n       It is with great enthusiasm that I offer my strong support \n     for Madelyn's nomination, and I am hopeful that members of \n     the Armed Services Committee and the full Senate will concur.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nSenator Lugar's letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. If confirmed today, I understand that Madelyn Creedon will \nbe the first woman to be placed in charge of the safety and reliability \nof America's nuclear deterrent. I cannot imagine any individual who \nwould be better qualified to handle this awesome responsibility. We \nwill miss Madelyn Creedon on the Armed Services Committee, but I think \nwe all know that the committee's and the Senate's loss will be the \ncountry's gain.\n\n[[Page S6335]]\n\n  In closing, I first thank Madelyn Creedon for her dedicated service \non the staff of the Armed Services Committee. I congratulate her on her \nnomination by the President to this important position in the \nDepartment of Energy. Finally, I thank Madelyn Creedon for her \ncontinued willingness to serve the country. And I thank her family--her \nhusband Jim, her daughter Meredith, and her son John--for their \nsacrifices in supporting her in this demanding position.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2000.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Levin: I regret that I am \n     unable to appear before your committee today to introduce a \n     fellow Hoosier and offer my support for the nomination of \n     Madelyn Creedon to the position of Deputy Administrator of \n     Defense Programs at the Department of Energy. My \n     responsibilities as Chairman of the Senate Agriculture \n     Committee have required my presence at an important oversight \n     hearing.\n       It is always a source of great pride to see Hoosiers making \n     valuable contributions to our country's security. Madelyn has \n     an outstanding record of service to the U.S. government. She \n     has served with distinction as Associate Deputy Secretary for \n     National Security Programs at the Department of Energy, as \n     General Counsel for the Base Realignment and Closure \n     Commission, and here in the Senate as Minority Council of the \n     Senate Armed Services Committee. It has been in the \n     fulfillment of this last assignment that I have had the \n     opportunity to observe and work with Madelyn.\n       As you know, Mr. Chairman, I am a strong supporter of U.S. \n     nonproliferation efforts in the former Soviet Union. These \n     programs have continually garnered bipartisan support because \n     of the outstanding efforts of dedicated Members of Congress \n     and staff on both sides of the aisle. Madelyn's efforts in \n     this area have made tremendous contributions to the \n     successful implementation of these important programs. Her \n     oversight and legislative analyses of these programs have \n     improved our country's national security. I am confident that \n     she will provide the same level of expertise and dedication \n     if confirmed as Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs at \n     the Department of Energy.\n       It is with great enthusiasm that I offer my strong support \n     for Madelyn's nomination, and I am hopeful that members of \n     the Armed Services Committee and the full Senate will concur.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard G. Lugar,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is good to see you, Madam President, and to be back \ntoday. I just arrived from New Mexico, which accounts for my failure to \nput a more conventional tie on, but if I took the time to do that I \nwould have missed an opportunity to speak on this issue.\n  I am going to take a few minutes to discuss the way I see the matter, \nthe pending nomination of Madelyn Creedon for Deputy Administrator of \nthe National Nuclear Security Administration for Defense Programs.\n  Let me start by suggesting that everyone should know, and I believe \nthe nominee understands, that she does not work for the Secretary of \nEnergy. She works for the new National Nuclear Security Administrator \nfor Defense Programs within the Department of Energy. We might hearken \nback to only a few months ago when we had a very lengthy, multiday \ndebate with reference to what we should do to reorganize the Department \nof Energy in the aftermath of the Wen Ho Lee incident, and a very major \nreport by the President's most significant security group headed by \nformer Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire.\n  They recommended, and we adopted by law, a total reorganization \nwithin the Department of Energy of the matters that pertain to nuclear \nweaponry and nonproliferation on the basis that the Department of \nEnergy had been built up just topsy-turvy and we had, within a very \ndysfunctional multilayered department, a most, most significant \nAmerican concern, to wit: the nuclear weaponry of America. Believe it \nor not, a Department called Energy is in charge of the nuclear \nlaboratories that produce all the science with reference to nuclear \nweapons and the three or four sites within America that used to produce \nweapons when we produced them. They are now part of a very dramatically \nchanged effort called science-based stockpile stewardship, which means \nwe are going to make every effort to make sure our nuclear weapons are \nsafe and secure without ever doing another nuclear test. We are trying \ndiligently to do that.\n  Now we have a new department within the Department. Let me repeat \nthat, because we are having so much difficulty getting out the message \nthat we have already created a new entity, just let it start working. \nIt is called the National Nuclear Security Administration. It is a hard \nname. In fact, I remembered it by carrying around to hearings a coffee \ncup that had ``NNSA'' on it. Then I was able to remember the name. But \nacross the country they were all asking about 6 weeks ago: What are we \ngoing to do in the aftermath of Wen Ho Lee, finding some other secrets \nthat had been misplaced in very peculiar circumstances?\n  The first thing we ought to say is that we have already done \nsomething about it. We have created a semiautonomous agency that, in \nthe not too distant future, will be running all of that. We have \nalready selected the person in charge, thank God, a very distinguished \ngeneral--that means he is a four-star--who was with the CIA, worked at \nSandia National Laboratories and was an adviser to two Presidents on \nsecurity. He has agreed to take this job. In other words, he will be \nrunning, within the Department of Energy, under his own power, all the \nnuclear weapons activities. This nominee will work for him.\n  It was very important that we find out, since he did not select her, \nwhether he wanted her for this job. I would think that would be the \nmost logical question we would have; if the new man, General Gordon, \nwho is going to run this, was not part of her selection and she was \ngoing to be his deputy, we surely ought to ask: Do you want her?\n  So I am first reporting to the Senate that I had a responsibility of \nfinding that out, because she also wanted to know.\n  I can report to the Senate that he said: As matters are going now, I \nwould not want to stand in the way--in fact, I will support her \nconfirmation by the Senate. So let's not expand much on that. Let's \njust say that the man for whom she will work, because he is going to be \nin charge of all this--she is not going to be working for the Secretary \nof Energy--has said: OK, even though I did not pick her, let's try her.\n  I also want to tell the Senate that she had a lot to do, staffwise, \nwith opposing this new law. She was the one helping Senators who \nopposed the creation of the National Nuclear Security Administration. \nSo I have talked with her at length and I have said: Will you enforce \nthis law? And she said: I will.\n  Do you understand, you are working for the general who runs the new \nNational Nuclear Security Administration?\n  She said: I do. I work for him. I will try to help him be a success.\n  Do you understand that the Secretary of Energy has created a number \nof positions that violate this law, to wit: He has put dual-hatted some \npeople to work for him and the new man, when Congress did not intend \nthat?\n  They intended that all the people who worked for the general worked \nonly for him, not the Secretary; that there not be 10, 12, 14 people \nwho worked for both of them.\n  She said: I understand that.\n  He said: Did you hear the Secretary of Energy say he would fight that \nno longer?\n  She said: I did.\n  Did you hear him say he would support amendments to totally clarify \nthis so there are no dual-hatted people who worked for both the \nSecretary of Energy and the general in charge of trying to create some \ndecent management within our nuclear weapons complex, including the \nlaboratories and the manufacturing centers and the nonproliferation \nactivities that go with the laboratories?\n  She said she understands that.\n  Everybody seems to be on board.\n  The problem is the general was just sworn in. There were a few months \nof\n\n[[Page S6336]]\n\ndelay for various reasons, not the least of which was that right after \nsigning the bill into law, the President and Secretary of Energy, Bill \nRichardson, did not seek to implement the law very quickly. As a matter \nof fact, they went very slowly.\n  We are now at a point where the general is in office, and he needs to \nbuild his team. She will be part of his team. If Senators are worried \nabout whether she will work in that regard, they can vote for her or \nagainst her. I did not come to the floor to fight her nomination \nbecause I satisfied myself that she understood the law and pledged to \nenforce it and understood she worked for the general, not for the \nSecretary of Energy, for the foreseeable future. I do not know how long \nshe will be in office. I do not know how long he will be in office, \nalthough we intend to make his term a 3-year term.\n  With that, and given this background, I will vote for her. I am \nclearly of the opinion she has sufficient talent and expertise based on \nbackground and who she worked for and what she did. I do say it will be \nvery challenging, based on her experience, for her to truly help this \ngeneral make this work because she will be working for him, a very \ndistinguished American retiring from the Air Force where he was a four-\nstar general to undertake this job. It was a true act of patriotism on \nhis part. He decided to take one of the most challenging jobs in \nGovernment, hardly understood as of today. But I assume that if it all \nworks out, he will be very well known in a few years. If it really \nworks out, he will be known for having set the nuclear weapons part of \nour Government on the right path, with the right management, not only \nwith reference to security--for that will be his job also--but he will \nset it on a management path that something as refined as our nuclear \nweapons should have in place for the American people.\n  That has not been the case. There have been at least three major \nstudies just crying out for us to fix this, the last one done by the \nPresident's board on national security matters, headed by Warren Rudman \nwith four other distinguished Americans, recommended this, and we \nhelped draft the first law. We had five chairmen on the Republican side \nsponsoring the legislation which worked its way through the Senate and \nthrough the House and has now created this semiautonomous agency that I \njust described to the Senate and to those who are interested in where \nthe security is going to come from for the nuclear weapons complex and \nour laboratories.\n  We have created a whole new management effort. It is not going to be \nsetting new boxes within the Department of Energy, which I have \npredicted will never work, but rather a total semi-independent agency \nwith its own national administrator who will have total power and \ncontrol.\n  For those who are fearful of this, we have indicated on the \nenvironmental side that they must comply with NEPA, the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act. But as to other rules and regulations, it is \nclear they can make their own, consistent with good \njudgment, preserving and protecting the safety of our nuclear weapons \nand preservation of these great National Laboratories.\n\n  We banter around the security problems that have occurred, but \neverybody knows, since the Manhattan Project, we have always had the \nbest--not the second best--we have had the very best laboratories in \nthe world in charge of our nuclear designs, the nuclear weapons \nbreakthroughs, and Los Alamos has always been the leader.\n  They are having problems. Instead of saying, here are new rules we \nare going to pass in Congress, let's just make sure we are going to \ngive the new administrator of that semiautonomous agency, General \nGordon, everything he needs to take it out from under the dysfunctional \nDepartment of Energy and run it in a semiautonomous manner as described \nby law.\n  Madelyn Creedon will be a big part of that. I came to the floor to \nspeak so she will know that many of us have a genuine interest in this \nworking, and we will have our minds and ears and eyes wide open and \npaying attention, and the Secretary of Energy knows we will, too. We \nwant this general to have as much as he needs to do this job right. She \nwill be his first assistant. Everybody should understand it is a big \njob.\n  I do not need anymore time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank my good friend from New \nMexico for support of the Creedon nomination. It is important his \nsupport be there and his voting for her is a very significant step on \nhis part. I know how deeply involved he is in the issue and how hard he \nfought for the creation of the semiautonomous agency, the National \nNuclear Security Administration. She has satisfactorily assured him and \nall of us she will fully carry out this law.\n  As a matter of fact, when she was helping the staff when this bill \nwas in the Senate, she helped us work out the bipartisan bill that \npassed the Senate by a vote of 97-1. The good Senator from New Mexico \nwas very much in the forefront of that effort to create the bipartisan \neffort that we successfully created in the Senate. Again, there was \nonly one vote against the bill as it passed the Senate, and she helped \nus perfect that bill. I want to give her some credit.\n  Perhaps even more importantly, the responsibility of whatever bumps \nthat have been along this road are ours, not hers, because she staffs \nus. Just the way we want her to be the right arm of General Gordon, so \nshe has been staffing us as well and carried out that role very well.\n  We are, as Senators, responsible for our staff's work. If there is \ndisagreement on this with some of the difficulties in creation of this \nparticular semiautonomous agency or in the way it has been implemented, \nthose disagreements lie with the Secretary of Energy or, to the extent \nthey are legislative, lie with perhaps some Senators but not surely \nwith our staffs who are carrying out our wishes, as we want and expect \nher to carry out General Gordon's wishes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, can I make sure the Senator from \nMichigan and I have one thing clear because he has been so honest with \nme once we got past this problem? We are both going to see to it, to \nthe best of our ability, that the semiautonomous agency, as created by \nlaw, is carried out. He told us that the other day when he was meeting \nwith Republicans.\n  I am very pleased because I think we all have to watch it. Clearly, \nGeneral Gordon is going to need a lot of help. I think the Senator from \nMichigan would concur it is not easy to set up a semiautonomous agency \nwithin the Department of Energy. He told us: Let's go. And so did \nSenator Lieberman: Let's get it done. Is that a fair assessment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is a fair assessment, and I think General Gordon is \nready to have Madelyn there assisting him and will be a big boost. That \nis what he told me on the phone. The Senator from New Mexico recounted \na conversation with General Gordon. I had a similar conversation with \nhim. I wanted to be sure he truly wanted Madelyn Creedon because he was \nnot the administrator at the time that nomination was forthcoming. I \nwanted to be sure he was, in fact, desirous of having her as his \ndeputy, and he is so desirous and very much supports the nomination. We \nnow can proceed to that vote, and, hopefully, she will receive an \noverwhelming vote of support.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of Ms. \nMadelyn Creedon, who has been nominated by the President to become the \nDeputy Administrator for Defense Programs of the new National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration (NNSA) at the Department of Energy.\n  Ms. Creedon has a distinguished career with broad and deep experience \nregarding Department of Energy defense programs over which she will \nhave oversight and management responsibilities in her position as \n``second in command'' at the NNSA.\n  My colleagues should be aware that before joining the staff of the \nArmed Services Committee in 1990, Ms. Creedon worked for ten years with \nthe Office of the General Counsel at the Department of Energy (DOE).\n  She returned to DOE after serving as counsel to the Armed Services \nCommittee during 1990 through 1994 during which time she had oversight \nand review responsibilities of DOE national security and environmental \nprograms.\n  At DOE, Ms. Creedon served as Associate Deputy Secretary of Energy \nfor\n\n[[Page S6337]]\n\nNational Security Programs from 1995 to 1997 when she resumed her \nposition on the Armed Services Committee, once again with oversight \nresponsibilities for DOE defense and environmental programs.\n  In short, Mr. President, Ms. Creedon's professional credentials for \nthis position are impeccable.\n  Let me add, Mr. President, that I have worked closely with her during \nthe past several years in my capacity as ranking member of the \nStrategic and Emerging Threats Subcommittees of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  I've found Ms. Creedon to be fully knowledgeable about the issues we \nhave discussed, and to be a person of sound judgment regarding possible \nsolutions in the interest of improving our national security.\n  Her professional capabilities and commitment to public service and \nnational security are plain to see for all of us on both sides of the \naisle who have worked with her.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Ms. Creedon's \nnomination to assume this important new position as Deputy \nAdministrator to NNSA. Her experience and know-how will be key to \nensuring a smooth transition to a successful NNSA.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire either of the Chair or \nSenator Levin, is there time remaining or is the vote scheduled to \noccur right at 5:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time remaining; 4 minutes on the \nRepublican side.\n  Mr. KYL. In that event, Mr. President, I would like to conclude with \nsome remarks in opposition to the nominee.\n  With all due respect to Senator Levin--he knows I have the utmost \nrespect for him--I believe Madelyn Creedon is not qualified for this \nvery important position, one of the most important positions in our \nGovernment. She has never held the kind of positions, as her \npredecessors have, that would qualify her to head this particular \nagency.\n  The Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs has the direct \nauthority over the Directors of the three National Laboratories, the \nhead of the Nevada Test Site, and the heads of the four nuclear weapons \nproduction facilities. This is the person who is in charge of our \nnuclear weapons production facilities, as well as the nuclear weapons \nlaboratories and programs.\n  While Ms. Creedon has worked as Senator Levin's counsel, before that \nand in between working for Senator Levin, she has also served as \ngeneral counsel on the Base Closure Commission. She also served for a \nlittle over a year as an assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Energy. \nAnd she was counsel for special litigation at the Department of Energy \nfrom 1980 to 1990.\n  She has never had the kind of educational background or \nadministrative background that would qualify her for this position. The \nDeputy Administrator will be called upon to manage numerous large and \nvery technically complex projects that are expanding the limits of \nAmerica's scientific knowledge. Experience in managing large \norganizations and a technical background are highly desirable.\n  The previous holder of this position, for example, Dr. Victor Reis, \nhas a Ph.D. in physics and previously headed the Defense Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency--or DARPA, as we know it--and also served as \nDirector of Defense Research and Engineering at the Department of \nDefense.\n  We have known for a long time that our nuclear weapons program has \nhad great problems. With the appointment now of General Gordon to head \nthe security side of this program, as Senator Domenici has just talked \nabout, I think it is important that we have somebody really well \nqualified as the Deputy Administrator. I do not believe it is accurate \nto say that Ms. Creedon is his nominee. I think it is accurate to say \nhe has no objection to her nomination.\n  But as was pointed out, her nomination was made prior to the time he \ntook his position. While I am certain that her nomination will be \nconfirmed here today, I think for those of us who believe very strongly \nin national security, a strong nuclear weapons program, and a future \nthat will ensure that our weapons are safe and reliable, it requires us \nto vote ``no'' on a nomination which is clearly inferior.\n  There are 50 people who could readily be identified who have far \nsuperior qualifications to serve in this highly technical, very \nimportant post. For that reason, again, with all due deference to \nSenator Levin, and with deference to the nominee, I will be voting \n``no'' and urging my colleagues to do the same.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Do I have 1 minute left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will just use one of my minutes to fill in part of the \nrecord, and then we want to proceed to a vote.\n  Madelyn Creedon has also served as Associate Deputy Secretary of \nEnergy for National Security Programs. It is a very important part of \nher background where she worked directly with then-Deputy Secretary of \nEnergy Charles Curtis. In addition to being minority counsel for the \nArmed Services Committee, she served as counsel under my predecessor, \nSenator Nunn, when he was chairman of the committee.\n  So there are some additional important facets of her experience. As \nthe Senator from Arizona mentioned, and as the Senator from New Mexico \nmentioned, General Gordon, who is the new person to run the agency, to \nrun this new semiautonomous entity, specifically told me not just that \nhe has no objection, but he supports her being both appointed and \nconfirmed, and he had no objection to my putting it that way.\n  So the person for whom we have voted and confirmed overwhelmingly to \nrun this semiautonomous agency is anxious to get her on board and very \nmuch supports her nomination and confirmation.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield back any time we might have. I \nunderstand we will proceed to vote when time is yielded back.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Madelyn R. Creedon, of Indiana, to be Deputy Administrator for \nDefense Programs, National Nuclear Security Administration? The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. \nFitzgerald), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from \nArizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski), the \nSenator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum), the Senator from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Specter), and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. \nDurbin), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the \nSenator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. \nMikulski), and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Torricelli) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 30, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 172 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--30\n\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n\n[[Page S6338]]\n\n\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n\n                             NOT VOTING--16\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Durbin\n     Fitzgerald\n     Harkin\n     Inhofe\n     Kerry\n     Leahy\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Santorum\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, what is the pending business now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Interior appropriations bill, H.R. 4578.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we are working to go forward tonight on the \nDefense authorization bill. I see the managers are on the floor, the \nchairman and ranking member, and I presume that will be something we \ncan do around 6:30 or 7 o'clock.\n  I will check with the managers of the Interior appropriations bill \nand see if there is any further business they need to do on that bill \ntonight before we go to Defense authorization.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from West Virginia on the floor. As \none of the managers, does Senator Byrd know if there is further \nbusiness on the Interior appropriations bill tonight?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in talking a little earlier with the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington, Mr. Gorton, he indicated to me \nthat we had completed our work today on that bill and we would be back \non it tomorrow. I assume he did not anticipate anything further today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that was my understanding also, but I wanted \nto doublecheck. We will make one last check with Senator Gorton on \nthat. We are hoping good progress can be made on the Interior \nappropriations bill tomorrow, hopefully even finish it tomorrow, if at \nall possible, and we will be glad to work with the managers on that.\n  I yield to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just for a question.\n  As I understand it, the majority leader is going to propound a \nunanimous consent request to consider the Defense authorization bill. I \nwill not object to that. But I hope the leader would consider moving \nback to the consideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nat an evening session following the disposition.\n  I do not want to object to moving to this particular proposal, but I \nexpect to object to going to other proposals if we are not given at \nleast some assurance that we are going to revisit the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  I commend the leader for having the night sessions. I think this is \nchallenging all of us. I think we ought to be responsive to that. I \ncertainly welcome the leader's determination to move the process \nforward in the Senate, but I hope at least the leader could work out, \nwith our leadership, some opportunity for an early return to the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  I will not object on this particular request this evening, but I do \nwant to indicate, as that debate is going on for tonight and tomorrow \nevening, I hope we will have the opportunity for the leader to speak \nwith Senator Daschle and work out a process. If we are not going to do \nthat, then I will be constrained to object in the future, until we have \nsome opportunity, with certainty, of revisiting the elementary and \nsecondary education legislation, which is so basic and fundamentally \nimportant to families in this country.\n  I thank the leader for yielding.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to Senator Kennedy's \nquestion, first of all, I, too, would very much like to see us complete \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The committee did very good \nwork on that legislation. The Senate spent a week, over a week perhaps, \nhaving amendments offered and voted on.\n  With regard to the underlying Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nand other nongermane amendments that were offered, that delayed our \nability to complete that legislation. But I feel very strongly about \ngetting it done. I am very pleased with the condition the bill is in. I \nthink it might be a good idea that we workout an arrangement on the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act for next week, perhaps similar \nto what we have done with the DOD authorization bill, hoping to work on \nthat bill tonight and having votes on amendments, if any are ordered, \nin the morning; the same thing tomorrow night with votes occurring the \nnext morning. We could do the same thing on the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  But there is a key thing here. On the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, some nongermane amendments were offered delaying our \nability to complete our work on that, and some that were germane. But \nwe reached a point where we needed to try to find an agreement to \ncomplete our work.\n  After being abused severely by both sides of the aisle, perhaps, \ndepending on your point of view--the Defense authorization bill had all \nkinds of nongermane amendments offered to it--after a period of time, \nthere was an agreement that we needed to see if we could complete \naction on this very important Department of Defense authorization bill; \nit provides very important changes in the law, things that cannot be \ndone just with the Defense appropriations bill, including improvements \nin the health care benefits for our military men and women and their \nfamilies, and our retirees. We have to do this bill to get it done.\n  Therefore, under the persistent leadership of the Senator from \nVirginia and the Senator from Michigan, the managers, we came to an \nagreement last week, a unanimous consent agreement, that nongermane \namendments would not be offered any longer and all amendments had to be \noffered by the close of business Friday.\n  While they have a long list of amendments they have to work through, \nI am satisfied they can get it done now that they are focused on \namendments related to the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  I would be glad to pursue a similar type arrangement with the \nDemocratic leadership, with Senator Kennedy involved, where we could \nmaybe get a list of amendments by the close of business Friday, work on \nthe bill at night but limit it to germane amendments that could be \ndebated and voted on and complete action, hopefully, in a relatively \nreasonable period of time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator can yield for a very brief observation?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think that is a very reasonable request, with the \nunderstanding that school safety and security is also of fundamental \nimportance to families and to schools. I think we have had good debates \non class size, on afterschool programs, on well-trained teachers, new \ntechnologies, on accountability, measures about training programs and \nother programs. We can debate all of those matters. If we do not have \nsafety in the schools as well, those matters will have much less \nrelevance than they otherwise might.\n\n  I guess we still have some differences with the majority leader on \nthe issue of school safety. I think most parents in the country believe \nthat is a relevant amendment. Under the particular procedures of the \nSenate, it might be declared not to be, but certainly I think, for most \nMembers of the Senate, it would be.\n  I, for one, would be willing to let that decision be made by the \nSenate, if we could have a vote up or down on that issue, about whether \nit is relevant or not relevant. I have not mentioned it or talked it \nover with the sponsors of the amendment or the leader, but I would \nthink we could have a judgment made on that by the Senate itself in a \nvery quick order and have that resolved and then move to the other \namendments, if it is agreeable with the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. As I say, we will work with the Democratic leadership and \nsee if we can work out an agreement similar to the one we have on the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill.\n\n[[Page S6339]]\n\n  Let me make it clear. Being the son of a schoolteacher--in public \nschools, I might add--I know the importance of safety. I also know the \nimportance of discipline because I have been the beneficiary of \ndiscipline from my mother, the schoolteacher.\n  I also know Americans all over this country, in every State, would \nlike to have our schools be safe and drug free. So the idea that we \nwould have metal detector devices where that is called for in certain \nschools, and where we would have other efforts to make sure the schools \nare safer, that is something, certainly, we should all work toward. \nHopefully, we could do that when we take up the legislation.\n  I understand there was a suggestion earlier that there had been some \ndelay in calling up the legislation referred to generally as H-1B \nlegislation, that is, S. 2045, which would allow for certain high-tech \nworkers to come into the country on a limited basis and for a limited \nperiod of time, and that, for some reason, had not been called up \nbecause of something that we had not been doing.\n  Let me emphasize that I want this legislation to be considered. I \nwould like us to move it as quickly as possible. The problem we got \ninto earlier when we were trying to work out an agreement was we were \ntold there would have to be numerous amendments--I don't know, six or \neight amendments, that were nongermane that would be in order for us to \nconsider this very important legislation that I think has bipartisan \nsupport and that many people in this country, in business and industry \nand high tech, say addresses a major problem because the number that is \nallowed is now being reached and we need this legislation. I want to \nmake it very clear we are not only willing to move it; we are anxious.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate now proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 490, S. 2045, the H-1B legislation, and I further ask \nunanimous consent the committee substitute be agreed to, the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the title amendment be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill appear in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the leader, I know how difficult his \njob is, but, in spite of the difficulty of his job, H-1B is something \nthat we on the minority side believe should have its day in the Senate. \nI have been assigned by our leader to come up with a number of \namendments on our side. We have whittled it down from 10. I think we \ncould get back on six or seven amendments. We would have short time \nagreements on every one of those. Most of them would be relevant, would \nbe germane. They relate to the subject at issue.\n  I say to my friend from Mississippi, it reminds me of Senator \nMoynihan. He wrote a very nice piece called ``Defining Deviancy Down'' \na few years ago, indicating although we believed some things were real \nbad, with the encroachment of time and change of mores, we started \naccepting those things that at one time were bad. That does not make it \ngood that we are accepting it, but that is what Senator Moynihan wrote \nabout, and I am confident he was right.\n  I say to my friend, the majority leader, that is kind of what we have \nhere--not defining deviancy, but defining Senate procedure down. We are \nnot filibustering H-1B. We want to have this. We believe it could be \ncompleted in 1 day.\n  If you look at the definition of ``filibuster,'' we are not \nfilibustering anything. This is the definition from the dictionary: The \nuse of irregular or obstructive tactics, such as exceptionally long \nspeeches by a member of a minority in a legislative assembly to prevent \nthe adoption of a measure generally favored or to force a decision \nalmost unanimously disliked.\n  We are not filibustering. We want H-1B to come before this body. We \nwant to work with you. We agree it is important legislation, but can't \nwe have a few amendments? We are going to have short time agreements. \nWe are not asking that things that are not relevant be brought up. We \nhave matters that relate to immigration in this country.\n  As I say, I have been given the assignment by our leader to see how \nwe can squeeze down these amendments. I feel almost as if we have lost \nby doing this. We do not like that, but we have agreed to work with the \nleader and have a number of amendments, have time agreements, to move \nthis legislation forward.\n  I hope the leader will allow us that luxury, and I say ``luxury'' in \nthe sense recognizing what Senator Moynihan wrote. A year or two ago, \nwe would never have considered this because that was not the way we did \nthings in the Senate. We believe matters should be brought up and \nhandled as they have for over 200 years in this body, unless someone \nelse wants to speak.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving my objection.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be willing to go to H-1B tonight, ask \nconsent to go without the restrictions? I certainly urge our Democratic \nleadership to go to it. If he wants to go to it, let's go to H-1B.\n  Mr. REID. We have a number of amendments, I say to my friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let the Senate work its will. He indicated he would. \nAfter he objects, our Democratic leader will ask to go to that, will \nmove to go to H-1B, put it before the Senate, and let's go ahead and \nconsider it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I did ask consent, as a matter of fact. That \nis what the reservation is on: that we go to this bill, and we pass \nthis bill tonight.\n  I might also add, earlier I asked consent that we go to the bill and \nthat there be five relevant amendments on each side of the aisle, that \nsecond-degree amendments be in order, which would have brought it to 20 \namendments, and that was objected to on the Democratic side of the \naisle. Even the idea of 10 amendments with second-degree amendments in \norder was objected to.\n  First of all, I assume this is not controversial. I assume it has \nbroad support on both sides of the aisle. I assume it is something the \nSenate wants to get done. That is all I am trying to do. I heard today \nthe Democratic leaders saying they want to do this bill; that we were \nholding it up. I am trying to find a way to move it. Let me emphasize \nthis, too.\n  Some people say: Why don't you just call it up and let it go the way \nSenators would like to handle it, amendments and everything else.\n  Here is what we have to do this week alone: The Interior \nappropriations bill; we are going to be doing the Defense authorization \nbill at night; we are going to have a procedure to finally eliminate \nthe death tax; we are going to have a procedure to get a vote on \neliminating the marriage penalty tax. That is all this week.\n\n  Also along the way, we are going to try to get an agreement to take \nup the Thompson nonproliferation language with regard to China so that \nwe can find a time to go to the China PNTR bill. We also have to do the \nAgriculture appropriations bill, the energy and water appropriations \nbill, Housing and Urban Development and Veterans appropriations bill, \nthe Commerce- State-Justice appropriations bill, and the DC \nappropriations bill.\n  We should do all of those before we recess for the August recess. We \nhave done six so far, and that has been with a lot of cooperation on \nboth sides and a lot of pushing and pleading because every time an \nappropriations bill is offered, 100 amendments appear. On the Defense \nauthorization bill, I think there are 200 amendments.\n  As far as this job of trying to coordinate all these different \ninterests being a problem, I do not view it that way. It is just we \nhave to have some reasonable understanding of how we are going to \nproceed to get four major bills done this week, to get five more \nappropriations bills done before the August recess, to get the Thompson \nnonproliferation language considered, and to get the China PNTR \nlegislation considered as soon as possible.\n  We would like to find a way to work in among that, maybe at night, \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I would love to pass that \nlegislation just as it is or even after some more amendments, but we \nhave to find\n\n[[Page S6340]]\n\na time. We can do that at night. We can work day and night for the next \n3 weeks.\n  I would like to do the H-1B. I tried to offer an agreement that could \nhave led to 20 amendments. That was objected to on the other side. I am \ntrying to find a way to get all these good things done. I will continue \nto try and hopefully we will be able to work out an agreement to \nconsider them all. These appropriations bills are high priority. That \nis the people's business.\n  If we do not get the appropriations bills done, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment is going to have a problem with housing in which they are \ninvolved. The energy and water appropriations bill has a lot of very \nimportant energy-and-water-related issues. Certainly both sides of the \naisle would like to see us get to the Agriculture appropriations bill \nat the earliest possible date, hopefully next Tuesday at the latest. \nThose are all the things we have to do.\n  I want to make sure--I am willing to go to H-1B right away, pass it \nor to get some agreement that will not take 3, 4 days on one bill in \namong all these other urgent bills we have to do.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will allow me----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. If I may make a statement on my reservation. Reserving the \nright to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We really should have H-1B passed. It does not mean \neverybody is in favor of it, but it is something that needs to be done. \nIt is very important legislation. We need to have the matter debated. I \nhope the leader will take back the colloquy today. The Senator \nmisspoke. He said 20 amendments. I think he meant 10 amendments with \nfive on each side. Ten on each side would be a deal. We can do that \nthis instant. I think the majority leader made a mistake.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Actually, it is five on each side, which would be 10, plus \nsecond-degree amendments would have been in order, which could have \nbrought it to 20.\n  Mr. REID. I hope the Senator will withdraw his unanimous consent \nrequest; otherwise, we will object to it. We first should see if it can \nbe brought up and debated as any other matter. I think I know the \nanswer to that question. Then the Senator should review his suggestion \nthat we have five amendments per side and, of course, if relevant \nincludes immigration-related and training-related amendments, we may \nnot be able to do five. But I did indicate to the Senator, we were \nalready down to seven. We are down to seven amendments on our side. We \nwould agree----\n  Mr. LOTT. Seven amendments on H-1B or seven amendments on estate tax.\n  Mr. REID. H-1B. We should revisit this issue. If the Senator wants to \nreintroduce his unanimous consent request tomorrow, fine. Let's see if \nwe can come up with something that will meet the timeframe of what the \nmajority leader wishes. As I have indicated, this is not my preference \nin doing business, but this legislation is very important, and I want \nto spread upon the Record the fact we are not trying to hold up this \nlegislation. The minority wants to move forward, as Senator Daschle \nindicated today. If the Senator persists in his unanimous consent \nrequest, I will object. I hope the Senator will withdraw that and see \nif in the next 24 hours we can work something out on this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. So the record will be clear, I am trying hard to find a way \nto get this considered. I won't insist on my unanimous consent request, \nbut since we are working night and day and looking for ways to get \nthese things done, if you are down to seven, if you can get it down to \nfive relevant amendments, and we can continue to work on this, maybe \nthis would be a bill we could do at night the third week, but we are \nwilling to see if we can find a way to get it done.\n\n  Mr. REID. I think this is Mississippi math because we started at 10 \nand kind of split the difference.\n  Mr. LOTT. No, no. It was 5 and 5.\n  Mr. REID. No, but it was 10 on our side. We said 10; you said 5. But \nnow I said we are down to 7.\n  Mr. LOTT. You are headed in the right direction. Just keep working. \nYou are making progress.\n  Mr. REID. So I hope we can work something out on this. In the \nmeantime, Mr. President----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am a little uncomfortable with the discussion here. The \ndiscussion is: Under what conditions will the majority leader allow us \nto consider this bill? I understand that amendments are inconvenient, \nbut the rules of the Senate allow people to be elected to the Senate \nand offer amendments and consider legislation.\n  The unanimous consent request offered by the majority leader was to \ntake up this bill and pass it without any discussion or any amendments. \nNow there is a negotiation here saying: Maybe I will allow it to be \nbrought to the floor if the Senator from Nevada would, on behalf of his \nside, agree to no more than five amendments.\n  The fact is, it seems to me if we fretted a little less about what \nsomeone might do when they bring something to the floor and started \nworking through it, it would probably take a whole lot less time.\n  I happen to be supportive of the H-1B legislation, but I am not very \nsupportive of some notion of anybody in the Senate saying: Here are the \nconditions under which we will consider it--and only these conditions--\nand if you don't like it, we won't consider it.\n  I hope the Senator from Nevada--if the majority leader insists on his \nunanimous consent request--will make a unanimous consent request \nfollowing that similar to the one suggested by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, a unanimous consent request to bring the issue to the \nfloor under the regular order at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would withhold, I do ask unanimous consent \nthat the H-1B legislation be brought before the Senate at this time, \nthat we be allowed to proceed on that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I withhold that UC request I made, but I \nobject to the one that was just made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while the distinguished leader is on the \nfloor, there was some hope we could bring up the military authorization \nbill tonight. Senator Levin and I consulted with you on this, I say to \nthe majority leader. We will have for our joint leadership tomorrow a \nlist of amendments, with time agreements, and be ready to go. I say to \nthe majority leader, you can splice this in as you see fit. I assure \nthe majority leader--I see my distinguished colleague from Michigan on \nthe floor--my colleague from Michigan is ready to join me on this. We \nwill present to our joint leadership specific germane amendments on the \nlist, and move along on this bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I am not sure \nwhat that means. That means, I think, you are not going to be able to \nconsider any amendments tonight.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. We made a strong effort.\n  Mr. LOTT. When you say you will present a list of amendments, and \nwill try to work them through the process, that does mean, I take it, \nthe amendments still would be debated, if they have to be debated.\n\n[[Page S6341]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Tuesday night.\n  Mr. WARNER. Tuesday night.\n  Mr. LOTT. The votes would occur on Wednesday morning, if any?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Do you have any amendments where there would be a need for \na vote in the morning?\n  Mr. WARNER. Not tomorrow morning, I say to the leadership.\n  Mr. LOTT. Can you give me an idea about how many nights might be \ninvolved here because we are already beginning to think about another \nbill next week.\n  Mr. WARNER. I listened to that very carefully. I would say that with \nthree evenings we can do it. And there may be a juncture during the \ncourse of the day when there could be an hour or two. If you give us a \nring, we will have an amendment to plug in for that brief period of \ntime.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the leader will yield, it would be very helpful--I know \nit is difficult, and I have not had a chance to speak to my chairman \nabout this, but if we knew in advance about when we would start the \nevening proceeding, I think that would help us line up some amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe sort of the gentlemen's agreement we were talking \nabout last week was that we would start at about 6:30 or 7 o'clock, but \nnot later than 7, and hopefully as early as 6:30 tomorrow night, \npossibly even Wednesday night. Thursday night is not likely. So then \nyou might have to look at next Monday night for the third night, if a \nthird night in fact is used.\n  There is a possibility we will reach a moment of lull or we will see \nan hour or two coming sometime during the day, and we will call quickly \nand ask for the managers to come over and do some of their work.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That would be good.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, just being involved on the \nfringes of this legislation, I think with the work of Senator Levin and \nSenator Warner, they will complete this in two nights.\n  Mr. LOTT. I like the sound of that. Good luck.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I just want to take a moment of the \nSenate's time to speak about the two issues that have been talked about \nrecently. One is the H-1B visa issue, to which the majority leader \nreferred, as did Senator Reid and Senator Dorgan, which will lift the \ncaps so that we can have available to American industry some of the \nable, gifted, and talented individuals who have come to this country \nand who can continue to make a difference in terms of our economy.\n  We are in the process--at least I thought so, as a member of the \nImmigration Subcommittee--of working with Senator Abraham from the \nState of Michigan, in working that process through to try to respond to \nthe concerns that the leadership have; and that is that we debate that \nissue in a timely way, with a limited number of amendments, and that we \nreach a final conclusion in a relatively short period of time.\n  I had believed that those negotiations, at least from our side, were \nvery much on track. During the negotiations, we had talked to the White \nHouse as well as with the House Judiciary Committee members, all of \nwhom have an obvious interest.\n  So it did come as kind of a surprise--not that we are not prepared to \nmove ahead. I would be prepared to move ahead even this evening. I do \nnot know where the Senator from Michigan, who has the prime \nresponsibility for that legislation, is this evening. He is not on the \nfloor. But he has been conscientious in addressing that question.\n  One of the fundamental concerns--as we move toward permitting a \nnumber of individuals who have special skills to come in and fill in \nwith the special slots that are crying out for need in our economy--is \na recognition that, within our society, these are jobs that eventually \nshould be available to American workers. There is nothing magical about \nthese particular jobs--that if Americans have the opportunity for \ntraining, for additional kinds of education, they would be well \nqualified to hold these jobs.\n  Many of us have believed, as we have addressed the immediate need for \nthe increase, that we also ought to address additional kinds of \ntraining programs, so that in the future we will have these kinds of \nhigh-paying jobs which offer enormous hope and opportunity to \nindividuals, as well as the companies for whom they work, being made \navailable to Americans. We discussed and debated those issues with the \nJudiciary Committee. We made pretty good progress on those issues. So I \nthink there is a broad degree of support in terms of trying to address \nthat issue.\n  But there are also some particular matters that cry out for justice \nas well. When you look back on the immigration issues, there were \nprobably 350,000, perhaps 400,000 individuals who qualified for an \namnesty program that was part of the law. As a result of a court \nholding that was actually overturned, all of these individuals' lives \nhave been put at risk and, without any degree of certainty, subject to \ninstances of deportation. So we wanted to try to address this issue. It \nseems to me that could be done in a relatively short period of time. It \nis a question of fundamental decency and fundamental justice.\n\n  We treat individuals who come from Central American countries \ndifferently, depending upon which country they come from. Therefore, \nthere was some desire we would have a common position with regard to \nindividuals. Senator Moynihan had introduced legislation to that \neffect. That is basically a question of equity. There are really no \nsurprises. It is not a new subject to Members of the Senate. It is \nsomething about which many of us have heard, on different occasions, \nwhen we have been back to see our constituencies.\n  These are some of the items that I think we could reach, if there \nwere differences, a reasonable time agreement. But they are fundamental \nin terms of justice and fairness to individuals and their families.\n  If we are going to consider one aspect of change in the immigration \nlaw, it is not unreasonable to say if we are going to address that now, \nwe ought to at least have the Senate vote in a responsible way on these \nother matters in a relatively short period of time so the Senate can be \nmeeting its responsibilities in these other areas. So I look forward to \nthe early consideration of this bill.\n  This isn't the first time we have dealt with the H-1B issue. We made \nsome changes a few years ago. We were able to work it out in a \nbipartisan way. There is no reason that American industry should have \nconcern that we are not going to take action. We will take action. \nHopefully, we will do it in the next 3 weeks. There is no reason we \nshould not.\n  The other issue is the question of elementary and secondary \neducation. I certainly understand the responsibilities we have in \ncompleting Defense authorization, which is enormously important \nlegislation. I am heartened by what the majority leader has said with \nregard to the follow-on in terms of elementary and secondary education. \nThat is a priority for all American families. We ought to debate it. \nThe principal fact is that we have debated it for 6 days and we have \nhad seven amendments. Three of them were virtually unanimous. We didn't \nhave to have any rollcall votes. On 2 of the 6 days, we were restricted \nbecause we were forbidden to offer amendments and have votes. We \nhaven't had a very busy time with that as compared to the bankruptcy \nlegislation, where we had 15 days and more than 55 amendments.\n\n  In allocating time, we are asking for fairness to the American \nfamilies on education. If the Senate is going to take 15 days and have \n55 amendments on bankruptcy legislation, we can take a short period of \ntime--2 or 3 days--and have good debate on the question of elementary \nand secondary education,\n\n[[Page S6342]]\n\nwhich is so important to families across the country.\n  With all respect to the majority leader, the issue of school safety \nis out there. We need to ensure that we will do everything we possibly \ncan to make sure we are not only going to have small class sizes, well-\ntrained teachers, afterschool programs, efforts to try to help to \nrespond to the needed repairs that are so necessary to so many schools \nacross this country, and strong accountability provisions but make sure \nthat, even if we are able to get those, the schools are going to be \nsafe. We have measures we believe the Senate should address to make \nthem safe.\n  If the majority is going to continue to, in a real way, filibuster, \neffectively, the consideration of elementary and secondary education by \nnever bringing the matter before the Senate, they bear the \nresponsibility of doing so. It is their responsibility. Every family in \nthis country ought to understand that because they have the power, the \nauthority, and the responsibility to put that before the Senate. If \nthere is a question in terms of the relevancy or nonrelevancy of a \nparticular amendment, the Senate can make that decision. But when we \nare denying families in this country the opportunity to address that \nand respond to it, we do a disservice to the families and to the \nchildren in this country, and, I believe, to the Senate itself.\n  This issue isn't going to go away. It will not go away. We may have \nonly 3 more weeks, but we are going to continue to press it. We are \ngoing to press it all during July and all during September as well. It \nwill not go away. Elementary and secondary education needs to be \naddressed. We have to take action. We owe it to the American families, \nand we have every intention of pursuing it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6342-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BRIGADIER GENERAL PAUL M. HANKINS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding officer in the United States Air Force who is an individual \nwe have each come to know over the past two-years--Brigadier General \nPaul M. Hankins.\n  As those of us who work on national security matters know, General \nHankins has been serving as the Deputy Director of Legislative Liaison, \nwhere he has worked closely with us on a variety of issues of great \nimportance to the defense of the nation. As he has done in all his \nprevious assignments, General Hankins distinguished himself as an \nindividual of selflessness who possesses a strong sense of service and \nan unflagging dedication to executing his duties to the best of his \nabilities.\n  General Hankins arrived at the job of Deputy Director of Legislative \nLiaison well prepared for the position. A graduate of the United States \nAir Force Academy, he is a career personnel officer whose assignments \nare a mix of operational, joint, and high-level staff duties. Included \namong his tours are assignments at Tactical Air Command, Air Training \nCommand, Air Combat Command, and the Air Force Personnel Center. The \nGeneral has also served previously in the Secretary of the Air Force's \nOffice of Legislative Liaison and with the Office of the Undersecretary \nof Defense for Personnel and Readiness. He commanded the 6th Support \nGroup at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, and he served as chief of the \nAir Force Colonels' Group.\n  During the 106th Congress, General Hankins has been a valuable \nintermediary between the Congress and the Air Force on any number of \nvital matters. He always provided clear, concise, and timely \ninformation that was beneficial in supporting our deliberations on \nnational security matters. Clearly, the leadership, professional \nabilities, experiences, and expertise of General Hankins enabled him to \nfoster excellent working relationships that benefitted the Air Force \nand the Untied States Senate.\n  On a personal note, I am pleased to point out that I have known \nGeneral Hankins since his days as a young captain, when he first \ndemonstrated his skills at building ties with the Legislative Branch. \nAt the time, he was serving at Kelly Air Force Base near San Antonio \nwhen he met a young woman who was a member of my Washington staff and \nvisiting that facility. To make a long story short, Paul Hankins and \nthe former Donna Folse fell in love, had a whirlwind romance, and got \nmarried approximately one-year after they began dating. Today, they \nhave been married for fifteen years and together, they have raised two \nfine children, Priscilla and Clark.\n  The reward that the Air Force is giving General Hankins for doing a \ndifficult and demanding job well is to give him an even more \nchallenging assignment, solving the recruiting and retention issues \nfacing the Air Force. Then again, given how the General has repeatedly \ndemonstrated his ability to successfully meet and complete any \nassignment with which he has been tasked, it should not be surprising \nthat the Secretary and Chief of Staff would select him to head-up this \neffort.\n  I am confident that I speak for all my colleagues when I say that we \nare grateful and appreciative for the hard work of General Hankins \nduring his tenure as Deputy Director of Air Force Legislative Liaison. \nHe is a credit to the Air Force and he can be proud of both the record \nof accomplishment he has created and the high regard in which he is \nheld. We wish the General the best of luck in his new assignment and \ncontinued success in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6342-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6342-S6343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, last week, I was successful in achieving \nthe inclusion of a bipartisan amendment in the Manager's Amendment on \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriation bill, on \none of the most important issues we will deal with in this Congress--\nthe poor condition of our Nation's school buildings.\n  Let me briefly describe this amendment before I talk about the larger \nproblem this amendment is seeking to address.\n  This amendment is co-sponsored by Senator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, \nand Senator Hutchison from Texas--this bipartisan group should send a \nvery strong signal that this amendment is worthy of support.\n  This is a very simple amendment. Both the House and Senate versions \nof the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill set aside $25 million for Impact \nAid school construction. This amendment increases that amount to $10 \nmillion.\n  It offsets the increase by reducing the administrative and related \nexpenses of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and \nEducation on a pro rata basis by $10 million.\n  Allow me to explain why this amendment is so important to me and to \nthe bi-partisan group of Senators that support this amendment.\n  As you know, there are a number of pending bills that address our \nnation's school construction needs. And in the past days, we have voted \non a number of amendments addressing school construction issues \ngenerally.\n  These funds assist local school districts who are then able to raise \nthe remainder of their construction funds through bond issues. Like \nother school costs, the bonds are paid for by taxes on local property.\n  Issuing bonds is a time-honored approach to school construction. But \nin the heated national debate, one group of children is continually \nleft out in the cold--students who live on federally owned land, \nusually an Indian reservation or a military installation.\n  In Montana, some 12,000 children fall into this category.\n  These schools are located in areas where much of the local property \ncan't be taxed because of Federal activities. This tax-exempt property \nmay be a military base or an Indian reservation.\n  In many cases, the local public schools have to educate the children \nof families that live on the property. These so-called ``Federal \nStudents'' could come from military families. They could come from \ncivilian families. They could come from Native American families.\n  The Congress has recognized its responsibility for these schools \nthrough payments authorized by Title VIII of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  The House and Senate bills allocate $25 million for school \nconstruction to be distributed under Section 8007 of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  This is simply insufficient to meet the needs of these federally \nimpacted schools.\n  In fiscal year 2000, Montana had 28 school districts that were 50 \npercent or more impacted with either Indian land children or military \nstudents. Nationwide, there were 249 such districts.\n  In FY2000, the average allocation per school district in Montana of \nImpact Aid funds is just below $18,000. The average dollar received per \nstudent is $57.\n  Think about that for a moment. $57 for construction is not going to \ndo a heck of a lot of good for schools that are literally falling down.\n  Now, under the FY2001 appropriations bill, funding would increase to \napproximately $90 per student. And while that's better than $57, it \nstill falls way short of meeting the needs of our students.\n  Let me tell you a couple of stories to illustrate this point.\n  I remember talking last year with the Superintendent for the Harlem \nSchool District Don Bidwell. His district is so crowded, he has \nstudents\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\nusing a closet, where they used to keep the snow blower, for a \nclassroom. Now the snow blower is in the hall and the students are in \nthe closet.\n  And let me tell you about a recent visit with Steve Smyth, the \nSuperintendent of the Browning school district in Montana.\n  Browning is situated in one of the windiest areas of Montana. Mr. \nSmyth informed me that a year ago, the students, teachers, \nadministrators and community watched the roof on the high school \nbuilding literally curl up like the lid on a sardine can because of the \nharsh winds.\n  Just to replace that roof, the district spent $115,881. And yet, they \nonly received $27,000 for school construction and repairs in FY 2000. \nHow can we justify giving them only enough money to pay for one-fourth \nof their roof? That is a disgrace.\n  Let me give you another example. In 1998, the Box Elder school \nreceived $13,000 in Impact Aid construction funding. In FY 2000, they \nreceived $19,500. That might be enough to give half the building a \npaint job, but not for much more.\n  It's like trying to put out a fire with squirt gun. What this school \nreally needs is a new building or a major renovation.\n  The condition of these schools is not a Montana problem. Nor a \nNebraska problem. Nor a partisan problem.\n  Instead, it's a national problem.\n  As a nation, we can no longer pretend that this is a problem in a few \nschools in a few states that can be solved with a few scraps from our \nfederal education appropriation.\n  Every child in the United States deserves a healthy learning \nenvironment. An important and vital part of that environment is the \nphysical structure the learning takes place in. Our children should be \nconfident their school will still be standing by the end of the day. \nOur children shouldn't fear that their school is going to burn down \nbecause of faulty wiring.\n  Mothers and fathers should know that when they drop their children \noff at school or send them off to the school bus, that they are sending \nthem to a safe place.\n  I am pleased the managers of this bill saw this amendment fit to be \nincluded in their amendment. I thank Senators Bingaman, Domenici, and \nHutchison from Texas for their support. I hope that the conferees will \nmaintain this increased level of funding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6344-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REFORMING UNILATERAL SANCTIONS ON FOOD AND MEDICINE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to address recent \ndevelopments in the effort to reform our sanctions policy towards food \nand medicine.\n  Let me recall a bit of recent history. Late last year, the Senate \npassed legislation to end the use of food and medicine as a weapon of \nforeign policy. We passed it by a substantial margin--70 to 28--as an \namendment to the FY 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill.\n  We have both moral and commercial concerns. It is just wrong to \ninflict suffering on innocent people by withholding food and medicine \nbecause we oppose the policies of their government. This goes against \nthe core values of our nation.\n  Commercially, the reform legislation would open markets to American \nproducers, especially American farmers. They have been struggling \nthrough a long and terrible crisis brought on by low prices and bad \nweather. Opening new foreign markets would especially help our family \nfarms.\n  The sanctions reform amendment ran into stiff opposition from House \nmembers in conference. Their main objection was that the bill would \nallow food and medicine sales to Cuba. Unfortunately, they prevailed, \nand the amendment was struck from the conference report.\n  That was last year. What about this year? We've had two important \ndevelopments.\n  On the Senate side, the Agriculture Committee included sanctions \nreform in the FY 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill, which was \nreported out in May. It is the section of the bill entitled the ``Food \nand Medicine for the World Act.'' I would like to acknowledge the work \nof my colleagues on this important legislation, especially Senators \nDodd, Dorgan, Roberts, Ashcroft and Hagel.\n  It is very similar to the amendment the Senate passed last year. I \nwould note that it contains a new provision which weakens the sanctions \nreform effort. This provision requires one-year licenses for sales of \nfood or medicine to governments on the State Department's terrorism \nlist. Currently this list covers seven countries, Iran, Iraq, Libya, \nSyria, Sudan, North Korea and Cuba. I believe that this provision is an \nunnecessary restriction on our agricultural exporters.\n  But I am much more concerned about recent developments on the House \nside.\n  In late June, House members struck a deal to accommodate the same \nsmall group which fights against sanctions reform every year. Those \nmembers now have one main target: Cuba.\n  This recent House deal is billed as a move to lift unilateral \nsanctions on food and medicine. In fact, it does just the opposite. Let \nme explain.\n  First, it would outlaw all finance and insurance of food sales to \nCuba, even sales to private groups. This would essentially prohibit all \nU.S. exports. In today's world, nobody trades without some sort of \nfinance. It takes at least a letter of credit. What is the alternative? \nOnly to ride along on the cargo ship to exchange your wheat for cash in \nHavana harbor. Everybody requires some sort of commercial insurance. In \nfact, the House agreement is so broadly written that it might even make \nthird-country finance illegal. This is very bad legislation.\n  Second, the House agreement would impose even stricter licensing \nrequirements than are in effect today on sales of food and medicine. \nThese new restrictions would apply not just to Cuba, but also to Iran, \nIraq, Libya, Sudan, Syria and North Korea.\n  Third, it would make it harder for U.S. exporters to travel to Cuba \nto explore the market.\n  Fourth, it would prohibit any food assistance, such as Food for \nPeace, to Cuba, as well as to Iran.\n  Accepting these provisions would be a major setback for the Senate.\n  The House agreement goes beyond sanctions for food and medicine. It \nincludes provisions on travel to Cuba, an entirely unrelated issue. It \nwould remove all flexibility from the current travel regulations in two \nways. First, it would make them statutory. They could only be changed \nin the future by new legislation. Second, it would deny the Treasury \nDepartment any discretion in issuing travel licenses.\n  I understand that the current House plan is to strip this bad \nlegislation from their version of the FY 2001 Agriculture \nAppropriations bill, and then bring it up in conference. We must not \nlet a small group of House members prevail again this year. I firmly \noppose the House agreement, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise. We \nshould work to ensure passage of the Food and Medicine for the World \nAct.\n  Last year, the Senate took action that was correct and sound. We \nshould continue to press forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6344-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6344-S6345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, each year the American Immigration \nLaw Foundation and the American Immigration Lawyers Association sponsor \na national writing contest on immigration. Thousands of fifth grade \nstudents across the country participate in the competition, answering \nthe question, ``Why I'm Glad America is a Nation of Immigrants.''\n  In fact, ``A Nation of Immigrants'' was the title of a book that \nPresident Kennedy wrote in 1958, when he was a Senator. In this book, \nand throughout his life, he celebrated America's great heritage and \nhistory of immigration as a principal source of the nation's progress \nand achievements.\n  As one of the judges of this year's contest, I was impressed by the \nquality of writing that was presented and the great pride of these \nstudents in America's immigrant heritage. Many of these essays told the \nstory of their own family's immigration to the United States.\n  The winner of this year's contest is Kaitlin Young, a fifth grader at \nSt. Anne Elementary School in Warren, Michigan. She wrote about her \ndiverse immigrant background and how this diversity enriches her life. \nOther students honored for their creative essays were Shayna Walton of \nArizona, John Klaasen of Washington, Allison Paige Sigmon of North \nCarolina, and Christa Conway of Connecticut.\n  I believe that these award winning essays from the ``Celebrate \nAmerica'' contest will be of interest to all of us in the Senate, and I \nask that they may be printed in the Record.\n  The essays are as follow.\n\n                            Immigration & Me\n\n           (By Kaitlin Young, Warren, MI,

Mr. President, it gives me pleasure to bring to \nmy colleagues' attention a truly remarkable program that, \nunfortunately, is not located in my home state of Vermont, but \nnonetheless, does great work for Vermonters. Let me talk for a moment \nabout the ``Wonders of Ward 8.'' To enlighten my colleagues, ``Ward 8'' \nhouses the inpatient Post Traumatic\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\nStress Disorder (PTSD) treatment program at the Northhampton VA \nhospital. According to Friends of Ward 8, a group of veterans whose \nlives have taken on new meaning as a result of their treatment at this \nfacility, there is no better place on earth to deal with the \npsychological wounds of war.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is recognized worldwide as a \ntrue leader in the area of PTSD research and I applaud my friend Dr. \nMatt Friedman and his staff at the National Center for PTSD for the \nincredible work they have done to bring this often debilitating \ncondition to the forefront of public recognition and scholarly \nresearch. Thanks also go to Dr. Friedman for making treatment of PTSD a \npriority for the VA. Ward 8 is a shining example of what an inpatient \nprogram specializing in trauma treatment should look like. Although \nWard 8 is located in Massachusetts, veterans from all over the country \nhave benefitted from this program--including many, many Vermonters. It \nwas established to offer inpatient rehabilitative treatment to veterans \nsuffering from PTSD as a result of their wartime service and is one of \neight inpatient VA programs. Ward 8 provides this high quality service \nwhile running one of the most efficient and cost effective inpatient \ntreatment program in the VA system.\n  According to the Friends of Ward 8, the staff at this facility are \nthe reason for its success. I would like to recognize and thank the \n``heroes'' of Ward 8 beginning with the Program Director Dr. Sonny \nMonteiro and his dedicated staff of men and women including Dr. Richard \nPearlstein, Bruce Bennett, Sherrill Ashton, John Christopher, Ken \nZerneri, Gary Kuck, Fran Lunny, Joe Polito, Brooks Ryder, Judy Zahn, \nHeather White, Wayne Lynch, Alec Provost, Mike Connor, Barbara Graf and \nDelores Elliott. I hear again and again from Vermonters about how they \nbring compassion and healing to the science of mental health. It is the \nhuman touch that they so generously dispense that makes such a \ndifference in the lives of veterans who struggle to recuperate from \ntheir wounds of war. Their dedication to their jobs and to the lives \nthey touch has built a legacy for this program unrivaled by any other \nPTSD program in the country.\n  I thank you, Ward 8, and the many veterans from around the country \nwho have crossed your threshold, thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6346-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to comment on some \nsignificant developments that have recently taken place in my home \nstate of Colorado that will positively benefit the entire world of \ntelecommunications.\n  Qwest Communications International, Inc. of Denver, a young, \nworldwide leader in broadband Internet-based communications, continues \nto expand its technologies and vision for the coming century. Just \nthree and one-half years ago, this innovative company catapulted the \nworld into the Information Age beginning by branding its nation-wide \nfiber-optic network and developing connections into Mexico, \nintercontinental cable to Europe and transpacific submarine capacity to \nthe Pacific Rim. The Company's services provide a full range of \nleading-edge data, voice, video, e-commerce, web-hosting and related \nservices to consumers and business customers, including a variety of \nmultimillion dollar government contracts recently awarded to Qwest, \nsuch as the Treasury Department and DOE's Energy Sciences Network.\n  Qwest has positioned itself for the new Information Age economy by \ncombining its strengths and forming numerous strategic alliances, \npartnerships and evolving its next-generation infrastructure through a \nvariety of acquisitions.\n  About one year ago Qwest and U.S. WEST announced their intent to \nmerge. On Friday, June 30 that merger became reality.\n  I applaud the FCC, the states and other appropriate agencies for \nreviewing and approving this complementary merger in a respectable \ntimeframe and in accordance with the 1996 Telecommunications Act. This \nnow allows the ``new'' Qwest to bring a different competitive dynamic \nto the global marketplace.\n  I ask my colleagues today to join me in commending the regulatory \nbodies for enhancing the process of this merger and to the Companies' \nmerger review team, led by Drake Tempest and Steve Davis, as well as \nother Company officials. In closing, I extend my best wishes for \ncontinued success to Qwest and its Chairman and CEO, Joe Nacchio. Mr. \nNacchio will resume the leadership of the ``new'' Qwest to bring the \nbenefits of this global Company to all of our constituents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6346-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNITION OF THE YOUTH INVESTMENT PROGRAM OF THE TUKWILA SCHOOL \n                                DISTRICT\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in February of 1999, I awarded my \nfirst Innovation in Education Award to the Tukwila School District for \ntheir ``Friends and Family Program.'' Now, over a year later, I am \nstanding on the Senate floor again to recognize an innovative program \nin this same district, the Youth Investment Program at Cascade View \nElementary. As both these awards indicate, great things are coming out \nof the Tukwila School District and this innovative summer school \nprogram is no exception.\n  Teachers and educators at Cascade View Elementary realized that many \nof their students were in need of additional help to be ready for their \nupcoming school year. Cascade Valley wanted to take advantage of the \nsummer months to target students who need extra help in reading, math, \nand writing skills. Thus, the Youth Investment Program was created. \nLast week, I visited with teachers and students from this program and \nwitnessed first-hand the tremendous impact that it has on its students.\n  In classes where approximately 22-percent of the students speak \nEnglish as a second language and skill levels range across the board, \nthese teachers have produced spectacular results in their students' \nacademic achievements and social development.\n  Michael Silver, Superintendent of the Tukwila District, says ``There \nis a high percentage of kids from different ethnic groups who are at \ndifferent skill levels. Our program has been able to streamline their \nlearning to catch them up for their new grade level.''\n  The Youth Investment Program is also preparing students to succeed in \nthe 21st century by incorporating computer training into many of the \ntraditional academic subjects. The computer skills of each child are \nmonitored throughout program. Teachers have also used computers to \nteach non-traditional courses such as drama and music which has enabled \nstudents and teachers to bring new meaning to the classroom. I am \npositive that these students will return to school in the fall not only \nequipped with renewed confidence but also with the skills and knowledge \ndemanded by the new technology age.\n  After spending a time with the students and teachers involved in the \nYouth Investment Program, it was not hard for me to see why the efforts \nof the Tukwila School District continue to stand out among local \neducation in Washington State. Mr. President, the Youth Investment \nProgram demonstrates once again that our local educators know how to \nmeet the needs of their students. I applaud the work of the staff and \nteachers at Cascade View and I am pleased to present my 44th Innovation \nin Education Award to the Youth Investment Program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6346-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. McCathran, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6346-4", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6346-S6347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 1:09 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S6347]]\n\nMs. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker pro \ntempore has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 148.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey \ncertain land to Lander County, Nevada, for continued use as a cemetery; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               the lander county cemetery conveyance act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lander County \nCemetery Conveyance Act.\n  The settlement of Kingston, Nevada was destination and home to \npioneers that settled the isolated high desert valleys of the central \nGreat Basin. The inhabitants of this community set aside a specific \ncommunity cemetery to provide the final resting place for friends and \nfamily who passed away. The early settlers established and managed the \ncemetery in the late 1800's. The Kingston cemetery is on land now \nmanaged by the United States Forest Service (FS). The FS is selling \napproximately one acre to the Town of Kingston, but this conveyance \ndoes not allow for the long-term use and expansion beyond the \nundisturbed historic graves, the implementation of the community's \noriginal 10 acre site plan, nor the protection of the uncharted graves.\n  Mr. President, the site of this historic cemetery was established \nprior to the designation of the Forest Reserve surrounding the Town of \nKingston. The surrounding Forest Reserve was established in 1908. Under \ncurrent law, the agency must sell the encumbered land at fair market \nvalue to this community for continued use. My bill provides for the \nconveyance of the balance of the original, recognized cemetery location \nto Lander County, at no cost, contingent on the completed sale of the \nacre to the Town of Kingston. It is unconscionable to me that this \nlandlocked, rural community is required to buy their ancestors back \nfrom the Federal government.\n  I sincerely hope that members of Congress recognize the benefit to \nthe local community that the conveyance would provide and pass this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2842\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the historical use by settlers and travelers since the \n     late 1800's of the cemetery known as ``Kingston Cemetery'' in \n     Kingston, Nevada, predates incorporation of the land on which \n     the cemetery is situated within the jurisdiction of the \n     Forest Service;\n       (2) it is appropriate that that use be continued through \n     local public ownership of the parcel rather than through the \n     permitting process of the Federal agency; and\n       (3) to ensure that all areas that may have unmarked \n     gravesites are included and to ensure the availability of \n     adequate gravesite space in future years, a parcel of \n     approximately 10 acres, the acreage included in the original \n     permit issued by the Forest Service for the cemetery, should \n     be conveyed for that purpose.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE TO LANDER COUNTY, NEVADA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief \n     of the Forest Service (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Secretary''), simultaneously with or as soon as practicable \n     after the conveyance of the core parcel under subsection (b), \n     shall convey, without consideration, subject to valid \n     existing rights, to Lander County, Nevada (referred to in \n     this section as the ``county''), all right, title, and \n     interest of the United States in and to the remaining parcel \n     of the land described in subsection (c).\n       (b) Conveyance of Core Parcel.--The making of the \n     conveyance under subsection (a) is contingent on the making \n     of a conveyance, under Public Law 85-569 (commonly known as \n     the ``Townsite Act'') (16 U.S.C. 478a), of 1.25 acres of the \n     land described in subsection (c) in which gravesites have \n     been identified.\n       (c) Description of Land.--The parcel of land referred to in \n     subsection (a) is the parcel of National Forest System land \n     (including any improvements on the land) known as ``Kingston \n     Cemetery,'' consisting of approximately 10 acres and more \n     particularly described as SW1/4SE1/4SE1/4 of section 36, T. \n     16N., R. 43E., Mount Diablo Meridian.\n       (d) Use of Land.--\n       (1) In general.--The county (including its successors) \n     shall continue the use of the parcel conveyed under \n     subsection (a) as a cemetery.\n       (2) Reversion.--If the Secretary, after notice to the \n     county and an opportunity for a hearing, makes a finding that \n     the county has discontinued the use of the parcel conveyed \n     under subsection (a) as a cemetery, title to the parcel shall \n     revert to the Secretary.\n       (e) Access.--At the time of the conveyance under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary shall grant the county an easement \n     granting access for persons desiring to visit the cemetery \n     and other cemetery purposes over Forest Development Road \n     #20307B, notwithstanding any future closing of the road for \n     other use.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6348-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6348-S6350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 662\n\n  At the request of Mr. L.

Sense of the Senate on Prevention of Needlestick \n     Injuries. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n     that American health care workers report 600,000 to 800,000 \n     needlestick and sharps injuries each year;\n       (2) the occurrence of needlestick injuries is believed to \n     be widely under-reported;\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\n       (3) needlestick and sharps injuries result in at least \n     1,000 new cases of health care workers with HIV, hepatitis C \n     or hepatitis B every year;\n       (4) more than 80 percent of needlestick injuries can be \n     prevented through the use of safer devices; and\n       (5) the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's \n     November 1999 Compliance Directive has helped clarify the \n     duty of employers to use safer needle devices to protect \n     their workers. However, millions of State and local \n     government employees are not covered by OSHA's bloodborne \n     pathogen standards and are not protected against the hazards \n     of needlesticks.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should pass legislation that would eliminate \n     or minimize the significant risk of needlestick injury to \n     health care workers.\n       Sec. 219. (a) In General.--There is appropriated \n     $10,000,000 that may be used by the Director of the National \n     Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to--\n       (1) establish and maintain a national database on existing \n     needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury \n     protections;\n       (2) develop a set of evaluation criteria for use by \n     employers, employees, and other persons when they are \n     evaluating and selecting needleless systems and sharps with \n     engineered sharps injury protections;\n       (3) develop a model training curriculum to train employers, \n     employees, and other persons on the process of evaluating \n     needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury \n     protections and to the extent feasible to provide technical \n     assistance to persons who request such assistance; and\n       (4) establish a national system to collect comprehensive \n     data on needlestick injuries to health care workers, \n     including data on mechanisms to analyze and evaluate \n     prevention interventions in relation to needlestick injury \n     occurrence.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Employer.--The term ``employer'' means each employer \n     having an employee with occupational exposure to human blood \n     or other material potentially containing bloodborne \n     pathogens.\n       (2) Engineered sharps injury protections.--The term \n     ``engineered sharps injury protections'' means--\n       (A) a physical attribute built into a needle device used \n     for withdrawing body fluids, accessing a vein or artery, or \n     administering medications or other fluids, that effectively \n     reduces the risk of an exposure incident by a mechanism such \n     as barrier creation, blunting, encapsulation, withdrawal, \n     retraction, destruction, or other effective mechanisms; or\n       (B) a physical attribute built into any other type of \n     needle device, or into a nonneedle sharp, which effectively \n     reduces the risk of an exposure incident.\n       (3) Needleless system.--The term ``needleless system'' \n     means a device that does not use needles for--\n       (A) the withdrawal of body fluids after initial venous or \n     arterial access is established;\n       (B) the administration of medication or fluids; and\n       (C) any other procedure involving the potential for an \n     exposure incident.\n       (4) Sharp.--The term ``sharp'' means any object used or \n     encountered in a health care setting that can be reasonably \n     anticipated to penetrate the skin or any other part of the \n     body, and to result in an exposure incident, including, but \n     not limited to, needle devices, scalpels, lancets, broken \n     glass, broken capillary tubes, exposed ends of dental wires \n     and dental knives, drills, and burs.\n       (5) Sharps injury.--The term ``sharps injury'' means any \n     injury caused by a sharp, including cuts, abrasions, or \n     needlesticks.\n       (c) Offset.--Amounts made available under this Act for the \n     travel, consulting, and printing services for the Department \n     of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and \n     the Department of Education shall be reduced on a pro rata \n     basis by $10,000,000.\n       Sec. 220.

None of the funds appropriated under this Act \n     shall be expended by the National Institutes of Health on a \n     contract for the care of the 288 chimpanzees acquired by the \n     National Institutes of Health from the Coulston Foundation, \n     unless the contractor is accredited by the Association for \n     the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care \n     International or has a Public Health Services assurance, and \n     has not been charged multiple times with egregious violations \n     of the Animal Welfare Act.\n       Sec. 225.

Sense of the Senate Regarding the Delivery of \n     Emergency Medical Services. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds \n     the following:\n       (1) Several States have developed and implemented a unique \n     2-tiered emergency medical services system that effectively \n     provides services to the residents of those States.\n       (2) These 2-tiered systems include volunteer and for-profit \n     emergency medical technicians who provide basic life support \n     and hospital-based paramedics who provide advanced life \n     support.\n       (3) These 2-tiered systems have provided universal access \n     for residents of those States to affordable emergency \n     services, while simultaneously ensuring that those persons in \n     need of the most advanced care receive such care from the \n     proper authorities.\n       (4) One State's 2-tiered system currently has an estimated \n     20,000 emergency medical technicians providing ambulance \n     transportation for basic life support and advanced life \n     support emergencies, over 80 percent of which are handled by \n     volunteers who are not reimbursed under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act.\n       (5) The hospital-based paramedics, also known as mobile \n     intensive care units, are reimbursed under the medicare \n     program when they respond to advanced life support \n     emergencies.\n       (6) These 2-tiered State health systems save the lives of \n     thousands of residents of those States each year, while \n     saving the medicare program, in some instances, as much as \n     $39,000,000 in reimbursement fees.\n       (7) When Congress requested that the Health Care Financing \n     Administration enact changes to the emergency medical \n     services fee schedule as a result of the Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1997, including a general overhaul of reimbursement rates \n     and administrative costs, it was in the spirit of \n     streamlining the agency, controlling skyrocketing health care \n     costs, and lengthening the solvency of the medicare program.\n       (8) The Health Care Financing Administration is considering \n     implementing new emergency medical services reimbursement \n     guidelines that may destabilize the 2-tier system that has \n     developed in these States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Health Care Financing Administration should--\n       (1) consider the unique nature of 2-tiered emergency \n     medical services delivery systems when implementing new \n     reimbursement guidelines for paramedics and hospitals under \n     the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act; and\n       (2) promote innovative emergency medical service systems \n     enacted by States that reduce reimbursement costs to the \n     medicare program while ensuring that all residents receive \n     quick and appropriate emergency care when needed.\n       Sec. 227. Sense of the Senate Regarding Impacts of the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997. (a) Findings.--The Senate makes \n     the following findings:\n       (1) Since its passage in 1997, the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 has drastically cut payments under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act in the areas of \n     hospital, home health, and skilled nursing care, among \n     others. While Congress intended to cut approximately \n     $100,000,000,000 from the medicare program over 5 years, \n     recent estimates put the actual cut at over $200,000,000,000.\n       (2) A recent study on home health care found that nearly 70 \n     percent of hospital discharge\n\n[[Page S6364]]\n\n     planners surveyed reported a greater difficulty obtaining \n     home health services for medicare beneficiaries as a result \n     of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       (3) According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \n     rural hospitals were disproportionately affected by the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997, dropping the inpatient margins \n     of such hospitals over 4 percentage points in 1998.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     Congress and the President should act expeditiously to \n     alleviate the adverse impacts of the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 on beneficiaries under the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act and health care providers \n     participating in such program.\n\n                   TITLE III--DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\n              Office of Elementary and

Mr. President, I am proud and pleased that today the \nSenate has voted to authorize a memorial in our Nation's Capital to \nhonor disabled American veterans.\n  I must say that it is humbling for me to be a co-sponsor of this bill \nalongside some of the very people we are honoring--my fellow Senators \nMax Cleland, Daniel Inouye and Bob Kerrey. I know there are thousands \nof others across our country--some of whom I know personally--and they \ndeserve much more than a monument. They all have had their lives \ndisrupted, sometimes painfully, as a result of their willingness to \nfight for America and all that it stands for.\n  But we cannot undo the damage to limb and spirit that has already \nbeen inflicted. So we now authorize a permanent monument that will call \nattention to the special esteem we hold for our disabled veterans--\nliving and dead. It is my sincere hope that we can create a singular \ncommemorative site that will encourage all Americans to come, pause, \nand reflect on the meaning of sacrifice, patriotism, and the place of \ndisabled citizens in our society.\n  Mr. President, wish the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation \nall the best in the hard work to come, and I look forward to the day \nwhen the people of America can admire the memorial and reflect on the \nsignificant sacrifices it represents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/10/senate-section/article/S6400-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JULY 11, 2000\n\n  Mr. WARNER.
