Mr. President, before addressing the President's budget, \nI wish to address an issue that is more personal and a lot closer to \nhome. Chicago lost a great friend yesterday, and I lost a great friend \nas well. Bob Collins, top-rated radio personality in the city of \nChicago, died in an airplane crash that was reported around the Nation.\n  Bob Collins was an extraordinary person. When you think of what \ncreates a community, it is a person such as Bob Collins. His voice \nevery morning in Chicago was a blend of wisdom and humor that really \nset people off on a good day. I can recall visiting his studios so many \ntimes and feeling right at home.\n  Bob was a typical Chicagoan, a typical Midwesterner, and I think that \nis the reason for his success. Our thoughts, of course, today are with \nhis family and his wife Christine, but we should reflect for a moment \non the great contribution which this man made in over 25 years at radio \nstation WGN.\n  Great cities are made up of great people and Chicago is no exception. \nBob Collins, at WGN Radio since 1974, was a combination of town crier, \ncourt jester, wise counselor, and fellow common man. A Shakespeare \nquote comes to mind: ``He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose.''\n  He started at age 13 at a radio station in Lakeland, FL. When he was \n14, he had his own show, and radio was still at that time everyone's \nlink to the world. Until the day he died, he remained Chicago \nresidents' link to each other and to a wider community.\n\n[[Page S510]]\n\n  What was it about Bob Collins that made hundreds of thousands of \nChicagoans tune in virtually every weekday morning? What was it about \nBob Collins that enabled him not only to follow his fabled predecessor \nWally Phillips, but to create his own following?\n  Well, like Bob, it is fairly simple. In an age of political extremes \nand shock radio, we found in Bob Collins an observant, thoughtful, \nplain spoken but fair and common man who never lost touch with the \ncommunity he loved. He connected with us and with the families across \nIllinois and Chicago who were his loyal fans. Shaving in the morning, \ndrinking coffee, fighting the daily commute, Bob was there at our side.\n  In addition to winning our ears and hearts, Bob's unparalleled \nability to mix humor, human interest stories, and intelligent, \nthoughtful news won him award after award. His commitment to Chicago \ndid not end when the microphone was turned off. He was always the \nchampion of the little guy. He received the Salvation Army award known \nas ``The Other Award'' because of his spirit and his dedication.\n  His hobbies included motorcycling and flying. He was a man who \nenjoyed life and every minute of it. WGN's Spike O'Dell signed on this \nmorning and announced: WGN Radio, Chicago. This is the Bob Collins \nShow.'' These words remind us that mornings in Chicago will always \nbelong to Bob Collins, and he will continue to ride and fly and laugh \nthrough all of our memories.\n  Thank you, Uncle Bobby. Chicago is going to miss you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/09/senate-section/article/S510-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S510-S511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the topic this morning for our morning \nbusiness is the President's budget, a budget released by the President \nseveral days ago that is a continuation of a strategy of the past 7 \nyears, a strategy which has paid off for America. There are those who \nhave rejected this budget. There are those who have said it is a \ndisaster. There are those who have used the timeworn cliche that the \nPresident's budget is dead on arrival. For those who want to use this \nmedical analogy, let me remind them of another medical admonition: \nFirst, do no harm. Those who would criticize the President's budget \nshould come up with their alternative. Let them see if they can match \nthe performance of the Clinton administration over the last 7 years. \nLet them come up with a formula that is sensible, that will move this \ncountry forward as quickly and as positively as President Clinton's \nplans have during the course of his administration.\n  His budget says we have a strategy based on fiscal discipline, a \nstrategy which will bring down the national debt and say to our \nchildren: We will not saddle you or burden you with debt that we \nincurred during our lifetime for our purpose.\n  That is the linchpin and pillar of the President's budget, and it is \nsound. It is sound for our future.\n  The President says that as we bring down this national debt, we will \npreserve Social Security so it is there not only for the current \nretirees, but the baby boomers and beyond. We will invest in Medicare, \nan issue which many Republicans do not even want to discuss. We will \nmake certain that the health insurance plan for the elderly and \ndisabled in America is adequately funded and the doctors, hospitals, \nand health care providers across America know that Medicare has a \nbright future.\n  The Nation is witnessing the first back-to-back budget surpluses in \n43 years, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years, the lowest overall \ncrime rate in 25 years, the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. The \nstatistics go on and on.\n  Whether it is a Presidential candidate or a Member of Congress who is \ncritical of President Clinton's budget and approach, my challenge to \nthem is: How would you do it better? What can we look to in history to \npoint to a better model than what we have seen over the past 7 years? \nWe reached a milestone in America's economic history. Our economic \nexpansion is the longest, a remarkable 107 months of consecutive \ngrowth. In fact, it was reported yesterday that we have had \nproductivity growth of 5 percent. America is on a roll, and those who \nwould derail it for their own political purposes had best step back and \nthink twice.\n  There are clearly differences which I will have with the President on \nspecifics in the budget. There are differences which will come out \nduring the course of the congressional debate, but whether they come \nfrom the Democratic side or Republican side, let us not lose sight of \nour goal.\n  Alan Greenspan, as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, last year \nspoke to several committees in Congress--and he continues to do that--\nand admonished us to keep in mind the basic things we need to do as a \nnation to continue to progress. Bringing down the national debt is his \nhighest priority.\n  President Clinton's budget invests money in those things that will \nkeep this economy moving forward--in the people of America. He has not \ngiven up on the families and people who have made this economic \nrecovery such a reality.\n  He is investing in education so the next generation of skilled \nworkers and leaders will be there. He is investing in health care to \ntake away one of the major concerns of every family in America: \naffordability of quality health care.\n  Yes, the President does have a tax cut plan, but it is a targeted, \nspecific tax cut plan--not the broad-based, overwhelming plan which we \nhear from Presidential candidate George W. Bush or some leaders in \nCongress, but one that is more sensible, more targeted, more consistent \nwith maintaining our economic growth.\n  The President says families worry about paying for college education; \nlet's help them; let's give them a deduction for college education \nexpenses. In doing that, we will start to enable more and more young \npeople to realize their dream of a college education and pass it along \nto their children. Is there anything more important for the future of \nour country?\n  The President says as well there should be a tax credit for long-term \ncare for the fastest growing segment of the American population--people \nover the age of 85, our parents and our grandparents, many of whom will \nneed help in their advancing years. Their sons and daughters care about \nthem, and we need to help them with the long-term care tax credit.\n  The earned-income tax credit is a term with which many people  are \nnot familiar, but it is a tax credit for working families who are not \nmaking much money. We want to encourage work and help families, and the \nPresident, focusing on the earned-income tax credit, leads us in the \nright direction.\n\n  Of course, there are those who say if we are going to have a surplus \nover the next 10 years, then the first thing we should do is give a \nmassive tax cut primarily to wealthy people. Yet we know quite honestly \nthat is irresponsible. The American people know that intuitively. \nFirst, the surplus is not in hand and, second, to take whatever surplus \nwe have and give it away as a permanent tax cut is to say to people \nacross America that we do not need to pay down our national debt, we do \nnot need to invest in America's children and families. We do not need \nto create tax cuts that are more targeted.\n  The President has it right. The President has said to the American \npeople: Let us not ruin a good thing; let us move forward.\n  There are many things with which we need to deal in this time of \nprosperity which we may never have another chance to consider. If we \ncannot at this moment in time reach out to the American society and \nhelp those who are struggling with day-to-day problems in their family \nand life, when will we ever do it?\n  If we cannot extend the protection of health insurance, as the \nPresident has proposed, to children and families across America at this \nmoment in time, when will we do it? Those who are 55 years of age who, \nfrankly, may face retirement and loss of health insurance need to have \nthe option of buying into the Medicare plan.\n  Those who are already retired and the disabled who rely on Medicare \nneed to have the protection of a prescription drug plan, a benefit \nwhich is common to almost every health insurance plan. The President \nhas said we can do that, consistent with reducing the national debt and \nprotecting Social Security as well as Medicare. There are certain\n\n[[Page S511]]\n\nthings at this moment in time which we can do.\n  If we do not invest at this moment in time in education for future \ngenerations, how shortsighted we are. My friends on the Republican side \nof the aisle do not view the educational issue as many of us do. Their \nidea of education is a voucher plan to help those who would send their \nchildren to private schools.\n  I certainly can sympathize with these families struggling to do that. \nMy wife and I sent our kids to Catholic schools and I attended Catholic \nschools. But our first obligation as a government is to the 90 to 95 \npercent of the students in public education, the kids in Minneapolis or \nChicago or Los Angeles or New York who want to have the very best \nschools and the very best teachers.\n  The President has proposed money for teacher training to improve \ntheir skills so they can continue to bring the next generation forward \nwell versed and well trained in the technology with which we are \ndealing.\n  There were statistics given to us yesterday about some of the things \nthat have happened during the Clinton administration which are often \noverlooked by the critics of the President's budget. Let me tell you \ntwo or three which I think are amazing.\n  Record budget deficits have been erased. Do my colleagues know the \nCongressional Budget Office suggested that this year we were going to \nhave a deficit of $455 billion? That was their projection when \nPresident Clinton came to office. President Clinton came to Congress \nand said: I have a plan that is going to turn this around. Instead of \ndeficits, we can move America forward.\n  Some of us believed the President was right. In fact, I voted for the \nPresident's 1993 plan. There were Members of Congress running around \nhollering, ``The sky is falling if the President's plan passes; it will \nbe nothing but a disaster.'' I invite those Members of Congress to look \nout the window at the bright blue sky  of our economic prosperity \nbecause of the President's leadership in 1993, because Members of \nCongress, all Democrats, and Vice President Gore, who cast the tie-\nbreaking vote, made a courageous decision. Some of my colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives lost their next election because of that vote. \nIf it is any comfort to them, they did the right thing for America, and \nhistory has proven them right because instead of the anticipated $455 \nbillion deficit this year, we are anticipating instead a surplus of \nover $100 billion. What an amazing turnaround.\n\n  We have had the largest paydown of debt in the history of the United \nStates. Those who argue the Democrats are not fiscally responsible \ncannot really say it at this moment because President Clinton's \nleadership and the following of Members of Congress have led to the \npaydown of more than $290 billion in debt over the last 2 years, and we \ncan continue to do that.\n  The President is right, this should be our highest priority. We \ncollect every single day in America $1 billion in taxes from \nindividuals and businesses and families to pay interest on our debt. If \nwe follow the President's lead and eliminate the publicly held debt, it \nwill dramatically reduce those interest payments, and that is good for \nthis country. That is money that can be spent on good programs for \neducation and health care and given back to families in the form of tax \ncuts.\n  We have seen Government reduced and diminished in size. We have seen \nas a percentage of the gross domestic product the percentage spent on \nGovernment coming down. This is what America asked for; this is what \nthey received.\n  Of course, with the President's budget, there will be a great amount \nof debate. The Congress will get its chance. The Republican leadership \nin the House and Senate can come up with its work product and put it \nnext to the President's, and we can make our choice.\n  I will tell you this. It should be measured by one standard: Does it \nmeet the test of common sense? Will the proposals coming out of this \nRepublican Congress keep America moving forward? Can they explain to \nfamilies across America that we should break with a policy that has \ndone so much for so many in this country? I think they are going to be \nhard pressed to do it. But it is the nature of our deliberative process \nthat they will have that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, at this time I am prepared to yield the floor and the \nremainder of our morning business time to my colleague from the State \nof Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, if it is all right with \nmy colleague from Illinois, I will speak on two matters. I thank him \nfor his eloquence. It turns out on some of the issues that my colleague \nraised, we are not 100 percent in agreement, but I think Senator Durbin \nis a Senator who speaks with sincerity and marshals his evidence for \nhis point of view. I think Democrats are very lucky to have him as a \nSenator speaking for our party and for the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/09/senate-section/article/S511-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S511-S512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                CHECHNYA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke about what is \nhappening in Chechnya. I believe I should speak out about this. I hope \nother Senators will, as well.\n  I have a letter that I ask unanimous consent be printed in the \nRecord. This is a letter to President Putin.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2000.\n     President Vladimir Putin,\n     Russian Federation, The Kremlin,\n     Moscow, Russia.\n       Dear President Vladimir Putin: We are writing to express \n     our deep concern over the conflict in Chechnya and your \n     response to the humanitarian tragedy there. We recognize the \n     importance of Russia's territorial integrity, and your \n     government's obligation to protect its citizens from \n     terrorist and other acts of aggression. This responsibility, \n     however, does not and cannot justify the use of \n     indiscriminate force against civilians and the displacement \n     of hundreds of thousands of persons.\n       Since October 1, the Russian military offensive in Chechnya \n     has involved a relentless bombing and artillery campaign that \n     has killed thousands of innocent civilians and displaced over \n     200,000 people. Reports from those fleeing Chechnya detail \n     incidents of widespread looting, summary executions, \n     detentions and rape.\n       As you know, Russia has assumed obligations under the \n     Geneva conventions and commitments under the OSCE Code of \n     Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security. Common \n     Article 3 of the Geneva Convention states that in ``armed \n     conflicts not of an international character, persons taking \n     no part in hostilities . . . shall be treated humanely.'' \n     Article 36 of the OSCE Code of Conduct states that ``if \n     recourse to force cannot be avoided in performing internal \n     security missions, each participating State will ensure that \n     its use must be commensurate with the needs of enforcement. \n     The armed forces will take due care to avoid injury to \n     civilians or their property.'' Russia's campaign in Chechnya \n     violates these commitments.\n       We urge your government to allow into Chechnya and \n     Ingushetia an international monitoring mission. This mission \n     should have unfettered access and a broad mandate to monitor \n     and report on the humanitarian situation. Your government \n     should immediately allow civilians safe passage from \n     Chechnya, assist those persons who have been displaced from \n     Chechnya as a result of this conflict and allow \n     representatives of international humanitarian agencies full \n     and unimpeded access to those persons in order to provide \n     humanitarian relief. Finally, we urge your government to \n     initiate investigations into alleged human rights abuses and \n     to hold accountable those responsible.\n       President Putin, we believe it is imperative that you \n     devote every effort to achieve a peaceful resolution of the \n     conflict in Chechnya. Neither the use of force in 1994-1996, \n     which left over 80,000 civilians dead, nor the current use of \n     force in Chechnya will enhance the prospects of a durable \n     settlement to the conflict.\n       We hope you share our concerns and look forward to \n     receiving your response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Paul D.

The Russian Government should immediately allow all \ncivilians safe passage from Chechnya, assist those persons who have \nbeen displaced from Chechnya as a result of this conflict, and allow \nrepresentatives of international humanitarian agencies full and \nunimpeded access to those persons in order to provide humanitarian \nrelief.\n  President Putin has made a commitment that an international \nmonitoring presence would be allowed. This has not happened.\n  Finally, I am urging the Russian Government to initiate \ninvestigations into alleged human rights abuses and to hold accountable \nthose responsible.\n  As a Senator, I send this letter to President Putin today. I think it \nis very important that he devote every effort to achieve a peaceful \nresolution.\n  Neither the use of force in 1994 to 1996, which left over 80,000 \ncivilians dead, nor the current use of force in Chechnya will enhance \nthe prospects for any durable settlement to this conflict.\n  I am sending this letter today. I am going to send a copy to the \nSenator from Colorado and other colleagues as well. I hope other \nSenators will speak out.\n  There is a delegation of several high-ranking officials, \nparliamentarians with the Chechnya Government, who are here, and they \nhave been trying to meet with our State Department. So far, they have \nnot been able to arrange any meeting at all.\n  I am not asking the State Department to recognize the official \ngovernment, but our State Department has met with dissidents from China \nand dissidents from Russia over the years. I think these \nparliamentarians, these courageous individuals from Chechnya, deserve \nat least an audience with the State Department--whether it be with the \nSecretary of State, whether it be with Strobe Talbott, or whether it be \nwith Secretary Koh who has done such a fabulous job on human rights \nissues.\n  I just want to say to the State Department today--I am going to \ncontinue with calls--I just think it is wrong to not at least meet with \nthese individuals. We have a massacre of innocent people going on \nthere.\n  As the son of a Jewish immigrant--born in the Ukraine, who lived in \nRussia, and fled persecution in Russia--I understand our Government's \nrole in the world to speak out for human rights. Our silence, the \nsilence of the administration and our Government, is deafening. I think \nDemocrats and Republicans need to call on President Putin to live up to \nhis commitment to allow an international monitoring force to protect \ninnocent civilians and to get humanitarian assistance to people. This \nis a moderate, modest request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/09/senate-section/article/S512-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CAPITOL HILL POLICE SECURITY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in the few minutes I have remaining \ntoday, I will talk in specifics about the security situation here at \nthe Capitol, and what is going on and what is not going on by way of \nliving up to our commitment to Capitol Hill police officers, and also \nto the public.\n  As I said, we have made the commitment, and we should honor the \ncommitment. You need two officers at a post for their security, much \nless the security of the public.\n  Two examples. Please remember, for those who are listening, the \nofficer who works alone at any number of these posts is responsible for \nthe following: Watching the x ray monitor for weapons or contraband, \npersonally screening persons with a handheld metal detector--I say to \nthe Senator from Colorado, we come in every day, and we see them doing \nthis--controlling pedestrian traffic at entrances, and watching both \nentry and exit doors for people who try to bypass security.\n  That is what one officer at one post is supposed to do.\n  Example: Ford House Office Building, Annex 2, Third Street door \nentrance, 441, Third Street, Southwest. By the way, the Third Street \nentrance is a multiple-door entrance.\n  Monday, February 7, 2000, one officer was assigned to this entrance \nfrom 0700 to 1500 hours. From 1200 to 1300 hours, 512 people entered \nthrough the Third Street entrance--one officer.\n  The Ford Building sits directly across from the Federal Center \nSouthwest metro station, for those who are trying to identify it.\n  From 0800 to 0900 hours, 215 people entered through the entrance--one \nofficer. This is Monday, February 7.\n  By the way, during the highest volume of pedestrian traffic, an \nofficer who was passing by just simply stopped and offered assistance. \nBut that is not the way it is supposed to be.\n  Hart Senate Office Building, 120 Constitution Avenue, Northeast; C \nStreet door entrance to the Hart Building. This is a multiple-door \nentrance that is open to staff--Government workers--from 0700 to 0900 \nhours. This entrance is actually directly next to Senator Nickles' \noffice.\n  Tuesday, February 3, one officer was assigned to this entrance from \n0700 to 1500 hours. As I say, that was Tuesday, February 3.\n  From 0900 to 1000 hours, 432 people entered through this entrance, \nnot to mention the 332 staffers--Government workers--from 0800 to 0900 \nhours--one officer. Just think about the number of people who are \nstreaming in with one officer. Again, I don't know exactly who is right \nin terms of how this problem gets solved. I think some of our police \nofficers believe there are overtime funds for this purpose. It may be \nthat upper management is arguing that those funds are not available. \nOthers say we have to have more funds to hire more people. One way or \nthe other, either there is money there for the overtime funds to \nproperly staff these posts or additional money is necessary in \nappropriation.\n\n  I just gave two concrete examples on the House and the Senate side \nthis month of February. I don't think any Senator or anyone in any \ndecisionmaking position who is responsible for the security situation \nhere--starting with these police officers, for them, much less for the \npublic, much less for us--can justify this. It cannot be defended.\n  I will say it one more time. I think it is OK for me to say it. If I \nsay it the wrong way, it is not OK for me to say it. We lost two fine \nofficers. Agent Gibson, Officer Chestnut, we lost them. I do believe we \nall said to one another that we were going to do everything humanly \npossible to get the very best security for our officers. No one can \never guarantee a 100-percent safe situation. What we do know is that we \ncan do everything that is humanly possible to try to meet that goal.\n  I just gave two examples this month that show we have fallen way \nshort of meeting that goal. We are not doing right by the Capitol Hill \npolice officers. We are not doing right by the public. We have to take \naction.\n  I will give other examples over the days and weeks to come. Of \ncourse, my hope is this problem will be dealt with.\n  I thank Senator Durbin for allowing me this time.

Mr. President, I didn't want to take any time during\n\n[[Page S513]]\n\nthe Democrats' timeframe because I am so appreciative of Senator \nDurbin's remarks. I have another perspective, which is just my own \nintellectually honest and, by the way, personally heartfelt analysis of \nthe budget.\n  I was struck when Senator Durbin was talking about: If not now, when? \nThe words of Rabbi Hill, his third century admonition, were heard by \nmany. Rabbi Hill, speaking to Jews, said: If we don't speak for \nourselves, who will? And if we speak only for ourselves, who are we? \nAnd if not now, when?\n  I think Senator Durbin was talking about this booming economy and the \nfact that with a booming economy and the business cycle up, we can make \nour very good country even better. I agree. Let me spell out my dissent \nfrom the President's budget. I did it yesterday, but today I want to do \nit in a somewhat different way.\n  I do worry about the cynicism of people in the country toward \npolitics and toward government. I think we all do, regardless of party. \nI think one of the ways we get ourselves into trouble is when there is \nsuch a disconnect or a gap between what we say and what we say we are \ngoing to do versus the actual budgets and what, in fact, we really are \ncalling for by way of investment.\n  As I hear the President talk about his budget and where we are \nheading as a country, I hear the President talk about the goal of \nending child poverty; of making sure we have health care coverage for \nour children; of making sure every child comes to kindergarten ready to \nlearn; making sure that when children are no longer children but young \npeople, like our pages, they will eventually be able to afford college, \nif they choose to make that higher education decision; that there will \nbe economic security for senior citizens.\n  Then I look at the budget and this emphasis on Social Security, \nMedicare, yes, and basically paying down more of the debt. Frankly, \nwhen all is said and done--if somebody can prove me wrong, I am pleased \nto be proven wrong--the actual nonmilitary discretionary spending over \nthe next 10 years is, in real dollar terms, cut. There is no additional \ninvestment at all.\n  Now, the way in which we try to do this in this budget is through the \ntax system, because politically it seems as if Democrats are scared to \ndeath to talk about investment in people any longer for fear they will \nbe accused of being a big spender. Therefore, we do it through the Tax \nCode, through deductions and tax credits.\n  Let me give credit where credit is due, and let me tell you where I \nthink there is this huge gap between what we say we are going to do and \nwhat we are really going to do. The earned-income tax credit is one of \nthe best things we have done for poor people in this country, many of \nwhom are children. Refundable tax credits makes a whole lot more sense. \nWhen we did the HOPE scholarship for higher education, we didn't make \nit refundable, so a lot of young people or not so young people who were \nattending community colleges, who had incomes under $28,000, $29,000 a \nyear, got no help anyway. They had no tax liability from which to get a \ncredit. Refundable tax credits help low- and moderate-income working \nAmericans more.\n  But with all due respect, we have made hardly any additional \ninvestment. Sometimes, if you are going to do it through the tax \nsystem, if you are going to talk about long-term care, I say to the \nSenator from Colorado--I know this is a huge issue in his State--\nfamilies are thinking long and hard. I have been through it. Sheila and \nI and our children, we went through it with my parents. They are no \nlonger alive.  They both had Parkinson's disease. I know what it is \nlike. You don't want your parent or parents to be in a nursing home. \nThe United States of America is still the only country in the world \nwhere you have to go to the poorhouse when you are in a nursing home \nbefore you are going to get public help. You have to basically lose \neverything. You want your parents, or a loved one with a disability, to \nbe able to live at home in as near normal circumstances as possible and \nwith dignity.\n\n  We say there will be economic security. We are now concerned about \nlong-term care and that people should be able to live at home. Do you \nknow what. In this budget proposal--maybe I am wrong--when you finally \nget down to it, you are probably talking about a couple thousand \ndollars a year that a family can get on a tax credit.\n  For my mother and father, and other mothers and fathers and \ngrandparents, if we want to make a commitment to people being able to \nlive at home with dignity, it is going to cost them more than $3,000 a \nyear to have some people come in and help them do that.\n  We are so much for the children, and we have all this irrefutable \nmedical evidence about the development of the brain. Last night, I was \nlucky enough to have dinner with Rob Reiner. He is so committed to \nthis, and I thank him for his work. We know we have to get it right--\nprekindergarten. The Federal Government should be a player. It should \nbe centralized, and we should get funds to the neighborhoods and \ncommunity level and have really good developmental child care.\n  We have a pittance in this budget. Yes, we add more money for Head \nStart. I guess we should since, right now, we have been covering, under \nthe age of 3, only 2 percent of the kids who are eligible. That is \nhardly much of a commitment to give children from poor income \nbackgrounds. We have additional money, but in terms of the need, we \nonly cover 20 percent of low-income families in America. This is a huge \nissue for middle-income and working families. We are talking about good \nchild care, not unsafe child care. It is a pittance. It is a pittance.\n  So my point is--and the Presiding Officer is Republican, so don't \ntake this the wrong way; we like each other--I think and I hope we like \neach other. I think what the President has proposed is better than what \nthe Republicans propose for sure. The Republican view, when it comes to \nthese issues, is that there is not much the Government can or should do \nbut give people a tax break, most of it going to the people on top. \nThat doesn't meet the needs of working families in this country anyway. \nIf you don't own a large corporation and you are not wealthy, there is \na role for Government by way of getting some resources down to the \ncommunity level that can make a real difference to families. But where \nI dissent from this budget is where the polls say emphasize this, so we \ntalk about it. The polls say it is a hot issue, so we talk about it.\n  But the truth of the matter is that when people hear us, they \nactually think what we are proposing is going to make a huge \ndifference, so that children won't be in poverty. We have more children \nin severe poverty today--one-half the poverty income --than we have \never had. We still have about 13 million poor children.\n  People think a budget is going to help us end child poverty and make \na commitment to prekindergarten and good child care, so that every \nchild who comes to kindergarten is ready to learn, or the budget will \nhelp the elderly with health care. There is a little bit, but most \nfamilies will find out there isn't going to be nearly enough--not if we \ntruly want to live up to the goodness of America.\n\n  Every child should have the same opportunity to do well. People who \nhave worked hard and built this country and are on their backs at the \nend of their lives ought to have decent coverage. They ought not to \nhave to worry about going to a nursing home and losing everything.\n  Higher education should be affordable. People should not fall between \nthe cracks in health care. I was at a dramatic hearing yesterday on \nsuicide. Dr. Jameson from Johns Hopkins and many other people \ntestified. People need coverage because of a struggle with mental \nillness. I argue that it is politically unsafe, and because there is \nsubstance abuse and addiction, they should not be discriminated against \nand denied coverage. We could save so many lives with the dollars if we \ndid better.\n  People who work hard but don't have any coverage at all ought to have \ncoverage for themselves and their loved ones. That is not in this \nbudget. We hardly make a dent. So I take the words of my colleagues, \nthe Democrats with whom I work, who say the economy is booming and we \ncan do better, and I say I agree: So why are we not doing much better?\n  I think we have been taught to think small. I think that, \nunfortunately, part of what has been going on over x number of years is \nthat we Democrats have decided we should think small. The\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\nconventional wisdom is that that is the way to win--think small; come \nup with programs that people think are popular, and then appropriate, \nget some money, and do it through the Tax Code so nobody can say you \nare spending money. But you are, either way. But you don't even come \nclose to meeting the needs of the people to whom I say you are going to \nrespond. I think it invites cynicism. No wonder people say Government \nprograms don't work. They hear all this fanfare in press conferences, \nand, frankly, the investment isn't there. The people aren't helped very \nmuch.\n  I say to the Democrats--and I get to do it because I am a Senator and \nI get to speak to the floor to whoever wants to listen--I think \neverybody says the reason you have a 50-percent hole in the electorate, \nwith 50 percent of the people voting in a Presidential election, much \nless a congressional election, much less a local election, is because \nof money, politics, and disillusionment. That is true. But the other \npart is that we aren't necessarily standing for politics that really \nspeaks to people's lives, where ordinary citizens can say: Yes, the \nparty, the Democratic Party, the party of the people, is behind us. We \nknow it. Here is what they say they stand for, and they are willing to \nmake the investments to make sure that, for parents and grandparents, \nour children and grandchildren can do better. I think that is the void \nin American politics.\n  I think it is a shame that this budget doesn't do a better job of \nfilling that void. Frankly, I don't think we Democrats are doing the \njob we should do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to focus on \nthe budget debate in which this Congress is engaged. It is very \nimportant at the beginning to set priorities and parameters as we put a \nbudget together that makes sense for our country rather than treating \nin isolation each individual spending or tax matter that comes before \nthis body. It is very important that we step back and look at the \nbigger picture.\n  When a family or a corporation puts together a budget, they have to \nmake all of their needs and desires fit into an overall budget plan. In \nthe same way we should start out by making sure that all of our \nindividual proposals fit into an overall budget plan.\n  I say this because some Members of the House are going to be moving \nspecific tax bills in advance, without looking at the overall budget. \nThe problem, obviously, is if we take very tempting separate items, \nsuch as a tax bill, say, a marriage penalty, or maybe it is an \neducation tax bill, perhaps a retirement savings tax bill--it is very \ntempting to pass these in isolation and we are picking and choosing \nbetween different tax cuts before we even have agreed on how much money \nwe have available.\n  Let's not put the cart before the horse. It's the same kind of \nhelter-skelter approach that got us deeply into debt in the first \nplace. Let's set our budget priorities first.\n  As we do so, we should keep two points in mind. First, we should be, \nif I may use the word, conservative. Let's keep the cork in the \nchampagne and not put too much stock in ten-year projections that show \na huge surplus.\n  I don't care how good your crystal ball is. Things change, and small \nchanges add up to a lot over 10 years.\n  I would like to make a point about an article in yesterday's \nWashington Post that underlines this problem. It is a story by Eric \nPianin and John Berry. Their basic point is the fragility of the long-\nterm budget projections--whether they are the President's projections, \nthe CBO's, or others.\n  Let me quote, ``Clinton's projections highlight just how tenuous \nthose surpluses could be.''\n  There is another example of this. This chart shows how difficult it \nis to predict the future and how quickly and how dramatically budget \nprojections change. On the left, the red bar illustrates that 2 years \nago, January 1998, the Congressional Budget Office projected the \ncountry would face about a $900 billion deficit over the next 10 years.\n  Just a couple of weeks ago, the CBO reached a different conclusion. \nTheir conclusion was that we are going to have the benefit of a roughly \n$2 trillion budget surplus over the next 10 years. That is a swing of \npractically $3 trillion in just two years! Clearly, 2 years from now \nthis $2 trillion projected surplus is going to look a lot different, as \nit will 3 years from now and 4 years from now. Therefore, let us not \nlisten to the siren song of these huge projected surpluses based upon \ncurrent economic estimates. I know the budget estimators do the best \nthey can. But I sure wouldn't want to bet the farm that these new \nnumbers will hold up for a decade.\n  The current economy is doing well. We want it to continue doing well, \nbut there is no guarantee it will. Let's be careful. Let's be cautious. \nThese projections of huge surpluses could fade. It could change very \nquickly.\n  The point came home to me in a conversation I had with the CEO of a \nmajor telecommunications company.\n  I said: Sir, does your company make 5-year plans?\n  He said: Well, yes, we do.\n  I said: How closely do you follow them? How well do you implement \nthem?\n  He said: Well, we really don't. We try, but things change so quickly, \nwe have to change and adjust.\n  Granted, telecommunications is a fast-changing industry. But we are a \nfast-changing country in many respects. Changes happen very quickly. \nChanges happen, particularly as our world gets more and more \ninterconnected and more technologically advanced. With more and more \ntechnology and more factors involved in determining the course of our \neconomy, it is more and more difficult to predict the future. It is a \nproblem we face.\n  With all the inherent uncertainty about the future, let's be a little \ncautious when it comes to the Federal budget. And let's also adhere to \nthe Hippocratic Oath, that is, ``first, let's do no harm.''\n  I believe the prudent course is to adopt what I'd call a ``no \nregrets'' budget.\n  Policies that we believe make sense and address important needs \nirrespective of upticks or downticks in the economy.\n  To my mind, this means we should, first and foremost, reduce the \ndebt.\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\n  That's plain conservative, common sense. During good times, you pay \nyour debts, and you save a little. It also helps to protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Just paying down the debt will have a tremendous \neconomic benefit to our country.\n  How? First, paying down the debt will free up more private capital so \nindividual Americans can make more decisions along the lines they want, \nas they have in the last several years, which has helped boost this \ngreat economic growth. Paying down the debt means more private capital \nwill be available. But perhaps more importantly, if the Federal \ngovernment borrows less from the market, the private sector can borrow \nmore. Government reduces its debt service costs and pressure on \ninterest rates is reduced. And lower interest rates are a direct, \ntangible benefit to every businessman, farmer, home owner, and car \npurchaser.\n  Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said much the same thing yesterday \nmorning. He told the Finance Committee that a major benefit of reducing \nthe debt is to free money so that it is available to be productively \ninvested by the private sector.\n  So, Mr. President, reducing the Federal debt is important to the \ncontinued growth of the private sector.\n  The second step is to set the right budget priorities. After debt \nreduction, we should invest where it will make the most sense for our \neconomy. That means investment in people, investment in education, \ninvestment in infrastructure.\n  We can also do some good by creating incentives for private \nretirement savings. Retirees need more than just Social Security and we \nshould address it this year.\n  And we should deal with other tax issues, too. These include reducing \nthe marriage penalty, providing incentives for long-term health care, \nand helping communities conserve open space.\n  Those are all areas where I believe we can find strong bipartisan \nagreement.\n  I hope we could also find agreement not to go overboard with tax \ncuts. I know election years get the juices flowing. But I would just \ncaution folks to remember our experience in the early 1980's with the \nexuberance for large tax cuts.\n  Two years after we enacted that tax cut--and I voted for it--Senator \nDole had to come back and lead the damage control party. We had to \nincrease taxes that year to repair the deficit problem. But it wasn't \nenough and we needed to do it again two years after that.\n  I don't know about my colleagues, but I've learned from that mistake. \nI don't want to lock in a big tax cut now only to find ourselves in two \nyears digging out of a hole if the economy heads south. It's happened \nbefore!\n  Mr. President, I know that many observers have written off this year. \nThey say it's an election year. That we won't get anything done. But we \nshouldn't write off this year quite yet. We have 120 legislative days \nleft. It's not a lot of time.\n  But if we set solid budget priorities and we work together, then we \ncan pass a budget that is responsible and invests in America, then this \nCongress can write a record of bipartisan accomplishment that will \nbenefit all Americans.\n  I ask my colleagues to join together. If we do what is right--and we \nknow what is right--we are going to be serving our country well. That \nis my plea.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are still in the process of trying \nto resolve the nuclear waste bill. As the Chair is aware, last night we \nlaid down the substitute amendment; that has been circulated in the \nbody. We have some amendments pending, and I will identify those at a \nlater time. It is a very short list. Some may be deemed by the Chair to \nbe nongermane. I think we can begin the process now of addressing this \nlegislation in a positive vein inasmuch as it would provide a workable \nmethodology for the Federal program to ensure that our nuclear waste is \nmanaged safely and efficiently.\n  My point in highlighting this is to identify the value of this \nlegislation, as it stands, with the substitute filed last night. I went \nthrough an extended statement yesterday indicating that nuclear energy \nproduces 20 percent of our electricity today. We simply cannot \njeopardize our economic future by ignoring the contribution the nuclear \nindustry makes to our Nation and the realization that the industry is \nchoking on its waste. And the idea remains of losing 103 nuclear \npowerplants over a period of time because of the Federal Government's \nfailure to honor the sanctity of the contractual commitment to take \nthat waste in 1998, even though the ratepayers contributed some $15 \nbillion to the Federal Government to ensure the Federal Government \nwould have the funds to take and dispose of the waste. Well, we are all \naware of the realities associated with the inability of the Government \nto do that, to fulfill that contract and honor the sanctity of that \ncontractual commitment.\n  What isn't generally known or understood is the extent of liability \nassociated with the failure of the Government to perform its \ncontractual obligation. I have indicated that it is full employment for \nsome lawyers. The liability is somewhere between $40 billion and $80 \nbillion for failure of performance.\n  I think we agree that we have an obligation to come together to solve \nthis problem on behalf of the American taxpayers, where each family is \nsubjected to an allocation cost of about $1,400 per family in this \ncountry each year as we delay the process. We have made substantial \nprogress in addressing these issues and working with my friends from \nUtah--and I am sensitive to their particular position--as well as the \nminority and the ranking member from New Mexico, for whom I have the \ngreatest respect. As a consequence, I believe this bill provides \nsignificant benefits to the consumers, who have paid $15 billion-plus \nfor this Federal disposal program, and the program direction we have in \nthis legislation for the Energy Department which must carry out this \nimportant environmental obligation.\n  Now, the Senate should pass this legislation. The administration \nshould support this approach to solving this critical national issue.\n  Senate bill 1287 provides important changes to existing law as \nembodied in my new substitute that allows the Department of Energy to \nmeet its 1998 obligation to manage used nuclear fuel from nuclear \npowerplants which have already begun to run out of space in especially \ndesigned storage pools.\n  Further, it allows for the settlement of litigation, begins a process \nof settlement for litigation between these utilities and the Energy \nDepartment in a fair way, and eliminates costly litigation against the \nFederal government, hence the taxpayer.\n  This bill would protect the use of billions of dollars in the nuclear \nwaste fund so it is used only for the repository program and not \ndiverted to cover\n\n[[Page S516]]\n\nthe cost of long-term storage at these plants in some 40 States.\n  The fund itself could be used, however, to purchase containers to \nhouse the fuel. Those containers were used also to ship the fuel to a \nrepository. I am not suggesting that is the case, but that is possible.\n  S. 1287 retains the EPA--I want to emphasize this--as the sole \nauthority to establish radiation protection standards at Yucca Mountain \nand establishes a method for EPA to discuss the standards with the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission and the National Academy of Sciences. But \nit preserves, in spite of what the Washington Post reported and the \nadministration, the EPA as the sole authority to establish standards.\n  Finally, this bill protects consumers from unreasonable increases in \nFederal nuclear waste fund fees. It allows only Congress to increase \nthose fees--not the Secretary of Energy.\n  Every Member of this Senate is going to have an opportunity to \nexpress his or her opinion if the fees are raised. It is not going to \nbe an arbitrary decision from the Department of Energy.\n  These provisions represent a couple of areas in which we can by \nworking together to craft a bill that provides the necessary leadership \nto finally move this program towards achieving the intent of the \noriginal Nuclear Waste Policy Act. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeaningful reform and begin the responsibility of managing nuclear \nwaste from the 40 States at one location--not 40 locations.\n  I am pleased to say I have just learned Senator Kerrey of Nebraska \nhas come on as an original cosponsor of the legislation.\n  Briefly, the benefits of S. 1287 are:\n  Early receipt of used fuel at site in the year 2007 no later than 18 \nmonths after authorization of construction by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission is in the amendment.\n  There is protection. The nuclear waste fund section 105(e) ``source \nof funds'' states:\n\n       The Secretary may not make expenditures in the Nuclear \n     Waste Fund for any costs that may be incurred by the \n     Secretary pursuant to a settlement agreement or backup \n     storage contract under this Act except:\n       1. The cost of acquiring and loading spent nuclear fuel \n     casks;\n       2. The cost of transporting spent nuclear fuel from the \n     contract holder's site to the repository; and ``. . .other \n     costs required to perform settlement agreement or backup \n     storage.''\n\n  Further, it prevents unreasonable increases in fees. Section 104 of \nthe nuclear waste fee states:\n\n       The adjusted fee proposed by the Secretary shall be \n     effective upon enactment of a joint resolution or other \n     provision of law specifically approving the adjusted fee.\n\n  It provides for the development of a protective radiation standard, \ngiving absolute authority for setting of a standard to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  I want to repeat that.\n  It provides for the development of a protective radiation standard by \ngiving the absolute authority for setting a standard to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, while acknowledging for the ability of \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission to provide consultation and comments \nto Congress, as well as the hopeful contribution by the National \nAcademy of Sciences so we can get the very best science on this. But \nthe decision is still the EPA.\n  Specifically, the amendment drops the interim storage, requires \nCongress to approve any increases in fees to protect the consumer, sets \nthe schedule for development of a repository, authorizes backup storage \nat a repository for any spent fuel that utilities ``cannot store \nonsite,'' and allows the Environmental Protection Agency to set a \nradiation standard after June 1, 2001; prior to those consultations, \nonly with the NAS and the NRC to ensure we have the best science and \nthat the standard is set. But it is EPA's responsibility under statute \nto set the standard. We want it based on the best science available.\n  Further, it authorizes a settlement agreement for outstanding \nlitigation and requires an election to settle within 180 days as \nrequested by the administration.\n  The idea is to start the settlement process within 6 months. It sets \nacceptance schedules for spent fuel and transfers 76,000 acres of land \nto Nevada counties to assist them with the impact of the repository in \nthe counties.\n\n  It uses the WIPP model for transportation, which is currently used in \nNew Mexico, consistent with existing law under HAZMAT. I want to \nemphasize this. The State will be selecting the routes so we can move \nthis waste from the 40 States where it is located to one site at Yucca \nMountain.\n  We included training provisions to ensure safety in the movement of \nthat waste.\n  There was a question of transportation. The minority believed very \nstrongly that we should not be subsidizing international research for \nthe development of transmutation. We struck that from our original \nversion.\n  We include the decommissioning of a pilot program for the sodium-\ncooler fast breeder reactor in Arkansas.\n  We included a study on the Prairie Island rate impact as well. But \nthere are a couple of points I want to emphasize, specifically for \nMembers of this body--and their staffs--from Delaware, West Virginia, \nKentucky, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, \nHawaii, and my State of Alaska.\n  The significance of that list is that there are no commercial waste \nsites in those States. But we have a chart that shows where they are. \nThey are in 40 other States. But they are not in Delaware, West \nVirginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, North \nDakota, Hawaii, or Alaska.\n  If you are paying attention to this debate, you should be interested \nin the disposition of waste that may be in one of your States--one of \nthe 40 States.\n  This chart clearly identifies the various States where we have \ncommercial reactors. We have shut down reactors. We have spent nuclear \nfuel storage. We have research reactors, naval reactor fuel, so forth \nand so on.\n  Several years ago, when we started on this legislative train to try \nto resolve this problem, there was a suggestion made and legislation \nwas developed that said, well, since Yucca Mountain isn't ready, it is \nnot licensed, and we have some of these storage plants that are in a \ncritical stage, the volume of waste has either exceeded or is about to \nexceed the licensed storage in those plants, those States can shut \nthose plants down.\n  What are you going to do to make up for the loss of that electric \ngeneration? That was left to a later date. The idea, then, was to move \nsome of the waste from some of the critical reactors where storage had \nbeen built to a temporary repository at Yucca Mountain-- put it in \ncasks until Yucca Mountain was certified, licensed, and finalized. \nThere are a lot of steps to go through.\n\n  There was great concern over that. Nevada felt there was a finality \nassociated with it. In other words, it implies that once it is placed \nthere it will never move again. They opposed that. The administration \nopposed it because they said we had not finalized and licensed Yucca \nMountain. There is always a chance we won't be able to do that. Of \ncourse, that evades reality because we will still have to put it \nsomewhere.\n  Let me share a letter which I think personifies where we are in this \ndebate. It is from the Governors of the various States in the Northeast \ncorridor, for the most part: Governor Dean, Democrat of Vermont; \nGovernor King, Independent of Maine; Governor Shaheen, Democrat from \nNew Hampshire; Jesse Ventura, Reform Party of Minnesota; Governor Tom \nVilsack, Democrat of Iowa; Governor Jeb Bush of Florida; Governor John \nKitzhaber. They sent a letter to the President which I highlighted the \nother day. We have come full circle on the issue.\n  The letter reads as follows:\n\n       We governors from states hosting commercial nuclear power \n     plants and from affected states express our opposition to the \n     plan proposed by Energy Secretary Richardson in his February \n     1999 testimony before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee. Secretary Richardson proposes that the Department \n     of Energy take title, assume management responsibility and \n     pay costs at nuclear plant sites for used nuclear fuel it was \n     legally and contractually obligated to begin removing in \n     January 1998. This proposed plan would create semi-permanent, \n     federally controlled, used nuclear fuel facilities in each of \n     our states.\n\n  Think about that. We are not going to allow a temporary repository at \nYucca Mountain until we get a final decision. That legislation was \ndefeated. The Secretary and perhaps others suggested they take title to \nthe fuel. By taking title to the fuel, that does just that: It takes \ntitle in each of 40 States.\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\nIt provides no guarantee as to when or if it will be moved. As a \nconsequence, 40 States have no assurance it will leave their State.\n  Every Member of this body representing the 40 States that have \nnuclear power should be very concerned about the implications of this.\n  In deference to the Secretary of Energy, my good friend, Secretary \nRichardson, assured me he would be able to adequately address the \nconcerns of the Governors. I think he made a good-faith effort. \nObviously, it was not enough. Perhaps the reason it was not enough--and \nthis is certainly not the fault of the Secretary--was the inability of \nthe Government to commit to its word to take the waste in 1998. It was \nnot under his watch. The Government simply could not resolve it, so it \nwas not done.\n  I want to stress the significance of what this means to these States \nthat have expressed their concern. They are fearful that taking title \nin their State would create semipermanent, federally controlled, used \nnuclear fuel facilities in each of the States. They continue with more \nfood for thought that I think is appropriate. They say:\n\n       The plan proposes to use our electric consumer monies which \n     were paid to the federal government for creating a final \n     disposal repository for used nuclear fuel. Such fuels cannot \n     legally be used for any other purpose than a federal \n     repository.\n\n  They don't have that in mind.\n       This plan abridges states rights--it constitutes federal \n     takings and establishes new nuclear waste facilities outside \n     of state authority and control.\n       These new federal nuclear waste facilities would be on \n     river fronts, lakes and seashores which would never be chosen \n     for permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel in a site \n     selection process.\n       The plan constitutes a major federal action which has not \n     gone through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) \n     review process.\n\n  It is interesting that the Government agencies conveniently go around \nsome of the regulations that others cannot get around.\n\n       The new waste facilities would likely become de facto \n     permanent disposal sites.\n\n  Listen to that, ``permanent disposal sites.'' That could happen in \nany of your States.\n\n       Federal action over the last 50 years has not been able to \n     solve the political problems associated with developing \n     disposal for used nuclear fuel. Establishing these Federal \n     sites will remove the political motivation to complete a \n     final disposal site.\n\n  It will remove the political motivation. Those are pretty strong \nwords.\n  The last page reads:\n\n       We urge you to retract Secretary Richardson's proposed plan \n     and instead support establishing centralized interim storage \n     at an appropriate site. This concept has strong, bi-partisan \n     support and results in the environmentally preferable, least-\n     cost solution to the used nuclear fuel dilemma.\n\n  There it is: The inability of the Governors and the administration to \nprovide the Governors with the degree of comfort they need to ensure it \nwill not become permanent, and that we, in this legislation in its \nfinal form, have changed the take title provision and eliminated it, in \nview of the reality associated with the inability to provide the States \nwith the assurance that the waste would be removed from those States.\n  I had hoped the administration and the Secretary of Energy would be \nsuccessful in allaying fears. Probably the reason they have not been \nable to do so is because there is no assurance that they could move any \nfurther than we did in 1998 when we could not make the contractually \nrelated commitment to take the waste at that time.\n  I will make a couple of other points that I think represent good \nfaith in the manner in which we tried to resolve concerns of the \nminority. This included a 180-day window when contract holders must \ndecide whether to enter into settlement negotiation with the Secretary. \nThat is back in the bill at the request of the minority. We think it is \nappropriate that a process be started.\n  I think it is fair to characterize that Senator Bingaman and \nSecretary Richardson felt this must be an appropriate inclusion of this \nprovision to allow the Department of Energy planning process to go \nahead.\n  I want to touch briefly on transportation. I know there has been a \ngood deal of concern; people say they don't want the stuff to go \nthrough their State, and that is understandable. What we have done in \naccordance with the minority is to use the WIPP transportation model, \nwhich is a model I think I can say Senator Bingaman and Secretary \nRichardson support. Basically, it comes down to the State designating \nthe routes to move the waste.\n  We have also included in existing law a training provision to make \nthe transportation as safe as possible.\n  There was a question of transmutation. I think I have addressed that.\n  But one other point I would like to make to my colleagues from Nevada \nis how we have attempted to accommodate a concern they had about what \nwas in the bill. First of all, if I could have the attention of my two \ncolleagues from Nevada, because I think this is important, in the \noriginal bill we had payments to local communities. I was sensitive to \nthe impact of the ultimate disposition of perhaps finalizing a \npermanent repository in the State of Nevada. As a consequence, there \nare annual payments of $2.5 million. I think they would go for about 5 \nyears. It would be about $12.5 million to the local counties. Then \nthere was another $5 million to come in on the first fuel receipt that \nwould come in, and then annual payments after the first receipt until \nclosure. We do not know when the closure is, but it would be about $5 \nmillion a year. I think, if we figured the repository would go until \nabout the year 2042, that is about $140 million to your counties.\n  At the insistence of the minority, that funding was eliminated. \nHowever, I felt very strongly about the land conveyances that were \nrequested of 76,000 acres--that is twice the size of the District of \nColumbia, if I can put it in perspective. So we have in this bill \n76,000 acres to Nevada: 46,000 acres to Nye County, 30,000 to Lincoln \nCounty. This is going to go for a variety of uses: For the city of \nCaliente, a municipal landfill as well as for community growth and \ncommunity recreation; Lincoln County, for community growth. For Panaca, \nRachel, Alamo, Beatty, Ione, Manhattan, Round Mountain/Smokey Valley, \nTonopah, another 28,230 acres; for the towns of Amargosa and Pahrump, \nanother 17,450 acres. These are areas that have been identified for \nfavorable disposal by BLM.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, one thing we have to do is get \nyou to Nevada to hear how to pronounce some of those names.\n  In the early 1940s and 1950s, we had great football teams at the \nUniversity of Nevada. They would bring in these football players from \naround the country, as was done in those days. Marion Motley was a \ngreat all-pro Hall of Fame football player. He came and signed up for \nschool. He was going through registration. They asked him where he was \nfrom. He said Ely, NV; it is pronounced ``Elee,'' NV. That is how you \npronounced the names. Beatty and Amargosa and Pahrump--we are going to \nhave to give some lessons to you on how to pronounce the names. Just as \nif I went to Alaska, it would be hard for me to pronounce those names.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I know a lot of people who come to Alaska and visit \n``Valdeez'' think it is pronounced ``Valdez.''\n  But I did want to highlight the fact we have tried to respond to the \nrequest for the land conveyances. They are 76,000 acres transferred \nover to the two counties that would benefit the communities. That is in \nthis bill. I offer it simply as an effort in good faith to be sensitive \nto concerns I think are very legitimate. That is to transfer the land \nfrom Federal agencies that do not have a need for that land to the \ncommunities so they can put them on the tax rolls and have it \nfunctionally contribute to the economy of the area and benefit the \npeople. I think that is appropriate as well.\n  I see a few Members here awaiting recognition. It is appropriate I \nyield the floor. At a later time, it will be my intention to address \nsome of the amendments that are pending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I see my friend from North Dakota and my friend from \nMinnesota are here. I am wondering how long the Senator from Minnesota \nwishes to speak.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Probably less than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota wants to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 15 minutes.\n\n[[Page S518]]\n\n  I have just a few things to say. If it will be OK with the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, as soon as I finish, I ask the Senator from \nMinnesota be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Somewhere around there; maybe 12. I am just guessing.\n  Mr. REID. And then I ask the Senator from North Dakota be recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be brief. I did want to respond to \nsome of the things that were mentioned by the Senator from Alaska, the \nmanager of this bill.\n  When I practiced law, I represented a number of automobile dealers. I \nremember one of the big problems we had is that once in awhile someone \nwould buy a lemon. That is what they were called. Something just went \nwrong in the manufacture of that car, and whatever was done, it turned \nout bad; you just could not fix it.\n  I remember one dealer I represented. There was a man who was \npicketing his place of business. He had his car painted yellow, and he \nhad it so it looked like a float that looked like a lemon. The dealer \ntold me: You have to settle this case. You have to get rid of this \ncase.\n  That is kind of how I feel about this legislation. This legislation \nis a big lemon. Whatever they do with it, it is still bad. It is just \nlike those cars that are lemons.\n  Senator Murkowski, the manager of this bill, I have no doubt, is \ndoing his very best, and that is usually good enough. In this instance, \nhe is dealing with a lemon and it is not good enough. Take, for \nexample, the fact that everyone knows the 1987 act deleted the State of \nWashington and the State of Texas and began the characterization of \nNevada, Yucca Mountain. That is going forward as we speak, the \ncharacterization of Yucca Mountain. S. 1287 was supposed to streamline \nthe process. It would not do that.\n  For example, there is a provision in S. 1287 that the utilities badly \nwanted. What did that legislation call for? It said the utilities would \nno longer hold title to the nuclear waste but title would instead be \ntransferred to the Department of Energy. That was the big purpose of S. \n1287. That was the bill, S. 1287. The big part of it was what they call \n``take title.''\n  We were here yesterday at 5:55; 5 minutes before the deadline, \namendments were filed, and take title is gone. S. 1287, the take title \nprovision is out of this bill. It is like the proverbial lemon from \nwhich we try to protect automobile dealers. For the first time in the \nhistory of this legislation, we now have the utilities fighting the \nStates.\n  The EPA provision that the managers of the bill worked so hard to try \nto get resolved has made it worse. The problem we have here with the \nEPA provision is that the manager, recognizing he would rather deal \nwith a Republican President, has inserted a provision in this amendment \nthat puts off the decision by the Environmental Protection Agency until \nthe next administration. He is hoping, of course, that either President \nMcCain or President Bush will be elected.\n  The fact is, that is a crapshoot, I guess, but it should not be part \nof this legislation. All it does is further ``lemonize'' this \nlegislation.'' The EPA is concerned about this. The President is \nconcerned about it because it is attempting to make him a lame duck \nPresident, attempting to dissipate and do away with the rulemaking \npower of his agencies. Secretary Richardson is totally opposed to this \nlegislation. As I said, Carol Browner is opposed to it. The League of \nConservation Voters is opposed to it; most every other environmental \norganization is opposed to this bill. So we understand why the League \nof Conservation Voters--I am using them as just a representative \nbecause they speak for everyone, really--are concerned.\n  This legislation is placed ahead of the Patients' Bill of Rights, \npublic schools, Social Security, prescription drug benefits, and all \nthe other things we need to be talking about, including minimum wage \nand the juvenile justice bill.\n  The environmental community considers defeating this bill a major \npriority during this election year. In fact, I have a letter from Deb \nCallahan, who is head of the League of Conservation Voters, who has \nmade it clear they may score S. 1287 as it poses ``unacceptable risks \nto public health and the environment.''\n  The League of Conservation Voters is not some radical environmental \ngroup driving stakes in trees; it is a middle-of-the-road environmental \ngroup that speaks for the American public. They are decidedly and \nappropriately bipartisan.\n  It is interesting. I prepared these remarks long before the junior \nSenator from the State of Rhode Island started presiding, but just last \nyear, the League of Conservation Voters honored Senator John Chafee, a \nRepublican, for his lifetime and stalwart support for environmental \nprotection. Voting against this bill is about protecting the \nenvironment, not just in Nevada, but as the letter indicates, in the 43 \nStates where S. 1287 will accelerate nuclear waste trafficking.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                                 February 7, 2000.\n     Re Oppose S. 1287--The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of \n         2000.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is \n     the bipartisan, political voice of the national environmental \n     community. Each year, LCV publishes the National \n     Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of \n     Members of Congress on environmental legislation. The \n     Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters \n     nationwide, and the press.\n       The League of Conservation Voters urges you to vote against \n     the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2000 (S. 1287). S. \n     1287 poses unacceptable risks to public health and to the \n     environment.\n       The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should be in \n     charge of setting the final standard for Yucca Mountain and \n     should set the most protective standard possible. S. 1287 \n     would undermine EPA's standard-setting process by delaying \n     the issuance of a final standard until as late as June 1, \n     2001. The bill also would require agreement between the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission and EPA on the final standard. \n     EPA has already published a proposed standard for Yucca \n     Mountain that appropriately includes a separate standard for \n     groundwater--the most likely avenue for contamination at \n     Yucca Mountain. The NRC's proposed standard does not set a \n     separate groundwater standard, and is designed to accommodate \n     the anticipated failures of Yucca Mountain to contain \n     radionuclides. Further, the NRC's proposed radiation standard \n     is higher than the highest radiation standard recommended by \n     the National Academy of Sciences in its 1995 report on \n     standards for Yucca Mountain.\n       S. 1287 would put Americans in communities across the \n     nation at risk by mandating dangerous shipments of spent \n     nuclear fuel to an as-yet unidentified ``backup'' storage \n     site from reactors across the country beginning as early as \n     2006. S. 1287 would dramatically increase nuclear waste \n     shipments, together with the risk of a transport accident \n     involving nuclear waste. Up to 100,000 shipments of nuclear \n     waste will travel through 43 states and within half a mile of \n     50 million Americans over 25 years.\n       LCV urges you to vote ``No'' on S. 1287 and to work instead \n     for a national nuclear waste policy based on sound science, \n     citizen involvement, and protection of public health and \n     safety.\n       LCV's Political Advisory Committee will consider including \n     votes on this issue in compiling LCV's 2000 Scorecard. If you \n     need more information, please call Betsy Loyless in my office \n     at 202/785-8683.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deb Callahan,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Alaska talked about \nconveyances of Federal public lands to Nevada. The Senator from Alaska \nhas been very good working with Nevada which has 87 percent of its land \nowned by the Federal Government. We have worked very well with him. His \ncommittee has helped us get parcels of land put in the private sector, \nbut in this instance, the State of Nevada has had no input.\n  There are about 20 maps on file at the DOE showing where these lands \nare located. The Governor of the State of Nevada knows nothing about \nthis. Our public lands administrator in the State of Nevada knows \nnothing about this. I have not been provided copies of these maps, so I \nassume none of my colleagues have either. No hearings have been held to \nfind out whether the land conveyances are good or bad. We want land in \nthe private sector, but we do not want land conveyed that will have\n\n[[Page S519]]\n\na negative effect on the people of the State of Nevada. We need to \nreview the proposed land conveyances. These are not small conveyances. \nThis bill could convey land larger than the State of Connecticut from \npublic lands to private lands in the State of Nevada.\n  This legislation is a big fat yellow lemon. In addition to that, \nalthough I usually like the looks of lemons, this is an ugly lemon, and \nthe best thing we can do is vote against this legislation. It is bad \nlegislation, and the amendment of my friend, the Senator from Alaska, \nis not going to improve it. It just further, as I say, ``lemonizes'' \nthis legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to \nexpress my support for an amendment I was planning to offer, along with \nSenators Snowe, Collins, and Jeffords, to strike the so-called take \ntitle provision from S. 1287. I thank Chairman Murkowski for including \nthis in his substitute. We are withholding offering that amendment.\n  For as long as I have been in the Senate, I have argued that the \nDepartment of Energy has a legal responsibility to remove nuclear waste \nfrom my home State of Minnesota. We all know the DOE was obligated to \nbegin removing waste from civilian nuclear reactors by January 31, \n1998. Sadly, the DOE virtually ignored that date and instead has \nengaged in a protracted struggle to dodge any responsibility it might \nhave to our Nation's ratepayers.\n  As everyone in this Chamber knows, Washington's involvement in \nnuclear power is not new. Since the 1950s Atoms for Peace Program, the \nFederal Government has promoted nuclear energy in part by promising to \nremove radioactive waste from powerplants. Congress decisively \ncommitted the Federal Government to take and dispose of civilian \nradioactive waste beginning in 1998 through the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct of 1982 and its amendments in 1987. It has been on record for 18 \nyears, a mandate by the Congress, to do this.\n  These acts established the DOE Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste \nManagement to conduct that program. It selected Yucca Mountain, NV, as \nthe site to assess for the permanent disposal facility. It also \nestablished fees of a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour on nuclear-\ngenerated electricity, and it provided that those fees would be \ndeposited into the nuclear waste fund.\n  Furthermore, it authorized appropriations from this fund for a number \nof activities, including development of a nuclear waste repository.\n  Eventually, publication of the standard contract addressed how \nradioactive waste would be taken, stored, and disposed. The DOE then \nsigned individual contracts with all civilian nuclear utilities \npromising to take and dispose of civilian high-level waste beginning on \nJanuary 31, 1998. The DOE signed contracts to do this.\n  Other administrative proceedings, such as the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission's waste confidence rule, told the American public they \nshould literally bank on the Federal Government's promises.\n  This point needs to be clearly understood by the Members of this \nbody. Our Nation's nuclear utilities did not go out and invest in \nnuclear power in spite of Federal Government warnings of future \ndifficulties. Instead, they were encouraged by the Federal Government \nto turn to nuclear power to meet our increasing energy demands. \nUtilities and States were told to move forward with investments in \nnuclear technologies because it is a sound source of energy production, \nand the Federal Government's support for nuclear power was based on \nsome very sound considerations.\n  First, nuclear power is environmentally friendly. Nothing is burned \nin a nuclear reactor, so there are no emissions released in the \natmosphere. In fact, nuclear energy is responsible for over 90 percent \nof the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that have come out of the \nenergy industry since 1973. Between 1973 and 1996, nuclear power \naccounted for emissions reductions of 34.6 million tons of nitrogen \noxide and 80.2 million tons of sulfur dioxide.\n  Second, nuclear power is a reliable baseload source of power. \nFamilies, farmers, businesses, and individuals who are served by \nnuclear power are served by one of the most reliable sources of \nelectricity.\n  Third, nuclear energy is a home-grown technology, and the United \nStates led the way in its development. We have long been the world \nleader in nuclear technology and continue to be the world's largest \nnuclear-producing country. Using nuclear power increases our energy \nsecurity.\n\n  Finally, much of the world recognizes those same values and promotes \nthe use of nuclear power, again, because of its reliability, because of \nits environmental benefits, and its value to energy independence. For \nthose reasons, the Federal Government threw one more bone to our \nNation's utilities. It said: If you build nuclear power, we will take \ncare of your nuclear waste, we will build a repository, and we will \ntake it out of your State. Again, they told the public: You can bank on \nthose promises by the Federal Government.\n  In response to those promises, States across the country took the \nFederal Government at its word. It allowed civilian nuclear energy \nproduction to move forward.\n  As we all know, ratepayers agreed to share some of the \nresponsibilities but were promised some things in return. They agreed \nto pay a fee attached to their energy bill in exchange for an assurance \nthat the Federal Government meet its responsibility to manage any waste \nstorage facilities.\n  Because of those promises and measures taken by the Federal \nGovernment, ratepayers have now paid roughly $16 billion, including \ninterest, into the nuclear waste fund. Today, these payments continue, \nexceeding $600 million annually or about $70,000 for every hour for \nevery day of the year. For the ratepayers of Minnesota, these \ncontributions have claimed over $300 million of their hard-earned money \nsince the creation of the nuclear waste fund.\n  In summary, the Federal Government promoted nuclear power, utilities \nagreed to invest in nuclear power, States agreed to host nuclear \npowerplants, and the ratepayers assumed the responsibility of investing \ninto the long-term storage of nuclear waste. Still nuclear waste is \nstranded on the banks of the Mississippi River in Minnesota and on \ncountless other sites across the country because the Department of \nEnergy has a very short-term memory and this administration has \nvirtually no sense of responsibility-- --let me say that again--because \nthe Department of Energy has a very short-term memory and this \nadministration has virtually no sense of responsibility.\n\n  Now we can all argue all day long on the floor of this Chamber on the \nmerits of nuclear power. But we cannot stand here on the Senate floor \nand deny that the Federal Government promoted nuclear power and that \nthe Federal Government promised to take care of nuclear waste.\n  Taking title to the waste does not fulfill that promise.\n  Unfortunately, if the DOE is allowed to take title to nuclear waste \nat the plant site, I can't provide the ratepayers of my State with any \nreason to believe the waste will eventually be moved.\n  Allowing the DOE to take title to waste and to leave it at the \nreactor site is an invitation to even more ratepayer abuse at the hands \nof the Department of Energy. I think the record of the DOE has shown \nthat this administration would much rather leave waste where it is than \nmove it to a centralized storage facility.\n  A number of my colleagues in the Senate have suggested the same \nthing. I don't believe that is a good policy, nor is it the policy in \nwhich the ratepayers of Minnesota have so generously invested--again, \nnot only in Minnesota but across this country.\n  I met yesterday with Minnesota's Commerce Commissioner, Steve Minn. \nHe made it very clear to me that for States, the most objectionable \naspect of this bill is the take title provision. He indicated that the \nprovision is viewed with extreme skepticism by the State of Minnesota.\n  I understand why.\n  I know Senator Murkowski has read from the letter the Governors, \nalong with Governor Ventura of Minnesota, have written and sent to \nPresident Clinton dealing with this problem. It says:\n\n       We governors from states hosting commercial nuclear power \n     plants and from affected\n\n[[Page S520]]\n\n     states express our opposition to the plan proposed by Energy \n     Secretary Richardson in his February 1999 testimony before \n     the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Secretary \n     Richardson proposes that the Department of Energy take title, \n     assume management responsibility and pay costs at nuclear \n     plant sites for used nuclear fuel it was legally and \n     contractually obligated to begin removing in January 1998.\n\n  The Department of Energy says: Oh, we'll pay for it. But where are \nthey going to get the money? They are going to take it from the \nratepayers or the taxpayers. So basically this is a punt by the \nDepartment of Energy--again, not committed to those contracts that it \nsigned with all the States.\n\n       This proposed plan would create semi-permanent, federally \n     controlled, used nuclear fuel facilities in each of our \n     states.\n\n  This letter states some of the objections by the Governors:\n\n       This plan abridges states rights--it constitutes federal \n     takings and establishes new nuclear waste facilities outside \n     of state authority and control.\n\n  The Governors went on to say, in their objection to the take title \nprovision offered by Secretary Richardson of the Department of Energy:\n\n       The new waste facilities would likely become de facto \n     permanent disposal sites [some 100 sites across the country]. \n     Federal action over the last 50 years has not been able to \n     solve the political problems associated with developing \n     disposal for used nuclear fuel. Establishing these federal \n     sites will remove the political motivation to complete a \n     final disposal site.\n\n  The Governors across the states that are affected are very concerned. \nAgain, I understand why.\n  Quite reasonably, States don't want to see the Federal Government \ntake up permanent residence at these waste sites. It is the nuclear \nwaste equivalent to having the fox guard the hen house.\n  Allowing the Federal Government control of waste sites removes a \nState's oversight role. It removes the State's authority and control \nover these sites and it does not--I underline that--it does not remove \nwaste from Minnesota or any other State.\n  In closing, I ask my colleagues to listen to the Governors of our \nStates and to vote to remove the take title provision from this \nlegislation, in other words, support Chairman Murkowski's substitute.\n  With this bill, we need to lock in transportation provisions, protect \nthe ratepayers from increases in their contribution, facilitate a \nconstructive resolution to the radiation standard dispute, and also \nadvance the goal of completing a national repository for the permanent \nstorage of nuclear waste.\n  We do not need to provide the DOE with an excuse to leave waste \nstranded permanently in Minnesota and across the country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As previously ordered, the Senator from North \nDakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I had sought permission to speak as in \nmorning business--not on this bill--for 15 minutes. I shall not take \nthat entire time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/09/senate-section/article/S520-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S520-S521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROTECTING SMALL BUSINESSES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning there was a story in a daily \nnewspaper in my State, the Bismarck Tribune, entitled ``National candy \ncompany takes on Mandan couple.'' It is a curious story, an interesting \nstory, and one that is perhaps repeated all too often around the \ncountry. It concerns a type of business dispute in which one company \nalleges that another company is doing something that intrudes upon the \nrights of the first company.\n  As corporations become larger through mergers and acquisitions, all \ntoo often we see big companies trying to muscle mom-and-pop businesses \naround. That is what I think this case is about.\n  For those of us who care about small businesses and stand up for the \nrights of entrepreneurs, people who work hard, people who risk almost \neverything to make a go of it on Main Street, this kind of story is \npretty ominous. Let me describe what it is about.\n  It is about a small business in Mandan, ND, run by Debbie and Russel \nKruger. They run a drugstore and soda fountain on the main street of \nMandan; and to try to make a little extra money, they make homemade \ncandy. Debbie Kruger has created three different candy bars, and she \nmarkets these candy bars as well.\n  It is a good small business. They are not making a fortune, but they \nare struggling and doing business on the main street of Mandan, ND.\n  If I might, with the permission of the Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nto show the Lewis & Clark Bar on the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is a candy bar that has on its wrapper a picture of \nLewis and Clark, and buffalo, and the young Indian woman, Sakakawea, \nwho guided Lewis and Clark across the West. It is a milk chocolate \ncandy bar called the Lewis & Clark Bar, designed by Debbie Kruger in \n1997.\n  She did this because we are coming up to the 200th anniversary of the \nLewis and Clark Expedition. There will be celebrations up and down the \nroute that Lewis and Clark took. They stayed the winter in Mandan, ND--\nabout 40 miles north. They spent the entire winter there. They spent \nmore time in North Dakota than any where else on their trip.\n  The 200th anniversary--1804, 1805, 1806--will bring enormous \nvisitation to the Lewis and Clark route. So Debbie Kruger, created a \ncandy bar, the Lewis & Clark Bar.\n  She produced 20,000 to 30,000 bars. She sold about 20,000; and 10,000 \nare on shelves or in inventory.\n  Then she got a letter from a lawyer in Boston, MA. That is ominous \nenough, just getting a letter from a lawyer in Boston, MA.\n  The lawyer wrote:\n  ``I represent New England Confectionery Company (Necco).'' I know \nNecco. I have been eating Necco products since I was a little kid.\n  The letter continues that a matter has come to the attention of this \nlawyer for the New England Confectionery Company. The matter that has \ncome to his attention? There is a candy bar in Mandan, ND, named the \nLewis & Clark Bar. What does that mean?\n  He says his company has produced this bar--it is the Clark Bar--and \nthis woman has infringed on our rights by using the name, Lewis & Clark \nBar. She must cease and desist, he says. We seek an arrangement. We \ndemand she suspend operations.\n  The small business has to go hire a lawyer, who writes back and says: \nThis is not an infringement. This is a different candy bar, a different \nwrapper. We aren't infringing on anything.\n  The Necco lawyer writes back from Boston--I guess one has to go to a \nspecial law school to do this--and says: The differences between your \nclient's candy bar and my client's candy bar are not the kinds of \ndifferences that dispel confusion. ``They are both candy bars,'' he \nsays. Where do they train lawyers like this? Where on Earth could such \nlawyers come from?\n  He says, ``We seek an arrangement.'' We know what that means. They \nseek some money. Then at the end, of course, they demand that the \nregistration for the Lewis and Clark bar be withdrawn and ``assigned to \nus,'' and so on.\n  Now, the corporation that owns this confectionary company--Necco--is \nactually the United Industrial Syndicate. They do mill works. They make \nautomobile parts, truck parts. And yes, they make candy bars, including \nthe Clark bar. That candy bar was named after a Mr. Clark who lived in \nthe 1880s in Pittsburgh and started the company that made the bar.\n  The United Industrial Syndicate bought this company at a bankruptcy \nsale in 1999. It has nothing to do with Lewis & Clark. But here is a \nBoston lawyer, working on behalf of this company, this corporate \nconglomerate, who thinks the name Lewis & Clark apparently belongs to \nthem. Sorry, it doesn't.\n  Debbie and her husband weren't looking for a fight. They don't have \nthe money to spend on a battery of lawyers. They are a small business \ntrying to make a living.\n  What is happening here is wrong, but it happens all the time. It is a \nform of corporate bullying. It is throwing your weight around, if you \nare big enough to do it.\n  My message for Necco is: Pick on somebody your own size. I am one of \nyour customers. I can't walk past a candy counter without stopping, if\n\n[[Page S521]]\n\nthey have those little wafers. I like the all chocolate ones. I buy \nthem all the time. Is that a vice? I suppose. But I do it because they \nare awfully good.\n  I am one of their customers, and I say to Necco: Lay off small \nbusinesses. Don't hire blind lawyers. If you can't tell the difference \nbetween their Clark bar wrapper and the wrapper for the Lewis and Clark \nbar, then get a new lawyer, and do something worthwhile for a change.\n  Thomas Jefferson always said that the long-term success of this \ncountry would be our ability to sustain broad-based economic ownership. \nOf course, he was talking about a network of family farms and small \nbusinesses. That is what refreshes democracy, broad-based economic \nownership. He always insisted that you can't maintain political \nfreedoms unless you maintain economic freedom, and economic freedom \ncomes from broad-based economic ownership. Therefore, this freedom is \nrooted in the economic health of men and women in this country who run \nAmerica's small businesses on main streets. We need to be concerned \nabout that.\n  How often do you hear Members come to the floor of the Senate and \nworry about the number of lawsuits in this country? They worry about \nthe lawsuits filed by customers against big corporations. What about \nthis use of lawyers by a big company trying to put a small company out \nof business? What about that kind of corporate bullying? It is time to \nstop it.\n\n  The men and women who risk their all and work hard to run small \nbusinesses in this country don't deserve to have to defend themselves \nagainst a battery of lawyers hired by big corporations. I hope the \ncompany that produces a product that I purchase--a company I don't know \nvery well--will decide that they ought to cease and desist.\n  I hope they will decide they have better things to do. I hope they \nwill decide they don't own the name ``Lewis & Clark.'' I hope they will \ndecide that there is no threat to the economic well-being of their \ncompany by the existence of a small business on the main street of \nMandan, North Dakota that makes candy bars and hand-dipped candy. I \nhope they will find lawyers who can understand the difference between \nthese two wrappers.\n  There must be better things for this company and for its lawyers to \ndo. I hope to report to my colleagues one day that this company has \ndecided to take a more constructive approach. I also hope that the many \nothers around the country who suffer the same sort of difficulty--who \nare being bullied and muscled by some of the larger corporate \nenterprises that worry about the existence of competition--I hope these \nsmall business people will decide that the solution is not to cave in. \nThe solution is to fight. Don't give up.\n  I know that this subject is radically different from the issue of \nnuclear waste. But it has a lot to do with what goes on in this \ncountry, the kinds of business we pursue and the kind of economy we \nwill have in the future. If those who are big enough can always gain \nthe upper hand then those who are small will never be able to defend \nthemselves.\n  We must from time to time be the defenders of those in this country \nwho aspire to do good work and aspire to run a small business and \ncreate something of value on the main streets of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business and that \nthe time be charged to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later this afternoon a resolution \nsponsored by Senator Durbin and I will be sent to the desk. That \nresolution expresses the sense of the Senate regarding its sorrow upon \nthe passing yesterday of one of the Nation's leading radio \npersonalities, Bob Collins from WGN Radio in Chicago.\n  Yesterday afternoon, Bob Collins, who was one of the Nation's leading \nradio personalities, who had a listening audience of over 600,000 \npeople, after finishing his radio program, drove to his home in Lake \nCounty, IL, and decided to go out and fly his airplane. He apparently \nhad a friend with him in that airplane. While that airplane was \nattempting to land at Waukegan Airport in Waukegan, IL, another small \naircraft hit it. Ultimately, it drove Mr. Collins' plane into a \nbuilding. It later was confirmed that he died as a result of the \naccident. It was a horrible tragedy.\n  In the last 24 hours, all of Chicago and many people throughout the \nMidwest have been mourning the death of Bob Collins.\n  Mr. Collins was a personal friend of mine, somebody I thought very \nhighly of. It is with particular sadness that I rise upon this occasion \nof his untimely death.\n  Bob Collins was known affectionately to his Chicago audience as Uncle \nBob. He had the main drive time-radio program at WGN Radio since 1986. \nHe had by far the largest audience. In fact, his rating points for the \nlast 10 years showed that his audience was twice the size of his next \nclosest competitor. He was very much loved all around Chicago by people \nwho for the past 13 or more years, every morning when they awoke, heard \non the radio the voice of Bob Collins.\n\n  His show ran from 5 a.m. until 9 a.m., and so hundreds of thousands \nof Chicagoans, as they were driving to work in the morning on congested \nexpressways, would be listening to him day in and day out.\n  Some have described Bob Collins as the narrator of events in Chicago \nand in the Midwest over the past decade or more. He talked about \neverything from the local and national news to current political \ntopics. In fact, he was a very devoted Republican in a very Democratic \ncity. But notwithstanding his political views, he still had wide \npopularity. He had guests from all walks of life on his radio show \nevery day. Senator Durbin and I on at least one occasion were guests of \nBob Collins on his radio show.\n  Bob did everything during his radio show. He would announce the \nweather. He would talk the whole 4 hours. He even read his own \ncommercials. And being on from 5 in the morning until 9 in the morning \nand thinking about how you hold that audience's attention for that long \nof a time when you are talking is very difficult. It is even tougher to \ndo it and remain interesting. But Bob was always interesting. Yet he \ndidn't grate on people, and he retained and built his audience over the \nyears. He really had a gift of talking. People enjoyed what he was \nsaying and found him entertaining.\n  He never stooped to the methods we are seeing increasingly with the \nshock jocks, the rude and obnoxious talk radio we so often hear.\n  He never resorted to cheap tricks to maintain the interest of his \naudience. I think that is the reason people never tired of him and that \nhe went on for years as a popular radio guy.\n  Bob was very folksy and unpretentious. In fact, he was the exact same \nperson on the radio as he was off the radio. I saw him many times in \nrelaxed, amicable circumstances, and he was just the same regular old \nBob Collins who grew up in Lakeland, FL, who liked to ride motorcycles \nand fly airplanes, with a very sunny and cheerful personality at all \ntimes. He had a zest for life and always had a sunny disposition. On \nhis show, he was always very polite and agreeable. Even when he \ndisagreed with his guests, he was always very affable.\n  I want to read from a column that appeared this morning in the \nChicago Tribune by Mary Schmich. She wrote about Mr. Collins' life. It \nis a wonderful article. I will read a couple of paragraphs about how \nshe described Mr. Collins:\n\n       As a radio guy, he was both a master and a freak. In the \n     age of screechers and squawkers and shock jocks, in a time \n     that has elevated the obscenity to art and rewarded it with \n     megabucks, Bob stayed Bob.\n       He earned his big bucks the old-fashioned way and still \n     seemed as down-to-earth as the guy one row behind you in the \n     bleachers. He was blunt but never crude, amusing but rarely \n     rude, opinionated but not obnoxious. It was a formula that \n     made him the most popular morning radio guy in one of the \n     world's most cutthroat radio towns. He walloped the \n     competition as easily as if he were sunbathing.\n       That's the mark of an artist--he makes the difficult look \n     easy.\n\n  Uncle Bob, who for so many years in Chicago, to so many thousands of \nlisteners around the Midwest, always\n\n[[Page S522]]\n\nmade the difficult look easy, I am going to miss you; we are all going \nto miss you. Thank you for all you have done for Chicago and for our \ncommunity. May God comfort your wife Christine and your mother and \nfather, and may God rest and keep your soul.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we will have two \nbrief amendments, with voice votes, by Senators Conrad and Murkowski--\nthe two amendments that have been given to the Chair in number--and \nafter that there will be debate on the bill itself, with a half hour \nfor each side in the morning, and there will be no other amendments \nconsidered on this legislation until final passage.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, that is my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding of the Chair.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, might I further inquire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I think that is consistent with the understanding we have. \nI presume that this afternoon it is in order for us to continue to \ndebate the measure, subject to whatever accommodations both sides need \nto make to permit equal opportunities to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, I can \nannounce that there will be no further votes today and final passage of \nthe nuclear waste bill will occur tomorrow at 11 a.m.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, briefly interrupting the manager of the \nbill, I think it would be appropriate to ask for the yeas and nays on \npassage of the bill tomorrow, and I do so now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2813 to Amendment No. 2808\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a substitute amendment)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2813.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2819 to Amendment No. 2813\n\n    (Purpose: To include the States of North Dakota, South Dakota, \n       Wisconsin, and Michigan in the study required by this act)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2819 in the \nsecond degree offered by Senator Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski), for Mr. Conrad, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2819 to amendment No. 2813.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, line 20 of the amendment, strike ``Minnesota'' \n     and insert ``Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, \n     Wisconsin, and Michigan.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on either \nof the amendments and ask the Chair to put the question on the \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the second-degree amendment \nis agreed to. Without objection, the first-degree amendment, as \namended, is agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2819 and 2813, as amended) were agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me take this opportunity to again thank my colleagues from Nevada \nfor their understanding of this difficult issue and the effect, of \ncourse, it has on their State.\n  I encourage other Members who are seeking recognition and who might \nwant to speak on this issue, this would be a good time to do it because \nwe probably have an hour or two left today. Time being what it is in \nthe morning, we have yet to hear from leadership as to what time the \nSenate will convene tomorrow.\n  Might I inquire of the Chair, is there any indication of that?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Bryan wants to speak on the bill itself this \nevening. We have one other Member who wishes to speak in morning \nbusiness. That is all we know of this afternoon. As the Senator \nindicated, if there are other Senators who wish to come and speak on \nthis legislation, or as if in morning business, they should work their \nway over to the Capitol.\n  I also say to my friend that I haven't spoken to either leader, but I \nthink we probably would come in at 9:30 in the morning. That is the \nnormal time. Senator Thurmond is available.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond to my good friend from Nevada, I \ndon't think we have been able to ascertain when. But I join him in \nencouraging Members to come over and speak at this time. I have been \nnotified that Senator Craig will be coming over this afternoon. Senator \nDomenici will be coming over, and I believe Senator Sessions. In any \nevent, there probably will not be a lot of time tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will again yield, it was the understanding \nof the minority that the time between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. would be \nequally divided. It doesn't matter when we come in, just so everyone \nunderstands that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes. I certainly agree with my colleague from Nevada. \nThat hour is to be split between both sides.\n  I would like to continue for a moment, if I may. There are a couple \nof points that I think are necessary to highlight. They concern the \nissue of the Environmental Protection Agency and just what the role is \nas determined by the changes we made.\n  I refer to language that is on pages 3, 4, and 5 as opposed to the \nstatement we have from the administration on their\n\n[[Page S523]]\n\nposition. I should point out, that statement was given on February 8. \nIt is a statement of administration policy. It states that as of \nFebruary 4, 2000, the manager's amendment to S. 1287--I understand this \namendment will be brought to the floor--undermines EPA's existing \nstatutory authority to set standards to protect public health and the \nenvironment from radioactive releases. As a consequence, it is \nunacceptable to the administration because they say it undermines EPA's \nexisting statutory authority and is, therefore, unacceptable.\n\n  They further acknowledge that the amendment allows EPA to exercise \nits existing authority to set appropriate radiation release standards \nfor Yucca Mountain. It will allow another entity to block EPA's \nauthority until June 1, 2001. Consequently, if the February 4, 2000, \nmanager's amendment to S. 1287 is approved, and if the Senate bill with \nthese provisions is presented to the President, the President will veto \nthe bill.\n  I appeal to the administration. According to the Washington Post \narticle which I read, the White House says it opposes the bill because \nit would take away from the EPA the sole authority to determine \nradiation exposure requirements at a future permanent waste repository \nif it is built in Nevada.\n  Let me read what it says.\n\n     Adoption of standard:\n       Notwithstanding the time schedule in section 801 of the \n     Energy Policy Act, the administration shall not publish or \n     adopt a public health and safety standard for the protection \n     of the public from releases from radioactive materials stored \n     or disposed of in the repository at the Yucca Mountain site \n     except in accordance with this section before June 1st, 2001.\n\n  To suggest that they don't have the sole authority is not what the \nlegislation says. It says they shall not have the authority to publish \nor adopt before June 1st, 2001.\n  Further, relative to this portion, it says: not later than April 1st, \n2001, the Commission and the National Academy of Sciences shall, based \non the proposed rule and the information provided by the \nAdministrator--that is, the Administrator of EPA--under paragraph 1, \nshall submit a report to Congress on whether the proposed rule is \nconsistent about section 801 of the Energy Policy Act;\n  Or, B, provides a reasonable expectation of the public health and \nsafety and the environment will be adequately protected from the \nhazards posed by high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel disposed \nof in the repository;\n  And, C, it is based on the best reasonable obtainable scientific and \ntechnical information concerning the need for and consequences of the \nrule;\n  And, D, imposes the least burden consistent with obtaining the \nregulatory objective of protecting the public health and safety and the \nenvironment.\n  No. 3, in the event that either the Commission--that is, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission--or the National Academy of Sciences finds the \nproposed rule does not meet one or more of the criteria issued in \nparagraph 2, it shall notify the Administrator--that is, the EPA \nAdministrator--not later than April 1st, 2001, of its finding and the \nbasis for such finding.\n  I repeat that the Environmental Protection Agency has the final say \nand, under the statute, shall have the sole authority to address the \nlevels of radiation but not before June 1st, 2001. We have not heard \nfrom the administration relative to those changes. I hope the \nadministration will be sensitive to our effort to ensure that, indeed, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency will have the last word.\n\n  The objective is not to take away from the obligation of the EPA, \nwhich has the authority under statute. The effort is to bring forth the \nbest science available. If the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that \nlicensed and monitors the plants has more Ph.D.s in the area of nuclear \nscience and the National Academy of Sciences can contribute something, \nis that not in the public interest?\n  Again, I appeal to my colleagues to recognize our bottom line is \nsimply to have an emission standard that is attainable and that allows \nCongress to address a final resting place for the waste.\n  Senator Kerrey's office advised me he wishes to be deleted as a \ncosponsor of the amendment. I ask unanimous consent that request be \nhonored.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I assure my colleagues, Senator Bingaman, and the \nadministration of our willingness to use the remaining time to try to \nbe responsive to their concerns.\n  I will summarize the situation. We have been at this a long time. We \nall agree we have an obligation as elected representatives to resolve \nthis problem. The failure of the Government--certainly not under this \nSecretary of Energy--to take the waste in January of 1998 is what we \nare living with today. The ratepayers have paid $15 billion in electric \nrates on their bills with the assumption the Federal Government would \ntake that waste; the damages and the claims go on and on and on as a \nconsequence of time passing as that waste remains at the sites of our \nnuclear plants. The nearest estimate we have is $40 billion to $80 \nbillion. The longer we wait, the greater the burden of the taxpayer. I \nthink the public looks to Congress to address this with resolve.\n  Some have suggested this administration simply does not want to \nresolve this matter on its watch. That may be the basic position of the \nadministration. That may be justified in their minds. There is another \ngroup out there that sees the passage of this legislation to resolve \nwhat we will do with our nuclear waste as some kind of a significant \nbenefit to the nuclear industry. If they can defeat this and bring the \nindustry to its knees by causing it to choke on its own waste, nuclear \npower as we know in this country will die. It will reach a slow process \nof strangling on that waste, the nuclear power industry will go away, \nand we will simply generate power from some other source.\n  The difficulty I have with that is the inability to identify what \nthat other source will be and what it will do to our air quality. To me \nthere is a tradeoff in the process. If we lose the nuclear power \ngenerating capacity, which is about 20 percent in this Nation, what \nwill we replace it with?\n  We have to solve the waste problem. If this administration does not \nwant it to occur on its watch, we are still going to have to solve it \nunder another administration, whether it be Republican or Democratic, \nor we are simply going to add this obligation of the damages to the \nAmerican taxpayer. I think we are all in agreement that we simply must \ndeal with it. We have an equal responsibility.\n  I gave an interview a few minutes ago. The first question was: \nSenator, why can't you resolve this? I am sure all my colleagues know \nwhy we can't resolve it. Nobody wants the waste.\n  Unfortunately for our good friend from Nevada, a decision was made to \nproceed with Yucca as a permanent repository some time ago. We have \nspent over $6 billion. The tunnel is drilled. We are awaiting \nlicensing. That is where we are.\n  I am also told the administration is split on this. Some would like \nto see it resolved. Some don't want it resolved at all.\n  I guess it rests with each Member to recognize his or her \nresponsibility as elected representatives to bring this to a resolve \nresponsibly. If somebody else has a better idea of how to resolve it \nresponsibly, they can certainly have this dais, the microphone, and \nwhatever else goes with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor this \nafternoon and support the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee in an effort he has led for a good number of years. I have \nparticipated with him in trying to bring some reasonable resolution to \nthe issue of a permanent repository for the high-level nuclear \nradioactive waste of this country.\n  Mr. President, this debate will proceed. It is my understanding we \nhave a vote tomorrow morning. Already we have heard a variety of \nopinions on the process used to deal with the issue of high-level \nnuclear waste. Without question, this is an issue that Congress has \ndealt with over the years in which the public has had to go through \nmore misstatements, false statements, or emotional statements about \nwhat isn't\n\n[[Page S524]]\n\ntrue or what some wished might be true. All we can do is look at the \nscientific and engineering facts of the history of the management of \nnuclear waste in our country to say that this country, about 99.9 \npercent of the time, has done it right and not exposed their citizenry \nto the mismanagement of the storage of waste.\n  Yes, we have learned periodically of the handling of radioactive \nmaterials where mistakes were made and immediately corrected. However, \nour country has a positive legacy in nearly all instances of dealing \nwith this issue.\n  The Senator from Alaska and I have brought different versions of this \nissue to the floor over the last 4 years as we have tried to force this \nadministration to move responsibly following the enactment of a law in \n1982 that was a long-term approach toward funding and establishing a \npermanent geologic repository. We are now at a time when the issue of \nradiation release standards at what may become the permanent geologic \nrepository at Yucca Mountain has been largely the focus of what this \nlegislation deals with.\n  It think it is important to put the debate in the context of what is \nhappening under current law, not under the legislation, under the law \nas it stands today.\n  My purpose in describing the current situation is to explore with my \ncolleagues what I believe is a problem with EPA's current path and for \nmy colleagues to understand why I have reservations about the games \nthat are currently being played.\n  My frustration with EPA is that sometimes their science is rolled up \nin politics.\n  Let me also be clear about what is at stake. I firmly believe, if \nCongress does nothing on this issue, what is at stake is the viability \nof geologic disposal. In other words, to me this issue is larger than \nthe site at Yucca Mountain. It is about whether or not we will be able \nto site and license a geologic repository anywhere in our country.\n  It is not by accident that legislatively we picked Yucca Mountain \nyears ago. It was not done with a crystal ball. It was done with some \nreasonable knowledge that the geology of the region might well hold up \nand would probably be a point of isolation of the kind we would want \nfor a repository, compared with no other place in the Nation. That has \nstill held up and remains true today.\n  I do not believe the current process for setting radiation standards \nin dealing with this is what I would hope we would have. It is not \nbeing informed by good science, and I hope that Congress will bring \ngood science back into the process. That is why this legislation is \nvery important.\n  The chairman's original bill, S. 1287, contained the remedy of giving \nauthority to set radiation standards to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission. Why? Credibility. Honesty, no politics, in large part, and \na historic standard of doing it with the kind of science and knowledge \nthat you want to have to make these kind of decisions.\n  The chairman's substitute bill has a different remedy. EPA would \nstill set the radiation standards but only in consultation with the NRC \nand the National Academy of Sciences.\n  I wish EPA were not setting those standards. I don't think they have \nthe scientific knowledge or credibility to do so, although we have \ncreated this myth about them because it says: They are the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Surely their commitment is to the \nenvironment.\n  Sometimes their commitment is to politics. You cannot say that about \nthe National Academy and you cannot say that for the NRC. So what we \nhave tried to do and what the chairman, I believe, has successfully \ndone is bring all this together. Therefore, we can maybe satisfy the \npolitical side of it and, I hope above hope, we can address the \nscientific and the engineering side of it in a way that is credible \nand, most important, safe for our public and, of course, safe for the \nState of Nevada. Both of these approaches are superior to the current \nsituation which I would like to describe.\n  Today, the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for setting \nthe radiation standards at the Yucca Mountain repository. That \nauthority was granted to EPA in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. So on \nAugust 19 of last year, 1999, the EPA finally proposed a draft \nradiation standard. That draft standard is lengthy and has a lot of \ntechnical detail, but it boils down to two critical items. In other \nwords, when you sort through the chaff, here are the facts that make \nthis issue important.\n  First, EPA's draft proposes an individual protection standard from \nall exposure pathways--food, water, air, et cetera--of no more than 15 \nmillirems per year.\n  Second, EPA proposes a ground water protection standard that limits \nground water contamination to levels at or below EPA's maximum \ncontaminant levels for drinking water--drinking water, in an area where \nnone is drank, or where there are no people to drink it.\n  What that means, in simple terms, is that if we are able to sink a \nwell at the repository and draw the water up and into a glass, EPA says \nyou have to be able to drink that water straight from the ground \nwithout treatment.\n  Not much water is consumed without treatment today, except maybe in \nan isolated farmsteads and in some rural areas. There are very few \nplaces, even in remote wilderness areas, where I would be willing to \nsample drinking water in the way I have just described it. Even in some \nof the pristine, beautiful areas of my State of Idaho, I suggest you do \nnot drink from a stream. My forebears were able to do that, but today \nyou might get a bacterial contamination known as Giardia.\n\n  So we have a 15-millirem standard overall for Yucca Mountain and \nrequirements for underground water that translates, I am told, to a \nlimit of about 4 millirem exposure from underground water. Those are \ntechnical terms. That is why I have tried to break them down to a \nsimple explanation as to what it might mean.\n  What I want my colleagues to understand is that these levels, 15 \nmillirems and 4 millirems, are measured against a background level, a \npoint of measurement. You have to have that to determine any increases. \nYou go to what is known as a background level of naturally occurring \nradiation--from the rocks, the nature of rocks, and of course the Earth \nand the atmosphere itself--naturally occurring radiation of about 300 \nmillirems per year.\n  Yucca Mountain is located in a very arid, desert environment. If you \nhad to try to find a site within the entire contiguous United States \nwhere you might have some hope of meeting a 4-millirem ground water \nstandard, Yucca Mountain is the kind of site you would want to pick. \nYet even in the case of Yucca Mountain, the period of performance is so \nlong and the radiation limit is so unrealistically stringent that there \nis some doubt that the Department of Energy will be able to demonstrate \nwith absolute certainty that a 4-millirem ground water standard could \nbe met.\n  If a dry, desert site cannot meet a 4-millirem ground water limit, it \nis reasonable to question whether any site anywhere could meet this \nunrealistic standard.\n  I could talk at length about how ridiculous I find these kinds of \nradiation limitations, but I think there is a body of criticism of \nEPA's proposal already existing in many of the comments that have been \nsubmitted by experts--not politicians but by experts on EPA's draft. \nPerhaps it will be more persuasive to my colleagues if I quote from the \ncomments submitted to EPA by radiation experts regarding this draft \nradiation standard.\n  The American Nuclear Society, which is a nonprofit professional \nassociation made up of 11,000 members who are nuclear scientists, \nengineers, administrators, educators, physicians--you notice in that \nlist I did not say politicians; they do not have a reason to be \npolitical, they are professionals in an area of importance to this \ncountry--they submitted comments on EPA's radiation standards. The \nAmerican Nuclear Society had the following to say regarding the 15-\nmillirem proposal:\n\n       The individual dose limit that EPA is recommending is not \n     appropriate.\n\n  That is what they said.\n\n       EPA points out that the proposed dose limit of 15 millirem \n     per year is far below the level of background radiation--\n\n  I have already mentioned that--\n\n     (about 300 millirem per year) and that any hypothesized \n     effects of background radiation are not detectable against \n     the rate of health\n\n[[Page S525]]\n\n     effects in the general public. While this is certainly true, \n     we believe that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a \n     better basis in scientific logic than EPA. The individual \n     dose limit that the NRC has proposed (25 millirem per year) \n     is also lower than warranted. . . . [W]e conclude that a dose \n     standard of 70 millirem for the repository alone is \n     appropriate, conservative, and adequately protective.\n\n  So the American Nuclear Society, an association of these 11 million \nprofessionals, has endorsed a radiation standard as high as 70 millirem \nper year.\n  What does the American Nuclear Society have to say about the 4-\nmillirem groundwater standard? They say the following:\n\n       A ground water standard is unnecessary. . . . EPA's reasons \n     for applying a groundwater standard appear to stem from a \n     desire to influence the engineering design of the repository \n     and to reduce collective dose to the general population, \n     neither of which is appropriate. Both approaches are \n     inconsistent with the National Academy of Sciences conclusion \n     that an individual dose standard is adequately protective. . \n     . .\n\n  In other words, you do not need to do both.\n\n       [V]ery small individual doses are not meaningful in \n     assessing public health impacts. . . . In addition, the \n     Linear, Non-Threshold theory of radiation health effects is \n     being questioned with increasing intensity, and a body of \n     scientific opinion exists today that holds it to be without \n     scientific basis. . . .\n\n  If it is ``without scientific basis,'' then maybe the only basis left \nis a political basis. That is the frustration with which the chairman \nand I have had to deal for the last few years as we have tried to bring \nthis issue to completion so the American people would know they had a \npermanent, safe repository in which to put high-level nuclear waste.\n  How do other nuclear experts look at this? Let me turn to the \ncomments submitted to EPA by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in a \nletter dated November 2, 1999, providing NRC's review of EPA's draft 15 \nand 4 millirem radiation standard.\n  On the ground water standard, NRC commented the following:\n\n       The NRC staff objects to the inclusion of separate \n     groundwater protection requirements for the proposed \n     repository at Yucca Mountain because these requirements would \n     result in non-uniform risk levels, they misapply the Maximum \n     Contaminant Levels . . ., and they far exceed what is needed \n     for protection of public health and safety.\n\n  If the public is listening to me or if they have listened to some of \nthis debate, they would say: But, Senator Craig, don't you really want \nto make this as safe as humanly possible?\n  The answer, of course, is yes. The only problem with what EPA is \nsaying is that if we make it that safe, we cannot make it. Of course, I \nam sure my colleagues from Nevada hope that would be the case. If that \nwere true and if it were to become true, this Nation would still be \nwithout what the world of engineering and science says is a safe, \npermanent repository for nuclear waste. Why? Because we allowed \npoliticians instead of scientists to make a determination as to what is \nright and how this facility ought to be constructed for the purpose of \nlong-term safety.\n  What does the NRC have to say about the 15-millirem limit as compared \nto the NRC's proposed 25-millirem limit per year? Again I quote from \nthe NRC's comment letter to EPA:\n\n       Although the EPA rule proposes a lower limit of 15 \n     millirem, and the difference between 15 and 25 millirem is \n     small, the lower value is not necessary for protection of \n     public health and safety and would provide little, if any, \n     reduction in health risk when compared with 25 millirem. It \n     is also important to consider that the average American \n     receives approximately 300 millirem per year from background \n     radiation.\n\n  Oh, my goodness, you mean we are all being irradiated as we stand \nhere or as we travel in our cars or live in our homes or walk in our \nback yards? The answer is, yes, we are. It is natural. Shame on that \nSun and shame on the ground and shame on the minerals within the ground \nbecause they collectively give us 300 millirem per year in background \nradiation.\n  NRC goes on to say:\n\n       In addition to the lack of public health and safety \n     benefits, there are regulatory concerns associated with \n     lowering the dose limit to 15 millirem. Specifically, as the \n     dose limit becomes smaller, limitations in the DOE's models \n     used for estimating performance, and the associated \n     uncertainties in supporting analysis, become more pronounced.\n\n  In other words, how you prove your case becomes more complicated.\n\n       Further, a 15 millirem dose limit is likely to cause \n     unnecessary confusion for the public and cause the NRC to \n     expend resources without a commensurate increase in public \n     health and safety.\n\n  Zero risk. Is it possible in the world today, with all of our talent, \nall of our intelligence, and the best computers in the world, to \nconstruct a zero-risk environment? The answer is no. It cannot be done. \nIt is humanly impossible under any circumstance for any situation; not \njust for radioactive material, but automobiles and planes, walking \nacross the street, or riding the train back to our offices in the \nSenate. Zero risk? No. It does not exist. It does not exist in science, \nand it does not exist in the environment. It never has, and it never \nwill.\n  Yet I am quite sure the public believes we are so sophisticated today \nthat we in fact could create that with the unique talents of this \ncountry. We cannot. It is important we say that. That is why we have \nprofessionals determine what is doable, right, and responsible, and \nthat is all tied with costs and the ability to create.\n  What the NRC is saying by that--``the expending of resources without \ncommensurate increase in public health''--is one can lower it to such a \nlevel of safety that there is no justification to go beyond that.\n  I could continue quoting from these various radiation experts for a \nvery long while because the list is long; remember, experts not \npoliticians. Their objections to EPA's current draft radiation \nstandards reflect a very thorough and well-researched review of EPA's \nproposal, and the criticisms of these experts should inform our debate \nas we struggle to understand what all of these numbers mean and what \nthey mean for the future of this country's nuclear waste disposal \nprogram.\n  But I think perhaps DOE said it best, in a letter to EPA transmitting \nDOE's comments on the draft radiation standard. And the reason that I \nlike this quote is, I think it sets the larger context for what these \nradiation standards mean for our ultimate success or failure.\n  DOE says the following:\n\n       EPA's standards will play a pivotal role in achieving the \n     long-standing policy of the United States to properly dispose \n     of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in an \n     underground mined geologic repository. The Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission must implement EPA's standards in its regulations \n     for licensing a repository at the Yucca Mountain site, and \n     DOE must be able to comply with those NRC regulations in \n     order to construct a repository. If EPA were to select \n     unrealistic, unnecessarily conservative, or non site-specific \n     standards, the result could be the rejection of an otherwise \n     suitable site, and the de facto rejection of the geologic \n     disposal option without commensurate benefit to the \n     protection of public health and safety. Such rejection would \n     not avoid the consequences of radioactive water management, \n     but it would require resort to a different and currently \n     undefined approach.\n\n  I think the statement I just read describes the situation we are in \nnow with EPA's unrealistic and unsupportable draft standard. I hope my \ncolleagues will agree with me that this is a situation Congress must \nact to correct, by bringing good science back into the process of \nsetting a radiation standard.\n  We need a disposal program. Congress, more than a decade ago, chose a \ncourse, a path. We began to tax the ratepayers of the utilities that \nhave nuclear generation in this country to pay for that path.\n  That is where we are today. Some resist that path using all the \nreasons they can humanly generate, and that is why it is important we \nhave this legislation. I hope the Congress can pass it and the \nPresident will sign it.\n  Those are the issues with which we have to deal in understanding this \nproblem. It is critically important to our Nation.\n  At lunch today, I addressed a group of congressional staff and people \nin town who represent energy companies and those who do not. I said: I \nfind it fascinating that the administration would want to take us \nthrough a climate change initiative, known as the Kyoto Protocol, in \nwhich they want to reduce carbon emissions in this country; therefore, \nwe would have to reduce the use of fossil fuels which are currently our \nmost abundant source of energy. In doing so, they are also not\n\n[[Page S526]]\n\nwilling to find a way to deal with nuclear waste, so that we can see an \nextension of the nuclear generation of our country for electricity. \nThey are downplaying that energy source also, and, at the same time, we \nhave a Secretary of Interior who wants to blow up hydro dams. They \ndownplay hydro, and they will not even put hydro in the renewable \nresource category.\n  I find it fascinating, a country that exists on energy, an economy \nthat is being driven today by artificial intelligence as a new \nindustry, and that very industry operates on electricity itself.\n  I see our staff on the floor with computers in front of them. If you \nturned off the power of that computer, its brain would go dead, we \nwould no longer have the tremendous expansion of this economy from \nwhich we are all benefiting. Yet we have an administration phenomenally \nresistant to the establishment of a permanent repository for nuclear \nwaste but is open to the idea that if you do not handle the waste, you \nwill ultimately kill the industry; and if you kill the industry, you \nwill never build another nuclear reactor to generate environmentally \nclean electrical energy. And they want to get rid of the dams and they \nwant to stop burning fossil fuels. Oh, my goodness.\n  What a reality check for our country, to have as our national policy \nno energy policy at all. Our wealth and our very existence, as a major \neconomic force in the world, has always been built on the abundance of \nreasonably inexpensive but readily available energy.\n  That is a part of all of this debate. I think it is probably separate \nfrom what my colleagues from Nevada would say in opposing this \nlegislation. Obviously, they have to reflect the politics of home, as \nthey should.\n  But for a President to say, in a relatively unspoken way, as a policy \nfor the country, we have no energy policy at all--we do not even have \nan energy strategy except maybe a few windmills and solar cells--it is \nno policy at all.\n  That is why we are on the floor trying to close the link between the \ngenerator of electrical power, by the use of the atom, and the \nnecessity to have a responsible method for handling the waste that is \ncreated by that form of generation.\n  While the rest of the world around us builds nuclear reactors for \ngenerating power, and has responsibly handled their waste--and has \nused, in large part, our technology to do so--we have been bound up in \nthe politics of it for well over a decade. I hope, finally, an \nopportunity exists for us to break through it.\n  In my opinion, this is one of the most significant environmental \nbills we will have before the Congress this year. While those on the \nother side would like to cast it as antienvironment, finding a way to \ncollect the nuclear waste of this country, and putting it in one safe \nspot, far from any human being, high in the dry desert of Nevada, seems \nto me, and a lot of other people, to be darn good policy.\n  So let me thank my colleague from Alaska for his leadership. While he \nand I over the years have had disagreements on this issue, we have \nworked them out. We have asked the Senate to work with us to work out \nthe differences. In most instances they have because this policy is too \nimportant for the normal course of politics that it has been served. \nThis is an issue whose time has come. I hope the Senate and the House \nrecognize that as we attempt to deal with it.\n  Again, I thank my chairman and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I acknowledge that this piece of \nlegislation, as it has worked its way from the committee to the floor, \nis better than its original form. But the old adage that you can't make \na silk purse out of a sow's ear is applicable to this piece of \nlegislation. It represents exceedingly bad policy.\n  I am bemused by my friends who are advocating on behalf of this piece \nof legislation in that laced throughout their comments is the \nsuggestion that somehow those of us who oppose this legislation are \n``playing politics.'' I think it is important, once again, to recite a \nlittle of the history.\n  In 1982, when the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was enacted into law, \nCongress made a judgment. I think it was a sound judgment. Congress \nconcluded that it lacked the expertise to set public health and safety \nstandards. They chose the Environmental Protection Agency, which is \nresponsible generally for setting health and safety standards, as the \nappropriate agency to serve that function.\n  I think that was a sound policy judgment. It was to use the language \nI frequently have heard on the floor, responsible. It was good science. \nIt was responsible then and it is responsible now.\n  Had that 1982 piece of legislation gone unchanged, it would have set \nin motion a chain of events that would, in fact, have at least been, at \nthe outset, predicated upon science and not politics.\n  As I have said before in this Chamber, I think that piece of \nlegislation was a balanced approach. It would search the entire country \nand look for the best possible geological formations. We would have had \nregional equity so no one part of the country would bear it all; that \nthree sites could be studied. Once they met the scientific criteria, \nthey would be submitted to the President of the United States. The \nPresident would select one. I think that is fair. I think that is \nbalanced. I think it is good science.\n  Let me respond to this issue of politics because I am both bemused \nand frustrated.\n  The first example of politics is the Department of Energy's own \ndecision to eliminate one particular section of the country from any \nconsideration at all in terms of being considered. That was the \nNortheast. The Department of Energy, in their internal documents, said: \nThe political resistance will be too strong. We will never be able to \nget a site established in that part of the country, even though granite \nmay be an acceptable geological material in which to place a \nrepository.\n  What was that? Was that science? Was that responsible? It was \npolitics--not politics played by the Senators from Nevada or the good \npeople of my State but politics by the Agency.\n  As I stated yesterday, in 1984, we had a Presidential election. \nDuring the course of that election, the then-incumbent President said: \nLook, we're going to eliminate the folks in the Southeast. Salt dome \nformations will not be considered.\n  Was that science? Was that responsible? It was politics--not politics \nby the Senators representing Nevada at that time, nor politics by the \npeople in our own State.\n  What occurred? In 1987, the law was changed so that only one site \nwould be studied at Yucca Mountain. I have expressed my strong \nopposition to that. I do not like it. Was it science? Of course not. \nWas it responsible? Of course not. That was naked politics--naked \npolitical aggression visited upon my State. You have heard me \ncharacterize that legislation as the ``Screw Nevada Bill,'' as it is \nknown throughout my State. That is politics--politics played by the \nSenate and the House of Representatives and the President in offering \nwhat was originally a balanced piece of legislation. There is not a \nscientist in the country who would argue that those changes were made \nin the interest of science or that they could be categorized as \nanything else other than a political decision.\n  My point is, this process, that was set out in the 1982 Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act, is self-executing. It sets forth the process as to how we \nultimately make this determination.\n  What has occurred over the years is the injection of politics--\noriginally on a regional basis and now, as we debate it on the floor, \nwith the nuclear utility industry.\n  I suspect there are very few people who are listening to this debate \nwho can define a millirem or tell us the difference between a millirem \nand a kilowatt. I confess that I am not a scientist. So let me try to \ncategorize this as best I can in terms of what we are doing.\n  In the location of the transuranic waste storage facility in New \nMexico, the Environmental Protection Agency, then as now, is charged \nwith the responsibility of setting a health and safety standard.\n  These are the basic principles involved: A geologic repository \ndesigned to isolate radioactive waste from humans and the environment. \nThat is\n\n[[Page S527]]\n\nwhat is occurring at Yucca Mountain. I don't like it, but that is what \nis occurring. That is going forward. This notion that there is an \noverriding necessity to enact some new piece of legislation is simply \nnot true. This process continues. Sometime at the end of this year, \nperhaps, there will be a finalized environmental impact statement, and \na couple or 3 years down the road there will be a recommendation for \nsite selection. None of that has occurred at this point. It may occur \ndown the road. It has not yet occurred. No reason to act other than \nthat the nuclear utility industry, in the middle of this ballgame, \nwants to move the goalposts because they cannot be sure the guaranteed \noutcome they seek, irrespective of public health and safety--namely, \nopening the repository at Yucca Mountain--can occur if, indeed, public \nhealth and safety considerations are allowed to prevail.\n  So we have essentially a geologic repository designed to isolate \nradioactive waste. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant and Yucca Mountain \nshare the same. The possibility of widespread contamination of both \nfood and water sources and the human population likewise is a concern \nof the WIPP facility and Yucca Mountain. Radiation standards are to be \nestablished by the EPA to protect human health and the environment; \nthat is true with WIPP, and those standards had been set at 15 \nmillirems, and Yucca Mountain.\n  So I think the question has to be asked: Why should Yucca Mountain be \ntreated any differently? Is there a scientific reason? The answer is \nno. It is a political reason: to accommodate a nuclear utility industry \nwhich exercises enormous power and influence in the Halls of Congress \nand, frankly, wants to change the rules of the game in midstream; not \nto protect public health and safety but to get rid of nuclear waste \nirrespective of the consequences.\n  We could talk about background radiation and all of that sort of \nthing forever and ever. I think this is the most important issue: Is \nthe standard that was set for the WIPP fair and reasonable? I assume \nthat it is. There was no controversy attached to that. Nobody said we \nought to take the EPA out of that; we ought to put in the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. There was no objection to it. It moved forward.\n  Is the EPA being reasonable and responsible and scientific? I think \nthe answer is clearly yes. The 1992 energy bill, which has been \nreferenced in this debate, had inserted a provision which said the \nNational Academy of Sciences needs to take a look at whatever the EPA \nstandard is to see if it is reasonable and within a recommended range. \nThey have done that. Here is what the National Academy of Sciences' \nrecommended range. This is the millirems we are talking about, which \nsimply means the amount of radioactive exposure an individual can have \nin a given year from this source. What was proposed at WIPP? Fifteen \nmillirems. The EPA proposes 15 millirems at Yucca Mountain.\n  Now, S. 1287 in its original version, not the bill we are now \ndebating, had a 30-millirem standard. What does the National Academy of \nSciences say? I confess, I don't know the difference between 2 \nmillirems and 3 millirems. I suspect if my colleagues are as forthright \nas I am, they couldn't tell the difference either.\n  The point that needs to be made is, the National Academy of \nSciences--these are scientists; they are not politicians--says that is \na reasonable standard. They say the standard, to be reasonable, could \nbe as little as 2 millirems or as great as 20. That is a reasonable \nstandard.\n\n  What did the EPA come up with? Fifteen millirems. Why is this debate \noccurring? It is all about politics--not politics in Nevada but \npolitics by the nuclear power industry because they want a standard \nthat is less protective in terms of public health and safety. That is \nwhat this issue is all about: public health and safety. We would not be \non the floor debating today if the nuclear power industry was not \npushing and driving to weaken that standard the EPA has proposed. That \nis a fact of life, my friends.\n  Let us talk about the 4-millirem standard for water for a moment. I \nknow my good friend from Alaska is privileged to be from an absolutely \nmagnificently beautiful State. I have been to his State. I love it, \nperhaps not with the same passion and conviction he does, but it is a \ngorgeous State. The State of Alaska, unlike the State of Nevada, is \nfortunate that nature has been more bountiful in terms of the amount of \nwater it has. Nevada is the most arid of the 50 States. Las Vegas, with \na metropolitan population of more than 1.3 million, is the most arid of \nall of the major population centers in America.\n  When we talk about this 4-millirem standard for safe drinking water, \nit has been suggested that somehow that water would have to be \nextracted from the aquifer--that is the underground formation in which \nwater is situated--and would be capable of being consumed at that very \nminute. That is simply not true. All the 4-millirem standard deals with \nis the amount of radiation. That water may have other contaminants--\narsenic. It may have to be subject to a whole series of processes, \nwhether it is a reverse osmosis process, which sometimes we have to use \nin southern Nevada, adding chlorine to it, or whatever else might have \nto be done to make it fit for human consumption. But what we do not \nwant to do is to damage a water resource which a growing State such as \nNevada will need in the future.\n  The notion that somehow we can cavalierly dismiss the notion of a \nstandard to protect us in terms of safe drinking water is somewhat \noutrageous. Perhaps if nature had been more bountiful, we could say \nmaybe that aquifer isn't all that important. Maybe we don't need to be \nconcerned about it because we have water all over the place.\n  In point of fact, Nevada has marvelous geography. It is a State for \nwhich I have great passion, and I am eager to return at the conclusion \nof this year and the end of my term. But the one thing we do not have \nis a lot of water.\n  I think Mark Twain once hit it right on the head when he came to \nNevada as a young man. He came believing there was a position as an \nassistant to his brother, who was the secretary of state during \nNevada's territorial period of time. He wrote a book about those \nexperiences. He talked about water. He said: Whiskey is for drinking, \nand water is for fighting.\n  In the arid West, water is life itself. Water is a resource that we \nprotect because it is vitally important to us. This aquifer needs the \nprotection, and the EPA, the agency which Congress chose, has said that \na 4-millirem standard for safe drinking water is reasonable and is good \nscience. That is science.\n  What is occurring here is a political effort to divert that standard \nfrom going into effect. I appreciate the candor of my friend, the \nchairman of the committee. We want to make sure that the measuring is \nunder a regulation that allows waste to go to Yucca Mountain.\n  That says nothing about health and safety. And as a Nevada Senator, \nthat energizes me. It angers me. It makes me very angry and I don't \nlike the process that has occurred. I do not like the fact that Nevada \nwas designated in a ``screw Nevada bill'' as the only site to be \nconsidered. I don't like that. I am opposed to that. But if it is going \nto occur--and that is the state of the record--that Yucca Mountain is \nthe only place to be studied, why? And by what conceivable rationale, \nif there is any public morality at all, would we suggest that somehow \nthe people of Nevada ought to be subject to a lower public health and \nsafety standard than our good friends from New Mexico in the WIPP \nfacility--15 millirems and 4 millirems for the safe drinking water?\n\n  As I have said, is it somehow that Nevadans are subcretins, less \nhuman? I am outraged at that suggestion or notion. As offended as I am \nby the process by which Nevada was selected--by politics, not science--\nthe ``Screw Nevada Bill''--at least the people in our State, as this \nprocess moves forward, ought to be entitled to the basic minimum health \nand safety standards of the EPA.\n  Let me be clear. The EPA was not established by some left-wing, \nradical, commie sympathizer group of folks. This agency was brought to \nlife during a Republican administration--the administration of Richard \nNixon. In 1982, there was essentially a Republican Senate, and a \nRepublican President made the determination in this piece of \nlegislation--the Nuclear Waste Policy\n\n[[Page S528]]\n\nAct--that the Environmental Protection Agency was the appropriate place \nfor the determination to be made in terms of public health and safety \nstandards.\n  So I submit that you don't have to know a lot about millirems, or \nabout aquifers, and you don't have to know a whole lot about this issue \nto understand that the one agency that is charged by law with providing \npublic health and safety, the Environmental Protection Agency, was \ncharged with that responsibility 18 years ago in this act, and has \nexercised that responsibility with WIPP, and there was not a murmur--no \nsuggestion--that that was somehow radical, that it was political, not \nscience.\n  We are simply asking for no more and demanding that there be no less \nprotection for us. That is really all you need to know about this \nargument. It is simply an attempt to reduce those standards. And \nsomehow to suggest that unless we pass this piece of legislation, this \nprocess that began back in the early 1980s to locate a permanent \nrepository cannot go forward, that simply is not true. This process \ncontinues.\n  We are spending hundreds of millions of dollars studying that Yucca \nMountain facility to see whether or not it is suitable, and that is \nongoing. That would continue, much to my regret, as I have indicated, \nif this piece of legislation had never been conceived or seen the light \nof day.\n  What is involved here is the nuclear utilities. Yes, sure, they would \nlike the American Society for Nuclear Engineers to make the judgment. \nIt doesn't give me, as a citizen, great comfort that crowd is going to \nbe more concerned about my health and safety, that of my children and \ngrandchildren--two of whom live in Nevada--but the EPA has a pretty \ndecent track record, and it was not challenged previously--not \nchallenged.\n  So what this is all about is to kind of bump this standard over into \nnext year. Presidential politics. We know we are going to have a new \nPresident, and the hope of the nuclear utility industry is that a new \nPresident will say to the nuclear utilities, look, you can have \nwhatever standard you want. I hope and pray to the good Lord that does \nnot occur, but that is what this is all about. It is not necessary. It \nis not scientific, and it is not responsible to proceed on the \ncourse of action that we are asked to follow in this piece of \nlegislation.\n\n  I appeal to my colleagues in the name of fairness. All we are asking \nis to have the same measure of protection that is accorded to the good \npeople of New Mexico with respect to their nuclear facility, which the \nNevadans will be entitled to if Yucca Mountain is ever determined to be \nscientifically and suitably situated for the receipt of that waste. \nThat is not an unreasonable premise. It is not an unreasonable request. \nWe are not asking you to repeal the ``Screw Nevada Bill,'' much as I \nobject to the political way in which our State was savaged for it. That \nis a fight for another day.\n  Having had that piece of legislation shoved down our throat, we \ncertainly ought to be entitled, as human beings who happen to live, as \nI do, within 90 miles of that site, to the protection of the agency \nthat is charged by law with protecting the health and safety \nrecommendations, and that an independent oversight group, the National \nAcademy of Science, says is within the recommended range.\n  What is wrong with that? The answer is, nothing is wrong with that \nexcept the politics that the nuclear industry would visit upon this \nChamber and say: Look, you have to help us out; I am not sure we can \nmake that standard. Reduce it, dilute it, kick it over until next year, \nand maybe we will get a new President who will be less responsive to \nthe concerns of public health and safety.\n  I ask my colleagues, when we vote on this at 11 o'clock tomorrow, to \nreject this ill-conceived piece of legislation. It will be vetoed by \nthe President and opposed by the EPA, opposed by the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality, and by every environmental organization of which \nI am aware.\n  It is said that this is an important piece of environmental \nlegislation. Let me correct the Record. This is not an important piece \nof environmental legislation. If this is allowed to occur, this is an \nenvironmental travesty. I hope my colleagues will not allow that to \noccur.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to join the occupant of the chair \non his remarks in support of this legislation, which is far too long \noverdue and which has cost the taxpayers money because your efforts to \nsee it passed have been frustrated.\n  The leadership you, and others have given to this bill has made a \ncompelling case for its passage. I believe we ought to move forward \nwith it, and hopefully we will this time.\n  I do not agree with some who say this is not an important piece of \nenvironmental legislation. It clearly is. We have nuclear waste all \nover this country in nuclear facilities in less than ideal conditions. \nThat waste can be moved to an ideal location approved by the Federal \nGovernment. This is a bill which would help make that happen and clean \nup the environment.\n  I would like to share some thoughts. I come at this with a little bit \nof a different view, as I am sure others do. I don't speak for anybody \nelse, and certainly not the chairman who has advocated this legislation \nso ably. I would like to share a personal insight into where I am \ncoming from with regard to this legislation.\n  During his State of the Union Address, President Clinton remarked:\n  ``The greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global \nwarming. The scientists tell us that the 1990s were the hottest decade \nof the entire millennium. If we fail to reduce the emission of \ngreenhouse gases''--that comes from burning fossil fuel--``deadly heat \nwaves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will flood, \nand economies will be disrupted. That is going to happen, unless we \nact.''\n  But just because the President declared it so does not necessarily \nmake it so. Science surrounding climate change is very complex. In \nfact, NASA has found through satellite data that the upper atmosphere \nhas not warmed at all over the last 20 years. But, regardless of that, \nwe don't know what is happening out there. Change is always about.\n  The notion that our coastlines will flood or that heat waves will \nplague the world is a view that is shared by a lot of radical \nenvironmentalists, non-growth people in this country and around the \nworld. Some scientists have actually studied the matter, however, and \nconcluded that there are many beneficial changes that occur when carbon \ndioxide levels increase. If there is more carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere, plants grow better. They suck in carbon dioxide and emit \noxygen in the process of life that all plants go through.\n  Regardless of who is right and the status of this debate, all of us \nshould look forward to working together in developing a plan to reduce \nair pollution. In doing so, we will at the same time reduce these \ngreenhouse gases, many of which are not damaging to our health. But we \nwill do that anytime we reduce pollution, as a general rule.\n  The largest component of greenhouse gases, of course, is carbon \ndioxide, CO2, which is not an unhealthy gas. President \nClinton and Vice President Gore have already tried to commit our \ncountry, through the Kyoto global warming treaty, to an agreement which \nwould call on the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7 \npercent below the 1990 level by the year 2002. That was a goal of \nKyoto. The Vice President was adamant about committing the United \nStates to reducing emissions 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012, just \n12 years from now. And the United States already produces greenhouse \ngas emissions that are 8 percent over 1990 levels.\n  The Energy Information Administration predicts that the United \nStates, however, will need about a 30-percent increase in electricity \nby the year 2015. We are talking about reducing greenhouse gases in the \nnext 12 years by 15 percent from current levels during a\n\n[[Page S529]]\n\ntime when we need a 30-percent increase in power. It is going to be \nvery difficult to do under any circumstances.\n  But at the same time we are faced with these difficult choices, this \nadministration has surprisingly and openly opposed the use and \ncontinued development of the only options we have to realistically meet \nthe emissions reduction goals--nuclear power and natural gas.\n\n  Nuclear power currently provides over 20 percent of the electric \npower in this country. Given the state of energy technology today, a \ncritical component of our emissions reductions plan should be the safe \nuse of nuclear power. We must maintain this energy source, perhaps \nmaking it a larger source of our energy mix, and not dismiss its future \nuse outright by opposing this critical legislation.\n  As an example of the environmentally friendly capacity of nuclear \npower, consider this: Between 1973 and 1997, nuclear power generation \navoided the emission of 82.2 million tons of sulfur dioxide, and more \nthan 37 million tons of nitrogen oxide, which would have been released \nif that electricity had been produced by fossil fuel plants. In 1997 \nalone, emissions of sulfur dioxide in 1 year would have been about 5 \nmillion tons higher, and emissions of nitrogen oxide would have been \n2.4 million tons higher had fossil generation plants replaced this \nnuclear generation. In addition, literally billions of tons of carbon \nand millions of tons of methane emissions--believed to be the most \nsignificant greenhouse gas--could have been avoided by the sensible use \nof nuclear power in this country.\n  Even though we are still fighting health problems associated with \npollution, a problem that is measurable and real, the safe use of \nnuclear power in this country and elsewhere has helped all of us to \nbreathe easier. In fact, there has not been a single incident in this \ncountry of a person being significantly injured or losing their life at \na nuclear power plant in the entire history of US nuclear power \nproduction. That wouldn't have been true at plants burning coal. How \nmany coal trucks have had wrecks and killed people? How many coal \nminers have been injured or killed? How many people have been killed in \nmoving gas through pipelines and that kind of thing? Nuclear power has \nactually been much safer than those options.\n  Indeed, other countries are far ahead of us. In France, 76 percent of \ntheir power is nuclear. And soon, 50 percent of the power in Japan will \nbe generated by nuclear plants. Nuclear powerplants provided some 16 \npercent of the world's energy production in 1998. Yet the United States \nhasn't proposed to build a new plant in over 23 years. One reason is \nthe cost is rising and is being driven up by our inability to dispose \nof even small amounts of nuclear waste.\n  On November 8, 1997, just after signing the Kyoto greenhouse gas \ntreaty, Vice President Gore stated:\n\n       There are other parts of the Earth's ecological systems \n     that are also threatened by the increasingly harsh impact of \n     thoughtless behavior: The poisoning of too many places where \n     people--especially poor people--live, and the deaths of too \n     many children--especially poor children--from polluted water \n     and dirty air.\n\n  Perhaps the Vice President should heed his own rhetoric and stop the \nthoughtless behavior put forth by his own administration that has \ndiscouraged both the use of nuclear power and the production of our \ncleanest fossil fuel--natural gas.\n  On September 3, 1999, Vice President Gore pledged to stop the new \nleasing of oil and gas sites offshore.\n  It is really a stunning thing. We are producing natural gas mainly in \nthe Gulf of Mexico at unprecedented rates. And we have the opportunity, \nthrough recent discoveries there, to produce even more. Producing more \nnatural gas in this country will reduce our burden on coal and it will \nreduce our burden on oil, which is more polluting. It will reduce our \ntrade imbalance and debt to foreign producers in the Middle East where \nwe are shifting huge amounts of our wealth.\n  Vice President Gore said we are going to stop natural gas production. \nHe went on to state his intention to shut down even existing gas wells. \nNear my home in Mobile Bay, I fished around the oil and gas rigs there. \nIt is some of the cleanest water you can find. We are having no \nproblems with those wells.\n  The Vice President said:\n\n       If elected President, I will take steps to prevent any \n     drilling on the older leases that were granted during \n     previous administrations . . .\n\n  He is even committing to shut down current natural gas wells that are \nproducing the cleanest form of fossil fuel energy we have today.\n  These comments and the policies of this administration on pollution \nand the environment just don't mesh. There simply is no way to meet our \npollution reduction goals while simultaneously stopping the production \nof clean natural gas and blocking the development of a healthy nuclear \npower industry in this country.\n  The Senator from Idaho earlier said we have no energy policy in this \ncountry. We are drifting from poll to poll. Well I think he may be \nright.\n  Some say wind, solar, and biomass technologies are the way to meet \nour air pollution goals. I know of some good research projects. One in \nmy home State uses switch grass and coal to help produce electricity. \nIt is an environmentally friendly project and I hope it will be \nsuccessful. While a lot of progress has been made in this area, we must \nface the reality that these new technologies are good steps--but they \nare small steps; they simply cannot be relied upon to meet our energy \nneeds over the next 40 to 50 years.\n  Every day, new ideas, new procedures, and new techniques cut fuel \nuse, allowing citizens to get energy with less pollution. Refrigerators \ntoday are using less than half the electricity they did 15 or 20 years \nago. That is good progress. The fact is, electricity consumption is up \nin the last 8 years despite these huge increases in efficiency. World \ndemand also will rise.\n  The theory of global warming does not hinge solely on pollution in \nthe United States. The theory suggests that global air emissions are \ncreating, so the theory goes, a greenhouse effect that might raise the \ntemperature around the world. I know people have become absolutely \nconvinced this is a scientific fact; my staff and I have been doing \nresearch and I am not yet convinced. Again I repeat: NASA has monitored \nthe temperature of the upper atmosphere for over 20 years using \nsatellites, and they find the upper atmosphere has not warmed. \nOriginally, the greenhouse gas theorists believed that this part of the \natmosphere would be where the warming would first occur. It has not.\n  I point out that even members of President Clinton's own \nadministration have recognized that nuclear power must play a large \npart in our energy mix. In March of 1999, Ambassador John Ritch, \nPresident Clinton's appointed Ambassador to the North Atlantic \nAssembly, an assembly of parliamentarians to the North Atlantic \ncountries, commented on this issue we are debating today. He said:\n\n       The reality is that, of all energy forms capable of meeting \n     the world's expanding needs, nuclear power yields the least \n     and most easily managed waste.\n\n  In October of 1998, Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat \nremarked:\n\n       I believe very firmly that nuclear [power] has to be a \n     significant part of our energy future and a large part of the \n     Western world if we are going to meet these emission \n     reduction targets. Those who think we can accomplish these \n     goals without a significant nuclear industry are simply \n     mistaken.\n\n  However, we cannot have this industry if we cannot dispose of the \nwaste.\n  By passing sensible nuclear waste legislation, we have the greatest \nopportunity to reduce air pollution since the passage of the Clean Air \nAct. Nuclear power produces virtually no air emissions and generates an \nextremely small amount of solid waste. In fact, relative to the amount \nof power generated per ton of waste produced, nuclear power rates among \nthe cleanest of all energy technologies.\n  My judgment, which has been formed over time, is that we have to \ndevelop policies which will encourage the future development of nuclear \npower in this country--not build roadblocks to its use. How can we \ncontinue to maintain 20-percent power production from nuclear plants if \nthese plants are now going to reach an age where they will have to be \nclosed down? What will we do? The only choice is to burn fossil fuel if \nwe don't use nuclear power.\n\n  Currently, there are tons of spent nuclear fuel stored at 71 sites in \n34 States around this country. Most of the spent\n\n[[Page S530]]\n\nfuel is stored onsite at nuclear plants. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nof 1982 established a nuclear waste storage fund and required the \nDepartment of Energy to begin accepting nuclear waste from these plants \nall over the country by 1998. The fund was paid for by a user fee \nimposed on customers of electricity--that is, American citizens. That \nis, in effect, a tax on American citizens that has been paid for quite \nsome time to store this nuclear waste.\n  To date, the fund has grown to over $15 billion, as the chairman has \npointed out. Not a single ton of spent nuclear fuel has been accepted \nby the Department of Energy. That is an outrage. As a result of the \nDepartment's failure to meet the 1998 deadline, the Department is \ncurrently facing multiple lawsuits which could cost the Federal \nGovernment--and taxpayers--tens of billions of dollars for their \nfailure to produce a safe storage spot and make it available.\n  The Department of Energy has spent over $4 billion to study the \nsafety and environmental impact of storing spent nuclear fuel at Yucca \nMountain site. That is $4 billion. The general fund budget of the State \nof Alabama, with 4 million citizens, is $1 billion. Four billion is a \nlot of money that has been spent.\n  The Department's findings indicate that Yucca Mountain is ideally \nsuited for the long-term storage of nuclear power.\n  Despite the rhetoric put forth by those who oppose this bill, the \nfact is, Yucca Mountain is located in the heart of a remote Nevada \nnuclear test range where nearly 1,000 nuclear devices have been \ndetonated and tested over the years during the cold war. It is a \ndesert. It is not located near any population center and would pose no \nthreat to the surrounding areas.\n  The safe long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel--which has no \npotential to blow up--is a problem we can and should have solved. By \npassing S. 1287, we will set in motion a well-researched plan to safely \nsolve this problem once and for all and allow America to move forward \nin meeting our goals: Cleaning up the environment of nuclear waste and \nreducing air pollution by continuing to allow the nuclear industry to \nfunction.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration has suggested it may veto this bill \nif it arrives on the President's desk. The effect of this announcement \nis to frustrate a $15 billion plan agreed to years ago.\n  To say ``no'' to nuclear power use in this country is to say ``no'' \nto our best chance to significantly reduce air pollution and save the \nenvironment. A vote against this bill is a vote against the \nenvironment, a vote against common sense and a vote against fiscal \nsanity. We have dawdled and delayed far too long. Now is the time to \nstore this hazardous waste under a mountain, at an old nuclear test \nrange in the Nevada desert, at Yucca Mountain.\n  I thank the chairman of this committee for his courageous, steadfast, \nand determined effort to bring this outrage to an end and to get this \nmatter settled.\n  I appreciate his leadership, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama. He has \nhighlighted some points that certainly needed to be identified. In \nreality, the issue is twofold.\n  No. 1, are we going to have a future in this country for the nuclear \npower generating capability associated with our power industry? Is that \nin the future of this country? Or are we hell-bent to kill it?\n  Further, do we want this high-level waste stored at 80-some-odd sites \nin 40 States for an extended period of time or do we want to get on \nwith the job of collecting it and putting it in one permanent \nrepository?\n  Listening to the debate, I am sensitive to the difficulties \nassociated with the decision that was made at a time when we had a \nDemocratic chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, my \ngood friend, Senator Bennett Johnston. This has been a tough vote for \nmy colleagues from Nevada. I recall a Republican Senator who probably \nlost the election in his State. He fought valiantly against putting the \nwaste there. But, as I have identified time and time again, nobody \nwants the waste. That is the first premise with which you enter into \nthis discussion. But you have to put it somewhere because it will not \nstay up in the air. As a consequence, we find ourselves still debating \nthe issue.\n  At the hearing we had in the Energy Committee some time ago, the \nstatement was made by our colleagues that regardless of the science, \nthey would have to oppose the selection of a site in Nevada. Let's face \nit; that is a tough set of circumstances. But we have a job to do \nbecause we have to put it somewhere.\n  I do not want to oversimplify it. My friend said the bill is a lemon; \nit is ugly. I do not dispute that. But Nevada has been selected for the \npermanent repository, assuming it can be licensed. That is the hard \nfact. It might not be pretty. I guess I would say that we have, really, \nno other alternative because it is critical that we maintain a nuclear \npower industry in this country.\n  We have had a conversation about removing the take title. It has been \nremoved. I know that disturbs my good friend and ranking member from \nthe State of New Mexico. Secretary Richardson, the Secretary of Energy, \nraised this issue. I have held it in the legislation until the very \nend. But it became obvious that the administration could not deliver on \ntheir promises, that they could reassure the States that this was not \njust another ruse or another broken promise. And the broken promises \nobviously go back to 1998 when the Federal Government did not deliver \non its contractual commitments to take the waste. The administration \nsimply could not assure the States that they would not become some 40 \nrepositories, which is what they are now.\n  I know the Secretary of Energy did the best he could, but it simply \ncould not be done. So it is quite natural these States would say: Wait \na minute, the Federal Government has not performed on its contractual \ncommitment. Now it wants to take title in our State, without giving us \nthe assurance it is going to be moved. As a consequence, as my \ncolleagues know, those States were represented in the letter I \nintroduced into the Record from six States claiming they would urge \ntheir representatives in the Senate not to support legislation unless \nthe take title was removed.\n  I do not fault the Secretary of Energy. But I think it is fair to say \nthe administration has not had its act together for one reason or \nanother. Maybe it is to accommodate my friends from Nevada, but, \nnevertheless, it has not been resolved.\n\n  I tried my best. I am willing to revisit this in the future if the \nadministration can follow through with some type of commitment. But I \nthink it is unfair for the administration to criticize legislation \nbecause of their failure to follow through on their commitment. That is \nwhere we are on this.\n  We have heard suggestions from our friends from Nevada that putting \nthe issuance of a radiation standard off is politicizing the process. \nWe can point fingers around here because this is a political body. But \nif we look at the facts, the opposite is probably true.\n  The administration chose to abandon sound science and to inject \npolitics into the standard-setting as part of its opposition to the use \nof nuclear power. Under the law, the Energy Policy Act, the EPA was to \nfollow the guidelines set by the National Academy of Sciences. The \nNational Academy is not an appointed body. Its membership is elected, \nbased on professional scientific background, by the other scientists. \nThe National Academy called for ``all pathways'' as a standard.\n  EPA chose to go outside that guideline and threatened to create a \nseparate groundwater standard in addition to the ``all pathways.'' I \nguess the only reason was to frustrate the development of the \nrepository. They ignored science and yet injected politics. If \nanything, I think my amendment will remove politics from the process, \nand that is my objective.\n  Talking about whether or not this is environmental legislation, the \nSenator said environmental groups oppose this legislation and the \nLeague of Conservation Voters is watching every one of us. Think about \nthat. Here is an environmental agency that is genuinely concerned about \nthe safety, health, and welfare of people regarding issues it\n\n[[Page S531]]\n\nhas every right to be involved in. But what is its objective? Is the \nobjective to kill the nuclear power industry in this country? Is that \nthe true objective? I wonder. Because maybe the League of Conservation \nVoters, as they indicate their opposition to this legislation, \nindicating they are watching, thinks having spent fuel spread around \nthis country at 80 sites in 40 States is a good idea.\n  I do not think so and I do not think the majority of Senators think \nso. Maybe they think shutting down 20 percent of our generating \ncapacity is a good idea, when they do not come up with any alternative. \nWhat do they want us to do? Maybe they will ignore that we will have to \nreplace that capacity with fossil fuel-fired plants. Is that what they \nwant? They do not have to take the responsibility that you and I do, to \ncome up with and address an alternative. It is very appropriate that \nthey criticize, but I wonder where they are going. Are they really \ngoing to shut down the nuclear power industry? They do not say that.\n  Maybe they do not care about the cost to the taxpayers, the elderly, \nthe poor, when we have to replace that capacity at the taxpayers' \nexpense--the ratepayers' expense.\n  Maybe they do not have a better use for the $80 billion, or whatever \nit is, in liability we are facing as a consequence of this delay. They \nhave a responsibility to come up with answers, and they do not accept \nthat responsibility. As a consequence, I find fault with their logic as \nwell as their objective.\n  Maybe they simply do not care. Maybe they do not care about human \nhealth and safety or the environment or the cost and the impact on the \ntaxpayers, the poor or the elderly, because they want to pursue their \nown agenda. Is that a political agenda? I think it is. It is a \npolitical agenda against nuclear power.\n  This is a major environmental bill, and if you are not for the \nenvironment in moving this quantity of high-level nuclear fuel to one \nsite, how in the world can you suggest in any manner or form that you \nare for the environment by leaving it at these sites? It does not \nbelong there. The sites were not designed for it. It is contrary to the \nhealth and welfare of the public.\n  What we have here is a progressive bill to address the problem. I say \nto those who receive threats or notification on the merits of the \nenvironmental aspect that this is not a good environmental bill, this \nis an environmental bill that addresses and solves the problem.\n  I conclude my remarks--since we are beginning to get statements from \nvarious groups that either oppose or support the bill--by asking \nunanimous consent that a letter dated February 8 from the International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Department of \n           Government Affairs,\n                                 February 8, 2000, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The International Brotherhood of Teamsters \n     urges your support for S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \n     of 1999. Passage of this legislation is crucial to solving \n     the ongoing problem of safe storage of spent nuclear fuel.\n       Thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel are stored onsite \n     at nuclear plants in approximately 110 temporary storage \n     facilities in communities across the nation. No one disagrees \n     that nuclear waste belongs in a single safe repository far \n     removed from population centers. Yucca Mountain, located on \n     the Nevada Test Site, which S. 1287 designates as the site, \n     is just such a facility.\n       This legislation directs the Department of Energy to \n     develop and operate a simple, safe construction plan for \n     Yucca Mountain. The plan includes development of a safe \n     transportation system from nuclear power plants to the site. \n     We anticipate that this could support more than 10,000 \n     Teamster jobs.\n       To ensure the safe and responsible handling of all phases \n     of construction and management of the facility, as well as \n     the transfer of waste to the facility, S. 1287 provides \n     extensive training to all workers involved in the \n     transportation of used fuel as well as to emergency response \n     personnel. Specifically, the legislation requires the \n     Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor and the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop an appropriate \n     training standard, and goes the extra mile of ensuring that \n     employers possess evidence of meeting that training standard \n     before workers are permitted to remove or transport nuclear \n     waste.\n       In addition, the legislation provides grants to \n     organizations like the Teamsters Union to train workers who \n     transport spent nuclear fuel. These training programs ensure \n     that the high standard of safety that has been demonstrated \n     in nearly 3,000 shipments of used nuclear fuel in the United \n     States since 1964 will continue. The fact is that there has \n     never been any human injury or environmental damage in the \n     transportation of nuclear waste, and none of the sturdy \n     nuclear fuel shipping containers has ever been breached.\n       Finally, the legislation supports programs to enhance road \n     and vehicle maintenance and inspection efforts, all of which \n     contribute to continued safe transportation of high-level \n     radioactive materials.\n       For these reasons, the Teamster Union believes that S. 1287 \n     is a well-reasoned, balanced approach to solving the on-going \n     continuously growing problem of nuclear waste. We urge you to \n     support it as it moves to the Senate floor.\n       Should you have any questions or need additional \n     information, please contact Jennifer Esposito or me at 202/\n     624-8741.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael E. Mathis,\n                                     Director, Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in paragraph 2, it states:\n\n       No one disagrees that nuclear waste belongs in a single \n     safe repository far removed from the population centers. \n     Yucca Mountain, located on the Nevada Test Site, which S. \n     1287 designates as the site, is just such a facility.\n\n  On page 2:\n\n       The fact is that there has never been any human injury or \n     environmental damage in the transportation of nuclear waste. \n     . . .\n\n  In the last paragraph:\n\n       For these reasons, the Teamster Union believes S. 1287 is a \n     well-reasoned, balanced approach to solving an on-going, \n     continuously growing problem of nuclear waste. We urge you to \n     support it as it moves to the Senate floor.\n\n  It is signed Michael E. Mathis, Director of Government Affairs.\n  As we wind down this debate, I again urge we all focus on the reality \nof whether we want to kill the nuclear industry in this country, if \nthat is the objective, or whether we want to get on with addressing the \nresponsibility which we have, which is to address what we are going to \ndo with this high-level waste.\n  Since we have been committed at the expense of some $6 billion at \nYucca Mountain, since we have in this legislation addressed the \nappropriate role of the Environmental Protection Agency as having the \nfinal say on the determination of what the radiation standards should \nbe, since we have addressed the transportation system by leaving it up \nto the States to designate how and where and under what terms and \nconditions, the waste will move out of the States where it presently \nresides. We have met the challenge we have been charged to address. As \na consequence, we should recognize that it is time to finally put this \nmatter behind us and not contribute additional expense to the American \ntaxpayers or the ratepayers who have been paying into this fund for the \nlast several years.\n  I save the remainder of my remarks for the remaining time tomorrow \nwhere I understand the proponents and opponents have an hour equally \ndivided beginning at 10 o'clock, with a vote scheduled at 11.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor for comments by my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee \nfor his remarks. I will make a few remarks this afternoon. There will \nbe more in the morning. I will be back on the floor in the morning to \nexpress it in more detail.\n  First of all, for anybody who is watching this debate and trying to \nunderstand what is happening, it is not easy to understand because we \nhave a complicated set of procedures we have followed around here to \nget to this point.\n  Yesterday, I outlined my reasons for opposing the manager's amendment \nthat was being considered at that time. It was No. 2808. That was the \nmanager's amendment on which we voted to invoke cloture, or to bring \ndebate to a close.\n  I said at that time I believed the overall legislation, not that \nparticular amendment but the overall legislation, was very important \nand was necessary to solve particular problems we have with our nuclear \nwaste program, but that the particular provisions in that amendment \nthat was before us yesterday did not solve those problems and, in fact, \nthe particular language in that amendment created some additional\n\n[[Page S532]]\n\nproblems. That was why I could not support the language we were \nconsidering yesterday.\n  We have, of course, gone beyond that. We now have a new substitute \namendment which has many changes in it. It was my hope that when we got \nto this substitute, it would fix the problems and concerns I had. I \ncommend the chairman of the committee for a number of constructive \nimprovements he did make in this substitute. Unfortunately, though, my \nown view is that while the new substitute makes improvements, there are \nstill serious flaws and, more important than that even, there is \na major step backward, and that relates to the dropping of the take \ntitle provision. I will try to explain in more detail why I think the \ntake title provision is important to us.\n\n  Let me also parenthetically say, I can sympathize with the statement \nthe chairman makes about people who criticize and offer no alternative. \nLet me make it very clear, and I do not think this will be disputed by \nthe chairman or anyone else, from the beginning of this process, I have \nnot only expressed concerns, I have offered alternative language. In \nfact, when we were considering this bill in committee, I offered a \ncomplete substitute that was voted on by the committee and was defeated \nat that time but got quite a few votes. It is not as though we have \nrefused to offer alternatives. We have offered alternatives. They have \nnot been acceptable. I understand that. Each Senator votes their best \njudgment, and their best judgment was that the alternatives were not \nimprovements. I disagree strongly with that judgment.\n  This new substitute on which we are getting ready to vote tomorrow \nmorning--and we will, as I said before, have time to speak about it \ntomorrow morning; we will have an hour equally divided--eliminates the \nso-called take title provision which was the core of the committee-\nreported bill and was the focus of our efforts to reach a consensus \nwith the administration.\n  Let me explain a little bit about what this take title provision is \nbecause that is probably not understood well by a lot of folks who have \nnot spent a lot of time on this subject.\n  The Federal Government, particularly the Department of Energy, was \nobligated to actually take delivery of this nuclear waste that had been \ndeveloped at these nuclear powerplants around the country by January \n31, 1998. We had written that into the law. We said that is an \nobligation, the Department of Energy has to do it, and the Department \nof Energy entered into contracts with the various utilities around the \ncountry.\n  The map is not up right now, but every place you saw a dot on that \nmap, there is a utility, and they have entered into contracts with the \nDepartment of Energy where the Department of Energy says: We will \naccept your waste at a particular time, and we will move it to a \npermanent repository.\n  We in Congress were way too optimistic, and the Department of Energy \nwas too optimistic about how quickly they could do all this. They \nentered into these contracts. When January 31, 1998, came, the \nDepartment of Energy had no place to put this waste, so they defaulted \non at least the first of those contracts. The contracts become due. The \nobligation of the Department of Energy to pick up that waste and move \nit to a site becomes due each year to more and more utilities as we \nmove forward.\n\n  So today the reality is we have a bunch of lawsuits, lawsuits in the \nCourt of Claims, by utilities against the Department of Energy, saying: \nYou owe us money; you are continuing to be in default; you should have \npicked this waste up; you have not picked the waste up; for every day \nyou don't pick the waste up, you owe us some more money.\n  That is the situation.\n  The take title provision was a provision we worked out with Senator \nMurkowski, with the Department of Energy, and with my staff to solve \nthat problem. Basically, what it said was that we would give authority \nto the Department of Energy to enter into a contract--if a utility \nwanted to--whereby that utility would give up title to the waste, the \nDepartment of Energy would take title to the waste, and that would be \ndone as part of a settlement of the litigation that is presently \npending or that would otherwise be filed.\n  We provided a particular length of time in which utilities would have \nto decide whether they wanted to enter into negotiations to do this, \nwhether they wanted to take advantage of this. There was nothing \nmandated. But it was a way out of this morass of litigation in which \nthe Department of Energy now finds itself.\n  This bill we are going to vote on at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning \neliminates that way out. That way out was a main reason for actually \nconsidering this bill. It was the core reason our committee reported \nthe bill in the first place. It was the core reason I thought it was \nimportant for us to go ahead and pass the legislation.\n  The new substitute still does preserve the Department of Energy's \nauthority to settle lawsuits arising from its failure to meet its \ncontractual obligations to begin accepting this waste in 1998, by \nreducing the fees they pay or providing other forms of financial \nrelief. That is still in the bill. But the Department already has that \nauthority. We did not need to legislate that authority again. I think \nit is clear to anybody who will study it for a little bit, it is not an \nobjectionable part of the bill but it is an unnecessary part of the \nbill.\n  What the Department lacks, and what we were trying to provide in the \nlegislation, and what would benefit the country, the taxpayers, the \nutilities--particularly the taxpayers, because the taxpayers ultimately \nare going to wind up footing the cost of the judgments, whatever \njudgments are imposed on the Federal Government--but what clearly would \nbenefit all of these groups and individuals I have talked about here is \nfor the Department to take title to the utilities' waste and assume \nfinancial and legal liability for management pending the completion of \nthe repository.\n  The truth is, Yucca Mountain is being characterized. It is not being \ndone as quickly as we would like because we have not provided all the \nfunds necessary to do it on a timely basis, but it is being \ncharacterized. If it passes muster in the final analysis, if it can \nmeet the standards the Environmental Protection Agency establishes, and \nthen is going to be used, it is still going to be 8 or 10 years from \nnow before waste will actually be moved to that site. That is just the \nreality. It is not a question of whether you like it or dislike it; \nthat is just the reality.\n  What we were trying to say is, during these 8 or 10 years, there is \nno reason why the Federal Government's liability for not moving that \nwaste beginning in 1998 should continue to grow and to accrue. The new \nsubstitute drops that provision. The new substitute eliminates this way \nout for the Department of Energy, for the utilities, and, more \nimportantly than anything, for the American taxpayers.\n  There are other provisions where this new substitute we will vote on \ntomorrow, like the original one, creates problems that would limit the \nability of the Department of Energy's waste program to succeed. Let me \nmention a few.\n  The substitute imposes deadlines on the Department of Energy, saying \nthe Department must ship spent fuel to Nevada on a schedule that the \nDepartment of Energy says they cannot meet.\n  I know that is what we did before. We set a deadline. At that time, \nthe Department of Energy did not say they could not meet it. But at any \nrate, we set a deadline they did not meet and now we have litigation.\n  If we pass this bill, we are in danger of setting another deadline or \nanother series of deadlines which this time the Department says they \ncannot meet--of course, prompting a lot of new litigation as a result \nof that. So it holds the Government and the taxpayers liable if the \nDepartment of Energy misses those deadlines.\n  There are also some broader issues affecting the program we have been \nunable to address in this bill that I think are important to consider. \nOne example is Northern States Power's problem. This gets a little bit \narcane, but I do not think too arcane.\n  Under Minnesota law, Northern States Power will have to shut down the \nPrairie Island nuclear powerplant in January of 2007 if the Department \nof Energy has not picked up Prairie Island's waste by that date. That \nis Minnesota law I just paraphrased for you. The manager's substitute \ncould require\n\n[[Page S533]]\n\nthe Department to enter into a ``backup'' storage contract with \nNorthern States Power to take the Prairie Island waste to Yucca \nMountain so that Prairie Island can keep operating. The problem is, the \nDepartment of Energy will not be able to honor that contract by January \nof 2007, so the provision does not prevent the reactor from shutting \ndown. The truth is, we have put in a requirement that the Department of \nEnergy cannot meet.\n\n  There are also funding problems besetting our nuclear waste program. \nAs I said yesterday, I think this is one of the most critical problems \nfacing the Yucca Mountain program. The substitute does nothing to make \nthe balances in the nuclear waste fund more readily available or even \nto make deferred payments for waste generated before 1983, the so-\ncalled one-time fee under current law available to the program. I \nbelieve this latter provision would not score under our budget rules \nsince it is currently outside the 10-year scoring window. That is \npretty arcane, but it is an important provision.\n  By dropping the take title provision and by failing to make this \nsimple budget adjustment, in my view, the manager's substitute fails to \ncapture and apply this important source of funds to the program when it \nis urgently needed.\n  None of us is ever 100-percent satisfied with any vote we cast here \nin the Senate. We all have to compromise, to give things away, to \nsettle for less than a perfect bill. Senator Murkowski has certainly \nshown his willingness to do that. I, too, believe I have done that and \nshown my willingness to make concessions on key issues--issues such as \nfunding, on capping the nuclear waste fee, on potentially shifting the \nfunding burden to taxpayers, conveying 76,000 acres of Federal lands to \nNevada localities. These are all things in the bill that I have not \nthought were really appropriate, but I am certainly willing to \ncompromise on them in order to reach agreement.\n  But as I look at the new amended bill on which we are going to vote \ntomorrow, and I try to weigh it in relation to the Nation and the \ntaxpayers--what the Nation and the taxpayers of the country are getting \nversus what they are giving up--I find that the balance that is \nrequired for me to support the end result is not there. Legislators, as \ndoctors, need to obey the rule: First do no harm. When I look at the \nsubstitute on which we are going to vote tomorrow, to my mind, it does \nmore harm than good. Unfortunately, as a result, I will be compelled to \nvote against it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, in order to \nattempt to advance the process, for the benefit of everybody----\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would withhold for me to make a brief \nstatement, while the Senator from New Mexico is on the floor, I would \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Go ahead.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  While the Senator from New Mexico is here, I want to say I personally \nappreciate his hours of time, and the tens of hours his staff has \nspent--probably hundreds of hours--on this legislation. I am grateful \nto the Senator for the work he has put into this legislation and for \nthe fairness he has demonstrated to the chairman of the committee and \nthe Senators from Nevada. The fact that Senator Bingaman has done \neverything within his power to get satisfactory legislation passed \nshould be spread throughout the Record. That does not mean the Senators \nfrom Nevada would be happy with it, perhaps, but I think he has tried \nto work on something that would bring a general consensus in this \nSenate and would satisfy the administration.\n  The Senator worked very hard to do that, and I commend and applaud \nhis legislative abilities and constant fairness in this regard, keeping \nus informed, keeping the majority informed. I think it bodes well for \nthe Senate to have the Senator as the ranking member and, hopefully, in \nthe not-too-distant future, chairman of this very important committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I shall not further debate the issue \ntoday.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to compliment Senator Murkowski's \nleadership on the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act. I appreciate his \nefforts to enable progress on the Nation's need for concrete action on \nspent nuclear fuel.\n  I find it amazing how fear of anything in this country with \n``nuclear'' in its title, like ``nuclear waste,'' seems to paralyze our \nability to act decisively. Nuclear issues are immediately faced with \nimmense political challenges.\n  There are many great examples of how nuclear technologies impact our \ndaily lives. Yet few of our citizens know enough about the benefits \nwe've gained from harnessing the nucleus to support actions focused on \nreducing the remaining risks.\n  Just one example that should be better understood and appreciated \ninvolves our nuclear navy. Their experience has important lessons for \nbetter understanding of these technologies.\n  The Nautilus, our first nuclear powered submarine, was launched in \n1954. Since then, the Navy has launched over 200 nuclear powered ships, \nand about 85 are currently in operation. Recently, the Navy was \noperating slightly over 100 reactors, about the same number as those \noperating in civilian power stations across the country.\n  The Navy's safety record is exemplary. Our nuclear ships are welcomed \ninto over 150 ports in over 50 countries. A 1999 review of their safety \nrecord was conducted by the General Accounting Office. That report \nstated:\n\n       No significant accident--one resulting in fuel \n     degradation--has ever occurred.\n\n  For an Office like GAO, that identifies and publicizes problems with \ngovernment programs, that's a pretty impressive statement!\n  Our nuclear powered ships have traveled over 117 million miles \nwithout serious incidents. Further, the Navy has commissioned 33 new \nreactors in the 1990s, that puts them ahead of civilian power by a \nscore of 33 to zero. And Navy reactors have more than twice the \noperational hours of our civilian systems.\n  The nuclear navy story is a great American success story, one that is \ncompletely enabled by appropriate and careful use of nuclear power. \nIt's contributed to the freedoms we so cherish.\n  Nuclear energy is another great American success story. It now \nsupplies about 20 percent of our nation's electricity, it is not a \nsupply that we can afford to lose. It's done it without release of \ngreenhouse gases, with a superlative safety record over the last \ndecade. The efficiency of nuclear plants has risen consistently and \ntheir operating costs are among the lowest of all energy sources.\n  I have repeatedly emphasized that the United States must maintain \nnuclear energy as a viable option for future energy requirements. And \nwithout some near-term waste solution, like interim storage or an early \nreceipt facility, we are killing this option. We may be depriving \nfuture generations of a reliable power source that they may desperately \nneed.\n  There is no excuse for the years that the issue of nuclear waste has \nbeen with us. Near-term credible solutions are not technically \ndifficult. We absolutely must progress towards early receipt of spent \nfuel at a central location, at least faster than the 2010 estimates for \nopening Yucca Mountain that we now face or risk losing nuclear power in \nthis country.\n  Senator Murkowski's bill is a significant step toward breaking the \ndeadlock which continues to threaten the future of nuclear energy in \nthe U.S. I appreciate that he made some very tough decisions in \ncrafting this bill that blends ideas from many sources to seek \ncompromise in this difficult area.\n  One concession involves tying the issuance of a license for the \n``early receipt facility'' to construction authorization for the \npermanent repository. I'd much prefer that we simply moved ahead with \ninterim storage. An interim storage facility can proceed on its own \nmerits, quite independent of decisions surrounding a permanent \nrepository. Such an interim storage facility could be operational well \nbefore the ``early receipt facility'' authorized in this Act.\n  There are absolutely no technical issues associated with interim \nstorage in dry casks, other countries certainly use it. Nevertheless, \nin the interests of seeking a compromise on this issue, I\n\n[[Page S534]]\n\nwill support this Act's approach with the early receipt facility.\n  I appreciate that Senator Murkowski has included Title III in the new \nbill with my proposal to create a new DOE Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel \nResearch. This new Office would organize a research program to explore \nnew, improved national strategies for spent nuclear fuel.\n  Spent fuel has immense energy potential--that we are simply tossing \naway with our focus only on a permanent repository. We could be \nrecycling that spent fuel back into civilian fuel and extracting \nadditional energy. We could follow the examples of France, the U.K., \nand Japan in reprocessing the fuel to not only extract more energy, but \nalso to reduce the volume and toxicity of the final waste forms.\n  Now I am well aware that reprocessing is not viewed as economically \ndesirable now, because of today's very low uranium prices. Furthermore, \nit must only be done with careful attention to proliferation issues. \nBut I submit that the U.S. should be prepared for a future evaluation \nthat may determine that we are too hasty today to treat this spent fuel \nas waste, and that instead we should have been viewing it as an energy \nresource for future generations.\n  We do not have the knowledge today to make that decision. Title III \nestablishes a research program to evaluate options to provide real data \nfor such a future decision.\n  This research program would have other benefits. We may want to \nreduce the toxicity of materials in any repository to address public \nconcerns. Or we may find we need another repository in the future, and \nwant to incorporate advanced technologies into the final waste products \nat that time. We could, for example, decide that we want to maximize \nthe storage potential of a future repository, and that would require \nsome treatment of the spent fuel before final disposition.\n  Title III requires that a range of advanced approaches for spent fuel \nbe studied with the new Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research. As we do \nthis, I will encourage the Department to seek international \ncooperation. I know, based on personal contacts, that France, Russia, \nand Japan are eager to join with us in an international study of spent \nfuel options.\n  Title III requires that we focus on research programs that minimize \nproliferation and health risks from the spent fuel. And it requires \nthat we study the economic implications of each technology.\n  With Title III, the United States will be prepared, some years in the \nfuture, to make the most intelligent decision regarding the future of \nnuclear energy as one of our major power sources. Maybe at that time, \nwe'll have other better energy alternatives and decide that we can move \naway from nuclear power. Or we may find that we need nuclear energy to \ncontinue and even expand its current contribution to our nation's power \ngrid. In any case, this research will provide the framework to guide \nCongress in these future decisions.\n  I want to specifically discuss one of the compromises that Senator \nMurkowski has developed in his Manager's Amendment. In my view, his \nlargest compromise involves the choice between the Environmental \nProtection Agency or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to set the \nradiation-protection standards for Yucca Mountain and for the ``early \nrelease facility.''\n  The NRC has the technical expertise to set these standards. \nFurthermore, the NRC is a non-political organization, in sharp contrast \nto the political nature of the EPA. We need unbiased technical \nknowledge in setting these standards, there should be no place for \npolitics at all. The EPA has proposed a draft standard already, that \nhas been widely criticized for its inconsistency and lack of scientific \nrigor--events that do not enhance their credibility for this role.\n  I appreciate, however, the care that Senator Murkowski has \ndemonstrated in providing the ultimate authority to the EPA. His new \nlanguage requires both the NRC and the National Academy of Sciences to \ncomment on the EPA's draft standard. And he provides a period of time, \nuntil mid-2001, for the EPA to assess concerns with their standard and \nissue a valid standard.\n  These additions have the effect of providing a strong role for both \nthe NRC and NAS to share their scientific knowledge with the EPA and \nhelp guide the EPA toward a credible standard.\n  The NRC should be complimented for their courageous stand against the \nEPA in this issue. Their issuance of a scientifically appropriate \nstandard stands in stark contrast to the first effort from the EPA. \nThanks to the actions of the NRC, the EPA can be guided toward \nreasonable standards.\n  Certainly my preference is to have the NRC issue the final standard. \nBut I appreciate the effort that Senator Murkowski has expended in \nseeking compromise in this difficult area.\n  By following the procedures in the Manager's Amendment, we can allow \nthe EPA to set the final standard, guided by the inputs from the NRC \nand NAS. Thus, I will support the Manager's Amendment.\n  I thank Senator Murkowski for his superb leadership in preparing this \nnew act. We need to pass this Manager's Amendment with a veto-proof \nmajority, to ensure that we finally attain some movement in the \nnation's ability to deal with high level nuclear waste.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/09/senate-section/article/S534-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S534-S535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that there \nbe a period for the transaction of routine morning business with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, during today's debate on the nuclear \nwaste legislation, I want to take my first opportunity to Call the \nBankroll in the new year.\n  As we all know, nuclear waste has been a very contentious issue in \npast years.\n  I'm not here today to recap the arguments on either side, but instead \nto offer the public and my colleagues a picture of the money that has \nbeen spent by interests on both sides of the issue.\n  Of course the Nuclear Energy Institute is the chief lobbyist on \nbehalf of companies that operate nuclear power plants in the U.S., and \nhas led the fight for the nuclear waste legislation, in its various \nforms, that is now before us.\n  NEI gave more than $135,000 in soft money to the parties and more \nthan $70,000 in PAC money to candidates in the 1998 election cycle.\n  In addition to NEI, a number of utilities which operate nuclear \nplants were also significant PAC and soft money donors in the '98 \ncycle, including:\n  Commonwealth Edison, which gave $110,000 in soft money and more than \n$106,000 in PAC money, and Florida Power and Light, which gave nearly \n$300,000 in soft money to the parties and more than $182,000 in PAC \nmoney to candidates.\n  Many of these donors didn't waste any time before donating in the \ncurrent cycle either--NEI already reported donating more than $66,000 \nin soft money, and Commonwealth Edison already reported $90,000 in soft \nmoney donations in 1999.\n  On the other side of this fight is a coalition of environmental \ngroups that has opposed this bill in its various forms, writing to \nmembers of the Senate last September to urge us to protect our country \nand our environment by voting against the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAmendments Act of 1999.\n  Among these groups is the Sierra Club, which gave more than $236,000 \nin PAC money to candidates in the '98 cycle, and Friends of the Earth, \nwhich gave just under $4,000 during that same period.\n  I also think it's important here to make a larger point that reaches \nwell beyond the nuclear waste debate--that interests can exercise their \nclout not just through PAC and soft money donations but through yet \nanother loophole in the law--phony issue ads.\n  Now it is very difficult to determine how much money is spent on \nphony issue ads. They are not reported under current law, and they \nshould be. Nonetheless, some estimates have been made by news \norganizations and independent analysts. The Sierra Club spent an \nestimated $1.5 million on issue ads in the '98 election cycle, and the \nNuclear Energy Institute reportedly spent $600,000 on issue ads in just \ntwo Senate races in the last cycle.\n  Now I can't say that even this is a complete picture of all the \ninterests\n\n[[Page S535]]\n\nlobbying on this bill, but it does give my colleagues and the public \nsome idea of what interests are trying to influence the passage--or the \ndefeat--of this bill, and a picture of the huge sums of money they are \nusing to pursue their goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/09/senate-section/article/S535-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNITION OF SEATTLE'S LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I had the \npleasure--or displeasure--of being in Seattle during the now infamous \nWorld Trade Organization meeting last fall, shortly after Congress \nadjourned for the year. The images broadcast via the airwaves portrayed \na negative image of Seattle and a narrow view of the debate in this \ncountry surrounding free trade. The spectacle of the ``Battle in \nSeattle'' that most of us saw on the evening news also did not \naccurately represent the full experience that law enforcement officers \non the street endured. These officers suffered through appalling work \nconditions largely attributable to poor planning by public officials \nresponsible for such preparation. In spite of these conditions, the \nincidents of confrontation and violence were kept to a surprising \nminimum. These fine men and women in law enforcement deserve \nrecognition for their vigilance, their restraint, and their dedication.\n  Officers, wearing 60-70 pounds of tear gas drenched equipment, were \nforced to stand the line with minimal rest, no bathroom facilities, and \nlittle food--for shifts of 16 to 17 hours. Given the fact that officers \nendured a continual barrage of insults and projectiles from out-of-\ncontrol protestors, I am surprised that there were not more instances \nwhere frustration and exhaustion temporarily superceded discipline and \ntraining. It is a credit to the men and women of the Seattle Police \nDepartment, the King County Sheriff's Office, the Washington State \nPatrol, and the many officers from other localities, that their \nrestraint kept a bad situation from becoming much, much worse.\n  As with any confrontational event involving thousands of people, \nmistakes were made by both sides. It is clear, however, that the law \nenforcement officers involved with the WTO in Seattle overwhelmingly \nexhibited professionalism and conduct above and beyond the call of \nduty--for that they should be commended. To the officers who, against \ngreat odds, did everything they could to preserve peace and order, I \noffer my sincere thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/09/senate-section/article/S535-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to reform the process by which the Office of the \nPardon Attorney investigates and reviews potential exercises of \nexecutive clemency; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              The Pardon Attorney Reform and Integrity Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nhelp restore public confidence in the Department of Justice by \nreforming the way that the Office of Pardon Attorney investigates \ncandidates for executive clemency. This bill, the Hatch-Nickles-Abraham \nPardon Attorney Reform and Integrity Act, which is co-sponsored by \nSenators Lott, Thurmond, Kyl, Ashcroft, Sessions, Smith of New \nHampshire, and Coverdell, addresses the problems that led to the \nwidespread public outrage at the Department of Justice's role in \nPresident Clinton's decision last September to release 11 Puerto Rican \nnationalist terrorists from prison.\n  The beneficiaries of President Clinton's grant of clemency were \nconvicted terrorists who belong to violent Puerto Rican independence \ngroups called the FALN and Los Macheteros. They were in prison for a \nseditious conspiracy that included the planting of over 130 bombs in \npublic places in the United States, including shopping malls and \nrestaurants. That bombing spree--which killed several people, injured \nmany others and caused vast property damage--remains the most prolific \nterrorist campaign within our borders in United States history.\n  The Judiciary Committee has thoroughly investigated the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding the decision to release those terrorists from \nprison. We read thousands of documents produced by the Department of \nJustice and the White House. We interviewed law enforcement officials \nknowledgeable about the FALN and Los Macheteros organizations. We spoke \nto victims, and we held two hearings on the many issues raised by the \ngrant of clemency. Our investigation has led me to a very troubling \nconclusion: the Justice Department ignored its own rules for handling \nclemency matters, exercised very poor judgment in ignoring the opinions \nof law enforcement and victims, and sacrificed its integrity by bowing \nto political pressure to modify its original recommendation against \nclemency.\n  I do not come to this conclusion lightly. I base it on an examination \nof the facts. The facts show that the clemency recipients were never \nasked for information relevant to open investigations or the \napprehension of fugitives--despite the fact that one of their co-\ndefendants, Victor Gerena, is on the FBI's ``ten most wanted'' list. \nMany of the killings associated with the FALN bombings, including the \ninfamous Fraunces Tavern bombing, remain unsolved. The failure to ask \nfor such information from the clemency recipients, several of whom held \nleadership positions in the FALN, means that the rest of the \nperpetrators of those crimes may never be brought to justice. My \nlegislation will require the Justice Department to notify law \nenforcement of pending clemency requests, and to assess whether a \nproposed clemency recipient could have information on open \ninvestigations and fugitives.\n  Our investigation also revealed that the White House and the Justice \nDepartment ignored the many victims of FALN crimes, even while senior \nofficials were holding numerous meetings with the terrorists' advocates \nfor clemency. While top government officials actually gave strategic \nadvice to the terrorists, no one lifted a finger to find, interview, or \neven notify the victims about the pending clemency request. My \nlegislation would help ensure that the Justice Department remembers who \nit is supposed to be working for by requiring it to notify and seek \ninput from victims.\n  Finally, a disturbing connection has come to light between the FALN, \nLos Macheteros and the Cuban government.\n\n[[Page S539]]\n\nJorge Masetti, a former Cuban intelligence agent, has stated that Cuba \nhelped Los Macheteros to plan and execute the $7.1 million Wells Fargo \nrobbery--the biggest cash heist in US history--by providing funding, \ntraining and assistance in smuggling the money out of the country. Some \nsources estimate that 4 million dollars from the robbery ended up in \nCuba. We don't know whether the Pardon Attorney knew of or told the \nPresident about this Cuban connection because the Pardon Attorney \ncurrently has no obligation to contact intelligence agencies for \ninformation relevant to proposed grants of executive clemency. My \nlegislation would require the Justice Department to solicit from law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies necessary information concerning \nthe nature of the threat posed by potential clemency recipients so that \nthe Pardon Attorney can properly advise the President whether a \nparticular grant of clemency will impact future crime or terrorism.\n  Before describing how this bill works, I want to explain how the \nOffice of Pardon Attorney currently operates. The job of the Office of \nPardon Attorney is not complicated: it is to investigate potential \ngrants of clemency and, in appropriate cases, to produce a report and \nrecommendations to the President. Ordinarily, this work begins when the \noffice receives a petition from a prisoner or someone who has already \ncompleted a prison sentence. The Department's rules require that an \nindividual seeking clemency submit such a petition to the Pardon \nAttorney. After receiving a petition, the Pardon Attorney makes an \ninitial determination of whether the request has enough merit to \nwarrant further investigation. If so, the Pardon Attorney researches \nthe potential clemency recipient and prepares a report analyzing the \ninformation in light of the grounds for granting clemency. As described \nby the United States Attorneys' Manual, those grounds ``have \ntraditionally included disparity or undue severity of sentence, \ncritical illness or old age, and meritorious service rendered to the \ngovernment by the petitioner.''\n  It is to be expected that the Administration and the Department of \nJustice Office of Legal Counsel (``OLC'') would question the \nconstitutionality of this bill by asserting an expansive view of \nexecutive power. That is their nature. This is the same Administration \nand Department that resisted any oversight of the FALN clemency \ndecision. The OLC and the Department have a history of taking a liberal \nview of laws and privileges that would shield the President from \nscrutiny. This is evidenced by the Department's sound defeats on \nassertions of government attorney-client privilege and its ill-fated \nattempt to create a protective function privilege out of whole cloth. \nAnyone examining the merits of the OLC's attacks against this bill, \ntherefore, must acknowledge that the Administration and the Department \nhave a track record of overstating executive power.\n  With that background, let me clarify that the Pardon Attorney Reform \nand Integrity Act was carefully drafted to avoid offending the \nseparation of powers. The Act does not attempt to dictate how the \nPresident uses the pardon power. Far from it. The Constitution gives \nthat power to the President, and this bill does not restrict it in any \nway. This bill affects only those cases where the President delegates \nthe responsibility to investigate a particular potential grant of \nclemency. Nothing in the bill requires the President to ask the Pardon \nAttorney for assistance or requires the Pardon Attorney to take any \nparticular position or recommend any particular outcome. It doesn't \neven require the Department to submit a report to the President, but \nsimply make it available. Furthermore, the bill does not require the \nPresident to read any report, consider any particular information, or \navail himself of any resource. The President will still be able to \ndisregard the Justice Department's reports, use another agency, ask \nanyone in the world for advice, or exercise the ``pardon power'' \nwithout anyone's counsel. Only if the President chooses to ask the \nJustice Department for assistance will the procedural requirements of \nthis bill apply--and they will apply only to the Justice Department, \nnot to the President.\n\n  The Act is consistent with the Supreme Court's opinions relating to \nthe pardon power. The Act neither ``change[s] the effect of . . . a \npardon'' as described in United States v. Kline, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128 \n(1872), nor will it ``modif[y], abridge[], or diminish[]'' the \nPresident's authority to grant clemency as discussed in Schick v. Reed, \n419 U.S. 256, 266 (1974). In fact, the Act will have no effect \nwhatsoever on the President's ability to exercise the pardon power as \nhe or she sees fit.\n  Moreover, the Supreme Court has recognized that Congress can \nlegislate in areas that touch upon the pardon power. In Carlesi v. New \nYork, 233 U.S. 51 (1914), the Court found that it was within the power \nof the legislative branch to determine what effect a pardon would have \non future criminal sentences. The Supreme Court has also acknowledged \nthat the pardon power has limits; the President cannot use that power \nas an excuse to wield power over departments that he or she otherwise \ncould not. In Knote v. United States, 95 U.S. 149 (1877), the Court \nheld that the pardon power does not give the President authority to \norder the treasury to refund money taken from a prisoner--even though \nthat prisoner had just been pardoned for the crime that gave rise to \nthe government's seizure of that money.\n  It is Congress, not the President, that has the authority--indeed, \nthe responsibility--to examine and legislate the manner in which the \nJustice Department performs its work. Congress created an ``attorney in \ncharge of pardons'' within the Department of Justice in 1891, and \nappropriated money for an ``attorney in charge of pardons'' in that \nsame year. To this day, the Office of the Pardon Attorney depends on \nfunds appropriated annually by the Congress. In the most recent \nappropriations legislation, the Congress appropriated $1.6 million for \nthe Pardon Attorney for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000. This \nCongressional involvement--creation and funding of the office--provides \na compelling basis for the Judiciary Committee's investigation and the \npresent legislation.\n  ``The power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in \nthe legislative process. That power is broad. It encompasses inquiries \nconcerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or \npossibly needed statutes.'' Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 187 \n(1957). The scope of this power ```is as penetrating and far-reaching \nas the potential power to enact and appropriate under the \nConstitution.''' Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund, 421 U.S. \n491, 504 n. 15 (1975) (quoting Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. \n190, 111 (1959)). The Supreme Court has also recognized ``the danger to \neffective and honest conduct of the Government if the legislative power \nto probe corruption in the Executive Branch were unduly hampered.'' \nWatkins, 354 U.S. at 194-95. Once having established its jurisdiction \nand authority, and the pertinence of the matter under inquiry to its \narea of authority, a committee's investigative purview is substantial \nand wide-ranging. Wilkinson v. United States, 365 U.S. 408-09 (1961).\n  Congress also has broad powers under the Constitution to ``make all \nLaws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution \nthe foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution \nin the Government of the United States, or in any Department of Officer \nthereof.'' The areas in which Congress may potentially legislate or \nappropriate are, by necessary implication, even broader. Thus, in \ndetermining whether Congress has jurisdiction to oversee and enact \nlegislation, deference should be accorded to Congress' decision.\n  Because of this legal history, the administration of the Department \nof Justice and its various components has long been considered an \nappropriate subject of Congressional oversight. Early this century, in \nMcGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 151 (1927), the Supreme Court \nendorsed Congress' authority to study ``charges of misfeasance and \nnonfeasance in the Department of Justice.'' In that case, which \ninvolved a challenge to Congress' inquiry into the DOJ's role during \nthe Teapot Dome scandal, the Court concluded that Congress had \nauthority to investigate ``whether [DOJ's] functions were being \nproperly discharged or were being neglected or misdirected, and \nparticularly whether the Attorney General and his assistants were \nperforming or neglecting their duties in\n\n[[Page S540]]\n\nrespect of the institution.'' Id. at 177. These precedents make clear \nthat the Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction to investigate the Pardon \nAttorney's role in the pardon process, and to enact legislation \nconcerning the way in which that office operates.\n  We have discussed this bill with the Department of Justice, and we \nhave reviewed the regulations the Department has proposed. The problems \nwith the Office of the Pardon Attorney, however, cannot be fixed by a \nmere change in department regulations. It has been six months since the \npublic outcry over the FALN clemency shined a spotlight on the Pardon \nAttorney's practices. Despite having half-a-year to reform itself, the \nDepartment has suggested only minimal changes in the way it does \nbusiness. In its draft regulations, the Department agrees that it \nshould ascertain the views of victims, but only in cases involving \n``crimes of violence.'' Victims of other crimes deserve the right to be \nheard, too. Victims of so-called identity theft, for example, have \ncompelling stories of the horror of being forced into bankruptcy to \navoid collections lawyers, losing their jobs due to issues related to \nwage garnishments, and trying to rebuild their lives without the \nability to obtain credit or sign an apartment lease. Victims of such \ncrimes also deserve to be heard. Similarly, the Department's proposed \nregulations acknowledge the need to determine whether releasing a \nparticular prisoner would pose a risk, but limit their focus to past \nvictims and ignore other possible targets including witnesses, \ninformants, prosecutors and court personnel. The Department's proposal \nalso fails to notify victims when it undertakes a clemency \ninvestigation, when it completes its report to the President, or when \nthe President makes a decision. Under the Department's scheme, victims \nmay still learn of a prisoner's release from prison by watching the \nevent on TV.\n  Equally important, the Department's suggested regulations ignore the \nDepartment's main job: to protect law-abiding people from criminal \nacts. The Department does not see a need to require the Pardon Attorney \nto talk to law enforcement officials about whether a particular person \ncould provide helpful information about criminal investigations or \nsearches for fugitives. Nor does the Department see the value of asking \nlaw enforcement whether a potential release from prison would pose a \nrisk to specific people other than victims or to a broader societal \ninterest such as enhancing a particular criminal organization or \ndecreasing the deterrent value of prison sentences. The Department's \nproposed regulations also ignore the importance of whether a potential \nclemency recipient has accepted responsibility for, or feels remorse \nover, criminal acts.\n  Even if the Department's proposed regulations were identical to this \nbill, moreover, those regulations could not overcome what is perhaps \nthe most important weakness of all: Regulations are not law. They do \nnot have the force of statutes, and they can be changed very easily. \nThe FALN case proves the need for a statute because the Attorney \nGeneral ignored even the current, weak regulations in the FALN matter. \nAlthough the Justice Department and the White House refuse to let \nanyone in Congress review the reports produced by the Pardon Attorney \nabout the FALN clemency, it is clear that the Pardon Attorney did not \nfollow the Justice Department regulations when analyzing the issues for \nthe President. For starters, the Pardon Attorney began investigating a \npotential grant of clemency for the FALN terrorists even though no \npersonal petitions for clemency had been filed. That's right--these \nterrorists had not asked for clemency prior to the Justice Department's \nefforts to free them. Indeed, no such petitions were ever filed. And \nthe absence of petitions was not a mere oversight: the FALN terrorists \nrefused to file such petitions because they do not recognize that their \ncriminal acts were wrongful or that the United States government had \nthe right to punish them for committing those acts.\n  I have the utmost respect for the career men and women at the Justice \nDepartment. It appears, however, the Department caved in to political \npressure in this case. Although it submitted a report in December 1996 \nrecommending against the granting of clemency for the FALN terrorists--\nwhich should have ended its involvement--the Pardon Attorney produced \nanother report two-and-a-half years later reportedly changing its \nrecommendation. The second report did not recommend either for or \nagainst the granting of clemency, violating the Justice Department \nregulation requiring that in every clemency case the Department ``shall \nreport in writing [its] recommendation to the President, stating \nwhether in [its] judgment the President should grant or deny the \npetition.''\n  Why did the Justice Department's recommendation change? What happened \nbetween the first report in December 1996 and the second one in the \nsummer of 1999 that justified a reexamination and change of the \nDepartment's conclusion? Because of the President's assertion of \nexecutive privilege, we may never know for sure. It was a mistake for \nthe President to let politics affect such an important clemency \ndecision, but is much worse than a mistake when political pressure \nforces an independent agency to alter its advice against its better \njudgment.\n  The Pardon Attorney Reform and Integrity Act will help prevent this \nfrom happening again. It will make available to the President access to \nthe most pertinent facts concerning the exercise of executive clemency, \nincluding information from law enforcement agencies about the risks \nposed by any release from prison. It will also help ensure that--if the \nPresident chooses to have the Department of Justice conduct a clemency \nreview--the victims of crime will not be shut out of the clemency \nprocess while terrorists and their organized sympathizers have access \nto--and obtain advice from--high government officials. In other words, \nthis Act will insure that the tax-payer funded Justice Department will, \nwhen assisting the President in a clemency review, focus on public \nsafety, not politics. Let me be clear that the Department of Justice is \nan agency which I have great respect for. Its employees are loyal, \ndedicated public servants. This bill is aimed at helping the \nDepartment, not hurting it.\n  Specifically, our bill will do the following:\n  1. Give victims a voice by insuring that they are notified of key \nevents in the clemency process and by giving them an opportunity to \nvoice their opinions.\n  2. Enhance the voice of law enforcement by requiring the Pardon \nAttorney to notify the law enforcement community of a clemency \ninvestigation and permitting law enforcement to express its views on: \nthe impact of clemency on the individuals affected by the decision--for \nexample, victims and witnesses; whether clemency candidates have \ninformation which might help in other investigations; and whether \ngranting clemency will increase the threat of terrorism or other \ncriminal activity.\n  Of course, it is the hope of all the co-sponsors--and all Americans--\nthat presidents will use the congressionally created and funded Office \nof the Pardon Attorney in order to make the best possible decisions \nregarding executive clemency. I believe that when Congress passes this \nbill--and should President Clinton sign it into law--future Presidents, \nvictims, and the American public will be well served. If President \nClinton wants to help in this effort to restore integrity to the \nclemency process, he will announce his support for this bill.\n  Mr. President, I thank the many co-sponsors of this act, and I ask \nthe rest of my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation.

A bill to designate the United States Post Office building \nlocated at 3101 West Sunflower Avenue in Santa Ana, California, as the \n``Hector G. Godinez Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 hector g. godinez post office building\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues to \nsupport a bill to name the Santa Ana, California Post Office as the \n``Hector G. Godinez Post Office Building.''\n  Hector Godinez, who passed away in May of 1999, was a true leader in \nhis community of Santa Ana, California. He was a pioneer in the United \nStates Postal Service rising from letter carrier to become the first \nMexican-American to achieve the rank of District Manager within the \nUnited States Postal Service. He served with honor in World War II, was \na ardent civil rights activist and an active participant in civic \norganizations and local government.\n  After graduation from Santa Ana High School, Mr. Godinez enlisted \ninto the armed services and was a tank commander in World War II under \nGeneral George Patton. For his service, he earned a bronze star for \nbravery under fire and was also awarded a purple heart for wounds \nreceived in battle.\n  Upon his return home in 1946, Mr. Godinez started his first of 48 \nyears of distinguished service as a United States postal worker.\n  Hector Godinez was a true pillar within the Santa Ana community \ndevoting his tireless energy to such civic groups as the Orange County \nDistrict Boy Scouts of America, Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce, Orange \nCounty YMCA and National President of the League of United Latin \nAmerican Citizens, one of the country's oldest Hispanic civil rights \norganizations.\n  On behalf of the Godinez family and the people of Santa Ana, \nCalifornia, it is my pleasure to introduce this bill to name the Santa \nAna, California Post Office in his honor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2044. A bill to allow postal patrons to contribute to funding for \ndomestic violence programs through the voluntary purchase of specially \nissued postage stamps; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              THE STAMP OUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Stamp Out Domestic \nViolence Act of 2000.\n  The bill will allow every American to easily contribute to the fight \nagainst domestic violence through the voluntary purchase of certain \nspecially issued U.S. Postal stamps, generally referred to as semi-\npostals. Proceeds raised from the stamps would fund domestic violence \nprograms nationwide.\n  The national statistics on domestic violence are reprehensible and \nshocking. Consider the following: A woman is battered every 15 seconds \nin the United States. According to the Justice Department, four million \nAmerican women were victims of violent crime last year. Two thirds of \nthese women were victimized by someone they knew. In fact, 30 percent \nof female murder victims are killed by current or former partners. In \nColorado alone, the Colorado Coalition Against Domestic Violence \nreported 59 domestic violence related deaths in 1998. We can and must \nmake every effort to change that. But, before we can eliminate the \nincidence of domestic violence we must acknowledge the problem and \nidentify the resources needed to combat the problem.\n  Mr. President, I believe this bill represents an innovative way to \ngenerate money for the fight against domestic violence. In the 105th \nCongress, as Chairman of the Treasury and General Government \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I supported the first semi-postal issued \nin the United States, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. So far, more \nthan 104 million stamps have been sold nationally, raising $8 million \nfor breast cancer research. My bill is modeled after the breast cancer \nstamp, and I am confident it will be just as successful.\n  Specifically, under the ``Stamp Out Domestic Violence Act of 2000,'' \nthe Postal Service would establish a special rate of postage for first-\nclass mail, not to exceed 25 percent of the first-class rate, as an \nalternative to the regular first-class postage. The additional sum \nwould be contributed to domestic violence programs. The rate would be \ndetermined in part, by the Postal Service to cover administrative \ncosts, and the remainder by the Governors of the Postal Service. All of \nthe funds raised would go to the Department of Justice to support local \ndomestic violence initiatives across the country.\n  In a country as blessed as America, the horrid truth is more women \nare injured by domestic violence each year than by automobile and \ncancer deaths--combined. We can no longer ignore that fact, for our \ndenial is but a\n\n[[Page S542]]\n\nsmall step from tacit approval. The funds raised by this stamp will \nrepresent another step forward in addressing this national concern. I \nurge my colleagues to act quickly on this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objecton, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2044\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act with \nrespect to H-1B nonimmigrant aliens; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n    american competitiveness in the twenty-first century act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce what I believe is \none of the most important pieces of legislation the Senate will \nconsider this year, the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century \nAct.\n  At the outset, I would like to express my gratitude to my two lead \ncosponsors, Senator Abraham and Senator Gramm. Both have worked \ntirelessly with me to craft this legislation. Senator Abraham, of \ncourse, as chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, has long led the \nway on this matter. I also thank our Democrat sponsors, Senators \nGraham, Lieberman, and Feinstein, as well as our majority leader and \nassistant majority leader for their contributions to this effort.\n  Last month, the national jobless rate hit 4 percent, the lowest level \nin 30 years. That jobless rate is even lower in my home State of Utah \nat 3.3 percent. That's great news; but at the same time, serious labor \nshortages threaten our continued economic prosperity and global \ncompetitiveness. A recent study, for example, concluded that a shortage \nof high-tech professionals is currently costing the U.S. economy $105 \nbillion a year.\n  A look at last Sunday's Washington Post makes the problem very clear. \nHigh-tech jobs even have their own separate section of help wanted ads. \nTwenty-one pages of jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  The Clinton administration recently projected that in the next 5 \nyears, high-tech and related employment will grow ``more than twice as \nfast as employment in the economy as a whole.'' The growth of the high-\ntech industry is being felt across this country, and nowhere more than \nin my State of Utah. Common sense tells us that we must allow American \nhigh-tech companies to fill their labor needs in the United States, or \nthey will be forced to take these opportunities of growth abroad.\n  We want the high tech industry to thrive in the United States and to \ncontinue to serve as the engine for the growth of jobs and \nopportunities for American workers. If Congress fails to act promptly \nto alleviate today's high-tech labor shortage, today's low jobless rate \nwill be a mere precursor to tomorrow's lost opportunities.\n  The purpose of our important bipartisan legislation is twofold: (1) \nTo allow for a necessary infusion of high-tech workers in the short \nterm, and (2) to make prudent investments in our own workforce for the \nlong term.\n  It is clear that in the short term we need to raise the limits of the \nnumber of temporary visas for highly skilled labor. Our bill does this \nby increasing the cap to 195,0000 visas over each of the next 3 years. \nWe also exempt persons from the cap who come to work in our \nuniversities and persons who have recently received advanced degrees in \nour educational institutions.\n  But this, by itself, is not a satisfactory solution either in the \nshort item or long term. Thus, we need to redouble our efforts to \nprovide training and educational opportunities for our current and \nfuture workforce. Thus, we raise an additional $150 million for \nscholarships and training of American workers for these jobs for a \ntotal of $375 million for education and training under this program \nover 3 fiscal years. Our legislation, in other words, seeks\n\n[[Page S543]]\n\nto address both the short and long term needs.\n  My hope is that the administration will come to support this \nimportant high-tech legislation. In our new knowledge-based economy, \nwhere ideas and innovations rather than land or natural resources are \nthe principal well springs of economy growth, American competitiveness \ndepends greatly on intellectual assets and capacity. The most \nsuccessful economics of the 21st century will be those which maximize \nintellectual assets. In recognition of this fact, the administration \nhas worked with me over the years to improve intellectual property \nprotection and to encourage developing nations to invest in doing \nlikewise. For this reason, I believe that the administration \nappreciates the need for this legislation. In the end, I hope they will \nhave the smarts to listen to Alan Greenspan--who has testified about \nthe need for this bill--and that the administration will support its \npassage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2045\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Hatch in \nintroducing the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act.\n  Mr. President, no company can grow if it fails to find enough \nemployees with the skills needed to get the job done. And that is \nprecisely the situation faced by our high-tech companies today. A Joint \nVenture: Silicon Valley study found that a lack of skilled workers is \ncosting Silicon Valley companies $3 to $4 billion every year. A \nComputer Technology Industry Association study concluded that a \nshortage of information technology professionals is costing the U.S. \neconomy as a whole $105 billion per year.\n  These costs should not be seen as mere abstractions. Because of \nskilled labor shortages, an increasing number of highly productive \nfirms have had to curtail their economic activities and/or move \noffshore. At an October 21, 1999 Senate Immigration Subcommittee \nhearing, Susan DeFife, CEO of womenCONNECT.com, noted that ``as \ninvestment capital flows into start-ups and puts them on a fast growth \ntrack, the demand for workers will continue to far exceed the supply. \nIn order to fill these positions, the options for tech companies are \nnot particularly attractive: we can limit our growth, but then we lose \nthe ability to compete; we can `steal' employees from other companies, \nwhich makes none of us stronger and forces us to constantly look over \nour shoulders; or, in the case of larger companies I know, move \noperations off-shore.''\n  None of these solutions is good for our economy or our workers. As e-\ncommerce and other forms of high technology become increasingly \nintegrated throughout our economy, the long-term solution to our \ndilemma will be for earlier and better training for our young people to \nqualify them for high-tech tasks. But we are losing productivity and \nopportunities for growth right now. If we are to maintain our high-tech \nedge in an increasingly competitive global market, we must find the \nskilled workers we need wherever we can.\n  We must meet our training and education needs. And we need wise and \ncareful reforms to our immigration laws. This is not an either/or \nproposition. We have studied this approach for some time. In February \nof 1998 the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on high \ntechnology workforce issues. This hearing demonstrated that many \ncompanies could not find enough qualified professionals to fill key \njobs. It also showed that the foreign-born individuals hired by \ncompanies on H-1B temporary visas typically many additional jobs for \nAmericans through their skills and motivations.\n  Mr. President, shortly after that hearing, Congress raised the cap on \nH-1B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 in FY1999 and 2000, and 107,500 in \n2001. A number of provisions in this legislation increased enforcement \nefforts and established a $500 fee per visa--currently generating $75 \nmillion per year--for training and scholarships to encourage Americans \nto enter high-tech related fields.\n  Unfortunately, this was not enough. Despite the raised cap, a tight \nlabor market, increasing globalization and burgeoning economic growth \nall combined to increase demand for skilled workers. The 1999 cap on H-\n1B visas was reached by June of last year.\n  We must do more to enable American employers to hire job-creating \nhigh-tech professionals. That is why I have sponsored this legislation \nthat would:\n  Provide a temporary increase in H-1B visas. Caps would be increased \nby 80,000 for FY 2000; 87,500 for FY 2001; and 130,000 for FY 2002.\n  Create exemptions for universities, research facilities, and graduate \ndegree recipients to help keep in the country top graduates and those \nwho help educate Americans.\n  Modify per-country limits on permanent employment visas to allow \ncompanies to hire talent without regard to nationality.\n  Increase labor mobility by allowing H-1B professionals to change jobs \nas soon as the new employer files the initial paperwork, instead of \nwaiting for a new H-1B application to be approved.\n  Continue and extend the $500 per visa fee to provide over $150 \nmillion in additional funding over three years for training and \nscholarships. Counting the existing money brought in by the fee, this \nwill raise the total to over $375 million over three years and will \nhelp over 50,000 American students receive scholarships in math, \nscience or engineering.\n  These provisions will increase our economic competitiveness, sustain \nour economic growth, and provide new opportunities for workers and \nentrepreneurs. Julie Holdren, President and CEO of the Olympus Group, \ntold the Immigration Subcommittee that ``For every H-1B worker I \nemploy, I am able to hire ten more American workers.'' A study for the \nPublic Policy Institute of California by U.C. Berkeley Professor \nAnnalee Saxenian bears this testimony out. It found that Chinese and \nIndian immigrant entrepreneurs in northern California alone were \nresponsible for employing 58,000 people, with annual sales of nearly \n$17 billion.\n  Critics of the last H-1B visa increase have been proven spectacularly \nwrong, as the U.S. economy added 387,000 new jobs in January and the \nunemployment rate dropped to a 30-year low of 4 percent. Specialty jobs \nin the computer industry alone are projected to grow by 1.5 million \nbetween 1998 and 2008, according to the Department of Labor.\n  President Clinton's former chief economic advisor, Laura D'Andrea \nTyson argues that ``it's time to raise the cap on H-1B visas yet again \nand to provide room for further increases as warranted. Silicon \nValley's experience reveals that the results will be more jobs and \nhigher incomes for both Americans and immigrant workers.''\n  Mr. President, the final word should belong to Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan. At a Budget Committee hearing last month he \nwas asked ``Do you believe we should do something with our laws--\nimmigration--that would allow high tech . . . labor to come into the \ncountry to ease the burden'' on our labor force?\n  Chairman Greenspan responded: ``I would certainly agree with that. \nIt's clear that under existing circumstance . . . aggregate demand is \nputting very significant pressures on an ever-decreasing available \nsupply of unemployed labor. The one obvious means that one can use to \noffset that is expanding the number of people we allow in, either \ngenerally or in a specifically focused area.''\n  By increasing the number of highly skilled professionals we allow to \nwork in America, and providing additional funding for training and \nscholarships, we will create jobs for all Americans and keep our high-\ntech driven economic expansion on the move.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am proud to join in the \nintroduction of legislation which will increase the number of H-1B \ntemporary work visas used to recruit and hire workers with very \nspecialized skills, particularly in high technology fields. This bill \nwill ensure that the dramatic U.S. economic expansion will not be \nstalled by a lack of skilled workers in critical positions. It retains \nthe language of current law which protects qualified U.S. workers from \nbeing displaced by H-1B visa holders.\n  With record low unemployment, U.S. companies already have been forced \nto slow their expansion or even to cancel projects, and some may be \nforced to move their operations overseas because of an inability to \nfind qualified individuals to fill job vacancies. We will achieve our \nfull economic potential only if we ensure that high-technology \ncompanies can find and hire the people whose unique qualifications and \nskills are critical to America's future.\n  Last year, the Congress temporarily increased the number of annual H-\n1B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 for Fiscal Years 1999 and 2000, and to \n107,500 in 2001. The number of H-1B visas is scheduled to drop back to \n65,000 for Fiscal Year 2002 and subsequent years. Our legislation will \nincrease the H-1B visa cap to 195,000 for Fiscal Years 2000, 2001, and \n2002. By the end of that period, we will have the data we need to make \nan informed decision on the number of such visas required beyond 2002.\n  According to a recent study by the American Electronics Association \n(AEA), Texas has the fastest growing\n\n[[Page S545]]\n\nhigh technology industry in the country and is second only to \nCalifornia in the number of high technology workers. This legislation \nwould ensure that these companies have access to highly educated \nworkers, in order that America can continue to grow and prosper, and in \ndoing so, create more jobs and opportunity for U.S. workers.\n  I believe that this legislation represents a fair and effective way \nto address a critical need in our Nation's economy, and I hope my \ncolleagues will quickly approve this important proposal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n        Breaux, and Mr. Hollings);\n  S. 2046. A bill to reauthorize the Next Generation Internet Act, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                 the next generation internet 2000 act\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Next \nGeneration Internet 2000 Act, a multi-agency research and development \nprogram designed to fund advanced networking infrastructure and \ntechnologies. Two and a half years ago, I stood in this exact spot and \nintroduced its predecessor, the ``Next Generation Internet Research Act \nof 1998.'' While scientists throughout the country have made tremendous \ninroads since that time, the digital divide makes the truth clear and \nsimple: we are leaving many of our fellow Americans behind. The Next \nGeneration Internet 2000 will attempt to eliminate these geographical \nbarriers, while providing research funding for a faster, more secure \nand robust network infrastructure for all Americans.\n  The Internet is one of the most significant developments of the last \ndecade. Its significance is not limited to the new industries that it \nhas created nor the new educational opportunities that it affords. The \nimpact of the Internet goes beyond those things. With the development \nof electronic commerce, the Internet has radically altered the economic \nlandscape of this country. Advances in industries are taking place at a \nfaster and faster pace. At the heart of this dizzying pace of change \nare two things: computers and communications. More and more we are \nseeing that computers and communications means the Internet.\n  If you had to find a prototypical success story, it could very well \nbe the Internet. There are in fact, multiple dimensions to its success. \nIt was and is a successful public-private collaboration. It \ndemonstrated successful commercial application of technology developed \nas part of mission directed research program. It showed a successful \ntransition of an operational system from the public to the private \nsector. Perhaps most of all, it is a prime example of a successful \nfederal investment.\n  In some respects the Internet is now ``suffering'' from too much \nsuccess. With the advent of tools that have made the Internet easy to \nuse, there has been an explosion in the growth of network traffic. As \ncomputers become more powerful, applications more sophisticated, and \nthe user interfaces get easier to use, we can look forward to an even \ngreater demand for network bandwidth.\n  The Internet and its promising applications have transformed our \ndaily lives. They have reshaped the ways in which we communicate at \nwork, and with our families; they have made revolutionary medical \nadvances a reality that we once thought impossible only a few years \nago. But each day, as more and more of our neighbors become connected \nto the World Wide Web and experience the amazement of its potential, \ncertain segments of our nation are left without these same \nopportunities.\n  Since the enactment of the Next Generation Internet Research Act of \n1998, the National Science Foundation has connected hundreds of new \nsites to a testbed providing a 100-fold increase in network \nperformance. And the Department of Defense is currently deploying a \ntestbed with 1,000-fold increased performance at over twenty sites to \nsupport networking research and applications deployment. As we applaud \nthe success of the first three years of the Next Generation Internet \n(NGI) initiative, we must also realize its current limitations.\n  In the review of the first two years of the initiative, the \nPresident's Information Technology Advisory Committee recommended that \nthe NGI program should continue to focus on the utility of the Next \nGeneration Internet's gigabit bandwidth to end-users, its increased \nsecurity, and its expanded quality of service. More importantly, the \ncommittee shared Congress' concern that no federal program specifically \naddresses the geographical penalty issue--the imposition of costs on \nusers of the Internet in rural or other locations that are \ndisproportionately greater than the costs imposed on users in locations \ncloser to high populations. I must admit that this is a great \ndisappointment for myself and my colleagues who fought to combat this \ngeographical penalty through the authorization of NGI in 1998. \nUnfortunately, the White House did not take us seriously and did not \nfollow through with the complete implementation of the original act.\n  The Next Generation Internet 2000 makes a distinct departure from its \npredecessor. First, it designates ten percent of the overall program \nfunding for research to reduce the cost of Internet access services \navailable to all users in geographically remote areas. It further \nprioritizes that these research grants be awarded to qualified college-\nlevel educational institutions located in Experimental Program to \nStimulate Competitive Research states.\n  Second, the act requires that five percent of the research grants \nshall be made available to minority institutions including Hispanic, \nNative American, Historically Black Colleges and small colleges and \nuniversities. The most efficient way to open the Internet superhighway \nto everyone is to provide scientists in every corner of the nation with \nopportunities to perform peer-reviewed and merit-based research.\n  Finally, the National Academy of Sciences is requested to conduct a \nstudy to determine the extent to which the Internet backbone and \nnetwork infrastructure contribute to the digital divide. The study will \nfurther assess the existing geographical penalty and its impact on all \nusers and their ability to obtain secure and reliable Internet access.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2047. A bill to direct the Secretary of Energy to create a Heating \nOil Reserve to be available for use when fuel oil prices in the United \nStates rise sharply because of anticompetitive activity, during a fuel \noil shortage, or during periods of extreme winter weather; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                the home heating oil price stability act\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nLieberman, Snowe, Jeffords, Lautenberg, Reed and Leahy in introducing \nthe Home Heating Oil Price Stability Act.\n  For the past several weeks, Connecticut and the Northeast have been \ngripped by cold weather and skyrocketing heating oil prices. \nApproximately 36 percent of households in the Northeast rely on home \nheating oil. On Friday, February 4th, home heating oil cost $2 per \ngallon in Hartford, Connecticut and $1.80 per gallon a little farther \neast in Groton, Connecticut, almost double the price from mid-January. \nPrices averaged $.86 per gallon during the winter of 1998/1999.\n  Independent, family-owned heating oil retailers in Connecticut are \nstruggling to meet their delivery demands because of supply \nconstraints. Local oil terminals are at dangerously low levels. Last \nweek, supply levels of heating oil were so low in Bridgeport and New \nHaven that the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection \nissued a 48-hour waiver to allow the sale of 7-9 million gallons of \nheating oil with sulphur content above the level permitted by state \nlaw.\n  To be sure, the extreme cold weather and isolated refinery problems \nhave contributed to the supply strain. Icy waters around New Haven had \nslowed the off-loading of some heating oil in late January and early \nFebruary. However, even after tankers were able to unload millions of \ngallons last weekend, customers throughout Connecticut are still paying \nrecord-high prices as high as $2.10 per gallon--supply is still tight.\n\n[[Page S546]]\n\n  The Northeast is always cold in winter, so why are consumers and \nretailers suffering so much this winter? Many analysts believe that the \nprecarious petroleum situation was precipitated by a calculated \ndecision by OPEC and others to cut back production, and by major oil \ncompanies adhering to a practice of just-in-time inventories. As \npetroleum prices began to rise in reaction to OPEC action, refiners \ndrew down from their already low stock of lower-priced crude rather \nthan purchasing higher-priced crude and thus replenishing the stocks. \nInventories dwindled and the supply is now at record low levels. For \nthe week ending January 14, the total distillate stock for the East \nCoast was 33.5 million barrels compared with 69.1 million barrels a \nyear ago.\n  What do these events mean to the average consumer in Connecticut and \nthe Northeast? Dramatically higher costs, for starters. Heating oil \nbills are averaging 30-60 percent higher than last year. The wide range \nis due to the extent to which people are turning down their thermostats \nto ration supply and stretch their dollars. Schools, libraries and \nsmall businesses are seeing their budgets burst as more money is \nallocated for fuel. The Middletown, Connecticut school system has spent \nmore than twice as much for heating oil from October to January than \nduring the same period a year ago, despite a warmer than average \nDecember.\n  Some market analysts believe this is a temporary situation. Mr. \nPresident, this is not a temporary situation. Just-in-time inventory \npractices appear to be here to stay. OPEC has intimated that the \npetroleum production drawbacks may continue beyond March, thus causing \nfurther instability at a time when peak demand for gasoline begins. \nThis is a perennial problem--unusually high heating oil prices in \nwinter followed by skyrocketing gasoline prices in the summer.\n  Today's legislation is an effort to address the heating oil problem \nfor the long-term. It would create a heating oil reserve of 2 million \nbarrels in leased storage facilities in New York Harbor and 4.7 million \nbarrels of heating oil in one of four Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) \ncaverns along the Gulf Coast. The Secretary of Energy may fill the \nreserve by trading crude oil from the SPR for heating oil. The \nPresident may draw down the reserve when fuel oil prices in the United \nStates rise sharply because of anti-competitive activity, during a fuel \noil shortage, or during periods of extreme winter weather.\n  Let me be perfectly clear. The creation of a Government regional \nheating oil reserve is not intended to compete with the commercial \nsector for sales under normal conditions. It is intended, rather, to \nhelp stabilize supplies and prices during critical periods.\n  I, along with Senator Lieberman, first raised the issue of \nestablishing a regional reserve in 1996 when Connecticut consumers were \nfacing unusually high heating oil prices attributed to extreme winter \nweather and domestic and international events, including the onset of \njust-in-time inventories. We asked the Department of Energy (DOE) to \nexamine regional reserve feasibility and report back to Congress. Their \nconclusions form the foundation of our legislation.\n  Mr. President, I have an article from July 13, 1998 coinciding with \nthe release of the report that states a positive benefit/cost ratio if \na small reserve were located in leased terminals in the Northeast and \nfilled by trading crude from the SPR for the distillate. As I stated \nbriefly a moment ago, our legislation also establishes a backup 4.7 \nmillion barrel reserve in the Gulf due to excess capacity there.\n  This legislation should be part of a long-term solution. In the \nmeantime, Connecticut and Northeast residents need near-term action. \nAdvice to just ride out the winter is simply not acceptable. Hardest \nhit are the poor and elderly who should not have to choose among having \na warm house, food on the table, or medicine in the cabinet.\n  The current home heating oil crisis cuts across all income levels. \nThe 1999/2000 winter will go down in the history books as the year with \nthe highest heating oil prices ever. I am sure you will agree with me \nthat this is one record that need never be broken. I urge our \ncolleagues to join me, Senators Lieberman, and our other cosponsors in \nsupport of working families, small businesses, and towns across the \nNortheast to move forward with this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the bill and additional material be entered in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2047\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Home Heating Oil Price \n     Stability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a sharp, sustained increase in the price of fuel oil \n     would negatively affect the overall economic well-being of \n     the United States, and such increases have occurred in the \n     winters of 1983-84, 1988-89, 1996-97, and 1999-2000;\n       (2) the United States currently imports roughly 55 percent \n     of its oil;\n       (3) heating oil price increases disproportionately harm the \n     poor and the elderly;\n       (4) the global oil market is often greatly influenced by \n     nonmarket-based supply manipulations, including price fixing \n     and production quotas; and\n       (5) according to the June 1998 Department of Energy \n     ``Report to Congress on the Feasibility of Establishing a \n     Heating Oil Component to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve''--\n       (A) the use of a Government-owned distillate reserve in the \n     Northeast would provide benefits to consumers in the \n     Northeast and to the Nation;\n       (B) the Government would make a profit of $46,000,000 from \n     drawing down and selling the distillate;\n       (C) consumer savings, including reductions in jet fuel, \n     would total $425,000,000;\n       (D) there are a number of commercial petroleum storage \n     facilities with available capacity for leasing in the New \n     York/New Jersey area; and\n       (E) it would be cost-effective to keep a Government \n     stockpile of approximately 2,000,000 barrels in leased \n     storage in the Northeast, filled by trading some crude oil \n     from the Government's strategic reserve of oil for the \n     refined product.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF HEATING OIL RESERVE.\n\n       (a) Creation of Reserve.--The Secretary of Energy shall \n     immediately create a heating oil reserve consisting of--\n       (1) 2,000,000 barrels of heating oil in leased storage \n     facilities in the New York Harbor area; and\n       (2) 4,700,000 barrels of heating oil in 1 of the 4 \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve caverns on the coast of the Gulf \n     of Mexico.\n       (b) Exchange for Crude Oil.--The Secretary of Energy may \n     acquire heating oil for the reserve by trading crude oil from \n     the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for heating oil.\n\n     SEC. 4. DRAWDOWN OF HEATING OIL RESERVE.\n\n       The President may immediately draw down the Heating Oil \n     Reserve--\n       (1) when fuel oil prices in the United States rise sharply \n     because of anticompetitive activity;\n       (2) during a fuel oil shortage; or\n       (3) during a period of extreme winter weather.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \n     Energy to carry out this Act $125,000,000 for the period of \n     fiscal years 2000 through 2019.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From DOE Fossil Energy Techline, July 13, 1998]\n\nDOE Sends Report to Congress Analyzing Costs, Benefits of Regional Oil \n                            Product Reserve\n\n       A Department of Energy (DOE) report, commissioned two years \n     ago when high prices and low stocks of heating oil raised \n     consumer concerns, has concluded that a Government-controlled \n     ``regional petroleum product reserve'' would make economic \n     sense only under a very narrow set of conditions.\n       The report, which DOE forwarded to Congress late last week, \n     concludes that the benefits of a Government stockpile of \n     heating oil in the Northeast would exceed its costs only if \n     the reserve was relatively small, approximately 2 million \n     barrels, located in leased terminals, and filled by trading \n     crude oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     for the distillate product.\n       Storing distillate product in dedicated salt caverns at the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve along the Gulf of Mexico \n     coastline would improve the cost-benefit characteristics, the \n     study found, but products would take 7-10 days to reach \n     consumers in the Northeast.\n       A larger product reserve, sized at around 6.7 million \n     barrels to meet the worst weather contingencies, would not be \n     attractive based on the cost-benefit analysis unless it was \n     constructed entirely within the existing Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve sites.\n       Moreover, the study found, the positive economic benefits \n     would be achieved only if the Government adopted the policy \n     of releasing the entire volume of the product reserve at the \n     point heating oil prices reached a predefined ``trigger \n     price.'' A more conservative policy of releasing only enough \n     crude oil to bring wholesale prices back down to a predefined \n     ``ceiling price'' would not provide sufficient benefits to \n     offset the reserve's costs.\n\n[[Page S547]]\n\n       The two-volume study is titled ``Report to Congress on the \n     Feasibility of Establishing a Heating Oil Component to the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve.'' The Energy Department \n     undertook the study when in 1995-1996 an unusually long \n     winter, uncertainties about production from Iraq and the \n     Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and \n     increased global demand for petroleum led to a gasoline price \n     surge and later, a price increase in middle distillate fuels \n     used for heating oil, diesel and jet fuel. Consumers in New \n     England, which has no refineries, became especially concerned \n     about heating oil inventory levels and the rise in heating \n     oil prices.\n       The events of 1996 prompted several members of Congress \n     from New England states to urge DOE to carry out a study to \n     determine whether or not Government intervention in petroleum \n     markets in the form of a regionally-cited refined product \n     stockpile could be beneficial.\n       The Federal Government currently stores only crude oil for \n     emergency purposes, principally to protect the United States \n     from disruptions in petroleum supply, especially imported \n     crude oil. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve currently stores \n     563 million barrels of crude oil along the Gulf Coast in four \n     sites that are accessible to most refining centers in the \n     country.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Feb. 6, 2000]\n\n                          Buffering Oil Prices\n\n       The surge in home heating and diesel oil prices has shocked \n     householders, truckers, and others and sparked a fresh round \n     of suspicions that massive collusion is responsible. Would \n     that such cooperation existed. Instead, business anarchy has \n     much to do with the rise. The attorney general's consumer \n     protection division should seek to assure that there is no \n     price gouging by individual dealers. In the meantime, \n     prevention of future price spikes is available to government \n     in a form that need not be intrusive. Oil prices spurted \n     because inventories were inadequate. Public reserves are \n     needed.\n       The impact has been severe. Oil deliveries costing $400 \n     have been a shock for elderly homeowners living on fixed \n     incomes. Even low-cost, emergency suppliers like Joseph \n     Kennedy's Citizens Energy Corp. have been stymied by \n     shortages and high prices.\n       The American Petroleum Institute keeps track of inventories \n     of gasoline, oil, crude, and other petroleum products around \n     the country. Among all these, heating oil is unique because \n     demand for it is seasonal, peaking in the winter months.\n       While some extra stockpiling of oil by the private sector \n     takes place every year, the tendency has been to cut reserves \n     as close to the bone as possible. This past fall, despite \n     indications that consumption was on the rise, inventories ran \n     significantly below their year-earlier levels. At the end of \n     December, inventories of distillate fuel oil (both diesel and \n     heating) stood at 124 million barrels compared with 156 \n     million barrels a year earlier. Both these figures run well \n     below comparable statistics in the past, when inventories \n     were frequently above 200 million barrels.\n       The federal government in the 1970s set up a strategic \n     petroleum reserve of crude oil to dampen the power of OPEC, \n     the international oil cartel. But it needs a similar reserve \n     of distillate to help cope with domestic developments like \n     this year's failure to stockpile adequate oil to cope with \n     predictable seasonal surges, much less unpredictable cold \n     snaps. The mere presence of such a reserve, available for \n     rapid release, would dampen spot markets. To do less condemns \n     everyone to senseless repeats of this painful experience.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Home Heating Oil \nPrice Stability Act being introduced today by Senator Dodd. In response \nto Congressional concern raised over volatile heating oil prices, the \nDepartment of Energy completed a study of regional oil reserves and \nissued their report in 1998. This report concluded that regional \nheating oil reserves, such as the one proposed in this bill, would \nbenefit New England and help guard against the negative effects of \nvolatile fuel prices during the winter months.\n  The recent price spike in home heating fuel throughout the Northeast \nand mid-Atlantic regions illustrate the need for a regional fuel \nreserve. Prices of home heating fuel have increased over the last month \nto unprecedented levels, putting many families and businesses at risk \nduring these cold winter months. Many areas of New England are now \nfacing fuel costs between $1.70 and $2.00 per gallon--nearly double \nlast January's average price of .80 cents per gallon. Home heating fuel \nhas not seen average prices over $1 dollar in nearly ten years. These \nprices are endangering the welfare of low income Vermonters and \nthreatening the stability of our economy.\n  This is not the first time we have seen such volatile prices in New \nEngland and will certainly not be the last. I remember Vermont in \nDecember 1989, when we experienced the coldest temperatures the \nNortheast has seen in 100 years, and then again in 1993 when the \nmercury plummeted and the fuel bills rose. Mr. President we need a \nregional home heating fuel reserve to protect the welfare and the \neconomy of states such as Vermont. The cold winters and the absence of \nrefiners make New England susceptible to fluctuations in the market \nwhich leave other parts of the country virtually untouched.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 2048. A bill to establish the San Rafael Western Legacy District \nin the State of Utah, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    san rafael western legacy district and national conservation act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the San Rafael \nWestern Legacy District and National Conservation Act. I am proud to \nsponsor this legislation which is a result of local citizens working \ntogether with federal land managers to produce a plan that promotes and \nprotects one of our nation's finest natural treasures, the San Rafael \nSwell in Emery County, Utah.\n  This is by no means a standard one-size-fits-all land management \nscheme. It reflects both local and national interests. I wish to \ncongratulate the elected officials of Emery County, Secretary of \nInterior Bruce Babbitt, local citizen groups, and local Bureau of Land \nManagement professionals for their willingness to come to the table and \ncraft this proposal. It is a testament to what I have always believed: \nthat those who live on and around our public lands love the land and, \ngiven the chance, will find ways to help protect it. I hope that this \neffort to work out solutions to land issues with meaningful local input \nwill become the norm for federal land policy.\n  Mr. President, under this legislation, 2.8 million acres will be \ndesignated as the San Rafael Western Legacy District. Visitors to the \nSan Rafael will be able to see where Kit Carson, Chief Walker, Wesley \nPowell, Butch Cassidy and many others became famous, or infamous as the \ncase may be. Backpackers and day hikers will be surprised by \npetroglyphs that tell stories of Native American ancestors and that \ngive a picture of life as it once was. Families will enjoy access to \none of the largest sources of fossils in the New World. They will also \nenjoy a variety of quality museums that already exist in the area which \ntake us back in time, whether it be the time of dinosaurs, Native \nAmericans, pioneers and the wild west, early explorers, or even the \nearly atomic arms race.\n  A the core of this Western Legacy District will be the San Rafael \nNational Conservation Area, which will withdraw approximately 1 million \nacres from development. Mr. President, Congress cannot create \nspectacular geologic formations, such as the San Rafael Swell, but this \nlegislation will protect what God has given us. The San Rafael Swell is \nvast and can accommodate all types of experiences including wilderness, \nwildlife viewing, fishing, mountain biking, and other activities. The \nspecifics for these uses will be detailed in a forty year planning \nprocess led by the Secretary of Interior.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce this legislation along \nwith my good friend and colleague Senator Robert Bennett. A companion \nmeasure in the House is sponsored by Representative Chris Cannon.\n  The San Rafael Swell is an area rich in history, beauty, culture, and \ntradition. This legislation protects the San Rafael for all citizens in \na manner that reflects the needs of those directly affected by its \nbounties. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent for the text of the fill to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 2048\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend the authorization for the Violent Crime \nReduction Trust Fund; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n       re-authorization of the violent crime reduction trust fund\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, I introduce a bill which will re-\nauthorize the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund for an additional five \nyears.\n  I firmly believe that re-authorization of the Violent Crime Reduction \nTrust Fund for another five years is the single most significant thing \nthat we can do to continue the war on crime.\n  In 1994 when we introduced the Biden Crime Bill, which eventually \nbecame the crime bill of 1994, some people disagreed with certain \naspects of the bill. But, we all agreed that crime control is a place \nwhere the federal government can and should play a key role.\n  We can all argue about how much we should be involved in education or \nwelfare, but no one can argue about the requirement of the government \nto make our streets safe. That is the starting point for all ordered \nsociety.\n  So, I, along with the Senior Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, and the \nSenior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, worked to set up a Violent \nCrime Reduction Trust Fund. The way we did that was not to raise \ntaxes--it was to cut the size of the federal government and use the \nmoney to fight crime. And so we agreed to let 250,000 Federal employees \ngo. Then we took the paycheck that would have been used to pay John \nJones and Sue Smith and we put it into a trust fund to do nothing but \ndeal with violent crime in America. And guess what--it worked.\n  Since the Fund was established in the Biden Crime Bill, The Office of \nManagement and Budget tells us that Congress had appropriated \n$16,648,000,000 from the fund through 1998, and $10,300,000,000 was \nestimated for 1999 and 2000 combined.\n  What has this money done you ask? Just look at the numbers: To date, \nthe money has funded more than 103,000 police officers under the COPS \nprogram to make our streets safer.\n  As of 1999, over 17,000 new prison, jail or alternative beds had been \nadded under the Violent Offender Incarceration/Truth-in-Sentencing \nGrants Program.\n  Under the drug court program nationwide, more than 140,000 offenders \nhave participated in drug courts, receiving the supervision and \ntreatment they need to stop abusing drugs and committing crimes.\n  Under the National Criminal History Improvement Program, enhancements \nto the FBI's National Criminal History Background Check System have \nhelped block more than 400,000 gun sales to ineligible persons. And, \nprogram improvements now allow 35 states and the District of Columbia \nto submit data to the FBI's National Sex Offender Registry, which \nbecame operational in July 1999.\n  The fund has provided money to states and localities to help offset \nthe costs of incarcerating criminal illegal aliens under the State \nCriminal Alien Assistance Program.\n  Under the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment for State Prisoners \nprogram, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the five \nterritories, have implemented drug testing and treatment programs that \naddress 80 percent of offenders who have drug or alcohol problems.\n  Through the largest Violence Against Women Act program, funding for \nthe STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grants Program is changing the \nway communities work together to respond to domestic violence, sexual \nassault, and stalking.\n  And there are other Violence Against Women Act grant programs which \nhave had an impact on many communities. The Grants to Encourage Arrest \nPolicies program encourages jurisdictions to implement mandatory or \npro-arrest policies in domestic violence cases. The Rural Domestic \nViolence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program has \nrecognized the special needs of victims in rural locations. The Civil \nLegal Assistance Grant Program is designed to strengthen civil legal \nassistance for domestic abuse victims through innovative, collaborative \nprograms that increase victim access to services. And, the Grants to \nCombat Violent Crimes Against Women on Campuses Program was first \nfunded in FY 1999 to promote comprehensive, coordinated responses to \nviolent crimes against women on campuses.\n  The results of these efforts have taken hold. Crime is down--way \ndown. And we didn't add 1 cent to the deficit.\n  The significance of the Trust Fund, why it was so important, is \nbecause it funds the initiatives contained in the Biden Crime Bill. The \nmoney has to be used for new cops and crime prevention. It can't be \nspent on anything else but crime reduction. It is the one place that no \none can compete. it is set\n\n[[Page S550]]\n\naside. It is a savings account to fight crime.\n  This fund works. It ensures that the crime reduction programs that we \npass be funded. It ensures that the crime rate will continue to go down \ninstead of up. It ensures that our kids will have a place to go after \nschool instead of hanging out on the street corners. It ensures that \nviolent crimes against women get the individualized attention that they \nneed and deserve. It gives states money to hire more cops and get \nbetter technology.\n  Today our challenge is to keep our focus and to stay vigilant against \nviolent crime. This is one modest step toward meeting that challenge.\n  This Act shares bipartisan support. No one wants crime and no one \nwants to raise taxes. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike--\nthis should be an easy one for all of us. In July of last year, during \ndebate on the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill, my friend \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, declared his commitment to get the \nViolent Crime Reduction Trust Fund re-authorized. Senator Gramm has \nalways stepped up to the plate on this issue as well, and I commend \nthem for their commitment to this program. As Senator Byrd aptly stated \nback in 1994 when we were first debating this, ``the war on crime is of \nsuch an overriding concern that, as in the past, the Committee on \nAppropriations must take extraordinary actions to confront the issue.'' \nThat still rings true today. Although crime is down, we can not become \ncomplacent. We must continue the fight. We need this Violent Crime \nReduction Trust Fund more than any other single piece of legislation.\n  Every member of the Senate is against violent crime--we all say it in \nspeech after speech. Now, I urge all my colleagues to back up their \nwords and follow through on their commitments to defeat violent crime. \nPass this bill. Continue the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. Take \nserious action against violent crime. Show the criminals that we are \nserious about fighting crime. Show the American people that their \nsafety is of the highest priority for us and that we are taking action.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2049\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a panel to investigate illegal gambling \non college sports and to recommend effective countermeasures to combat \nthis serious national problem; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         combatting illegal college and university gambling act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, six years ago we passed a crime bill which, \nwhile controversial at the time, has led to an unprecedented decrease \nin criminal activity. It was a tough bill that was aimed at cracking \ndown on illegal criminal activity. It gave law enforcement the tools it \nneeded to prevent and crack down on criminal conduct. The legislation \nhas been so effective that I believe it should be the model for future \nfederal anti-crime initiatives. At the time, however, supporters of the \nCrime Bill were attacked for focusing on the root causes of criminal \nactivity. Today, as evidenced by declining crime rates, we see that \nthis was an effective approach.\n  I raise this issue today because I am concerned that some may be \nmoving in the wrong direction in the worthwhile effort to crack down on \nillegal gambling on college sports. Recently introduced legislation \nattempts to crack down on dorm room and bar hall bookies by shutting \ndown legal and highly-regulated sports book operations in Nevada. Mr. \nPresident, this is like closing the Bank of America to eliminate loan \nsharking. It simply does not solve the problem.\n  Mr. President, the collegiate gambling legislation recently \nintroduced in the Senate is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that \nthe elimination of legal sports book wagering in Nevada will mean the \nend of illegal wagering on college sports. The National Collegiate \nAthletic Association (NCAA) is on record stating that there is an \nillegal bookie on every college campus. ``Sports Illustrated'' ran a \nseries in 1995, stating that ``gambling is the dirty little secret on \ncollege campuses, where it's rampant and prospering,'' and that ``the \nbookies catering to most college gamblers are fellow students.'' \nBanning legal college sports gambling in Nevada, where it is controlled \nand heavily regulated, is not going to put these bookies out of \nbusiness. Just as the Twenty-First Amendment did not stop the illegal \nconsumption of alcohol, but rather, drove it underground, banning \nregulated, legal college sports wagering in Nevada is simply not going \nto end illegal college sports gambling.\n  Mr. President, illegal gambling on college sports is a very serious \nproblem, and I commend my colleagues for their willingness to address \nthis issue. The problem with gambling on collegiate sporting events, \nhowever, does not rest with what is legal, but rather, with what is \nillegal. While there are currently numerous state laws that prohibit \ngambling on college sports, illegal practices still occur and there is \nlittle, if anything, that is being done to address or understand the \nproblem. A recent NCAA report noted that there are no comprehensive \nstudies available that analyze the prevalence of illegal gambling on \ncollege sports. Furthermore, the report found that ``the issue of \nillegal gambling on college sports is still largely overlooked by \ncollege administrators.''\n  Mr. President, to respond to this very serious problem, I rise today, \nalong with Senators Baucus, Torricelli, and Bryan, to introduce \nalternative legislation that would examine the root causes of illegal \ngambling on college sports. My legislation addresses several\n\n[[Page S551]]\n\nkey aspects of the problem of illegal gambling on collegiate sporting \nevents, namely, what is being done by federal and state officials to \nenforce existing laws, whether law enforcement has the proper tools and \nadequate funding to address illegal gambling on college sports, and, \nwhat colleges and universities are doing to address the problem of \nillegal gambling, especially on their own campuses. The legislation I \nam introducing today would follow the recommendations of the NCAA \nreport by directing the Justice Department to examine these issues and \nreport back to the Congress.\n  Mr. President, the growing attraction of illegal gambling among our \ncollege youth is a serious national problem that requires a serious \nresponse. We must have a solution to this problem, however, that \naccurately addressed the source of illegal college sports gambling. The \nalternative legislation I am introducing today, which focuses on \nstronger enforcement of existing laws and education campaigns, follows \nthe correct path toward addressing the root causes of this problem and \nfinding the most effective and appropriate solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url":

Jenkins, Jr., Judge Advocate General's \nCorps, United States Navy, as he departs the Office of Legislative \nAffairs and active duty service.\n  A native of Virginia, Lieutenant Commander Jenkins was commissioned \nan Ensign through the Naval ROTC Program upon graduation from the \nUniversity of Virginia in 1987.\n  Serving initially as a Surface Warfare Officer, Lieutenant Commander\n\n[[Page S553]]\n\nJenkins performed in a consistently outstanding manner under the most \nchallenging of circumstances during his first sea tour aboard U.S.S. \nCarr (FFG 52) where he was assigned as the Combat Information Center \nOfficer. In 1988, U.S.S. Carr acted, with substantial contributions \nfrom Lieutenant Commander Jenkins, as the On-Scene Commander during the \nrescue of 89 U.S. sailors from U.S.S. Bonefish as a result of a fire on \nboard that submarine. The following year, U.S.S. Carr distinguished \nitself during Operation Earnest Will escorting of U.S flagged tankers \nduring the Iran-Iraq War. Lieutenant Commander Jenkins served as one of \nthe ship's two Tactical Action Officers responsible for defending his \nown ship and the escorted vessels during this crucial demonstration of \nU.S. resolve in the Persian Gulf. In 1991, as a result of his \ndistinguished record of achievement, he was selected from among his \npeers in an intensely competitive process for the Navy's funded Law \nEducation Program. He began law studies at The George Washington \nUniversity Law School that fall and graduated with high honors in 1994, \nreceiving the Charles Glover Award for the highest grade point average \nas a third-year student. Upon graduation, Lieutenant Commander Jenkins \nwas assigned as a judge advocate to the Naval Legal Service Office, \nNorfolk, Virginia, were he served as Senior Defense Counsel and Trial \nCounsel in courts-martial at the Navy's largest and busiest legal \nservice command.\n  Since April, 1997, Lieutenant Commander Jenkins has served as \nLegislative Counsel in the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. In \nthis capacity he has been a major asset to the Department of the Navy \nand Congress. While relatively junior in rank, Lieutenant Command \nJenkins' maturity, judgment, initiative and intelligence have made him \na valued advisor to the very top echelons of the Navy and Congress on \nissues of great importance to our national security. His insight into \nthe legislative process is respected and sought out by all levels of \nthe chain of command. Lieutenant Commander Jenkins' dedicated service \nand his ability to effectively articulate the Navy's position to \nMembers of Congress and their staffs have contributed directly and \nsubstantially to the Navy's future readiness and the success of its \nlegislative initiatives.\n  Lieutenant Commander Jenkins' distinguished awards include the \nMeritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, and the Navy \nAchievement Medal with two gold stars in lieu of subsequent awards.\n  The Department of the Navy, Congress, and the American people have \nbeen served well by this dedicated naval officer. John Jenkins is a \nyoung man who knew he could make a difference and have an impact, and \ndid. Those in this Congress who have had the opportunity to work with \nhim will remember him warmly and will miss his constant energy and \nsincere commitment to the best interests of the Navy. We wish John, and \nhis lovely wife Karen, our very best as he transitions to civilian law \npractice with one of Washington's most prestigious law firms and \ncontinued affiliation with the Navy through the Naval Reserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/09/senate-section/article/S553-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DERRICK THOMAS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sadness at \nthe news of the passing of one of the finest defensive football players \never, Derrick Thomas.\n  Derrick Thomas had a stellar 11 year career, all of which was spent \nwith the Kansas City Chiefs. Among his numerous NFL achievements are 9 \nPro Bowl appearances, 119.5 sacks, 3 safeties, and 28 fumble \nrecoveries; all of which are K.C. records. In 1990, Derrick had 20 \nsacks in one season, setting a K.C. single season record.\n  When Derrick was just 5 years old, his father was shot down over \nVietnam on December 17, 1972. He was returning from a mission called \n``Operation Linebacker Two.'' As you can imagine, this had a tremendous \nimpact on young Derrick. Eighteen years later, Derrick was the most \ndominant linebacker in the National Football League. His most \nimpressive performance came against the Seattle Seahawks when he made a \nNFL record 7 sacks in one game. As fate would have it, that game was on \nVeteran's Day.\n  Mr. President, while he certainly made an impact on the quarterbacks \nthat played against him, he made a much larger impact in the lives of \nthose he touched through his philanthropic efforts. During his career \nhe received the League's two most prestigious humanitarian awards. In \n1993 he was the youngest man to ever win the NFL Man of the Year and in \n1995 he won the Byron ``Whizzer'' White Humanitarian Award for service \nto team, community and country. The Humanitarian Award is the most \nprestigious award given by the NFL Players Association.\n  In 1993 he delivered the keynote address at the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial during the annual Memorial Day ceremony. By delivering the \nKeynote address, he joined the ranks of other great Americans such as \nBob Hope and General Colin Powell. Derrick said addressing those who \nserved with his father was one of his greatest honors.\n  By far, his greatest contribution was founding the Third and Long \nFoundation. The foundation's goal is to help inner-city children by \n``sacking illiteracy.'' As part of the program, Derrick would read to \nchildren at local libraries each home Saturday during the season. \nPresident Bush designated Derrick as the 832nd point of light for his \nwork with the foundation. Derrick said once that he didn't want to be \nremembered or rewarded for what he did in football, but that if he \nhelped one child become a success, that is all he needed. Derrick has \nbeen and will continue to be a force in the lives of many children \nthrough the work of his foundation.\n  Derrick Thomas was truly a humanitarian, philanthropist and hero, not \nonly to Kansas City, but to many around the country. His life was \ntragically cut short at the age of 33, but his influence will continue \nto make America better for the youth of this country for many years to \ncome. Thank you, Derrick.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/09/senate-section/article/S553-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S553-S554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. HILARY KOPROWSKI\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the 50th anniversary of Dr. \nHilary Koprowski's feeding a child the very first dose of oral polio \nvaccine, I am pleased to offer this tribute so that America and the \nworld can know more about this extraordinarily distinguished scientist. \nI have come to know Dr. Koprowski as a friend, a counselor and a \nconstituent. The world owes Dr. Koprowski an enormous debt of gratitude \nfor his scientific achievements as he will celebrate on February 27, \n2000 the 50th anniversary of the first application of his oral polio \nvaccine.\n  Vaccination of children in the United States, and mass vaccination \ntrials with oral vaccine in Africa and Poland, paved the way for the \neradication of paralytic polio in the Americas since 1991 and, \nhopefully, the elimination of polio from the rest of the world this \nyear. Prior to the discovery of the oral vaccine, polio, a crippling \ndisease, claimed numerous victims throughout the world. In the period \nfrom 1951 through 1953, here in the United States, 26 cases of polio \nwere recorded for every 100,000 people.\n  Dr. Hilary Koprowski is one of the most distinguished and respected \nbiomedical researchers in the world recognized for his many \nachievements including the development of the first oral polio vaccine, \nin 1950, and the development of the genetically engineered oral rabies \nvaccine used all over the world. Dr. Koprowski pioneered the \ndevelopment of monoclonal antibodies for the detection and treatment of \ncancer. Dr. Koprowski continues his important work on gene-related \nvaccine using his wide scientific experience and profound scientific \nknowledge combined with strong organizational insight. Dr. Koprowski is \nthe Director of the Biotechnology Foundation Laboratories and the \nCenter for Neurovirology at Thomas Jefferson University and is \nProfessor Laureate at the Wistar Institute. From 1957 to 1991, as \nDirector, Dr. Koprowski led the Wistar Institute, where he is currently \non the Board, to become one of the nation's leading biomedical research \ninstitutions with a staff of more than 600 people.\n  Dr. Koprowski is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the \nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences, the New York Academy of Sciences \nand twenty-eight other learned institutions. He is a recipient of more \nthan\n\n[[Page S554]]\n\neighteen major awards, including the Order of the Lion, awarded by the \nKing of Belgium, the Legion of Honor of France and the Nicolaus \nCopernicus Medal of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Mr. President, on April 20, we are going to mark a 1-\nyear anniversary of the terrible tragedy that occurred at Columbine \nHigh School in Colorado. That was the day when two teenagers, Eric \nHarris and Dylan Klebold, walked into the school and sprayed the \nlibrary and cafeteria with gunfire, killing 12 classmates and a teacher \nand wounding many others. A few who were aware of what took place that \nday will never forget that horrible scene of a young man jumping out a \nwindow, people running, weeping, the whole place in disarray, students \nlying on the ground wounded, some fatally.\n  You would have thought by now, 9 months after that massacre, that \nCongress would have been able to get together to pass commonsense gun \nsafety measures. Some of my colleagues will say there is not much we \ncan do about it.\n  No, we cannot go back and undo that tragedy, but we sure can do \nsomething that maybe will prevent something similar from happening in \nthe future. It is preposterous to say we can't do anything better. We \ncan do a lot about it. Reasonable gun safety legislation can make a \ndifference.\n  For proof, I ask that we take a look at testimony of the young woman, \nRobyn Anderson, before the Judiciary Committee of the Colorado House of \nRepresentatives. In case the name isn't familiar, Robyn Anderson is the \nyoung woman who went with Harris and Klebold to the Tanner gun show in \nAdams County, CO. It was in late 1998. She wanted to help them buy \nguns.\n  Harris and Klebold were too young to buy guns because they had an 18-\nyear age limit, but Robyn Anderson was 18. She bought three guns at \nthat gun show, two shotguns, and a rifle, and immediately handed them \nover to Harris and Klebold. Four months later, Harris and Klebold used \nall three of those guns in their murderous rampage.\n  This is what Ms. Anderson said during her testimony:\n\n       Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had gone to the Tanner gun \n     show on Saturday and they took me back with them on Sunday. . \n     . . While we were walking around, Eric and Dylan kept asking \n     sellers if they were private or licensed. They wanted to buy \n     their guns from someone who was private--and not licensed--\n     because there would be no paperwork or background check.\n\n  That was her statement to the committee in the Colorado House. As all \ncan see, they had one mission: to avoid a background check.\n  I am the author of a piece of legislation we tried to get through the \nSenate that said we ought to have everybody available for a background \ncheck. We know those unlicensed dealers who were able to sell at these \ngun shows--and there are over 4,000 gun shows a year--unless a State \nlaw says no, can sell guns to anybody who has the money. They can put \nthem in the back of their car. They can carry them on their shoulder. \nEven someone who is listed on the 10 Most Wanted--criminals--could \nqualify to buy a gun from one of these dealers.\n  Tragically, these three young people found three gun dealers, and \nthey bought their deadly weapons. This is what she had to say about gun \nsales at gun shows:\n\n       It was too easy. I wish it had been more difficult. I \n     wouldn't have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a \n     background check.\n  Robyn Anderson said that in front of the Colorado legislature. This \nshows clearly that background checks for gun sales can make a \ndifference. They can keep guns out of the wrong hands.\n  When the National Rifle Association says that our gun laws are \nsufficient, it is wrong. They are simply out of line. There is a \nglaring loophole--the gun show loophole--which Congress must close.\n  There is no more time for delay. The American people are requesting \naction, demanding it, if you look at surveys. I hope my colleagues will \ncomplete action on the juvenile justice bill because it did contain a \nprohibition on gun sales that are done at gun shows without a \nbackground check. Now, that was knocked out of the House bill as it \ncame over to the Senate for conference. But the fact is that it was in \nthe Senate bill, and we ought to include it in any bill that finally \npasses. Let's do it before we mark the anniversary of that terrible day \nat Columbine High School, showing that we are serious and that we care \nabout what happened.\n  In the nine months since April 20, we have seen more terrible \nshootings and bloodshed. In May of last year, a teenager in Conyers, \nGA, shot and injured six of his classmates. In July, a gunman in Ohio \nshot three teenage girls and the teacher of a Bible study group. In \nAugust, a white supremacist stormed into a Jewish community center near \nLos Angeles and shot two children and a senior citizen. Later that day, \nbefore this culprit was apprehended, he shot and killed a postal \nworker. In September, more gun violence--a gunman in Fort Worth, TX, \nwalked into a Baptist church and killed seven young people who were \nthere for a prayer meeting before shooting himself. In November, the \nworst mass shooting in Hawaii's history--a Xerox employee killed seven \ncoworkers. Yet another school shooting in December--a seventh grader in \nFort Gibson, OK, takes his father's gun to school and wounds four \nclassmates.\n  That is what we see. It doesn't matter what the heritage is of the \nindividuals; race or religion doesn't matter. Everybody is subject to \nthis kind of violence if they are in the wrong place at the wrong time. \nThese are just the shootings that got the most attention. Month after \nmonth, the death toll from gun violence continues to mount. From \nColorado to Georgia, from Ohio to California, from Texas to Hawaii, \nfamilies across this country continue to mourn.\n  What do we do here in Congress about it? Nothing. It is a disgrace.\n  Of course, the Senate did pass several reasonable measures as part of \nthe Juvenile Justice bill, including the amendment I mentioned before, \nwhich would prevent criminals from being able to buy guns at gun shows.\n  Technically, this legislation is stuck in a conference committee. For \nthose who are not part of the structure here, the conference committee \nis where legislation is finally resolved when the House committee and \nthe Senate committee, with similar jurisdiction, meet together and \nargue out the differences, if any, in a bill. But it would be more \naccurate to say that it is being held hostage by the extremists at the \nNRA and the politicians who march lockstep to their commands.\n  We have to free this legislation, and we dare not let the gun lobby \nprevail over the vast majority and the will of the American people who \nsimply want to make their families a little safer.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in pushing the congressional \nleadership to finish work on the juvenile justice bill. We want to do \nit before there is another episode of gun violence, another loss of \nlife that could be avoided. We have to do more to stop the gun \nviolence, the epidemic that lies within our country. I hope we will be \nable to do it soon.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/09/senate-section/article/S555-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S555-S556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DERRICK THOMAS\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I come to \nthe floor today. Just a few days ago, on February 1, I came here to \ntalk about a professional football achievement, congratulating the St. \nLouis Rams on their Super Bowl victory. It was a tremendous victory.\n\n[[Page S556]]\n\n  Today, I come to the floor on what may seem to some to be another \n``football story,'' albeit one that is much more tragic. I want to make \nremarks about my friend, Kansas City Chiefs' linebacker Derrick Thomas. \nI want to talk about more than just professional sports. I believe what \nis important in life is not what game you play but how you play the \ngame to which you are called. I want to share my thoughts on a young \nman who was a true professional.\n  Yesterday, the Kansas City Chiefs' great linebacker, Derrick Thomas, \ndied of cardiorespiratory arrest, a complication from a tragic \nautomobile accident of January 23. The accident occurred on a snow and \nice-covered stretch of Interstate 435 in Clay County, MO, as Derrick \nand two of his friends were headed to the airport to fly to St. Louis \nfor the NFC championship game between St. Louis Rams and the Tampa Bay \nBuccaneers. To Derrick's many loyal fans, the news of his death is \nstunning and saddening--profoundly saddening.\n  The life of Derrick Thomas, who lived but 33 years, should be \ncelebrated. His accomplishments on the field and off the field were \nsubstantial. An All-American at the University of Alabama, he became an \ninstant star with the Kansas City Chiefs after his selection in the \nfirst round of the 1989 draft. He was named as an All-Pro in each of \nhis first nine seasons in the league. Derrick ranked ninth on the all-\ntime list in career quarterback sacks.\n  Chiefs fans will never forget the day in 1990 when No. 58 set the \namazing single-game record of seven sacks in a game against the Seattle \nSeahawks on Veterans Day. What some people don't know is that Derrick \ndedicated his efforts on Veterans Day to his father, an Air Force pilot \nkilled in Vietnam in Operation Linebacker II when Derrick was just \nfive.\n  The fighters from nearby Whiteman Air Force Base periodically do a \nfly-by during pre-game ceremonies. The planes, according to Derrick \nThomas, reminded him of his father and provided inspiration for some of \nhis greatest and most spectacular performances. I have been at \nArrowhead Stadium before games for those pre-game ceremonies, when in \nthe parking lot there was tailgating, with the smoke from the barbecue \nand the roar from the jets as they crossed the field in a fly-by. It is \na moving experience, but it moved none of us as much as it moved \nDerrick Thomas, who set records based on the inspiration that reminded \nhim of his dad.\n  Derrick will, no doubt, enter the pantheon of Kansas City's great \nathletes--George Brett, Tom Watson, and Len Dawson, just to name a few. \nBut Derrick's accomplishments off the field are worthy of note as well. \nHe was that kind of special star who took all that he gained from his \ntalents and gave back with generosity, energy, and joy to his \ncommunity. Very early in his career as a Kansas City Chief, he began an \ninner-city reading program called the ``Third and Long Foundation.'' As \npart of it, he read to children at local libraries on Saturdays when he \nwas home in Kansas City during the season.\n  He was No. 832 among President George Bush's celebrated ``Thousand \nPoints of Light.'' He was named the NFL's Man of the Year in 1993. Two \nyears later, he received the Byron ``Whizzer\" White Humanitarian Award \nfrom the NFL Players Association for his service to the community. In \naddition, he received the Genuine Heroes Award from Trinity College in \nChicago.\n  But more important than accolades from several foundations was the \nlove and respect directed toward Derrick by the people of Kansas City. \nThey understood that Derrick helped bring an invigorated sense of civic \npride and community and togetherness to Kansas City, and the Chiefs \nfans were inspired by his sunny smile, his giving heart, and his \nwinning ways. The arrival of Carl Peterson and Derrick Thomas to Kansas \nCity marked the resurrection of Lamar Hunt's historic franchise. The \npeople of Kansas City loved Derrick Thomas--as a Chief and as a person. \nCarl Peterson, at yesterday's news conference, clearly communicated his \ndeep respect and profound joy in his association with Derrick.\n  Others expressed themselves eloquently as Kansas City Chiefs fans \nwho, visiting the Web site on the Sports Illustrated chat room, left \nremarks about this great football player. The first remark I would like \nto call to your attention is from a fan who calls himself ``Frank L.'' \nIn a frank evaluation, perhaps, he put it this way:\n\n       Thanks for everything, D.T. [Derrick Thomas]. You helped \n     bring our city to life and gave us a common cause. While \n     doing that you helped a lot of those less fortunate. Now you \n     are with your father that you always talked about and never \n     knew. Back here in the land of the free and the home of the \n     Chiefs we will never forget you. God bless your soul.\n\n  That line back there, ``in the land of the free and the home of the \nChiefs,'' is the way they sing the anthem at the stadium. They didn't \nwant to say the ``brave,'' so they said the ``Chiefs.'' Derrick knew \nthat and enjoyed it.\n  Listen to what a fan, called Big58, says. And, of course, we all know \nDerrick was No. 58. He wore that number on his jersey. A fan who \nidentified himself as Big58 said:\n\n       I can't believe that Derrick is gone. He was one of my \n     heroes for more than a decade now. Derrick did so much for \n     the Kansas City community and the people here. It wasn't \n     loved in KC because he was such a great athlete. He was loved \n     in KC because of the person he was. The time and money he \n     gave to help the kids of the Kansas City community was \n     enormous. And who can forget his Veterans Day performances \n     dedicated to his father who was killed in Vietnam? They were \n     always D.T. at his best. At least D.T. will have some great \n     company along with our Lord in Heaven. I'll bet he's chasing \n     around Walter Payton right now. And ya know what, Derrick \n     will finally get to spend time with his Dad. We love you \n     and will miss you Derrick. Rest in Peace.\n\n  And finally, not only are Chiefs fans saddened, but others who \nrecognized his talents as well. Listen to what Lance Reynolds had to \nsay:\n\n       I have been a Raider fan for over 20 years. Derrick Thomas \n     single handedly ruined at least a dozen Sunday afternoons for \n     me; destroying O-tackles, tight-ends and quarterbacks of the \n     Silver & Black. The Raiders-Chiefs rivalry runs deep. Even \n     though, I have found myself pacing the Chiefs sidelines the \n     past couple of weeks avidly cheering for Derrick Thomas' \n     quick recovery. Today I find myself amongst the millions \n     mourning his death. Derrick Thomas, you wickedly ruthless \n     foe, God Bless You! You are already missed!\n\n  From time to time, we are compelled to pause and consider the real \nand lasting value of the things we hold dear. For Missouri football \nfans like me, today is a reminder that, as much as we love the game, it \nis just a game.\n  To those to whom we look for examples, we extend our thanks, and we \ngive our thanks to Derrick, for he was one who excelled not just on the \nfield but inspired us by an example and called us to our highest and \nbest.\n  Friends such as Derrick Thomas are a rare and special gift to each of \nus. We will miss him. Our prayers are with his family his friends and \neach other as we, his fans, across the Nation and certainly across \nMissouri and Kansas City are saddened by this very substantial loss.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, I want to take some time today to express \nmy outrage with the way the federal government has handled its \nresponsibility to remove and store nuclear waste from 41 states across \nthe country and to outline my thoughts on the bill before us. I'm also \ngoing to speak about my expectations for the future of nuclear energy \nand the future of nuclear waste storage in the State of Minnesota.\n  First, I hope the Senate will indulge me while I review the process \nthat has brought all of us here today.\n  As everyone in this chamber knows, Washington's involvement in \nnuclear power isn't new. Since the 1950's\n\n[[Page S557]]\n\n``Atoms for Peace'' program, the federal government has promoted \nnuclear energy, in part, by promising to remove radioactive waste from \npower plants.\n  Congress decisively committed the federal government to take and \ndispose of civilian radioactive waste beginning in 1998 through the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, and its amendments in 1987.\n  This is nothing new. Eighteen years ago Congress decided that the \nFederal Government was going to take this waste beginning in 1998, and \nalso by amendments in 1987 reestablish those facts.\n  These acts established the DOE Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste \nManagement to conduct the program, selected Yucca Mountain, Nevada as \nthe site to assess for the permanent disposal facility, established \nfees of a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour on nuclear-generated \nelectricity--and provided that these fees would be deposited in the \nNuclear Waste Fund. Furthermore, it authorized appropriations from this \nfund for a number of activities, including development of a nuclear \nwaste repository.\n  Eventually, publication of the Standard Contract addressed how \nradioactive waste would be taken, stored, and disposed of. The DOE then \nsigned individual contracts with all civilian nuclear utilities \npromising to take and dispose of civilian high-level waste beginning \nJanuary 31, 1998--over two years ago. Other administrative proceedings, \nsuch as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Waste Confidence Rule, told \nthe American public that they should literally bank on the federal \ngovernment's promise.\n  In other words, take this promise to the bank.\n  I think this point needs to be clearly understood by the Members of \nthis body.\n  Our nation's nuclear utilities didn't go out and invest in nuclear \npower in spite of federal government warnings of future difficulties. \nInstead, they were encouraged by the federal government to turn to \nnuclear power to meet increasing energy demands.\n  Utilities and states were told to move forward with investments in \nnuclear technologies because it's a sound source of energy production.\n  And the federal government's support for nuclear power was based on \nsome very sound considerations.\n  First, nuclear power is environmentally friendly. Nothing is burned \nin a nuclear reactor, so there are no emissions in the atmosphere. In \nfact, nuclear energy is responsible for over 90 percent of the \nreductions in greenhouse gas emissions that have come out of the energy \nindustry since 1973. Between 1973 and 1996, nuclear power accounted for \nemissions reductions of 34.6 million tons of nitrogen oxide and another \n80.2 million tons of sulfur dioxide.\n  Second, nuclear power is a reliable base load source of power. \nFamilies, farmers, businesses, and individuals who are served by \nnuclear power are served by one of the most reliable sources of \nelectricity.\n  Third, nuclear energy is a homegrown technology, and the United \nStates led the way in its development. We have long been the world \nleader in nuclear technology and continue to be the largest nuclear-\nproducing country in the world. Using nuclear power increases our \nenergy security.\n  Finally, much of the world recognizes those same values and promotes \nthe use of nuclear power because of its reliability, its environmental \nbenefits, and its value to energy independence.\n  Because of those reasons, the Federal Government threw one more bone \nto our Nation's utilities. It said if you build nuclear power, we will \ntake care of your nuclear waste, we will build a repository, and we \nwill take it out of your State.\n  In response to those promises--again, those promises the Federal \nGovernment said you can take to the bank--over 30 States took the \nFederal Government at its word and allowed civilian nuclear energy \nproduction to move forward.\n  As I mentioned earlier, ratepayers agreed to share some of the \nresponsibilities but again were promised some things in return. They \nagreed to pay a fee, attached to their energy bill, to pay for the \nproper handling of the spent nuclear fuel, in exchange for assurances \nthat the Federal Government meet its responsibility to manage any waste \nstorage challenge. Again, contracts were made, contracts were signed.\n  Because of these procedures and measures taken by the Federal \nGovernment, ratepayers have now paid over $15 billion, including \ninterest, into the nuclear waste fund. Today these payments continue, \nexceeding $1 billion dollars annually, or about $70,000 for every hour \nof every day of the year.\n  In summary, the Federal Government promoted nuclear power, utilities \nagreed to invest in nuclear power, States agreed to host nuclear \npowerplants, and ratepayers assumed the responsibility of investing in \nlong-term storage of nuclear waste.\n  Still, nuclear waste is stranded on the banks of the Mississippi \nRiver in Minnesota and on countless other sites across the country \nbecause the Department of Energy has a very short-term memory, and this \nadministration has virtually no sense of responsibility. We can all \nargue all day long on the floor of this Chamber on the merit of nuclear \npower, but we cannot stand here today and deny that the Federal \nGovernment promoted nuclear power and promised to take care of nuclear \nwaste and that there is nuclear waste piled up around the country.\n  The Clinton administration, however, would have you believe that they \ndo not have a responsibility to deal with nuclear power. I have been \nworking with Senator Murkowski and many other Members over the roughly \n5 years I have been in the Senate to establish an interim repository \nfor nuclear waste and to be able to move forward with the development \nof a permanent repository. We have brought a bill to the floor that \naccomplishes those objectives in each of the past two Congresses. Each \ntime, we passed the bill in both the House and the Senate with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. Just over 2 years ago, we passed by a \nvote of 65-34 a bill that would have removed nuclear waste from States, \nand the House passed the bill with 307 supporters--a veto-proof \nmajority in the House.\n\n  We have had extensive debate with the opportunity for anyone to offer \namendments. We have thoroughly addressed most issues related to nuclear \nwaste storage, including the transportation of waste across the United \nStates. Yet every time we have passed a bill that fulfills the Federal \nGovernment's commitments, President Clinton has issued his veto threat \nand he has stopped our efforts in their tracks.\n  After years of trying to establish an interim storage site, we are \nnow left with only the ability to make some smaller changes to the \nnuclear waste program and condition the date for removal of waste on \nthe authorization for construction of the permanent repository.\n  I want to tell my colleagues that I am not overly joyous about the \nbill before the Senate today. In fact, I don't think this bill does \nenough. But I don't blame those who support the bill for what the bill \ndoes not do, and neither should anyone else across the Nation or anyone \nhere in Congress. If anyone is at fault for the lack of a definite \naction and definitive action on this issue, it is the Clinton \nadministration.\n  As my colleagues are very well aware, my main concerns with the \nnuclear waste storage issue have centered on two major issues. First, \nthe ratepayers of Minnesota have paid countless millions into the \nnuclear waste fund, and they expect nuclear waste to leave Minnesota at \na reasonable date. More specifically, Minnesota ratepayers expect \nnuclear waste to leave our State no later than beginning on January 31, \n1998. We all know that it didn't, and we all have known it won't be \nleaving anytime soon no matter what we do this week in the Senate.\n  Second, because the State of Minnesota recognized in the early 1990s \nthe Federal Government would not meet its obligation to remove spent \nnuclear fuel from the State by January 1998, it placed a limit on the \namount of onsite waste storage at Northern States Power Company's \nPrairie Island Facility. Northern States Power agreed to that limit. \nBut it now appears the State-imposed limit for this onsite storage will \nbe reached sometime in the year 2007, and then two nuclear reactors \nthat produced 20 percent of Minnesota's electricity will be forced to \nshut down.\n\n[[Page S558]]\n\n  At a time when we are trying to reduce carbon dioxide, sulfur \ndioxide, and other emissions across the country, Minnesota will be \nlosing 20 percent of its emissions-free electricity generation, and it \nwill be replaced with fossil fuels. The loss of those two reactors also \nmeans increased costs to ratepayers, as Minnesotans will continue to \npay in their rates for the operation of the nuclear facility even after \nit is shut down. Security will be needed, people will have to remain \nonsite to monitor both the waste in casks and the spent rods and the \nstorage pool.\n  Water systems will have to remain working, as will any emergency \nresponse teams. In fact, the costs of operations may not reduce much at \nall. The ratepayers will pay the bill and they will get nothing for it. \nSo there are some big problems that need to be addressed in my State, \nand it will require the participation and also the leadership of the \nFederal Government.\n\n  While this bill does not immediately fix either of these concerns, it \ndoes make some progress that I believe is important to move forward. \nFirst, while this legislation doesn't move waste from Minnesota or any \nother State on a specific date, it does advance the removal date by \nallowing the construction of an early acceptance facility upon approval \nof construction for the permanent repository. Right now, that would \nmean sometime in late 2006 or sometime early 2007.\n  Under the current situation, we won't move waste until the permanent \nrepository is built and operating--and no one is quite sure when that \nwill be. We thought we had a date certain for the removal of waste--\nagain, going back to the old contracts, bills passed in 1982, that it \nwould begin no later than January 31, 1998. Again, the Department of \nEnergy ignored it as if it didn't exist, that the contracts they signed \ndidn't matter, and had no bearings. They continue to do the same yet \ntoday.\n  This bill tries to establish a reasonable threshold for the \nconstruction of an early receipt facility. I think that is something \nthat is achievable. The bill protects ratepayers by requiring that only \nCongress can undertake actions which would raise the fee paid by energy \nconsumers into the nuclear waste fund. The Secretary of Energy will not \nbe able to act unilaterally to raise that rate.\n  He says he would like to take control, or take title to the nuclear \nwaste, and they would pay for the facility and all the storage. But the \nonly way they would do that is to go back to the ratepayers, or the \ntaxpayers, for more money to take care of a problem they have ignored.\n  Third, this bill will put in place transportation provisions for \nnuclear waste that are similar to those now in the place for the \ntransport of low-level waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Project in \nNew Mexico.\n  Fourth, this bill tries to establish a mechanism by which we can \navoid unreachable regulations governing the radiation standard for the \npermanent repository. The EPA should not be allowed to unilaterally set \nan unreasonable radiation standard aimed solely at ensuring the \npermanent repository is never built.\n  The radiation standard should protect long-term human health and \nshould be based on the best science available--but it should not be a \nbullet aimed at the heart of the permanent repository.\n  Fifth, this bill addresses the problems just across the Minnesota \nborder with Dairyland Power Cooperative. They have been requesting and \nneeding some relief from their specific problem and have tremendous \nsupport in Minnesota.\n  In fact, the Minnesota Rural Electric Association strongly supports \nthis bill for that very reason.\n  Sixth, I believe this bill is a step forward for nuclear power. There \nare provisions in the bill that allow for additional research into the \ntransmutation of nuclear waste and the viability of reprocessing. \nSenator Domenici and I traveled to France and examined their waste \nprogram and reprocessing facilities.\n  France has taken our technology and used it to create an amazingly \nintegrated and well planned program that allows them to derive over 80 \npercent of their electricity from nuclear power. For them, our \nfascination with nuclear waste is perplexing. They can deal with their \nwaste.\n  I stood on the floor under which all of their nuclear waste is now \nstored. We need to take another look at how we think about both nuclear \npower and nuclear waste storage and this bill allows for that to \nhappen.\n  Seventh, this bill does not include everything I believe it should. I \nhave tried to address the situation with Northern States Power but \nright now we do not have a perfect answer. I believe keeping Prairie \nIsland open and operating will require the cooperation of NSP, the \nSecretary of Energy, the States of Minnesota, and those of us in \nCongress.\n  I will be pushing Secretary Richardson to come to Minnesota to sit \ndown with the state legislature, the Governor's Office, NSP, and me to \nsee if we can find some common ground.\n  I have also received the assurance of Senator Murkowski that the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee will not forget about Minnesota \nand that he will continue to work with me on this important matter as \nwell.\n  I am also pleased that Senator Murkowski agreed to include some \nlanguage I proposed which will aid in the process of addressing \nMinnesota's situation. My language has two specific components which \nwill aid decisionmakers in Washington and in Minnesota throughout the \ncoming months and years.\n  The first part of my language requires the DOE to report on all \nalternatives available to NSP and the Federal Government which would \nallow NSP to operate the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant until \nthe end of the term of its current NRC licenses, assuming existing \nState and Federal laws remain unchanged.\n  I want to get the DOE engaged in discussions and cooperation with the \nState of Minnesota and NSP on this matter. Unfortunately, I have not \nseen a willingness within federal agencies to work with the State of \nMinnesota and NSP on what options might exist that would facilitate a \nresolution of this dispute.\n  I want to get everyone working together on this problem now, not 6 \nyears from now when a shutdown is imminent.\n  Additionally, my language will require the General Accounting Office \nto issue a report on the potential economic impacts to Minnesota \nratepayers should the Prairie Island facility cease operations once it \nhas met its state imposed storage limitation--including the costs of \nnew generation, decommissioning costs, and the costs of continued \noperation of on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel storage.\n  I am hopeful this information will give both policymakers and \nratepayers a clearer indication of exactly what a shutdown of the \nfacility means not only to the reliability of their electric service, \nbut to the checkbooks of Minnesota families as well.\n  Finally, I believe it was vitally important that we removed the take \ntitle provision from this legislation. I do not believe we should give \nthe DOE any further opportunities to leave waste where it now sits. \nAllowing the DOE to take title to waste is a dangerous proposition for \nratepayers.\n  I was proud to join Senators Collins, Snowe, and Jeffords in offering \nthe amendment to delete the take title provision and I am grateful \nSenator Murkowski deleted the take title provision from the manager's \namendment as well.\n  While these components will certainly be helpful to my State, I know \nthere will be some in Minnesota who'll want me to oppose this bill \nbecause it does not go far enough. But I do not believe I would be \nserving the interests of my constituents by voting against a good bill \nthat might help Minnesota ratepayers because of what is not in it.\n  I should not vote against a good bill because it is not a perfect \nbill. And I cannot vote against a bill that might move waste out of \nMinnesota sooner than under current conditions, because it does not \nmove waste out as soon as I would like. I intend to vote in support of \nthis bill because I believe it is an important bill.\n  I intend to vote for the bill because I want to remain part of this \nprocess and because I do not believe Minnesota can withdraw itself from \nthis debate. And I intend to vote for this bill because I believe this \nis part of a process in restoring government accountability in the \nnuclear waste debate.\n\n[[Page S559]]\n\n  I may be back asking for more or looking for other opportunities to \nhelp my State and my State's ratepayers. I do not consider this matter \nclosed either in Minnesota or in Washington, DC.\n  I want to take just a moment to thank Senator Murkowski for his \nwillingness to work with me and to continue to explore ways in which we \ncan help my State. His staff have remained open to our concerns and \nwilling to work with my staff.\n  They have been honest about what they cannot do--and I appreciate \nthat as well.\n  I also want to issue a warning and a challenge to my colleagues in \nthe Senate. Let us not assume that this is a great victory for \nratepayers or for our States.\n  This legislation does not fulfill the Federal Government's commitment \nto remove nuclear waste.\n  Regrettably, this bill is but a shell of the bills we have passed \nwith bipartisan support in each of the last two Congresses. So we \nshould not go home and tell our constituents that this matter is \nresolved or that our work here is finished.\n  I am a little biased, but I hope we have a totally new direction in \nthe White House after next year. I hope that translates into a \nwillingness to engage Congress and the States on nuclear waste issues \nrather than the protracted effort to ignore Congress and the States \nthat this administration has relied upon.\n  I believe we are going to have that new direction and I am going to \nbe back asking that administration to move forward immediately on \ninterim storage.\n  If this administration is unwilling to provide the American people \nwith the services for which they have paid, I hope and expect they will \nmake sure the next administration will do that and live up to the \npromises it made.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/09/senate-section/article/S559-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 106-21\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.
