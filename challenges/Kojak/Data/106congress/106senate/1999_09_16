It is always great to see our distinguished President pro \ntempore, Senator Thurmond, here and opening the Senate proceedings. We \nare thankful this morning that his State was spared the kind of \ndevastation it seemed to be facing just a couple of days ago. It looks \nas if the hurricane has dropped in power and there has not been the \ndamage and devastation that was expected from the hurricane, although \ncertainly there are people this morning who are very uncomfortable \nwithout power and there have been some lives--I believe a couple--lost \nas a result of accidents.\n  I am from a hurricane-prone State, Mr. President. I have lived \nthrough three major ones, including one last September, so I know how \ndifficult it can be for those who have had to endure this experience. \nSo I don't take bad weather lightly. But we have been watching very \nclosely the path of this hurricane and its strength and where it is \nheaded. I spoke early this morning to the Sergeant at Arms, Mr. Ziglar, \nand to Senator Barbara Mikulski. Typically, Senator Mikulski calls and \nsays, ``I am coming, unless you say don't come.'' I told her to come. \nWe believe that while we are going to have some wind and rain today, \nthe brunt of the hurricane has been diminished and it will go east of \nthis area. So the Senate will go forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S10963-6", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10963-S10964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this week we have some legislation we must \ncomplete because we do have a Jewish holiday Monday and Tuesday, with \nthe first vote not occurring until next Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Then we \nhave to do the HUD and Veterans appropriations bill next week, which I \nam sure will take at least the remainder of that week, 3 days.\n  So here is what we have to do today and tomorrow if necessary. We \nwill vote at 10:10 on the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations \nconference report. We hope to be able to stack at that time a second \nvote on the Transportation appropriations bill now pending before the \nSenate. Senator Shelby is here and working on an amendment or \namendments we may have to deal with. So we will just have to see how \nthat is going to work out. But we want to complete all amendments and \nhave final passage on the Transportation appropriations bill, and \nprobably we need to have a recorded vote on that so we will not be \nfaced with having to find\n\n[[Page S10964]]\n\ntime for a recorded vote after it comes back from conference.\n  Then we will probably move to the Defense authorization conference \nreport which was completed by the House just yesterday. The conferees \ndid a great job. This is a good bill, and we need to get that vote \nestablished.\n  We also have pending the District of Columbia conference report. I \nunderstand some time may be needed to talk about it and a recorded vote \nwill be required, but we will do that today or tomorrow if that is \nnecessary.\n  In addition, we are working to clear three judges. One of them may \nrequire some time, but we can do that today and tonight or tomorrow.\n\n  If the weather does become a concern later on in the day, \nmidafternoon, and it is necessary for us to quit early because of the \nconcern for safety, we will be back at 9:30 Friday to complete this \nlist of items. I would like to be able to say let's take a rain day and \ngo home, but we do not have the time to do that. I do not think it is \nreally necessary. So we will begin immediate consideration of the \nTransportation appropriations bill, and when the amendments are worked \nout and a final vote can occur on final passage, we will notify the \nMembers, but we will have a vote at 10:10. We do expect votes \nthroughout the day. We will watch the weather. And we do have the \noption of being in from 9:30 until noon tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I understand we have some \nmorning business requests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S10964-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are nearly to the point--\nnot quite--where we would like to go to third reading of the bill.

Mr. President, I have an amendment that I send to the \ndesk and ask unanimous consent that it be considered in order.\n  Mr. SHELBY. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1678.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert:\n       Sec.   . It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary \n     should expeditiously amend Title 14, Chapter II, Part 250, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, so as to double the applicable \n     penalties for involuntary denied boarding and allow those \n     passengers that are involuntarily denied boarding the option \n     of obtaining a prompt cash refund for the full value of their \n     airline ticket.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I offer today a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment on an issue that, unfortunately, is becoming more of a \nproblem for American travelers; that is, the experience of passengers \nwith paid reservations being bumped from overbooked plane flights.\n  Our skies are more crowded than they have ever been. People need to \nmove quickly between different cities to do business and also for a \nwide variety of personal reasons. As this need has grown, people who \nfly find themselves increasingly at the mercy of casual airline booking \npractices. In such cases, airlines do not treat people as they should. \nThese are passengers with paid reservations. They have a right to \nexpect a seat on the flight they book, but too often they discover that \nhaving a ticket does not mean much when they get to the gate.\n  Nothing ruins a business trip, a vacation, or other trip more \nthoroughly than being bumped from a flight. It is sometimes impossible \nto make up for the lost hours and the lost opportunity, let's say, to \nattend the funeral of a friend or relative. That opportunity is never \nagain presented. There is the frustration of rearranging longstanding \nbusiness or personal plans or rearranging the connection that one takes \nfrom a city a couple hundred miles away from a major hub, and then \nmissing a flight to Europe or to the Far East.\n  I understand the airlines have a problem. I respect that they would \nlike to find a solution to the problem. They should not have to fly \nwith empty seats without an opportunity to cover their costs. Perhaps a \ndeposit on a flight reservation, or something of that nature, ought to \nbe done. But it sure ought not to be simply at the whim of a gate \nattendant to decide who is going to fly and who is not.\n  On a personal note, I had that experience. I had paid for the \ntickets. I had a reservation number--with two tickets. I got to the \nairport, and they said: The flight is full. There was about 15 minutes \nleft before departure, and they said: Well, sorry, just too many people \nshowed up.\n  What happened is they oversold the flight. The airlines should not be \nable to act as an elitist business. They should have to treat their \ncustomers with respect. They are the only legitimate business I know of \nthat deliberately sells a product that they know they can't deliver.\n  When people attend a sporting event or a concert or the theater, they \nknow when they get there that they are going to have the seat for which \nthey paid. They deserve the same assurance when they fly.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate amendment should encourage the airlines to \nact more responsibly, by allowing travelers who are bumped from a \nflight to receive greater amounts of compensation for the airline's \ncasual action. The amendment calls for the applicable penalties to be \ndoubled from those under current regulation.\n  The goal is to hold the airlines accountable when they put profits \nahead of their friendliness and respect for their customer.\n  People who travel for business or personal reasons should not miss \nout on an event they planned because the airlines decided to treat them \nlike baggage and said: Well, we can't take all this baggage.\n  So I plan to continue to fight to ensure that airlines are \naccountable to the American public.\n  I want to acquaint my colleagues with current regulations pertaining \nto passengers that are bumped involuntarily.\n  Currently on the books, an airline must first request passengers with \npaid reservations to voluntarily give up their seats. We know that.\n  If a passenger is involuntarily bumped and delayed less than an hour, \nthe passenger is not entitled to any compensation--if you can make the \ntrip within an hour from the scheduled time of departure.\n  Delays between 1 and 2 hours, the passenger can receive 100 percent \nof the cost of the remaining ticket to the destination but not more \nthan $200; delayed more than 2 hours, the passenger\n\n[[Page S10965]]\n\ncan receive 200 percent of the cost of the remaining ticket but not \nmore than $400.\n  Other details: Instead of cash, the airline can offer free or reduced \nair transportation at equal or greater value than the amount of the \ncash compensation.\n  So what we are doing is we are saying: A, these rules are not \nadequately enforced; B, the public is ignorant of what kind of redress \nthey have if they get bumped off a flight and the airlines are not \nadequately informing them of what they are entitled to; and C, the \nairlines must act more responsibly, toward the passenger and be more \nconcerned about what is happening with the passenger.\n  The airlines owe this to the public. They use our national resources. \nThey use the nation's airspace. They use the FAA system. They use our \ntaxpayer investments in airports. They are using public money all over \nthe place. They ought to be more cognizant of what it is the flying \npublic should have in return.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, is the pending business the Lautenberg \namendment that was just offered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SHELBY. We have examined it, and we have no problem with it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the manager.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1678) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 10 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, with the vote on adoption of the \nconference report to immediately follow.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate \nthe conference report on H.R. 2490, the Treasury and General Government \nAppropriations Act, 2000.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing staff be accorded floor privileges during the consideration \nof this conference report: Tammy Perrin, Lula Edwards, Chip Walgren, \nand Dylan Presman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to approve this \nconference report. Because of the budget constraints, we were not able \nto give everything that everyone wanted, obviously; but that is \ncertainly what compromise is all about. It took us 6 weeks to get this \nreport to conference, by the way.\n  At the outset, I thank the ranking member of the Treasury \nSubcommittee, Senator Dorgan, and his staff for all of their valuable \nassistance and support during that process.\n  The conference report provides a total of $28,239,811,000, of which \n$13,706,000,000 is discretionary spending. We have provided funding \nnecessary for the Department of the Treasury, the United States Postal \nService, the Executive Office of the President, and various independent \nagencies to move into the new millennium.\n  Here are some of the highlights of this conference report.\n  The conference provided $12.32 million to the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms to Expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction \nInitiative. This is $1.12 million more than the requested level, and \nbrings the total funding for this very effective program to $51.32 \nmillion.\n  The conference also provided $13 million to ATF for grants to State \nand local law enforcement to allow participation in the Gang Resistance \nEducation and Training (GREAT) Program. The GREAT Program provides our \nyouth with the tools they need to resist the powerful pull of gangs and \nhas been highly successful as a deterrent to the growth of youth gangs.\n  The conference report provides funding for the continued operation \nand growth of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. We are still \nvery much committed to the consolidation of training for Federal law \nenforcement officers at FLETC. After completion of the five-year \nconstruction master plan, FLETC will be better able to serve the \ntraining demands of most Federal law enforcement agencies.\n  For the Customs Service, the conference has provided $4.3 million for \npre-hiring polygraph examinations and $2.5 million for the creation of \nthe Office of Assistant Commissioner for Training to continue integrity \nefforts begun last year.\n  The conference has funded the Customs Cyber-Smuggling Center at $4 \nmillion, which is a $1.6 million increase over last year.\n  The conference has provided full funding for the Internal Revenue \nService to allow them to fulfill the requirements of the Restructuring \nand Reform Act, to proceed with their much-needed organizational \nmodernization plan, and to continue necessary improvements in customer \nservice. This funding also provides $6 million for grants to low income \ntaxpayer clinics.\n  The conference has increased funding for the very critical technology \ntransfer program under the Drug Czar's Office. This $13.25 million \nprogram provides drug interdiction technology to State and local law \nenforcement. For fiscal year 2000, the funding was increased by more \nthan $10 million over the administration's request.\n  The conference has provided $185 million for the continued operation \nof the national youth anti-drug media campaign, and $192 million for \nthe popular and effective high intensity drug trafficking areas (HIDTA) \nProgram. In addition, the conference has included funding for a \nmanagement review of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) \nby an independent entity in an effort to strengthen the office's \noperations and programs.\n  The conference included a combined total of $2 million for the model \nstate drug law conferences and the National Drug Court Institute, \nprograms which assist State and local enforcement in combating the end \nresults of drug addiction and resulting crimes.\n  Mr. President, again I say that everyone did not get everything, and \ncertainly everybody doesn't agree with every provision of this bill. \nBut I think it is a very worthy conference report, on balance, and I \nthink we brought to the Senate an excellent product. It certainly \ndeserves the support of the entire Senate and signature of the \nPresident.\n  I again thank my friend and coworker, Senator Dorgan, for his hard\n\n[[Page S10966]]\n\nwork, and also the staff we depended very heavily on this time around, \nincluding Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, Lula Edwards, of the majority \nstaff, Barbara Retzlaf, who left a couple weeks to go to the Commerce \nDepartment, Chip Walgren, and Dylan Presman.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes, I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am concerned about how this appropriation fits into the \noverall caps on Federal expenditures for domestic discretionary \nprograms that were adopted in 1997, and then the more recent \nrecommendations of the Congressional Budget Office, which were the \nbasis of the tax bill we passed earlier this summer. Could the Senator \nindicate, is this budget, in terms of its total appropriation, \nconsistent with the 1997 Balanced Budget Act and the CBO recommendation \nof 1999?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent \nthat an additional 5 minutes be added to the 10 minutes for any other \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I say to the Senator that we did try to \nstay within our allocation, as you know. We had many more requests than \nwe were capable of dealing with and our allocation was raised by $100 \nmillion. So we did stay within that. We simply could not fit all of the \nrequests in the original amount we were allocated.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In relationship to the Congressional Budget Office \nrecommendations of this summer, does the Senator know where this \nappropriation would be?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. To my knowledge, we have a number of bills we still \nhave to complete. I believe by the time we have finished, we will still \nbe within the budget caps. But I have no way of telling before all the \nother bills are through.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, with respect to the question offered by \nthe Senator from Florida, my understanding is that the caps established \nin the Balanced Budget Act represent aggregate caps and one can have \nindividual subcommittees coming out with spending levels, and if those \nspending levels in the aggregate, with all the subcommittees, exceed \nthe caps, you have a problem.\n  This particular subcommittee has worked very hard to try to produce \nan appropriations bill that is responsible. Nearly one-half of all \nFederal law enforcement is in this particular subcommittee. People do \nnot understand that. But Customs, Secret Service, and a range of other \nlaw enforcement activities to fight drugs and crime exist in this bill.\n\n  Almost one-half of Federal law enforcement is in this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I will not repeat what the Senator from Colorado described about what \nwe did in the subcommittee. But I think it is responsible and \nthoughtful and most every Member of the Senate thinks it is a pretty \ngood investment.\n  One of the things we didn't do in this piece of legislation is fund \ncourthouse construction. Does there need to be some money invested in \ncourthouses around the country to rehab some old courthouses and \nrebuild some? Yes, but we simply didn't have the money. We were short \nof resources. We had to make some difficult choices. That was one of \nthem. It is not that the Senator from Colorado and I believe there is \nnot a need; there is a need. But we just weren't able to respond to \nthat.\n  I would like to add to his comments with respect to the work that has \nbeen done both in the Senate and in the House of Representatives on \nthis bill.\n  On my staff, Chip Walgren, Barbara Retzlaff, and Dylan Presman did \nexcellent work, and Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, and Lula Edwards of the \nmajority staff have done wonderful work.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with Senator Campbell. He is easy to \nwork with. He is thoughtful and wants to do the right thing. It is a \npleasure to work with someone with that kind of interest.\n  The subcommittee bill is a piece of legislation that strengthens the \nGovernment's commitment to fight drugs and crime, and the Department of \nthe Treasury, as I indicated, has a critical law enforcement role. That \nis funded in this piece of legislation.\n  One of the pieces of legislation inside this bill is called the GREAT \nProgram--Gang Resistance Education and Training Program.\n  One day not too long ago, I was invited to go over to Anacostia to a \njunior high school for a ceremony where some young kids were graduating \nfrom the GREAT Program, the Gang Resistance Education and Training \nProgram. This is a school, by the way, that has had significant gang \nproblems and a great deal of crime.\n  One of the police officers who is assigned to that school full time \ncame to the meeting we had on Capitol Hill. He was describing the \nproblems in that school--horrendous problems. We called to see if \nperhaps the GREAT Program could be taken to that school because they \nweren't participating. That program was taken over to the school, and \nthe first graduates received their diplomas.\n  I went over that day with the commissioner. It was really quite \nremarkable. It is a wonderful program to invest in to try to educate \nyoung people about the dangers of gangs and drugs and crime.\n  Part of this legislation is to make the right kind of investments to \nprevent activities in this country that we know are destructive.\n  This piece of legislation continues to reform the IRS. It modernizes \nthe Federal Election Commission. Several pieces we have put in this \nbill are the first steps in modernizing the FEC --the first steps that \nhave been taken for a long, long while.\n  I commend this legislation to my colleagues. I hope my colleagues in \nthe Senate will approve the work of this subcommittee. The conference \nwith the House was difficult, but I think it produced a result that is \nfair and one that will merit the support of the Members of the Senate.\n  Again, I thank Senator Campbell, who I think does a remarkable job, \nand his staff and the staff that has worked so hard on my behalf on the \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the conferees of \nthis bill for their work on this legislation which provides federal \nfunding for many vital programs. However, I regret that this \nappropriations bill continues the unwise practice of including \nunacceptable levels of parochial projects. This year's Senate bill \ncontained a little over $293.6 million in earmarked pork-barrel \nspending. This year's conference report is a drastic improvement in \nthat it only contains $91.2 million in wasteful, pork-barrel spending. \nAlthough $91.2 million of waste is better than $293.6 million of waste, \nwaste is still waste.\n  As my colleagues know, I have consistently fought Congressional \nearmarks that direct money to particular projects or recipients. I \nbelieve that such decisions are far better made through nationwide \ncompetitive, merit-based guidelines and procedures.\n  We must stop this destructive and irresponsible practice of \nearmarking special-interest pork-barrel projects in appropriations \nbills primarily for parochial reasons.\n  Where does all this pork go? This bill contains millions of dollars \nfor court house construction and repairs. There is $1,600,000 earmarked \nfor repairs and alterations to the Kansas City Federal Courthouse in \nKansas City, Missouri, and $1,250,000 for repairs and alterations to \nthe Federal Courthouse in New York, New York. Although these \ncourthouses may need repair and modernization, are these particular \nprojects more important than the other courthouses competing for \nfunding? The process by which these two earmarks were added makes it \nimpossible to evaluate the relative merit of these programs against \nother priorities.\n  In addition to earmarks for courthouses, this bill contains the usual \nearmarks of money for locality-specific projects such as $212,000 for \nrenovations to the Louisville International Airport in Kentucky, and \n$250,000 to the Fort Buford Historic Site in North Dakota for research \nand cataloging of records of this Fort.\n  Then there are the many sections of the report which have language \nstrongly urging various Departments of the\n\n[[Page S10967]]\n\nFederal Government to recognize or participate in a joint-venture with \na particular project in a state. While these objectionable provisions \nhave no direct monetary effect on the bill, this not-so-subtle \n``urging'' will have some financial benefit for someone or some \nenterprise in a Member's home state. For example, there is report \nlanguage urging the continuation and expansion of the collaboration \nbetween the University of North Dakota and the Customs Service for \nrotorcraft training. There is also report language urging GSA to \nstrongly consider the U.S. Olympic Committee's need for additional \nspace and to give priority to the USOC's request to gain title or \nacquire the property located at 1520 Willamette Avenue in Colorado \nSprings, Colorado.\n  This bill also selects sites across the country for which the report \nlanguage ``urges'' the Agency not to reduce its staff. For example, \nthere is report language providing that no reorganization of the \nInternal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division will result in \na reduction of criminal investigators in Wisconsin and South Dakota \nfrom the 1996 level.\n  Why are these facilities protected at a time when each agency is \nrequired to abide by the Government Program Reduction Act which \nmandates that they operate more efficiently with less bureaucracy? Even \nif these positions are critical, they should be prioritized in the \nnormal administrative process.\n  Mr. President, although we have not yet done so, we are very close to \nbreaking the spending caps. I hope my colleagues understand that merely \nbecause we can fund these programs of questionable merit within the \nspending caps, that does not entitle us to spend the taxpayers' hard-\nearned dollars irresponsibly.\n  The examples of wasteful spending that I have highlighted are only a \nfew of the examples of earmarks and special projects contained in this \nmeasure. There are many more low-priority, wasteful, and unnecessary \nprojects on the extensive list I have compiled. I ask that the list be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to develop a better standard to curb \nour habit of directing hard-earned taxpayer dollars to locality-\nspecific special interests.\n  The list follows:\n\n  Objectionable Provisions Contained in the Conference Report on H.R. \n 2490, The Treasury Department, the United States

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to explain why I voted ``no'' on \nthe Treasury Postal Appropriations conference report.\n  First, I am concerned that the contraceptive mandate included in the \nTreasury/Postal Appropriations bill is a precedent setting attempt to \nmandate coverage of abortifacients that have been approved--or will be \napproved in the future--by the Federal Food and Drug Administration.\n  Second, I am concerned that this mandate constitutes an attempt to \neventually force providers who have either a moral or religious \nobjection to abortion services to provide those services, or lose the \nability to provide health care within the Federal Employee Health \nBenefit Plan. The FEHBP mandate does not have adequate conscience \nclause protection for sponsors of health plans and individual providers \nwho are opposed to providing such drugs and devices. Conscience clause \nprotection for individual providers needs to be clarified to protect \nany health care provider, including but not limited to physicians, \nnurses and physician assistants who object to providing these drugs or \ndevices on the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions.\n  Third, this misnamed ``contraceptive'' mandate is being used to help \n``mainstream'' abortifacient drugs to which many health professionals, \npharmacies, and patients have serious objections. It reduces federal \nemployees' freedom to choose the health benefits they want; ignores \nhealth plans' potential moral objections; and increases pressure on \nhealth professionals to ignore their own conscientious convictions. All \nof this, ironically, is done in the name of ``freedom of choice.\n  Fourth, I do not believe that the federal government should issue \nhealthcare mandates. Mandating the FEHBP providers cover contraceptives \nas part of their health plan constitutes the first time in the history \nof the FEHBP that Congress has issued a mandate on a coverage.\n  Fifth, I am also concerned that this may be the first step by some in \nCongress to issue a similar mandate on private insurers. Such a mandate \non private insurers will drive up costs and lead to uninsurance at the \nmargins.\n  Therefore, because of the inclusion of this provision in the \nconference report I voted ``no.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S10968-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10968-S10969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT--\n                               Continued\n\n\n                             Change Of Vote\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

This \nwill not change the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am eager for this bill to be complete. I \ndon't intend to offer an amendment, but I would like to say a couple of \nwords.\n  I am somewhat taken by the fact that suddenly the Senate is made up \nof numerous Members who want to run the airlines. We have undertaken \ntremendous efforts to be elected to the Senate. In doing so, we have \ntaken up a high calling. We have a responsibility in American \nGovernment.\n  But for some reason, yesterday and today, all of a sudden Members of \nthe Senate have decided we ought to take it upon ourselves to tell the \nairlines in the United States how they ought to be run, and we want to \ndo it without the inconvenience of having to go out and invest billions \nof dollars.\n  My point is a very simple point. That is, for some reason --I don't \nknow if it is the weather, the change in the barometric pressure, \nwhatever--suddenly Members of the Senate have become experts in running \nairlines, all without the inconvenience of having to go out and raise \nmoney or invest their own money and without the inconvenience of having \nto take responsibility if their plans go bad.\n  My basic view is that we have good airlines in America. All of us \nhave had bad experiences on airlines: The weather went bad. We have had \nexperiences where we bought a cheaper ticket and would have liked to \nhave flown on a different flight. We wanted a cheap fare, but it would \nhave been nice had they let us fly on the other flight.\n  The point is, we deregulated the airlines. We have benefited from a \ndramatic decline in the cost of air transportation. Millions of average \nAmericans have moved out of the bus station and into the airport. Now \nall of a sudden it has become the popular mania in the Senate to want \nto start having the Congress--in this case, the Senate--run the \nairlines. I just didn't want it all to pass without making some comment \non it.\n  I thank the Chair for the time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1679\n\n (Purpose: To make available funds for the monitoring and reporting on \n  the transfer of passenger air transportation tickets among airlines)\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Daschle, Senator Wyden, and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is in order for the \nSenator to submit the amendment on behalf of the minority leader. The \nclerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for Mr. Daschle, \n     for himself, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Wyden, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1679.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 65, line 22, before the period at the end of the \n     line, insert the following ``: Provided, it is the sense of \n     the Senate That the funds made available under this heading \n     shall be used for the submission to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress by the Inspector General, not later \n     than July 15, 2000, of a report on the extent to which air \n     carriers and foreign carriers deny travel to airline \n     consumers with non-refundable tickets from one carrier to \n     another, including recommendations to develop a passenger-\n     friendly and cost-effective solution to ticket transfers \n     among airlines when seats are available.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I think my good friend, the distinguished Senator from \nTexas, might be referring to me and others, but I assure him that I \nhave no intention of trying to run an airline. I am challenged at this \nmoment to run my office. I am trying to do a good job at that and to \nrepresent the 4.5 million people who live in my State, which is the job \nof all Senators.\n  I come to the floor with great humility. The last thing I want to do \nis run an airline. I think the deregulation of the airlines has brought \ngreat benefits to our Nation and to this industry. I have no intention \nat all of moving the clock back.\n\n[[Page S10969]]\n\n  I do think--because so many people now, and growing by leaps and \nbounds, use air travel in our Nation and the world to conduct their \nbusiness, which is very dependent on the efficiency of the system, and \nbecause this is a very important industry in our Nation, and because \nthe Senate is responsible for giving guidance to many industries--that \nmy amendment is most certainly appropriate.\n  I have asked it to be a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to ask for a \nstudy to be done this year that would ask the airlines to find a cost-\neffective way and a passenger-friendly way for the transfer of tickets \nbetween airlines to facilitate the convenience of our constituents who \nlive in Texas and in Alabama and Louisiana and Montana and Ohio and \nHawaii and all of our States--and in Kansas, particularly in Kansas, \nright in the middle there, people need to get out and about and around.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to present this sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment. I am sorry if there are others who will object, but I \nthink it is an important amendment. I offer it in serious fashion for \nthe Senate's consideration.\n  Senator GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I do object to this amendment.\n  Here is the issue in a nutshell. It happens all the time. Someone \nbuys a discount ticket. They get a lower price. They get a lower price \nbecause they commit that they are going to use that ticket on that day \nand they are going to use it as a through ticket. If it is round trip, \nthey commit they are going to use it going and coming.\n  What happens is, they get to the airport early. They find out there \nis another flight going exactly where they want to go that is getting \nthere an hour earlier. So they go to that other airline and say: Will \nyou take my excursion ticket or my discount ticket? The airline says: \nYes, we have an empty seat; we would like to have the money. But they \ngo on to say: The airline you bought the discount ticket from does not \nallow us to take this excursion ticket.\n  Now, why is that? Basically when they entered into a contract with \nthe airline, they got the discount fare because they committed to fly \non that plane on that day.\n  Now, they could have gotten a ticket that would have allowed them to \nchange airlines, but they would have had to pay a higher price for it. \nMany people agonize constantly when they go on vacation and buy a \ndiscount ticket and have to lock in those tickets in advance. It can be \nmisery wondering whether or not you are actually going to be able to \nleave that day. But the point is, the reason you are getting the lower \nrate is you are committing to use the full ticket.\n  So the original way the amendment was written is subject to rule XVI. \nThe amendment was not filed at the desk prior to the deadline. I don't \ndoubt anybody's intention, but it is not the sense of the Senate--at \nleast this part of the Senate--that we ought to be getting into the \nbusiness of trying to tell airlines how their ticket structure should \nbe made. If you don't want to buy a discount ticket, don't buy it. But \nthe idea that we are going to set up a study where we are going to have \nthe Government recommend to Congress, and we are going to begin to try \nto change laws that say you can have a discount fare, and then you can \ndo things that the discount fare is not based on, that violates the \ncontract.\n  The contract you entered into with the discount ticket is a contract, \nwhereby you agreed you are going to use that ticket on that day or you \nare going to lose it. It might be convenient to change the day. It \nmight be convenient to fly on another airline, which would mean that \nthe airline you entered into the discount fare with would lose their \nhalf of the fare to another airline. But the point is, that is a \nviolation of the contract. I don't need the Government to study whether \nor not we ought to abrogate private contracts.\n  Therefore, I object to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from Louisiana--\nis the Senator making a point of order against the Senator's amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am. It was not timely filed at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana asked unanimous \nconsent to offer her amendment on behalf of the distinguished minority \nleader, who does have a reserved amendment under the agreement. The \nSenator's amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. Therefore, it \nis not legislation; as such, rule XVI does not apply.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S10969-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10969-S10970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A PILOT SHORTAGE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to bring before the Senate my \nobservations of a hearing that we held in Montana last Friday. It had \nto do with a pilot shortage in this country, something we have heard \nvery little about but which some of us are quite concerned about.\n  The hearing examined the impending problem. After the hearing was \nover, I will say it is moving from impending to maybe an acute pilot \nshortage, with the factors that contribute to that possibility. I think \nthe results of that hearing are very serious. I think it is certainly \nserious to the citizens of Montana and rural States on routes not \nheavily traveled.\n  Now, because the national economy has done fairly well, we have seen \na tremendous expansion in airlines, the major airlines--the \n``transcons,'' we call them. When business is good, they expand. Of \ncourse, expansion means hiring more pilots at almost record numbers, it \nseems. That creates a problem because pilots who start to work for the \nmajors usually are drawn from the pool of pilots who fly for the local \nservice or regional airlines.\n  Now, what happens when these pilots are taken up? Regional and local \nservice carriers get caught with fewer pilots, and that means, more \ntimes than not, canceled flights. We always wonder why they cancel a \nflight. Sometimes it is because we are just short of pilots. If this \ncontinues, then it is routes such as we find in rural areas in Montana \nthat suffer--some of those routes might even be abandoned. So it \ndoesn't take a doctorate in economics to figure out that the flights \nand routes that are canceled in these situations are those that are the \nleast profitable; and the sad part, the less profitable a particular \nroute tends to be for an airline, the more important it tends to be for \nthe people who live in that region.\n  As you know, Montana is a very large State. I was struck the other \nday that in a new route that had been put in, nonstop, from Missoula, \nMT, to Minneapolis, MN, the flying time is 2 hours 5 minutes, and the \nfirst hour is all spent in Montana. So we understand distances. If a \nregional airline is the only carrier serving a particular community and \nit cancels that route, what are the residents of that community \nsupposed to do then? Air service is an essential lifeline to many \nindividuals and communities. In fact, we have communities that are \nessential air service communities that have no buses and they have no \nrails. There is no public transportation, other than the local service \nairline. So our participation in the EAS, the essential air service \nprogram, has been a solution to that issue in the case of smaller, \nisolated communities, but it is jeopardized by operators who want to \noperate the routes but we have a shortage of pilots.\n  Now, we talk about this business of the major airlines, and services, \nand the rights of passengers. Let's take a look at some of the basic \nproblems. Maybe some of those problems are because of us. Who knows?\n  Historically, the military has always supplied many pilots to the \nindustry. But a large number of pilots who were trained by the military \nduring the Vietnam era are getting to the point where they have to \nretire because of Federal regulations.\n  Since the 1950s, airline pilots have had to retire when they reached \nthe\n\n[[Page S10970]]\n\nage of 60. I will tell you that some pilots aren't ready to retire at \nthe age of 60. In fact, some pilots shouldn't be retired at 60. They \nare still able, physically fit, and mentally fit to fly airplanes past \nthat age of 60. The age of 60 does not affect everyone the same way. In \nfact, I was thinking the other day that 65 doesn't sound nearly as old \nas it used to. But some pilots are fit enough to keep on flying.\n  I understand there is great opposition to changing that rule until I \nlook around the world and see what is happening when we have pilots \nflying major airlines in American airspace that have no age limit at \nall. Eight countries that fly into and connect into the United States \nhave no age limit at all. In other words, if that pilot is 65, and fit \nmentally and physically, he still is a captain of that airplane. I \nthink we have to take a look at that.\n  Also, I find it disturbing that the Federal Government can apply a \nblanket regulation, such as the age of 60 rule, determining that a \npilot exceeding that age is considered a hazard. I cannot accept that \nat all.\n  There is also some question about flight and duty time rules that \ncould worsen the pilot shortage and impact air service to those rural \nareas. I want the Appropriations' Subcommittee on Transportation and \nthe Subcommittee on Aviation of the Commerce Committee to be aware that \nI think this issue needs a hearing in Washington at the full committee \nlevel to make them aware that we may be overlooking some things at the \nroute level that could help us in providing more air service to this \ncountry.\n  We all say our skies are full. Do you realize that commercial air \nservice--basically 85 percent of the air service in this country--takes \nup only 5 percent of the airspace because of an old, outdated system \nthat we have for vectoring and ITC across this country?\n  I think maybe we should look at that. I appreciate the time given me \nby the chairman and the ranking member this morning.\n  But that is the result of the hearing we had in Kalispell, MT. I \nthink Senators should take a look at this and offer some comments. But \nI think we should have a hearing on this particular problem in \nWashington at the full committee level.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S10970-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10970-S10971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution by the Senator from Louisiana. She asked for a study, which \nin this place is a relatively harmless gesture. But what I hear in \nresponse is that suddenly the Senate wants to be an expert on airlines. \nNo. I don't see it that way. What I see is that we are experts on \nprotecting the public. That is our responsibility. That is why we are \nsent here--to take care of the public and not to take care of the \nairlines ahead of the public.\n  The airlines are wonderful companies. But they are not beyond \ncriticism. They have what amounts to a very uneven playing field. They \nget their slots. The facilities are paid for by the airline passengers, \nnot the airlines. The airlines have unlimited use of our nation's \nairspace. They get preferential treatment. They have an air traffic \ncontrol system paid for by the taxpayers in this country.\n  There is an objection that I hear to this study that is proposed by \nthe Senator from Louisiana.\n  When we get discount tickets, that is not a freebie. It is a \nmarketing calculation. The airlines say you can buy a discount ticket, \nand we are going to make it up elsewhere, and make it up elsewhere they \ndo. No one is objecting to that. That is their marketing scheme.\n  I have some objection to the fact that in one case flying down from \nthe New York area costs, at a government rate, $165, and if you fly out \nof another airport right nearby it is $38. Why? Because one airline has \na stranglehold on the traffic at the costlier airport.\n  I am going to relinquish the floor momentarily.\n  I want it abundantly clear that this Senator makes no apology for \ndefending the public first before defending the airlines. I hope the \npublic will take note of this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana for working with me. I think we have worked out language that \nI can live with and which I think basically does what she wants, which \nis gather information, and then as a policy-making arm of government we \ncould choose how to deal with it and what to do with it.\n  I will not object to the modification of her amendment. I think it \ndeals with that problem.\n  I say to the Senator from New Jersey that it is a stormy Thursday and \nwe all want to finish the bill. But my objection is for preserving \nprivate property with the sanctity of contracts and free enterprise. If \nthe government could run airlines better we all would be trying to \nrebuild our airlines based on the Soviet model. It didn't quite work \nout that way. We had an empirical test in the world, and our approach \nwon.\n  I am not trying to defend any interest here other than private \nproperty and contracting, and simply noting that for some reason on \nthis stormy day all of a sudden everybody wants to run the airlines.\n  I want to especially thank the Senator from Louisiana. She has been \nvery kind to me. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have a few observations. My friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, makes a lot of sense a lot of times. \nI agree with him most of the time. I especially agree with him on this. \nWe certainly don't want the Government running the airlines. We want \nthe airlines to be as responsive as they can be to the public, which is \ntheir customer. That is all of us. We have benefited.\n  As the Senator from Louisiana said in her remarks, we have benefited \nimmensely from the deregulation of the airlines. We want to keep it \nthat way. I want to deregulate just about everything I can think of, or \nsee, or feel, because I think there is a benefit.\n  The Senator from Texas is absolutely right. There is something in \nprivate enterprise and a contract, and we should respect that. We have \nto respect that. But I hope the airlines are getting the message that \nwe are getting from the public that there is a lot of unrest out there. \nMaybe it is lack of communication with the public. But if I buy a \nticket and if it is a special ticket, I know it is a special ticket. \nThat is a contract. I know that if I don't use it, I guess I will lose \nit. I certainly can't skip around on it. Maybe that is a communications \nproblem with whoever is purchasing it. But whatever we do, let's not \never have the Government running any business, especially the airlines.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the willingness \nof the Senator from Texas to work out the objection but to maintain a \nstrong amendment in addressing the sense of the Senate to look into \nthose issues because if there is a way this can be worked out that \nbenefits the airlines and the passengers, I think we most certainly \nshould be about doing that.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his comments because, while \nwe all want to see the deregulation work, I think we can all agree it \nis not perfect and that we could make some good suggestions as to how \nto improve it to keep the private contracts between the airlines and to \nhonor the sanctity of those private contracts and private arrangements. \nThis is a very public business, as is all business. There is a private \nside and there is a public side. That is why we have a public sector \nthat does the job we do and a private sector that does the job they do. \nWhen we work together, the public is served in the best way. That is \nall this amendment attempts to do.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama, our distinguished leader on this \nissue, for helping work this out.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1679, as Modifed\n\n  I submit a modified amendment to the desk. I don't think it will be \nnecessary for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S10971]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modifed.\n  The amendment (No. 1679), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 65, line 22, before the period at the end of the \n     line, insert the following ``: Provided, That it is the sense \n     of the Senate funds made available under this heading shall \n     be used for the submission to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress by the Inspector General, a report on the extent to \n     which air carriers and foreign carriers deny travel to \n     airline consumers with non-refundable tickets from one \n     carrier to another.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this managers' amendment has been cleared \non both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1680) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n            stevenson expressway/wacker drive rehabilitation\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Fitzgerald, and I \nwould like to engage the distinguished chairman of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Shelby, in a brief colloquy \nregarding the Stevenson Expressway and the Wacker Drive rehabilitation \nprojects.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Senator Shelby knows both of these projects are \nvitally important to the Chicago metropolitan region's transportation \nsystem. The Stevenson carries 135,000 vehicles per day, including \n24,000 heavy trucks, and is 15 years beyond its design life. Wacker \nDrive, in downtown Chicago, built in 1926, is also well beyond its \ndesign life. It carries 60,000 vehicles per day. Both projects are high \npriorities of the Illinois Congressional Delegation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. During congressional consideration of TEA-21 last year, \nthese projects were partially funded and further identified as \nexcellent candidates to receive funding from U.S. Department of \nTransportation discretionary funds. These projects have subsequently \nreceived some discretionary funding and are eligible to receive \nadditional funds this year. Does the Senator agree that both of these \nprojects are good candidates for discretionary funding in FY 2000?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senators from Illinois for drawing attention \nto these projects. I agree that both the Stevenson Expressway and \nWacker Drive rehabilitation projects are eligible for federal \ndiscretionary funds from the U.S. Department of Transportation under \nthe approach adopted in the Senate bill.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. We thank the chairman for his remarks.\n\n\n                        upper cumberland airport\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the \nTransportation Appropriations Committee, Senator Shelby, for his \nwillingness to discuss an important aviation issue for Tennessee. \nSpecifically, the Upper Cumberland Regional Airport's critical need for \ntaxiway and safety improvements.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I am aware of this project, and would like to strongly \nrecommend that the FAA give priority consideration to this request for \ndiscretionary funding. The Grants-In-Aid for Airports program is \ndesigned to provide federal assistance to airports like the Upper \nCumberland Regional Airport for vital safety enhancements and other \nimprovements as my friend from Tennessee mentioned.\n  Mr. FRIST. The Senator's willingness to offer support for this \nproject in Cookeville, Tennessee is greatly appreciated. I'm certain \nthe FAA will take note of the Chairman's support and give this project \nevery consideration.\n\n[[Page S10973]]\n\n               muskegon coast guard seasonal air facility\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMichigan to engage the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee in a colloquy regarding the Coast Guard's proposal to \nclose the seasonal air facility in Muskegon, MI. On July 13th, we wrote \nthe distinguished Chairman to seek his assistance on this issue and \nattempted to explain the necessity to keep this facility open.\n  Mr. President, in that letter, we described how on February 3rd of \nthis year, we wrote the Commandant of the Coast Guard and the Secretary \nof Transportation asking for a detailed explanation of this proposal in \nlight of what appeared to be a dramatic reversal on the \nAdministration's part given its previous statements as to both the \ndesirability of Muskegon and the overall need for a southern Lake \nMichigan seasonal facility.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. These letters, Mr. President, closely follow the letters \nthe entire Michigan delegation sent the Chairs of both the House and \nSenate Appropriations bills. Although we have been briefed by the Coast \nGuard regarding this proposal, we have not received a formal response \nfrom the Commandant or the Secretary.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are concerns within the Michigan delegation, Mr. \nPresident, that the proposal to close Muskegon may have been due to the \nCoast Guard's constrained funding and was not necessarily based on an \nanalysis of the safety needs of boaters on Southern Lake Michigan.\n  Mr. President, it would appear premature to close the facility at \nMuskegon given the investment made by both the Coast Guard and the \nlocal community to establish this seasonal facility. In choosing to \nlocate the facility in Muskegon in the first place, the Coast Guard \nprojected large cost savings that would not be fully realized if the \nstation were closed.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am aware of this issue due to the \ndiligence of the Michigan Senators, and I understand the concerns they \nhave regarding Coast Guard's proposal. I have seen the amendment filed \nby colleagues from Michigan to ensure the continued search and rescue \ncoverage from the Muskegon Air Station during the high-traffic summer \nseason. While I would be concerned if the closure of this facility \nwould cause a degradation of search and rescue capability, it is not \npossible at this point to incorporate such legislative directives to \nthe Coast Guard given the large number of other legislative initiatives \nregarding Coast Guard facilities that have been presented to the \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I understand the difficulty the \ndistinguished Chairman has in opening up such a panoply of Coast Guard \nissues to resolve this one problem. However, I would like to bring his \nattention to page 21 of House Report 106-180 to accompany JR 2084, the \nHouse Transportation Appropriations Act for FY 2000 where it directs \nthat the Muskegon seasonal air facility operations continue through FY \n2000.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am aware of House action on this matter \nas well as the Senators' role in bringing about that action and of \ntheir steadfast commitment to improving boating safety. I can assure \nthe Senators from Michigan that I will support directing the Coast \nGuard in the final Transportation Appropriations Act for FY 2000 to \nkeep the Muskegon seasonal Air Facility open.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, that assurance is important and welcome, \nand I believe I speak for the entire Michigan delegation in thanking \nthe distinguished Chairman for his support and in committing our \nefforts to assist him in any way he may need to see this provision \nincorporated into the final Transportation Appropriations Act for FY \n2000.\n\n\n                      Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road\n\n  Mr. GORTON. The Middle Fork Snoqualmie valley is 110,000 acres of \nforests, mountains, and rivers located just 45 minutes east of Seattle. \nNinety-eight percent of the land is public ownership. In recent years, \nthe valley has been plagued by dumping, indiscriminate shooting and \ngeneral lawlessness. Strong efforts are being made, however, by federal \nagencies and conservation groups to turn the valley back into a place \nsafe for recreationists. No other place in the Northwest presents such \nan opportunity to create a first-class recreation area so close to \nmillions of people.\n  A key part of turning this valley back into an attractive place is \nproviding better and safer access. The present road into the valley is \nunpaved, potholed and dusty. An improved, paved road would provide \nsafer, more pleasant access and allow for better law enforcement.\n  The Federal Highways Administration, Western Federal Lands Division, \ncurrently has $5 million budgeted for a new Middle Fork highway. Local \nconservation groups in my state, however, feel that the kind of highway \nwhich the F.H.W.A. builds would amount to massive overkill. The \nF.H.W.A. is restricted by its design standards to build only one kind \nof road--a highway in every sense of the word, with huge cuts and \nfills, broad sweeping curves and a wide swath cleared of trees on both \nsides. Conservationists feel that such a highway would destroy the very \nqualities which make the Middle Fork valley an attractive place.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I understand the concerns of the Senator of Washington \nand his desire to provide adequate access to an important area in his \nstate without disrupting its unique attributes. I would be happy to \nwork with Senator Gorton, the Federal Highway Administration, and other \ninterested parties to resolve this issue.\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate the Senator's interest and would like to \nexplore a proposal submitted by my constituents interested in \npreserving and enhancing the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Valley. I believe \nan appropriate solution would be to transfer the monies appropriated to \nthe Federal Highway Administration for this road project to the U.S. \nForest Service, giving the U.S. Forest control over design of the road. \nThe Forest Service is not so rigidly bound in its design standards as \nthe Federal Highway Administration, and could construct a paved road \nwhich closely follows the alignment of the existing road and goes \nthrough the woods. Such a road would provide much improved access \nwithout compromising the valley's integrity. I look forward to working \nwith my colleague from Alabama.\n\n\n                   Intelligent transportation system\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to engage the Chairman of \nthe Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy regarding \nthe Intelligent Transportation System program. Mr. President, I was \nvery pleased that the report accompanying S. 1143, the Senate \nTransportation Appropriations bill for FY 2000, contained direction \nthat Southeast Michigan receive no less than $4 million for ITS \ndeployment projects. I was particularly pleased with that designation \nas I had requested the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee \nprovide $3.5 million for the Southeast Michigan Snow Information \nManagement System, and wish to thank the distinguished Chairman of the \nSubcommittee for that designation. Does the Chairman believe such a \nfurther designation for this particular project would be in order?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I was pleased to support that designation \nin the drafting of S. 1143, and was particularly impressed that it is \nprojected to reduce the cost of winter storm maintenance by 10% in \nSoutheast Michigan, reduce weather-related accidents by 10%, as well as \nreduce by 5% the amount of salt used on those roads, while also \ncreating a model for other states to improve their snow removal \noperations. Because of that, I believe that the Federal Highway \nAdministration should consider the SEMSIM project as the top priority \nproject within that $4 million distribution to Southeast Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I appreciate the Senator's support and clarification Mr. \nPresident, and join him in calling upon the FHWA to quickly provide \nthis additional funding for the SEMSIM project as soon as the \nAppropriations Act is signed into law.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take this opportunity to discuss \nwhat should be done with the remaining $500,000 within that $4 million \ndistribution to Southeast Michigan. Mr. President, I would like the \nChairman of the\n\n[[Page S10974]]\n\nSubcommittee to know that after he had marked up S. 1143, I received a \nrequest from Wayne County in Michigan to support a Roads Infrastructure \nManagement System project that will use Global Positioning Satellite \nsystem technology and data to geocode the existing infrastructure \ninventory over the county's 1,400 miles of roads, such as signage, \nlighting, bridges, and existing utility runs, so as to better identify \nwhere road improvements will be most efficiently executed, and provide \nthe greatest improvements. The ultimate goal is to implement a travel \nrouting system that can be accessed over the Internet by commuters and \nfreight carriers. Having this geocoded inventory will permit the county \nto quantitatively assess and schedule road improvement projects and \nimprove traffic flow.\n  The total cost of a comprehensive Geographic Information System is \nabout $60 million, but Wayne County has already committed $14 million \nto building this base map, and to date, has completed all of it's \ndigital ortho photography at the 6'' pixel resolution. The Roads \nInformation Management System is one of the most costly applications \nwithin this project, and will cost the County $7.4 million. The County \nwas originally seeking $5 million in federal funding, but I believe any \nportion thereof would further this worthy effort.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished Chairman of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee if he could support this \nproject within the existing $4 million designation?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I agree that the RIMS project described by \nSenator Abraham indeed appears to be worthy of federal funding, and I \nwould recommend that the Federal Highway Administration provide funding \nfor this project to the extent possible after fully funding the SEMSIM \nproject discussed before. Furthermore, if the final appropriations bill \nwill provide more ITS money for Michigan, I will press to have both of \nthese projects funded as fully as possible, in accordance with the \nprioritization I have previously discussed.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chairman for his considerable assistance on \nthis matter, and look forward to working with him on this issue as it \nmoves through to final passage.\n\n\n              the incremental train control system (itcs)\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \nManager of this Appropriations Bill regarding funding of specific \nprojects under the Next Generation High Speed Rail Program.\n  Mr. President, I see that the FY 2000 Transportation Appropriations \nBill provides a total of $7.3 million for various positive train \ncontrol projects, and of that amount, $5 million is designated for the \nAlaska Railroad and $1 million for the Transportation Safety Research \nAlliance.\n  Now Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee is well aware, the Administration requested \n$3 million for the Incremental Train Control System (ITCS) along the \nDetroit to Chicago passenger rail corridor in its FY 2000 Budget \nRequest. This project has previously received $6 million in federal \nfunds, and I am very thankful for the designation the Chairman was able \nto convince the Conference Committee to provide this project last year \neven though my request came very late in the legislative process.\n  The reason I believe this project is worthy of specific funding is \nthat it is a key component in the efforts by Amtrak as well as the \nMidwest High Speed Rail Coalition to allow for passenger rail service \nof up to 125 miles per hour, not only along the Detroit to Chicago \ncorridor, but elsewhere as the $3 million requested by the \nAdministration would complete the research of this project, and allow \nthe technology to be applied to other rail corridors across the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I recognize the strict funding constraints the \nSubcommittee faced in drafting this appropriations bill, and the \nsignificant hurdles that had to be overcome in order to find this level \nof funding, but I wonder if the Chairman may be able to comment on the \npossibility that some level of funding could be found for the ITCS \nproject.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his \ncomments, and he is correct, we did face significant constraints \nthroughout this bill which impacted upon the Next Generation High Speed \nRail program. Furthermore, the Administration's funding request for \nthis specific program was funded in part with a recommendation to \ntransfer Revenue Aligned Budget Authority from the State highway \nformula to this and other programs, a proposal which was rejected by \nthe Congress. I believe the Senator from Michigan opposed the RABA \ntransfer from the States in the Budget Committee.\n  However, I believe the unallocated portion of the train control \ndemonstration program under the Next Generation High Speed Rail Program \nshould be allocated to the Michigan ITCS project, and as we enter the \nConference with the House, I will work to ensure adequate funding for \nthis project.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his support of \nthis project, and for his efforts to provide the necessary funds for \nour transportation infrastructure as we enter the 21st Century. I look \nforward to working with him on this program as the bill moves to \nConference.\n\n\n                            pipeline safety\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I rise to request a colloquy with my colleague from \nWashington State, Senator Gorton.\n  On June 10, 1999, 277,000 gallons of gasoline leaded from an \nunderground pipeline in Bellingham, Washington. It ignited and \nexploded. Three people were killed: an 18-year-old young man and two \n10-year-old boys. This is a tragedy.\n  The Office of Pipeline Safety, the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, the FBI, the EPA and State agencies have spent the last four \nmonths trying to determine why this happened. We still don't know the \ndirect cause and may not know for some time.\n  I wish I could say this was an isolated instance, but I can't. Recent \npipeline accidents have occurred in other places. In Edison, New \nJersey, one person died when a natural gas pipeline exploded. In Texas, \ntwo people lost their lives when a butane release ignited. In fact, \nlast November the owner of the pipeline that exploded in Bellingham had \nan accident in another part of my State that took six lives.\n  These pipelines are potential threats. There are some 160,000 miles \nof pipelines in the U.S. carrying hazardous materials. Many of these \npipes run under some of our most densely populated areas; under our \nschools, our homes, and our businesses.\n  I am disappointed that this year the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee did not adequately fund the Office of Pipeline Safety, the \nauthority governing interstate pipelines. I tried to get the \nappropriations in this year's bill to the level requested by the \nPresident. Unfortunately, we were unable to do so. It is my hope we can \nincrease funding in next year's appropriations.\n  I am also committed to strengthening OSP's oversight of pipelines and \ncommitment to community safety in next year's reauthorization of OPS.\n  I will be working with Senator Gorton, who is on the committee, to \nensure greater OPS effectiveness and oversight of the industry.\n  I also want to point out U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney \nSlater's prompt attention to this issue. Immediately following the \naccident, he met with me and granted my request to have a full-time OPS \ninspector stationed in Washington State. He has also been very helpful \nand informative as we've progressed through the investigation phase. I \nthank him. I know he will continue to work with us in the future on \nOPS's appropriations and next year's authorization.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would like to thank my colleague from Washington State. \nShe has been out front on this issue, and I commend her for her \npersistence.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Murray during the \nreauthorization of the Federal Office of Pipeline Safety, a piece of \nlegislation in which I will fully engage when it comes before the \nSenate Commerce Committee next year. While the interstate \ntransportation of hazardous materials in above and underground \npipelines has proven to be the safest and most cost-effective means to \ntransport these materials, the Bellingham tragedy has once again \nalerted us to its tragic potential. During the OPS reauthorization \nprocess I intend to ensure that the Federal law\n\n[[Page S10975]]\n\nand the Federal agency are performing their jobs of ensuring that \ntragedies like the one in Bellingham are not repeated. I will work \nclosely with Chairman McCain, the Majority Leader and my Democratic \ncolleagues to make this a top priority next year.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague. I will also continue to push for \nreform. We must take a long hard look at the effectiveness of OSP's \noversight activities; review ways to develop new technologies for \ndetecting pipeline defects; consider the effect of aging pipelines on \nsafety; review industry's influence on the regulation of pipelines; and \nfocus on our training and testing procedures for inspectors and \nmaintenance workers. I also intend to look at ways to treat \nenvironmentally sensitive and highly populated areas, recognizing the \nmultitude of safety and ecological problems operating pipelines in \nthese places can create.\n  Finally, I will work to strengthen communities' ``right to know,'' so \npeople are aware when there are problems with the pipelines that \nthreaten their neighborhoods.\n  Mr. GORTON. I share the Senator's concerns and I am certain we will \ndeal with those questions and ideas in the context of reauthorization \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you.\n\n\n                lewis and clark bicentennial celebration\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to address a matter important \nto my State's participation in the upcoming Lewis and Clark \nBicentennial celebration. As you and other history buffs may know, the \nCorps of Discovery led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark spent much \nof their travels in what is now my State of Montana. This celebration \nwill have an enormous impact on the State's economy and infrastructure. \nWe have a number of sites on the Missouri River that have retained \nhistoric ferry transportation. Currently, in the Fiscal Year 2000 \nTransportation Appropriations bill, the committee has included $2 \nmillion for the upgrade of the McClelland Ferry. A more fiscally \nresponsible use of these funds would be to spread this funding level \nout over three ferry sites on the historic Missouri River. Those sites \nare the McClelland, Virgelle, and Carter Ferry sites. I would like to \nalso indicate that is important to recognize that these upgrades should \nmaintain all of the historic features of the traditional ferry site. It \nis not my intention to replace these historic ferries with bridge work \nor new ferries.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I appreciate my colleague bringing this issue to my \nattention and am interested in ensuring that scarce Federal \ntransportation resources are used as efficiently as possible. I \nunderstand your concerns and look forward to working with you on this \nissue.\n\n\n          increased funding for u.s. route 2 in new hampshire\n\n  Mr. GREGG. U.S. Route 2 is an important travel and commerce \nthoroughfare in the New Hampshire North Country that runs through New \nHampshire, Maine and Vermont. On January 11, 1999, the New Hampshire, \nMaine and Vermont Senate delegation sent a joint letter to Secretary of \nTransportation Rodney Slater. In this letter the delegation asked \nSecretary Slater to give consideration to a $13 million joint state \ngrant application funded through TEA-21's National Corridor Planning \nand Development Program (NCPD) and Coordinated Border Infrastructure \n(CBI) for U.S. Route 2. The joint New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont \napplication received a total of only $1.5 million in funding for U.S. \nRoute 2. I am sure that the Senator from Alabama would agree that this \nfunding level for U.S. Route 2 is completely inadequate. I ask the \nSenator from Alabama to join me in urging the Secretary of \nTransportation to allocate more funding through the NCPD and CBI for \nU.S. Route\n  Mr. SHELBY. I agree with the remarks of the Senator from New \nHampshire, and I look forward to working with him on this issue in the \nfuture.\n\n\n                                 aovcc\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a brief \ncolloquy with the Chairman regarding some weather observation equipment \nfor the FAA.\n  As the Chairman will remember, last year he was very helpful in \ngetting money in the Department of Transportation Appropriation bill \nfor FY 99 to begin testing of the Automated Observation for Visibility \nCloud Height, and Cloud Coverage (AOVCC) system. Using high resolution \ndigital imaging, laser ranging and high performance computing \ntechnology, the AOVCC system augments the current ASOS by adding the \ncapability to detect fast-moving weather systems in a timely and \nrepresentative manner. Is it my understanding that FAA is currently \ntesting this equipment and it appears that AOVCC is performing up to \nexpectations.\n  Would the Chairman agree that if testing of AOVCC is successful, FAA \nwould make every effort to purchase the AOVCC system to enhance \nexisting weather observation?\n  Mr. SHELBY. If the Senator will yield, this equipment appears to be a \npromising technology which has the potential to greatly enhance safety. \nI would concur with the Senator from Oklahoma that if FAA determines \nthat the test of the AOVCC is successful, every effort should be made \nto purchase this equipment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chairman for his ongoing support of this \nimportant safety equipment.\n\n\n               big mountain road and great falls airport\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I would like to engage my colleague from Alabama on a \nnumber of issues relating to the Fiscal Year 2000 Department of \nTransportation Appropriations bill. Montana's roads and airports are \ninadequately funded. I would like to focus on a couple of projects that \nmust be addressed in the state immediately or we will be facing serious \neconomic loss as a result. The first is the Big Mountain Road. This is \na forest service access road, private property access road and also \nprovides access to Big Mountain Ski area. During the winter when \nconditions are worst, this steep road is traversed frequently and while \nthe road is covered with snow and ice. Montana winter conditions are \nnot friendly to our paved roads. I would like to express my support of \nfunding for this road. In 1996, the state estimated reconstruction \ncosts to be around $6.5 million. The road is presently one of the \nbusiest roads in the state awaiting reconstruction. Mr. Chairman, this \nis no small matter--every year Montanans are either killed or injured \nin accidents on this dangerous road. The freeze thaw conditions we face \nmake this road an important project in our state.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I understand your concerns and agree with you about the \nweather-related burdens on Montana's roads. Such conditions can be very \nharmful to a paved surface.\n  Mr. BURNS. I would also like to address another important matter in \nour state. The Great Falls Airport is the home to a Federal Express \nregional hub. Fed Ex employs numerous employees in the Great Falls \narea. Our problem originated when the FAA mandated the airport find \nanother option for Fed Ex's operations. That mandate has required the \nairport to begin immediate construction of an apron to accommodate Fed \nEx's Great Falls operations. I met with Jane Garvey on this issue and \nwas appreciative of the interest she has taken. Although she and her \nstaff have indicated their support of this project, the FAA is unable \nto provide funding considering the Airport Improvement Program has \nlapsed. Mr. Chairman, dirt has been turned on this project and we \ncannot afford to turn back at this time. Further delays will mean loss \nof revenue, possible job loss and increased funding requirements. \nConstruction season in Montana is short and we must take action on this \nproject immediately. I would like to request your assistance obtaining \nthe $4.5 million required to solve this problem. We will need to \naddress this problem immediately during this year and soon after the \nbeginning of the 2000 Fiscal Year. Thank you Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. SHELBY. We have many airports in need of increased funding. I \nunderstand the nature of your problem in Great Falls requires immediate \nconcern. Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention.\n\n\n                         BULLFROG CREEK BRIDGE\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I want to bring to the Chairman's attention an issue \nthat we would hope to address this year. In Garfield County, Utah, we \nhave what is called the Boulder to Bullfrog Highway which goes from the \ntiny town of Boulder to the Bullfrog Basin Marina at Lake Powell. This \nroad crosses some of the most rugged, scenic and roadless country in \nthe southwest. Headed eastbound, a traveler will cross the Grand\n\n[[Page S10976]]\n\nStaircase Excalante National Monument, Capitol Reef National Park, \nadditional BLM lands and on into the Glen Canyon National Recreation \nArea. It is county-maintained road with a right-of-way crossing federal \nlands.\n  Sections of the road are classified as both improved and unimproved \nmeaning that sections are paved in some places and are gravel or dirt \nin others. Despite this, it is heavily traveled by tourist and locals \nbecause it is the only east-west road for 60 miles north or south. \nDuring the spring and summer, flash floods often will wash out the road \nforcing its closure. This occurs most often near the Bullfrog Creek \ndrainage, where it is not unusual to have a 100 yard section of the \nroad washed out. When this happens, a detour of over 150 miles is \nrequired just to get to the other side of Capitol Reef National Park \nwhich would otherwise be roughly a 30 mile drive.\n  Clearly, there is an public interest in keeping the road open, yet \nevery summer the County and the National Park Service expend \nconsiderable capital and manpower to keep the road open after every \nrain. This situation could be alleviated by placing a series of \nculverts or other type of structures over the Bullfrog Creek drainage \nto keep the road from washing out.\n  With this in mind, I ask the Chairman if he believes it would it be \nappropriate to provide Garfield County, Utah approximately $500,000 \nfrom the Federal Lands Highway account to install a structure to keep \nthe road open throughout the year?\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator raises a very good point. Given the economic \nand public safety impacts on the County when the road is closed as well \nas the potential liabilities for the Federal Government, I will work \nwith the Senator, the House and the Administration during conference on \nthis bill to identify funds for the County to improve this small \nsection of the road.\n\n\n                      public lands highway program\n\n  Mr. REID. I would like to engage my colleague, Senator Shelby, the \nChairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, in a brief discussion \nabout an important program for my home state of Nevada.\n  As my colleagues know, Nevada is a state with a very large amount of \nfederal lands. Nearly eighty-seven percent of the state is federal \nland. In fact, Nevada trails only Alaska in total acreage under federal \ncontrol.\n  As such, Nevada qualifies for preference under the Public Lands \nHighway Discretionary Program portion of the Federal Lands Highway \nprogram, since, in the words of the law, its borders include ``at least \n3 percent of the total public lands in the nation''. (The other states \nare Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, \nOregon, Utah and Wyoming.) This factor, together with consideration of \na state's need, are the only statutory instructions on the awarding of \ndiscretionary funds under Public Lands Highway Discretionary Program.\n  Is the Chairman aware that this body has historically not earmarked \nprojects under Federal Lands Highway program. However, the other body \nhas undertaken to heavily earmark the program this year even though \nthis undercuts the basic intent of Congress in creating the \ndiscretionary program for states heavily impacted by federal land \nholdings.\n  In addition, this earmarking has the effect of reducing the federal \nagencies ability to utilize the program for very urgent needs on \nfederal lands and for which there is simply no other source of federal \nfunds. I have a copy of Nevada's submission to the FHWA for Public \nLands Highways funding in FY 2000. Eight of the nine projects are \nsubmitted by federal agencies.\n  I hope that my good friend and colleague, Senator Shelby, can address \nthis problem in Conference, by reemphasizing the intent of the Congress \nwith respect to this program.\n  Mr. SHELBY. My colleague is exactly right. The Public Lands Highway \nProgram was indeed created to fulfill the long-neglected infrastructure \nneeds of our nations vast holdings of federal lands. I share the \nSenator's commitment to ensuring that public lands states, such as \nNevada, continue to receive the lion's share of funding under this \nprogram. I will also seek to address the Senator's concerns about \nearmarking of this program both in Conference this year and when \ndrafting next year's Transportation Appropriation's bill.\n  Mr. REID. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                maine's advanced wood composites center\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Shelby, and the distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Lautenberg, in a brief colloquy in order to make clear \nthe intent behind some language contained in the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee's report accompanying S. 1143, the FY 2000 Transportation \nappropriations bill.\n  I want to first thank the distinguished managers of this bill for \ntheir assistance last year in securing approximately $1.2 million in FY \n99 funding for advanced engineered wood composites for bridge \nconstruction to be conducted by the University of Maine's Advanced Wood \nComposite Center. As both Senator Shelby and Senator Lautenberg may \nrecall, the University of Maine is the institution that pioneered this \ntechnology and is currently working with the Federal Highway \nAdministration (FHWA) in this area of research and development.\n  On page 95 of this year's Senate Appropriations Committee Report \naccompanying S. 1143, it states in part ``The Committee is interested \nin research to develop advanced engineering and wood composites for \nbridge construction and has provided $1.2 million for that purpose \nwithin this program.''\n  I want to inquire of the distinguished managers of this bill if it is \ntheir intent that the University of Maine's Advanced Wood Composites \nCenter is to receive the funding referenced by this part of the \nCommittee's report, in order that the University can continue to \nsupport FHWA's research in this vital area.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The distinguished Senator from Maine is correct. This \nreport language is intended to convey that it is the Senate's intention \nfor the FHWA to continue its advanced engineered wood composites \nresearch and development program begun last year at the University of \nMaine's Advanced Wood Composites Center. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Maine for giving us the opportunity to clarify our intent \non this matter.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleague for making their intent in this \nrespect clear, and I thank them for working with me on this important \nproject both last year and this year. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                        airline passenger safety\n\n  Mr. REID. I would like to engage my colleague, Senator Shelby, the \nChairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, in a brief discussion \nabout several important programs that impact my home state of Nevada. \nWhile these projects and programs are not currently fully funded in \nthis bill, I am pleased that my colleague, senator Shelby, has \nindicated that he will seek to find resources in the final conference \nreport.\n  The first two programs I would like to discuss today are cutting edge \nresearch and technology programs, ones where relatively small \nallocations of resources can pay huge long-term dividends to consumers.\n  The first research effort I would like to discuss is the Strategic \nAlliance for Passenger Airline Security. A consortium of local, state, \nand private entities, including the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, the \nUniversity of California-Los Angeles, Alaska Airlines, and Certified \nAirlines Passenger Services, a Nevada-based company is working with the \nFAA to develop a decentralized baggage and check-in system that will \nallow passengers to check-in at various remote locations in the city of \norigin, such as hotels, shopping malls, or other aviation check-in \npoints.\n  In a state as dependent upon tourist traffic as Nevada, the ability \nto more efficiently handle arrivals and departures is critical. As \nairports struggle in the coming years to cope with more and more \npassengers in facilities that are unable to expand, alternative, safe, \ntechnologies for keeping passenger and baggage traffic moving will \nbecome critical. I am grateful that my colleague, Senator Shelby has \nrecognized the merits of increased research and development in this \narea. I am looking forward to working with my Chairman on this issue in \nconference and during the upcoming fiscal year. Only by encouraging \ninnovation can the FAA\n\n[[Page S10977]]\n\nhope to keep our Nation's aviation system out of gridlock.\n  The second technology that I want to discuss to day is a Remote \nCertification and Maintenance system, a technology developed by Arcata, \na Nevada-based company.\n  In the Committee-passed version of this bill Senators Shelby and \nlautenberg included language favorable to the remote certification and \nmaintenance technology manufactured by Arcata. It is my understanding \nthat the FAA has informed the Committee of their ability to deploy up \nto $5 million worth of this technology at remote radar centers \nthroughout the nation. As this technology gives older generation radars \nadvanced RMM capability, the cost savings alone make this a worthwhile \ninvestment of our nation's resources.\n\n  Finally, as all of my colleagues are aware, Nevada has been one of \nthe fastest growing states in the nation for most of the last two \ndecades. Southern Nevada attracts nearly 5,000 new residents per month. \nGiven this colossal growth, it is no surprise that the demand for \naviation infrastructure has sky-rocketed in recent years.\n  These increases in aviation traffic in the skies over Southern Nevada \nhave make Contract Air Traffic Control Tower Service at Henderson \nExecutive Airport absolutely critical.\n  A relatively small investment of resources at the third largest \nairport in Southern Nevada will solve what is becoming a sticky air \ntraffic control issue for the Las Vegas Valley, especially in light of \nthe county's decision to move the majority of Grand Canyon overflight \ntour operators from McCarran to the airports in Henderson and North Las \nVegas.\n  Let me be clear, I am not asking for special treatment here. The \nClark County Department of Aviation has recently received independent \nconfirmation of a cost-benefit ratio of over 1.0 (specifically 1.16) \nand expects the FAA to verify that figure in the near future. Any \nrating over 1.0 makes a facility eligible for this funding. The cost-\nbenefit ratio, coupled with Henderson's status as the third rung in a \nmuch more complex air traffic system, make funding for this service an \neasy choice for Congress to make. I am delighted to have your support \nfor the Contract Tower Program and for the specific inclusion of \nHenderson Executive Airport in the program, Mr. Chairman.\n  I appreciate your consideration and look forward to working with you \non these and other important issues in conference.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank my colleague for raising these important issues \nwith me. Even in a tight budget year, such as this one, I agree that \nthese programs and projects have merit and I will work diligently to \nsecure funding for them in the House-Senate Conference or in whatever \nend-of-year mechanism we use to fund transportation in FY 00.\n\n\n                         georgia noise barriers\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the distinguished Chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation yield for a question?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will be happy to yield to the senior Senator from \nGeorgia for a question.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As you know, there are several areas in my state of \nGeorgia where the interstate expanded significantly around existing \nneighborhoods. The Georgia Department of Transportation wanted to put \nup noise barriers to address this situation. TEA-21 provided $750,000 \nfor Type II noise barriers on I-75 in Clayton County and I-185 in \nColumbus, Georgia. It also provided $1.5 million for noise barriers \nalong GA-400, and allowed federal highway funds to be used for noise \nbarriers along I-285. Unfortunately, because of an error in drafting \nthe provisions included in TEA-21, the Georgia Department of \nTransportation is not able to complete these noise barrier projects. I \nhave proposed an amendment which would correct this problem and allow \nmy state to use their apportioned federal highway funds to complete \nthese noise barrier projects. Would you be willing to work with me to \naddress this problem?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will be happy to work with you on this matter during \nconference negotiations with the House. I understand that the Senator \nhad secured a commitment that this matter will be affirmatively \naddressed by the Environment and Public Works Committee in the next \nauthorizing legislation vehicle. I commend the Senator for his \ninitiative, diligence, and hard work on this matter. I will continue to \nwatch and work with the Senator on this important issue for his state.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chairman for his help. I yield the floor.\n\n\n         drexel university intelligent infrastructure institute\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to thank the \nChairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for having \nincluded language in the Senate report urging the Federal Highway \nAdministrator to work with Drexel University to focus on the link \nbetween intelligent transportation systems and transportation \ninfrastructure. As the Chairman knows, for the next several years the \nUnited States will be making massive investments in its transportation \ninfrastructure, and, in view of the limited resources available for \nthese investments, there has never been a greater need to be certain \nthat these expenditures are wisely prioritized and based on sound \nassessments of the structural integrity of the existing infrastructure. \nIn recent years, we have all been gratified to witness the revival of \nmany of our major cities, but, while desperately needed, investments in \nthe urban transportation infrastructure are especially costly.\n  Thankfully, we are finding that technology is coming to our aid as we \nseek to address the issue of transportation infrastructure investments \nin an urban environment. One especially gratifying example of the \napplication of information technology--``smart'' technology--to the \nmanagement and maintenance of transportation infrastructure can be \nfound in Drexel University's Intelligent Transportation Institute. In \nthe passage of TEA-21 last year Congress specifically recognized the \noutstanding work of the Institute and included a special section of \nthat bill--Section 5118--which authorized $10 million to ``conduct \nresearch, training, technology transfer, construction, maintenance, and \nother activities to advance infrastructure research.''\n  I would ask whether the Senator agrees with me that work such as that \nconducted at the Drexel Institute is essential for determining the \nactual structural integrity of urban transportation infrastructure--\nsuch as multimillion dollar bridges--monitoring their ``health'' in \nreal-time, and determining cost-effective and innovative maintenance \nand operational strategies.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania's assessment \nof the importance of smart technology and commend the work being done \nat Drexel University's Intelligent Infrastructure Institute. It is \nimportant that we continue to support the work of the Institute, and I \nlook forward to working with the Senator during the conference with the \nHouse to see that this work is accomplished this year and in succeeding \nyears.\n\n\n                        unalaska pier extension\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senate Report on the FY2000 Department of \nTransportation bill allocates $8 million to the Coast Guard to pay for \nthe costs of extending the Unalaska municipal pier to provide a \ndedicated berth for the agency's High Endurance cutters. The Coast \nGuard is currently forced to shift the High Endurance cutters when in \nport because the large vessels inadvertantly serve as obstacles to the \ncommercial ship traffic, and the vessels' antennae have at times \nimpeded commercial aviation service into Unalaska.\n  I have since been informed that the Coast Guard may not have \nsufficient capability to manage a dock extension project in this remote \nregion of the Aleutian Islands. Since the City of Unalaska owns the \nmain pier, I have asked the City to take on the responsibility of \nmanaging the pier extension through its municipal competitive \nprocurement process and to assume the responsibility of maintaining the \ndock extension in exchange for being able to use the space when the \nHigh Endurance Cutters are not present. Such an arrangement would \ndramatically reduce any outyear operating expenses for the Coast Guard \nassociated with the pier space. This arrangement would require a \ntransfer of funds from the Coast Guard to the City at some point next \nyear. While I am not offering an amendment today, we may find that\n\n[[Page S10978]]\n\nsuch a Local-Federal cooperative endeavor may need specific legislative \nlanguage in the final FY 2000 appropriation bill. Am I correct in my \nunderstanding that this issue will be evaluated and technical language \nmay, if necessary, be considered in conference?\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Chairman is correct. I strongly concur that the Coast \nGuard should ask the City of Unalaska to use its own local knowledge \nand competitive procurement process to manage the pier extension. I \nalso agree that the Congress should encourage an arrangement between \nthe City and the agency to reduce the Coast Guard's operating costs \nassociated with the long-term maintenance of any dedicated pier space. \nWe will seek to address this in conference at the appropriate time.\n\n\n                          savannah water taxi\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the distinguished Chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation yield for a question?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will be happy to yield to the senior Senator from \nGeorgia for question.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As you know, last year your Committee provided \n$500,000 in federal funding for a water taxi service to and from \nHutchinson Island, near Savannah, Georgia. This water taxi is vital to \nthe overall success of the Georgia International Maritime and Trade \nCenter located on the island. While I am disappointed that the Senate \nfailed to include any additional funding for Savannah's water taxi \nservice in the FY 2000 Transportation Appropriations Bill, it is my \nunderstanding that the House included $1 million to help complete this \nimportant project. Would the Chairman be inclined to recede to the \nHouse approved amount in the conference report?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will be happy to work with the senior Senator from \nGeorgia on this issue during conference negotiations with the House. I \nrealize how important the establishment of a water taxi service in \nSavannah, Georgia is to you and the local community. I appreciate all \nyour hard work and diligence on this project.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chairman for his help. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  niosh aviation safety study funding\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Subcommittee Chairman \nwould be willing to discuss with me an Alaskan Aviation Safety Study \nthe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, called--\nNIOSH, has proposed.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, I would join the Appropriations Chairman.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama. As a \nlicensed private pilot in Alaska, I am well aware of the challenges \nevery pilot in my state faces every day. On some per capita basis, \nthere are more pilots in Alaska than in any other state in the union. \nFor many of the residents in my state, air travel is the only mode of \nintrastate transportation.\n  Alaska is one-fifth the size of the lower 48 with a population \nroughly the size of Montgomery County, Maryland. For many Alaskans, air \ntravel is the only way to get there from here. We have some of the \nroughest terrain and weather on this continent. Very little flying in \nAlaska is done above 10,000 feet. Most flying is done in small, single \nand twin engine aircraft that have historically higher accident rates \nthan high-flying multi-engine turbojets.\n  On average, in the last decade, there has been one aviation accident \nevery other day in Alaska. One hundred pilots, and 266 others have died \nin aircraft crashes in Alaska since 1991. Every nine days, on average, \nwe lose another Alaskan to an aircraft accident. And these statistics \ndo not take into account four helicopter accidents since June of this \nyear. This and other data compiled by the National Transportation \nSafety Board and NIOSH show that for the first time in our history, \naviation accidents have become the leading cause of occupation-related \nfatalities in Alaska.\n  This is why I am asking the good Senator from Alabama to consider \npartial funding for a promising safety study that has been proposed by \nthe Alaska Field Station of the National Institute for Occupational \nSafety and Health when his bill goes to conference. This study will \nbring together all the leaders in Alaska aviation. Industry, state and \nfederal agencies and pilots themselves will all contribute to an \nintense examination of how to improve aviation safety in Alaska. The \nFederal Aviation Administration, the National Weather Service, and the \nNational Transportation Safety Board are all enthusiastic supporters of \nthe study. It is my hope that this study will foster common sense, \nindustry-led safety initiatives--not promulgate increasingly burdensome \nfederal restrictions and penalties.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I am aware of the Senator from Alaska's ongoing efforts \nto improve aviation safety in his home state. And I know he is \nparticularly impressed with NIOSH's past record of initiating safety \nimprovements without recommending more regulations--it is an impressive \nrecord. I have flown within the state of Alaska on many occasions and \nhave witnessed firsthand the unique challenges Alaskan aviators face. \nThe NIOSH study is a worthy project for my subcommittee's consideration \nwhen this bill goes to conference. I will work to find the funds to \nsupport this study.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my friend from Alabama and remind him that I \nplan to ask the Subcommittee Chairmen of Commerce, Justice, State, the \nJudiciary, and Labor, HHS to also contribute funds to this study. For \nyour committee's review and oversight, I have asked NIOSH to provide \nannual progress reports.\n\n\n  improvements to provide access to the boyer chute national wildlife \n                                 refuge\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I realize that this year, you and Ranking Member \nLautenberg, are facing a challenging appropriations season with tight \nbudgetary constraints. However, I wanted to bring to your attention a \nvery important project of mine regarding road improvements in \nWashington County, NE.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Can the Senator from Nebraska please describe your \nrequest in greater detail?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes, it would be my pleasure. The State of Nebraska \nrequires $2,432,000 for road improvements to provide access to the \nBoyer Chute National Wildlife Refuge near Fort Calhoun, Nebraska. \nCurrently, the road that leads to Boyer Chute through Washington County \nis unpaved. This road is an important thoroughfare and is the most \ndirect route to Boyer Chute. Boyer Chute has become an increasingly \npopular recreation area and tourist destination. Traffic on the current \nroad has increased and will continue to increase as the National \nWildlife continues its expansion next year. Paving the road will \ngreatly improve access to this national treasure--and will be of great \nbenefit to Nebraskans.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I have noted the importance of this project and I hope to \nwork with you further on this project during conference.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the chairman for his assistance. I appreciate his \nconsideration of this very important project.\n\n\n                     clarifying project flexibility\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I rise to seek clarification from the Chairman concerning \na provision relating to spending flexibility for high priority \ntransportation projects.\n  As you know, action taken during the 105th Congress established that \nthe states of Idaho, Alaska, and West Virginia can each ``pool'' the \nstate's obligation authority for high priority projects--a flexibility \nprovided to Minnesota under Section 1212(m) of TEA21(m) of TEA21 (later \nredesignated in technical corrections legislation as Section 1212[g]). \nThis enables federal funds to be directed to the high priority project \nor projects in the state which are ready to go, rather than ration out \nobligation authority proportionately to all high priority projects in \nthe state, whether or not ready to go.\n  Section 336 of S. 1143 would provide to New Jersey the same \nflexibility. However, on page 170 of the Senate Committee report on the \nbill (S. Rpt. No. 106-55), at the point where the report shows changes \nfrom existing law, only the states of Minnesota and New Jersey are \nmentioned as having this flexibility in obligating high priority \nproject funds.\n  Is it the Chairman's understanding that the flexibility granted to \nIdaho, Alaska, and West Virginia under Section 1212(g) of TEA-21 is \nstill in force and effect, does not require yearly reenactment, and is \nunchanged by the amendment contained in the Senate bill?\n\n[[Page S10979]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator from Idaho is correct. Idaho, Alaska, and \nWest Virginia have already each been granted flexibility under Section \n1212(g) of TEA-21, to ``pool'' the state's obligation authority for \nhigh priority projects, as long as the total amount of funds authorized \nfor any project for which the funds are allocated are not reduced. This \nflexibility does not have to be re-established legislatively on an \nannual basis, and nothing in the FY2000 Transportation Appropriations \nbill or report changes this flexibility.\n\n\n             supporting public lands discretionary project\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I rise to engage the Chairman in a colloquy concerning the \nuse of the Public Lands Program funds.\n  In its report, the Committee has raised serious concerns--supported \nby findings of the General Accounting Office--about how funds have been \nawarded under the Public Lands Program. To correct this problem, the \nreport gives several specific directions to the Federal Highway \nAdministration and a list of projects that should be funded by the \nSecretary.\n  I would like to draw the Chairman's attention to a request made by \nthe state of Idaho for $6.0 million from this program to make needed \nimprovements to U.S. 89 from West Forest Boundary to Bishoff Canyon.\n  This project would improve safety and capacity of the highway, which \nprovides the only significant access into the Caribou National Forest \nin the region for hunting, fishing, mountain biking, hiking, camping, \nand snowmobiling. Of the total project distance of 8.3 miles, about 6.6 \nmiles (80 percent) is located within the forest boundary. The highway \nand also provides connections to Jackson Hole, Yellowstone Park, and \nBear Lake. Timber sales in the area require logging trucks to negotiate \na very narrow and slow speed route, inconsistent with safety and the \nroute's designation as a National Highway. The Idaho Highway Needs \nReport shows multiple deficiencies for this segment of roadway, \nincluding pavement width, foundation, drainage, shoulder condition, \naccident rate, and overall combined rating.\n  The requested $6.0 million will complete the work presented under the \n1991 ISTEA Demonstration project, supplementing $18.0 million in \ndemonstration funds. The limits and scope of the ISTEA demonstration \nproject are not being expanded. Additional funds are requested to cover \nthe cost of moving almost 2 million cubic yards of unanticipated earth \nand rock. In fact, without supplemental funds, the original \ndemonstration project would need to be shortened and limited.\n  Mr. SHELBY. It is clear that the US 89 project, from West Forest \nBoundary to Bishoff Canyon in Idaho, is a critical priority for Idaho \nand the nation, and deserves to be funded. I assure the Senator from \nIdaho that we will work to include this project in any list of earmarks \ndetermined by the conference committee.\n\n\n                        the indian roads program\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama, the Chairman of the Subcommittee, in a colloquy.\n  I want to begin by commending you, Senator Shelby for the hard work \nyou have done in crafting this Transportation appropriations bill. You \nhave done a fine job under difficult circumstances in funding the \npriorities identified by the Committee in this bill, and providing \nincreased flexibility to the states.\n  As you know, one of the more important highway programs in this bill \nfor my home state of New Mexico is the Indian Reservation Roads \nprogram. The program is directed to about 22,000 miles of Bureau of \nIndian Affairs roads serving tribal lands. Of these roads, only 11 \npercent of the paved roads are rated as being in good condition. Close \nto 90 percent of the unpaved roads are know to be in poor condition. \nIndian Reservation Roads funds are critical to improving transportation \nfor Native Americans in New Mexico.\n  I understand that in putting together this bill, the Chairman \nadjusted the revenue aligned budget authority (RABA) allocation \nformula, and that programs under the Federal Lands Highways program \nwill receive a total of $37.3 million less in funding under the Senate \nbill than they otherwise would under TEA-21. This will affect the \nIndian Reservation Roads program, which is part of the Federal Lands \nHighways program. Because of these changes to the RABA formula, Indian \nRoads will not receive an additional $14.5 million in funds it is \nauthorized to under TEA-21. Thus, the Indian Roads program will receive \n$275 million, instead of the full $289.5 million that would be \nallocated under TEA-21. I am concerned about this and hope that the \nChairman will work to improve the situation for Indian Roads in \nconference.\n  As this bill moves to conference, will the Chairman pledge to make \nevery effort to sustain full funding as envisioned by TEA-21 for the \nIndian Reservation Roads program?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I am aware of the importance of the Indian Reservation \nRoads program to the Senator from New Mexico, and pledge to work for \nfull funding of the Indian Reservation Roads program as provided in \nTEA-21.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Chairman, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n             the national environmental respiratory center\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. Chairman, I would like to discuss with you an \nimportant transportation research initiative addressed in the report \naccompanying the FY 2000 Transportation Appropriations bill. I refer to \nthe National Environmental Respiratory Center headquartered in \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico, at the Lovelace Respiratory Research \nInstitute.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would be pleased to discuss the potential of this \nCenter's research initiative as part of the FY 2000 Department of \nTransportation spending plan. The Committee has recognized funding for \nthis initiative within our Committee report, both under the \nDepartment's multi-disciplinary research account and in the Federal \nHighway Administration.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the Subcommittee's support for the NERC \nCenter, and I would like to highlight the potential of this Center's \nwork as it would relate to the Department of Transportation's mission. \nThe National Environmental Respiratory Center--NERC as it is called--is \nthe only research program in the United States focused specifically on \nthe increasingly troublesome issue of understanding the health risks of \nmixtures of air pollutants.\n  A major difficulty in moving forward in managing these residual \nhealth risks associated with air quality is the fact that no citizen \never breathes one pollutant at a time. Scientists are realizing that it \nis unlikely that any remaining effect of air pollution on health is \nactually caused by a single air pollutant acting alone. Clearly, the \ntransportation sector is at least one significant factor in the \nrelationship between air quality and public health. Therefore, it is \nessential that the Department of Transportation participate in the \ninteragency, multi-disciplinary public-private NERC initiative. I thank \nthe Committee for acknowledging this effort in the report accompanying \nthe pending bill.\n  The National Environmental Respiratory Center was conceived as a \njoint government-industry effort to determine how to identify the \ncontributions of individual pollutants and their sources to the health \neffects of complex mixtures of air contaminants. The work is well \nunderway and broad recognition of its importance is manifested by the \ncontinually increasing support from industry. Continued support through \nthis appropriations bill is essential to carrying out the Center's \nmulti-year research strategy. Accordingly, Mr. Chairman, I am hopeful \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation will take heed of our \nrecommendation, and I look forward to working with you on this matter.\n  Mr. SHELBY. It does appear that the Center stands apart from other \nresearch programs by tackling the pollution mixtures problem directly. \nIn my view, this effort is worthy of support by the Department. I will \nwork with you as the FY 2000 spending plan for the Department is \nimplemented to encourage the Agency to respond to our recommendation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1658\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President yesterday, this body unanimously adopted the \nHelms amendment to H.R. 2084, the Department of Transportation and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act. The Helms amendment expresses the \nsense\n\n[[Page S10980]]\n\nof the Senate that the United States Census bureau should include \nmarital status on the short form census questionnaire to be distributed \nto the majority of American households for the 2000 decennial census. \nThe marital status question currently appears only on the long form \nwhich will be distributed to one out of every six households, rather \nthan to all households as the short form is distributed.\n  I agree with the importance of collecting information about marital \nstatus, and I know that by using modern statistical methods and the \ninformation obtained from the question on the long form, we will know \nhow many Americans are married. Although I supported the amendment, I \noffer some explanation about the amendment, on behalf of the Census \nBureau, about why the marital status question was moved to the long \nform rather than left on the short form. I would also like to respond \nto my colleague from North Carolina, who said that the U.S. Census \nBureau ``obviously no longer regards marriage as having any \nimportance.'' This attitude should not be ascribed to the actions of \nthe Census Bureau. This was hardly a frivolous decision. Rather, an \nexplanation can be found in the agency's efforts to comply with \nCongressional mandates on the decennial census questionnaires.\n  In one of its many mandates imposed on the Census Bureau about \nconducting the 2000 census, Congress directed the agency to reduce the \nnumber of questions asked on decennial questionnaires. In response, the \nCensus Bureau performed a review of each question on both the long form \nand the short form. From this review, the agency eliminated questions \nfor which it found no statutory or legal requirement, including the \nmarital status question. A major reason for excluding certain questions \nfrom the short form is that the short form must be processed \nimmediately to provide timely information to States for redistricting \npurposes. In accordance, the questions not needed for redistricting \npurposes were eliminated from the short form and some were shifted to \nthe long form. Some questions were eliminated altogether, for the sake \nof brevity. Marital status was determined as not necessary for State \nredistricting purposes, not because the Census Bureau regarded marriage \nas unimportant, and therefore was shifted to the long form.\n  Following the question review and elimination, the Census Bureau \ncomplied once again with long-standing Congressional mandate and \nprovided the proposed questionnaire two years in advance of the \ndecennial census. This submission was made on March 31, 1998, to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and Majority Leader in the Senate, and \nthe Subcommittee on the Census and Speaker in the other body. After \nthis submission, the agency accepted and considered various concerns \nabout the content of the form. The Census Bureau reports that no \ncomments regarding content of the marital category were received. The \nCensus Bureau then finalized the questionnaire content.\n  At present, 246 million of the 462 million forms for the 2000 \ndecennial census have been printed. Redesigning and reprinting this \nquantity of questionnaires would be extremely costly and lead to \ndeleterious delays. We are already within seven months of the \nquestionnaire mail-out date. In addition, the FY 2000 Commerce-Justice-\nState Appropriations Bill that funds the Census Bureau has not yet \npassed, and the version of the bill produced by this body does not \nprovide the full $4.6 billion request--our figure is $1.7 billion \nshort. Therefore, even if the forms were reprinted, the Census Bureau \nwould not have adequate funds to mail the forms.\n  Mr. President, the Census Bureau needs much more support than we are \ngiving it if we expect a fair and accurate 2000 census. I feel that \namendment #1658 provides us with a perfect opportunity to call on \nconferees on the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Bill to provide \nfull funding for the 2000 census. I appreciate the opportunity to speak \non this matter.\n\n\n                        budget committee scoring\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of \nTransportation and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year \n2000.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nand the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for \nbringing us a balanced bill within necessary budget constraints.\n  The Senate-reported bill provides $13.9 billion in a new budget \nauthority (BA) and $17.5 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of \nthe Department of Transportation, including federal-aid highway, mass \ntransit, and aviation activities. When outlays from prior-year budget \nauthority and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals \n$12.8 billion in BA and $43.6 billion in outlays.\n  The Senate-reported bill is exactly at the Subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation for budget authority, and the bill is $4 million in outlays \nunder the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. President, I support the bill and urge its adoption.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget Committee \nscoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1143, TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS, 2000: SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                                                             [Fiscal year 2000, $ millions]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                              General                                  Mass\n                                                                              purpose       Crime       Highways     transit     Mandatory      Total\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority......................................................      12,034   ...........  ...........  ...........          721      12,755\n    Outlays...............................................................      14,226   ...........      24,574        4,113           717      43,630\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority......................................................      12,034   ...........  ...........  ...........          721      12,755\n    Outlays...............................................................      14,226   ...........      24,574        4,117           717      43,634\n1999 level:\n    Budget authority......................................................      11,913   ...........  ...........  ...........          698      12,611\n    Outlays...............................................................      13,797   ...........      20,379        4,402           665      39,243\nPresident's request\n    Budget authority......................................................      12,843   ...........

The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise not to delay the process at all \nbut just to acknowledge the fact that we have passed a bill that took \nsome time and an awful lot of work, I must say. I commend my colleague \nand my good friend from Alabama, Senator Shelby, chairman of the \nsubcommittee. We had some disagreements. This was not just sweetness \nand light; it was a good, solid debate. We called on the body to make \ndecisions for us at times. That is the way it should be. So I thank \nSenator Shelby for being so cooperative on issues and for understanding \nwhat we had to do. We went ahead and did it.\n  I also thank Senator Chafee and other members of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee for their cooperation. We had some questions \nthat had to be answered, and it took time to thoroughly review them.\n  Also I want to say, without our respective staffs doing the work they \ndid, this job would be a lot more complicated and would take even more \ntime. I speak specifically about Wally Barnett, the chief of staff on \nthe Republican side, and Peter Rogoff on our side, and the other \nmembers of the team: Joyce Rose, Paul Doerrer, Mitch Warren, Laurie \nSaroff, Denise Matthews, and Carol Geagley on our side, because they \nmade it, if not easy, certainly in many cases they simplified the \nissues to get them down to digestible form. It did make it considerably \neasier. I thank them.\n  I thank my good friend from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague, the \nformer chairman of the committee, the ranking Democrat, Senator \nLautenberg, and his staff. I believe, as he said, we worked a lot of \nhours, but our staff has put in, together, many more hours. I want to \nrecognize and thank Wally Burnett, who is the staff director on the \nsubcommittee, also Peter Rogoff whom Senator Lautenberg has just \nmentioned, Elizabeth Letchworth, Jay Kimmitt, Joyce Rose, Paul Doerrer, \nSteve Cortese, and all the others who contributed to this.\n  We think we have a pretty good bill. We have to go to conference and \nwork it out. Let's hope we can do it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald).

I know Senators are interested in the schedule for the \nremainder of the day. We believe we have worked out an agreement of a \nreasonable time for discussion on the District of Columbia \nappropriations conference report. Then that would be followed with a \nrecorded vote. We would need to have a recorded vote under our \narrangement where if we do not have a recorded vote on an \nappropriations bill when it goes through the Senate, then we do have a \nrecorded vote on it when it comes back from conference. So we will need \nthat recorded vote.\n  We hope to get the UC locked down, and hopefully, then, at around 2 \nor so we could get to final passage on the D.C. appropriations \nconference report. Therefore, then, there would not be the necessity, \nobviously, for there to be a vote on it at 10 o'clock on Friday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11013-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11013-S11014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have one other block of remaining issues \nof consideration, and that is judicial nominations. We had planned to \ngo forward with three judges--two that have been cleared and one that \nmay require time for discussion, and a vote on that at some point. \nThere may need to be, as I said, time for discussion. I hope we can get \na reasonable agreement on that.\n  I would not want to have to file cloture on Federal judges. I think \nit would be a bad practice if we began to have filibusters on Federal \njudicial nominations, requiring only 41 votes to defeat a judicial \nnomination. I guess that has been done in the past but not recently, \nnot since I have been majority leader, that I know of.\n  So I hope we can work out an agreement on time, as we have done on \nthe nomination of Mr. White of Missouri. We have a time agreement. At \nsome\n\n[[Page S11014]]\n\npoint in the next 2 or 3 weeks that will be called up, and it will have \na discussion period and a vote.\n\n  I hope that would be the case with any of these three that we had \nhoped to bring up. If we can't get an agreement of how to deal with all \nthree of them, then we will not be able to move any of the three. But \nwe are still working on that, and we hope to get it worked out.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the distinguished leader yield on that \npoint?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I apologize.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the distinguished leader yield on that point?\n  Mr. LOTT. Surely.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are one, two, three, four, five, six, \nseven judicial nominations on the calendar. I tell the distinguished \nleader that on this side of the aisle, at least, we are willing to \nagree to a time certain to vote on all of them--right now. We will be \nglad to enter into a time agreement to vote on each and every one of \nthem. Obviously, our concern is that they all be considered and we \nsuggest that they be in the order in which they appear on the calendar.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I apologize again. I think the Senator is \npropounding a question. What I am trying to do is to move forward on \njudicial nominations. We have already cleared six, I believe, since we \nhave been back. I believe we can move two more without any problem. \nThat would be eight. Then it would be my intent to move in that block \nof three also the nomination of Mr. Stewart of Utah, Brian Theadore \nStewart. It would be those three. If we could clear those three, that \nwould be nine we have moved since we have been back from the August \nrecess, leaving, I believe, only four on the calendar.\n  As I indicated, we have gotten tentative agreement on time on the \nnomination of White of Missouri, that we hope within the next week or \nso--at some point--when we find a window, in fact, we will call it up, \nand there will be a period of debate and a vote on that one, leaving \nonly three judges on the calendar.\n  I understand the Judiciary Committee is moving toward reporting out \nother judges and will begin to move those right away who are not \ncontroversial and won't take time. If there is controversy, and we can \nget a time agreement, a limited time agreement and then a vote on some, \nthen we would do that.\n  The three remaining on the calendar are Ninth Circuit judges, where \nthere is considerable problem and concern about the size of the \ncircuit, whether or not that circuit needs to be dealt with, whether it \nis split in two, and there are concerns about the judges themselves. So \nthat is a complicated problem. I cannot give any indication of a time \nagreement at this point.\n  I call on the Senators on both sides of the aisle to allow me to \ncontinue to move forward. I have been showing good faith. Before the \nAugust recess, I tried to move some of these judges, and if I did not \ninclude certain judges, there was objection from that side. If I did \nnot include certain other judges, there was objection on this side.\n  So what I said was: This is not reasonable. It does not make good \nsense. I am going to just start calling them up, one by one, and \nclearing them and getting them done. And by doing that, I have done \nsix, and I am on the verge of doing three more. So I would hope we \nwould get cooperation on that.\n  I think Judge Stewart of Utah is a qualified nominee. He is obviously \nsupported by the Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who has been working in good faith. He was not particularly \nhappy with my plan to just go forward and start calling up judges. I \nassured him that after we had done several of them that had been \ncleared, his would be next. His is going to be next. He will be in this \npackage of three.\n\n  I understand Senators may want to talk some more about this in the \nnext few minutes. I don't want to file cloture on Judge Stewart. I will \ndo that, and then we will start down this 41-vote trail, which I don't \nthink is wise. Let's try to have some cooperation with each other and a \nmodicum of good faith, and we will continue to work on them.\n  It takes a lot of time for the majority leader and the minority \nleader to clear these judges--a lot of time. I have to check with 54 \nother Senators before I can enter into any kind of agreement. Sometimes \nthe objections are: I need time to think about it; I need to meet with \nthis person or that person. Sometimes it is a legislative issue. \nSometimes they say: Well, I have a problem; I am going to vote no. \nSometimes they say: I need a lot of time.\n  I have to work through all that. I will withhold right now on these \nthree, on either of the three. I urge Senator Leahy, Senator Hatch, \nSenator Feinstein, anybody else who is involved and interested, to talk \nthis out. I will be back here in a couple of hours, and I will see if \nwe can't work out a way we can move the two who have been cleared \nalready and move Judge Stewart. I do think you will want to talk about \nit some and perhaps discuss it further with Senator Daschle. That would \nbe fine, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11014-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2587 CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, while the distinguished majority leader is \nstill on the floor, I note I, too, do not want to see the Senate go \ndown a path where a minority of the Senate is determining a judge's \nfate on votes of 41. In fact, the distinguished majority leader is \nperhaps aware of the fact that during the Republican administrations I \nrarely ever voted against a nomination by either President Reagan or \nPresident Bush. There were a couple I did.\n  I also took the floor on occasion to oppose filibusters to hold them \nup and believe that we should have a vote up or down. Actually, I was \none of those who made sure, on a couple controversial Republican \njudges, that we did. That meant 100 Senators voted on them, 100.\n  In this case, unfortunately, we have at least one judge who has been \nheld for 3 years by one or two or three or four Senators, not 41 but \nless than a handful. All I am asking is that we give them the fairness \nof having the whole Senate vote on them.\n  Unfortunately, in the last couple years, women and minorities have \nbeen held up longer than anybody else on these Federal judgeships. They \nought to be allowed a vote up or down. If Senators want to vote against \nthem, then vote against them. If they want to vote for them, vote for \nthem. But to have two or three people, quietly, in the back room, never \nbe identified as being the ones holding them up, I think that is unfair \nto the judiciary, it is unfair to the nominees, and, frankly, it \ndemeans the Senate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as a Senator representing California, who sits on the \nJudiciary Committee, I have to say a word or two on this subject.\n  First, I believe the chairman of our committee, Senator Hatch, has \nbeen very fair with respect to these judges. I believe he has tried his \nlevel best to move the calendar along.\n  I think what we on this side are encountering is the holding up of \njudges, particularly on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, for years \non end. That must stop. A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up; \nvote them down. To keep them hanging on--the court has 750 cases \nwaiting for a judge. These judges are necessary. If someone has \nopposition to a judge, which I believe to be the case in at least one, \nthey should come to the floor and say that.\n  It is also my understanding and my desire to ask that there be some \ncommitment from the other side as to when specifically the nominations \nof Judge Paez, Marsha Berzon, and Ray Fisher, pending on this \ncalendar--\n\n[[Page S11015]]\n\nJudge Paez pending for 4 years; Marsha Berzon through two sessions \nnow--can at least be brought to the floor for a vote.\n  I am prepared to vote on the judges that the majority leader \nmentioned. I am prepared to vote affirmatively, but I can't do that \nunless I have some knowledge that judges who have stood on this \ncalendar for years can be brought up before this body for a vote. I \ndon't think that is too much to ask the other side to do.\n  What this does to a judge's life is, it leaves them in limbo--I \nshould say, a nominee's life--whether they have a place to live, \nwhether they are going to make a move. It is our job to confirm these \njudges. If we don't like them, we can vote against them. That is the \nhonest thing to do. If there are things in their background, in their \nabilities that don't pass muster, vote no.\n  I think every one of us on this side is prepared for that. The \nproblem is, we have a few people who prevent them from having a vote, \nand this goes on month after month, year after year.\n  The ranking member of the committee said something that I believe is \nconcurred in on this side; that is, women and minorities have an \ninordinately difficult time having their nominations processed in an \norderly and expeditious way. I don't think that befits this body.\n  What I am asking for, as a Senator from California, on these three \njudges, is to just tell us when we might see their nominations before \nthe Senate for a vote up or down. I think there is also an \nunderstanding by the White House that will be the case as well.\n  I ask the majority party to please take this into consideration, \nallow us a vote up or down, and give us a time when this might happen.\n  Once again, I thank the ranking member and the chairman of the \ncommittee. I know the Senator from Utah has done everything he possibly \ncan to move these nominations. I, for one, very much appreciate it. I \nam hopeful the leadership of his side will be able to give us some \naccommodation on this.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's kind remarks. I \nsupport Mr. Stewart's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame, and not to filibuster any nominee, let alone this nominee.\n  I am pleased, with regard to the judicial nominations that have been \nvoted on so far this session--and there have been well over 300 since \nthis President became President--that no one on our side, to my \nknowledge, has threatened to filibuster any of these judges. I think \nthat is the way to proceed.\n  I think it is a travesty if we ever start getting into a game of \nfilibustering judges. I have to admit that my colleagues on the other \nside attempted to do that on a number of occasions during the Reagan \nand Bush years. They always backed off, but maybe they did because they \nrealized there were enough votes to stop a filibuster against Federal \njudges. I think it is a travesty if we treat this third branch of \ngovernment with such disregard that we filibuster judges.\n  I also have appreciated the comments of the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, who stated on this floor in the \npast:\n\n       I would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \n     whether it is somebody I opposed or supported. . . .\n\n  The Republican leadership, the Democratic President, the Republican \nchairman, and the Democratic ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \nall support Mr. Stewart's nomination. The nomination should not be \nfilibustered. As I understand it, the only reason there would be a \nfilibuster is because some Senators want their judges up. They have no \nreal reason to filibuster Mr. Stewart.\n  The only way I could ever see a filibuster would be justified is if a \nnominee is so absolutely unqualified to sit on the Federal bench that \nthe only way to stop that person is a filibuster. I can understand it \nunder those circumstances. Even then, I would question whether that \nshould be done. If a person is so unqualified, we ought to be able to \nbeat that person on the floor.\n  Even when I opposed a nominee of the current President, I voted for \ncloture to stop the filibuster of that nominee. That was for Lee \nSarokin.\n  We are dealing with a coequal branch of government. We are dealing \nwith some of the most important nominations the President, whoever that \nPresident may be, will make. We are also dealing, hopefully, with good \nfaith on both sides of the floor. For years, I thought our colleagues \non the other side did some reprehensible things with regard to Reagan \nand Bush judges--very few, but it was serious. By and large, the vast \nmajority of them were put through without any real fuss or bother even \nthough my colleagues on the other side, had they been President, would \nnot have appointed very many of those judges. We have to show the same \ngood faith on our side, it seems to me.\n\n  And unless you have an overwhelming case, then certainly I don't see \nany reason for anybody filibustering judges. I hope that we never get \ninto that. Let's make our case if we have disagreement, and then vote. \nAnd I reach this conclusion after having been part of this process for \nover 20 years now and always trying to be fair, whoever is the \nPresident of the United States and whoever the nominees are.\n  It is important to not filibuster judicial nominees on the floor of \nthe Senate. The fight over a nomination has to occur between honest \npeople in the White House and honest people up here. And that is where \nthe battles are. When they get this far, generally most of them should \nbe approved. There are some we still have problems with in the \nJudiciary Committee, but that is our job to look at them. It is our job \nto look into their background. It is our job to screen these \ncandidates.\n  We have had judicial nominees withdraw after we have approved them in \nthe Judiciary Committee because something has come up to disturb their \nnomination. This was generally handled between the White House, the \nSenate, and the nominee. That is the way it should work.\n  We must remember that these are among the most important nominations \nthat any President can make and that the Senate can ever work on. We \nshould not play politics with them.\n  I have really worked hard on the Judiciary Committee to try to not \nallow politics. It is no secret that there are some on the right who \ndecry the fact that I have put through Clinton judges. Some of them \ndon't want any Clinton judges put through --some just because they are \nliberal. If we get to the point where we deny people a chance to serve \nbecause they are liberal or conservative, I think we will be in real \ntrouble. Politics should not be played with judicial nominees. \nPresident Clinton did win this Presidency. He has a right to nominate \nthese people, and we have an obligation to confirm them if they are \nqualified. In every case where we have confirmed them, they are \nqualified, even though there may be some questions in the minds of \nsome.\n  In the case of Ted Steward, we have examined the whole record. The \nPresident has examined the whole record. The President and I and \nSenator Bennett agree that Mr. Stewart is qualified to serve as an \nArticle III, judgeship in Utah. The Judiciary Committee reported Mr. \nSteward's nomination favorably to the floor.\n  Now we have the unusual situation of a Democratic President and \nRepublican Chairman and Democratic Ranking Member agreeing on a \nnomination, but certain Democratic Senators who really don't oppose Ted \nSteward's nomination want to hold the nomination hostage in order to \nget other judges up. The majority leader said he will try to do so in \ngood faith, but he must consult with 54 other Senators on our side.\n  There is some angst on at least the background of two of the 9th \nCircuit Court judges on the part of some on our side. I could not \ndisagree more with the threat of filibuster here. Unless there is an \noverwhelming case to be made against a judge that he or she is \nunqualified or will not respect the limited role which Article III \nprescribes for a judge, there should be no filibuster.\n  Mr. Steward is definitely qualified and will certainly respect the \nlimited role that Article III provides for a federal judge. He will be \na credit to the federal bench in Utah and throughout the country.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I oppose filibusters of judicial nominees as a \ngeneral matter and I support Mr. Stewart's nomination in this specific \ncase. I\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\nwould like to see these three judges go through today because we put \nthem through the Judiciary Committee. I would like to see all of those \non the list have an opportunity to be voted up or down. I will work to \ntry to do that.\n  On the other hand, I understand the problems of the majority leader \nand I hope my colleagues on the other side do. I hope colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle will not hold up the business of the Senate to \nplay politics with Ted Stewart's nomination. I have to say that I think \nwe do a great injustice if we do not support this nomination.\n  Having said all of that, let me conclude by saying I have been \nwilling to and have enjoyed working with my distinguished friend from \nVermont. He has done a good job as the Democrat leader on the \ncommittee. I just have to say that I hope he can clear his side on \nthese matters and that we can get them through because I intend to put \nmore judges out from the committee and to move forward with as much \ndispatch as I can.\n  Earlier, when I said there was some angst concerning the background \nof some Ninth Circuit nominees, I was referring to their legal \nbackground and some of the matters that came before the committee. Be \nthat as it may, I was really referring to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, which seems to be out of whack with the rest of the country. \nIt is reversed virtually all the time by the Supreme Court. There is a \ngreat deal of concern that Ninth Circuit court has become so activist \nthat it is a detriment to the Federal judicial system. Some on our side \nbelieve that to put any additional activists on that court would be a \ntravesty and would be wrong. I am concerned about that, too.\n  All I can say is that it is important we work together to try to get \nthese nominees through, both in the Judiciary Committee and in the \nSenate. Should we be fortunate enough to have a Republican President \nnext time, I hope our colleagues on the other side will treat our \nnominees as fairly as I certainly did and the Senate Republicans as a \nwhole treated the Democrat nominees who have been brought before the \ncommittee. We are going to keep working on them, and we will do the \nbest we can to get as many of them through as we can. Thus far, I am \nproud of the record we have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have a number of highly-qualified \nnominees for judicial vacancies before the Senate and on the Executive \nCalendar. I want to be sure that the Senate treats them all fairly and \naccords each of them an opportunity for an up or down vote. I want to \nshare with you a few of the cases that cry out for a Senate vote:\n  The first is Judge Richard Paez. He is a judicial nominee who has \nbeen awaiting consideration and confirmation by the Senate since \nJanuary 1996--for over 3 and one-half years. The vacancy for which \nJudge Paez was nominated became a judicial emergency during the time \nhis nomination has been pending without action by the Senate. His \nnomination was first received by the Senate almost 44 months ago and is \nstill without a Senate vote. That is unconscionable.\n  Judge Paez has twice been reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to the Senate for final action. He is again on the Senate \ncalendar. He was delayed 25 months before finally being accorded a \nconfirmation hearing in February 1998. After being reported by the \nJudiciary Committee initially in March 1998, his nomination was held on \nthe Senate Executive Calendar without action or explanation for over 7 \nmonths, for the remainder of the last Congress.\n  Judge Paez was renominated by the President again this year and his \nnomination was stalled without action before the Judiciary Committee \nuntil late July, when the Committee reported his nomination to the \nSenate for the second time. The Senate refused to consider the \nnomination before the August recess. I have repeatedly urged the \nRepublican leadership to call this nomination up for consideration and \na vote. The Republican leadership in the Senate has refused to schedule \nthis nomination for an up or down vote.\n  Judge Paez has the strong support of both California Senators and a \n``well-qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. He has \nserved as a municipal judge for 13 years and as a federal judge for \nfour years.\n  In my view Judge Paez should be commended for the years he worked to \nprovide legal services and access to our justice system for those \nwithout the financial resources otherwise to retain counsel. His work \nwith the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, the Western Center on Law \nand Poverty and California Rural Legal Assistance for nine years should \nbe a source of praise and pride.\n  Judge Paez has had the strong support of California judges familiar \nwith his work, such as Justice H. Walter Crosky, and support from an \nimpressive array of law enforcement officials, including Gil Garcetti, \nthe Los Angeles District Attorney; the late Sherman Block, then Los \nAngeles County Sheriff; the Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' \nAssociation; and the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs.\n  The Hispanic National Bar Association, the Mexican American Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund, the League of United Latin American \nCitizens, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed \nOfficials, and many, many others have been seeking a vote on this \nnomination for what now amounts to years.\n  I want to commend the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his \nsteadfast support of this nominee and Senator Boxer and Senator \nFeinstein of California for their efforts on his behalf.\n  Last year the words of the Chief Justice of the United States were \nringing in our ears with respect to the delays in Senate consideration \nof judicial nomination. He had written:\n\n       Some current nominees have been waiting considerable time \n     for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. \n     . . . The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry \n     it should vote him up or vote him down.\n\n  Richard Paez's nomination to the Ninth Circuit had already been \npending for 24 months when the Chief Justice issued that statement--and \nthat was almost two years ago. The Chief Justice's words resound in \nconnection with the nomination of Judge Paez. He has twice been \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee. It was been pending for \nalmost 44 months. The court to which he was nominated has multiple \nvacancies. In fairness to Judge Paez and all the people served by the \nNinth Circuit, the Senate should vote on this nomination.\n  Justice Ronnie White is another nominee who has been pending before \nthe Senate without a vote for an exceedingly long time. In June I gave \na Senate speech marking the 2-year anniversary of the nomination of \nthis outstanding jurist to what is now a judicial emergency vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. He is \ncurrently a member of the Missouri Supreme Court.\n  He was nominated by President Clinton in June of 1997. It took 11 \nmonths before the Senate would even allow him to have a confirmation \nhearing. His nomination was then reported favorably on a 13 to 3 vote \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 21, 1998. Senators Hatch, \nThurmond, Grassley, Specter, Kyl, and DeWine were the Republican \nmembers of the Committee who voted for him along with the Democratic \nmembers. Senators Ashcroft, Abraham and Sessions voted against him.\n  Even though he had been voted out overwhelmingly, he sat on the \ncalendar last year, and the nomination was returned to the President \nafter 16 months with no action.\n  The President renominated him and on July 22 the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee again reported the nomination favorably to the Senate, this \ntime by a vote of two to one.\n  Justice White deserves better than benign neglect. The people of \nMissouri deserve a fully qualified and fully staffed Federal bench.\n  Justice White has one of the finest records--and the experience and \nstanding--of any lawyer that has come before the Judiciary Committee. \nHe has served in the Missouri legislature, the office of the city \ncounselor for the City of St. Louis, and he was a judge in the Missouri \nCourt of Appeals for the Eastern District of Missouri before his \ncurrent service as the first African-American ever to serve on the \nMissouri Supreme Court.\n  Having been voted out of Committee twice, he has now been forced to \nwait\n\n[[Page S11017]]\n\nfor more than two years for Senate action. This distinguished African-\nAmerican at least deserves the respect of this Senate, and he should be \nallowed a vote, up or down. Senators can stand up and say they will \nvote for or against him, but let this man have his vote. Twenty-seven \nmonths after being nominated, the nomination remains pending before the \nSenate. I would certainly like to see Justice White be accorded an up \nor down vote.\n  I have been concerned for the last several years that it seems women \nand minority nominees are being delayed and not considered. I spoke to \nthe Senate about this situation on May 22, June 22 and, again, on \nOctober 8 last year. Over the last couple of years the Senate has \nfailed to act on the nominations of Judge James A. Beaty, Jr. to be the \nfirst African-American judge on the Fourth Circuit; Jorge C. Rangel to \nthe Fifth Circuit; Clarence J. Sundram to the District Court for the \nNorthern District of New York; Anabelle Rodriguez to the District Court \nin Puerto Rico; and many others.\n  In explaining why he chose to withdraw from consideration for \nrenomination after waiting 15 months for Senate action, Jorge Rangel \nwrote to the President and explained:\n\n       Our judicial system depends on men and women of good will \n     who agree to serve when asked to do so. But public service \n     asks too much when those of us who answer the call to service \n     are subjected to a confirmation process dominated by \n     interminable delays and inaction. Patience has its virtues, \n     but it also has its limits.\n\n  Last year the average for all nominees confirmed was over 230 days \nand 11 nominees confirmed last year took longer than 9 months: Judge \nWilliam Fletcher's confirmation took 41 months--it became the longest-\npending judicial nomination in the history of the United States; Judge \nHilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Judge Susan Oki Mollway's \nconfirmation took 30 months, Judge Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 \nmonths, Judge Margaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Judge \nMargaret Morrow's confirmation took 21 months, Judge Sonia Sotomayor's \nconfirmation took 15 months, Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer's confirmation \ntook 14 months, Judge Ivan Lemelle's confirmation took 14 months, Judge \nDan Polster's confirmation took 12 months, and Judge Victoria Roberts' \nconfirmation took 11 months. Of these 11, eight are women or minority \nnominees. Another was Professor Fletcher was held up, in large measure \nbecause of opposition to his mother, Judge Betty Fletcher.\n\n  In 1997, of the 36 nominations eventually confirmed, 9, fully one-\nquarter of all those confirmed, took more than 9 months before a final \nfavorable Senate vote.\n  In 1996, the Republican Senate shattered the record for the average \nnumber of days from nomination to confirmation for judicial \nconfirmation. The average rose to a record 183 days. In 1997, the \naverage number of days from nomination to confirmation rose \ndramatically yet again, and that was during the first year of a \npresidential term. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average \ntime it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke \nthe 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days.\n  Unfortunately, that time is still growing and the average is still \nrising to the detriment of the administration of justice. Last year the \nSenate broke its dismal record. The average time from nomination to \nconfirmation for the 65 judges confirmed in 1998 was over 230 days.\n  Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the \nSenate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its \nunprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees since the 104th \nCongress, the Senate is shirking its duty. That is wrong and should \nend. The Senate recesses with a sorry record of inaction on judicial \nnominations.\n  Another example of a longstanding nominee who is being denied a \nSenate vote is Marsha Berzon. Fully one-quarter of the active \njudgeships authorized for that Court remain vacant, as they have been \nfor several years. The Judicial Conference recently requested that \nNinth Circuit judgeships be increased in light of its workload by an \nadditional five judges. That means that while Ms. Berzon's nomination \nhas been pending, that Court has been forced to struggle through its \nextraordinary workload with 12 fewer judges than it needs.\n  Marsha Berzon is an outstanding nominee. By all accounts, she is an \nexceptional lawyer with extensive appellate experience, including a \nnumber of cases heard by the Supreme Court. She has the strong support \nof both California Senators and a well-qualified rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  She was initially nominated in January 1998, almost 20 months ago. \nShe participated in an extensive two-part confirmation hearing before \nthe Committee back on July 30, 1998. Thereafter she received a number \nof sets of written questions from a number of Senators and responded in \nAugust of last year. A second round of written questions was sent and \nshe responded by the middle of September of last year. Despite the \nefforts of Senator Feinstein, Senator Kennedy, Senator Specter and \nmyself to have her considered by the Committee, she was not included on \nan agenda and not voted on during all of 1998. Her nomination was \nreturned to the President without action by this Committee or the \nSenate last October.\n  This year the President renominated Ms. Berzon in January. She \nparticipated in her second confirmation hearing in June, was sent \nadditional sets of written questions, responded and got and answered \nanother round. I do not know why those questions were not asked last \nyear.\n  Finally, on July 1 more than two months ago and before Mr. Stewart \nwas even nominated, the Committee considered the nomination and agreed \nto report it to the Senate favorably. After more than a year and one-\nhalf the Senate should, at long last, vote on the nomination. Senators \nwho find some reason to oppose this exceptionally qualified woman \nlawyer can vote against her if they choose, but she should be accorded \nan up or down vote. That is what I have been asking for and that is \nwhat fairness demands.\n  Unfortunately, the list goes on and on. In addition, there is the \nnomination of Timothy Dyk to the Federal Circuit. Tim Dyk was initially \nnominated in April 1998, and participated in a confirmation hearing \nlast July. He was favorably reported to the Senate by a vote of 14 to 4 \nlast September. His was one of the several judicial nominations not \nacted upon by the Senate last year before it adjourned. Instead, the \nSenate returned this nomination to the President without action.\n  The President proceeded to renominate Mr. Dyk in January 1999. Since \nthen, his nomination, which had been favorably reported last year, has \nbeen in limbo. I raised his nomination at our first Committee meeting \nof the year in February and a number of times thereafter. Still, he is \nbeing held hostage in the Committee without action.\n  There are the nominations of Barry Goode to the Ninth Circuit, who \nwas first nominated in June 1998 and is still patiently awaiting a \nconfirmation hearing; of Julio Fuentes to the Third Circuit, has been \npending three times longer than the Stewart nomination and is still \nawaiting his confirmation hearing; of Ray Fisher to the Ninth Circuit, \nwho is an outstanding lawyer and public servant now Associate Attorney \nGeneral of the United States Department of Justice and was reported by \nthe Committee on a vote of 16 to 2 but remains held on the Senate \nCalendar. There are the nominations of Alston Johnson to the Fifth \nCircuit, James Duffy to the Ninth Circuit, and Elena Kagan to the D.C. \nCircuit, among others who were nominated before Mr. Stewart. There are \nthe district court nominations of Legrome Davis and Lynette Norton in \nPennsylvania, Virginia Phillips, James Lorenz, Dolly Gee and Frederic \nWoocher in California, Rich Leonard in North Carolina, Frank McCarthy \nin Oklahoma, Patricia Coan in Colorado, and William Joseph Haynes, Jr. \nin Tennessee, to name a few.\n  All together, there are more than 30 pending judicial nominations \nthat were received by the Senate before it received the Stewart \nnomination and they need our attention, too. That is the point I am \ntrying to make. I understand that nominations are not considered in \nlockstep order based on the date of receipt. I understand and respect \nthe prerogatives of the majority\n\n[[Page S11018]]\n\nparty and the Majority Leader. I appreciate the interest of the \nChairman of the Committee in filling vacancies in his State and want to \nwork with him. I ask only that the Senate be fair to these other \nnominees, as well. In my view, Ted Stewart is entitled to a vote on his \nnomination and should get it, but these other nominees should be \naccorded fair treatment, as well. Nominees like Judge Richard Paez, \nJustice Ronnie White, and Marsha Berzon should be voted on up or down \nby the Senate. We are asking and have been asking the Republican \nleadership to schedule votes on those nominations so that action on all \nthe nominations can move forward.\n  Mr. EDWARDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11018-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HURRICANE DAMAGE IN NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment today about \nthe hurricane and report to my colleagues on what we have learned about \nthe damage Hurricane Floyd has done in North Carolina.\n  As most folks know, North Carolina, unfortunately, has borne the \nbrunt of hurricanes over the last few years. I think this is the fifth \nmajor hurricane to hit North Carolina since 1996. What we know thus far \nis that four people have died in traffic-related accidents as a result \nof the hurricane.\n  First, of course, our thoughts and prayers go to the families of \nthose folks who have lost loved ones. Secondly, we have had enormous \nflooding. That flooding will continue, and there will be some period of \ntime before that flooding recedes. Wilmington has received over 18 \ninches of rain in the last approximately 48 hours, and other areas of \neastern North Carolina have received enormous amounts of rain during \nthe same period of time.\n  We have also had enormous problems with crop damage and injury and \ndamage to our farms, particularly in eastern North Carolina. These \nfarmers are already struggling and suffering and having a difficult \ntime making ends meet. Now they have received a blow, which may very \nwell be a death blow, to the crops they still have in the fields. As I \nsaid, these are people who are already teetering on the edge. Now these \nfarmers and their families must deal with the damage that Hurricane \nFloyd has caused their farms.\n  We have also had roads washed out in eastern North Carolina. We know \nwe have power outages all over eastern North Carolina, and we have and \nwill continue to have enormous problems with increased erosion as a \nresult of this hurricane hitting the coast of North Carolina.\n  Let me say, first, that I have been in regular contact with Governor \nJim Hunt, the Governor of North Carolina, since this hurricane began to \napproach the southeastern coast of the United States in order to help \nprepare for what we knew was inevitable--that this would do great \ndamage for our State. In addition, I have been in constant contact with \nmayors from eastern North Carolina whose counties have been hit the \nhardest by this hurricane. Yesterday afternoon, I spent some time at \nthe FEMA headquarters with James Lee Witt looking at the FEMA \noperation--looking at what they were doing to prepare for the onslaught \nof this hurricane and their preparations for going in after the \nhurricane and dealing with destruction created by the hurricane.\n  I have to say, first of all, it was an incredibly impressive \noperation. James Lee Witt has done an extraordinary job of turning FEMA \naround. They are well prepared and well organized. I strongly suspect \nthey will respond quickly and efficiently to the destruction this \nparticular storm creates.\n  In addition to that, I talked to the Secretary of Transportation, Mr. \nSlater, about the problems with roads and roads being washed out, \nkeeping in mind that North Carolina has just recently been hit with \nHurricane Dennis, which washed out Highway 12 up on the Outer Banks of \nNorth Carolina, and now it has been hit again by a larger, more serious \nhurricane. We are going to have enormous problems with our roads in \neastern North Carolina.\n  I have also spoken with Secretary Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture, \nbecause of our concern for the farmers in North Carolina. The tobacco \nfarmers and the farmers of all kinds in eastern North Carolina are \ngoing to suffer enormous crop damage as a result of the devastation \ncreated by this hurricane.\n  As I mentioned earlier, these are folks who are already struggling, \nalready suffering, and already under enormous financial stress. And now \nhere comes Hurricane Floyd putting what for many of them, I am afraid, \nwill be the final nail in the coffin. These folks are going to need our \nhelp.\n  The bottom line is that while this hurricane has now moved out of \nNorth Carolina, it has created enormous damage. I think the devastation \nwill be extraordinary once we have had a chance to go in and assess \nexactly what the damage has been.\n  As we go through the process of passing these various appropriations \nbills that the Senate is working very diligently on, I have asked my \ncolleagues to keep in mind that the people of North Carolina, including \nthe farmers of North Carolina, are desperately going to need help. They \nneed help quickly, and they need that help getting to them in time to \nrespond to the devastation that Hurricane Floyd has created.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to keep that in mind. We will be in \nregular touch with the folks involved in appropriations in order to \nmake them aware of the specific problems that we have in North \nCarolina.\n  I also add that this injury and this damage is not limited to North \nCarolina. I am absolutely certain there is damage in Florida, Georgia, \nand South Carolina. As the storm moves north through Virginia and \nMaryland, I anticipate there will also be damage in those States.\n  I ask my colleagues not only from those States but all of my \ncolleagues in the Senate to be prepared to respond and respond quickly \nto a devastating blow that has been dealt to my State of North Carolina \nand to the surrounding States that have been hit by Hurricane Floyd.\n  Finally, I would like to say just a word about the people of North \nCarolina and their response to this hurricane.\n\n  The people of North Carolina, fortunately, are very experienced in \ndealing with hurricanes. They have been hit time and time again. I have \nto say we have gotten way more than our fair share of hurricanes and \nhurricane damage. The response of folks in eastern North Carolina has \nbeen heroic. It was absolutely extraordinary to watch their discipline \nand preparation when they saw the storm coming, their organized and \ncoordinated effort to evacuate the coast when those evacuations were \nnecessary, and their preparation for what they knew was inevitable, \nwhich was that Hurricane Floyd was going to come through eastern North \nCarolina and wreak havoc and devastation.\n  I am so proud of the people of North Carolina who have responded so \nheroically and in such a well-organized way to what they knew was \ncoming, and I expect that response will continue over the next weeks \nand months as we begin the efforts of cleaning up the devastation that \nhas been created by Hurricane Floyd.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 20 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11018-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11018-S11023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OPERATION ALLIED FORCE: LESSONS RELEARNED\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, over the couse of the next several months, \ncountless ``lessons learned'' studies assessed Operation Allied Force \nwill be conducted by NATO authorities as well as by our armed services, \nour own Committees here in Congress, and their counterparts found among \nour NATO allies.\n  What I wish to do today is to approach this matter of ``lessons \nlearned'' from the vantage point of one who regards the NATO Alliance \nto be a vital\n\n[[Page S11019]]\n\ninterest of the United States. I want to ensure that NATO's experience \nin Kosovo contributes to an Alliance that is better prepared for the \nchallenges it will face in the next millennium.\n  The conflict over Kosovo was NATO's first war, and the Alliance did \nwin. Operation Allied Force forced the regime of Serbian Prime Minister \nSlobodan Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo. It thereby ended \nthe systematic brutality that regime exercised against the province's \nAlbanian population.\n  It was in many ways a military campaign of unprecedented success. Not \na single NATO airman lost his or her life to enemy fire in the course \nof over 35,000 sorties. Despite a few tragic errors, the bombing \ncampaign featured unmatched accuracy and precision.\n  However, while Operation Allied Force did attain victory, the \naccomplishment of its goals did not yield a shared sense of triumph and \nfinality. This absence of triumph is the product of how NATO exercised \nits power in this war in light of the tremendous military advantages it \nhad over its opponent, the forces of the Milosevic regime.\n  Among NATO's first and foremost objectives in this war was to stop \nthe atrocities then being committed against Kosovar Albanians. Yet, in \nthe course of Operation Allied Force, Milosevic accelerated and \nexpanded his campaign of terror. Before the war was over, nearly 90% of \nKosovar Albanians were driven from their homes by Serbian para-military \nand military forces. Nearly one half were actually expelled from \nKosovo.\n  Moreover, no less than 10,000 Albanians were executed by Milosevic's \nhenchmen during the course of the NATO campaign. As we learn daily from \nthe grim excavations of body-filled wells and mass graves, the actual \nfigure is probably much, much higher. And then there were the countless \nrapes of Albanian women, which for cultural reasons will unfortunately \nnever be fully reported--all occurring during the course of Operation \nAllied Force.\n  When assessing the lessons learned from the Kosovo war, we must not \nforget that the primary purpose of NATO's threats and then its bombing \ncampaign was to prevent these tragedies from occurring.\n  Then there are the facts concern the balance of power between NATO \nand Serbia. It took the Alliance 78 days to force Milosevic from \nKosovo, a region that size of Los Angeles County whose population was \n90% Albanian--a population that wanted NATO's support and that would \nhave warmly welcomed Alliance ground forces as was done when Operation \nJoint Guardian commenced.\n  That this campaign took 78 days is especially disturbing when one \ntakes into account that, according to a Washington Post report, NATO \nwas a standing force some 37 times larger than that fielded by Slobodan \nMilosevic and a combined economy that is 696 times larger than that of \nSerbia. These statistics do not come close to capturing the vast \ntechnological advantages NATO forces have over the Serbian military.\n  That NATO won the war is obvious. That in the course of Operation \nAllied Force, NATO demonstrated its awesome capabilities is \nindisputable. But, when assessing the lessons learned from this war, \none cannot avoid the haunting fact that its results included an acute \nand brutal increase in the suffering of the Kosovar population, that an \nAlliance of such power and magnitude took over two months to defeat an \nexponentially far weaker foe, and that in the aftermatch of Operation \nAllied Force, the regime that created this crisis remains not only \nin place, but belligerent.\n\n  So what are the key lessons and issues raised by NATO's first war, a \nwar that brought NATO victory yet, denied it triumph?\n  The first and foremost lesson concerns the Alliance's political \ncohesion. Many have stated that NATO's greatest success in this \nconflict was that its 19 members hung together.\n  There can be no doubt that this cohesion was rooted in the common \nvalues and interests that bind the 19 Allies. But in recognizing this, \none must not overlook a central fact: The first lesson from Operation \nAllied Force is that the trust among Allied military personnel promoted \nby NATO is an invaluable reinforcer of the political cohesion binding \nNATO Allies. Allied unity in this war was never a given. Several allies \nfloated proposals to temporarily halt the bombing campaign. Others \npublicly denied the use of their territory for forced entry into Kosovo \nor Serbia proper. NATO's political cohesion was vulnerable in an often \nvery visible manner.\n  The trust and unity fostered among allied militaries through fifty \nyears of joint planning, training, command and operations significantly \nbuttressed the durability of Alliance cohesion during the conflict. \nUnfortunately, I fear that the significance of this military bond may \nnever be fully appreciated. I am disturbed that French Defense Minister \nAlain Richard recently asserted that the experience of Operation Allied \nForce has only further legitimized Paris' inclination to remain outside \nof NATO's Integrated Military Command.\n  Quite the contrary, the war over Kosovo underscored the need for all \nAllies to become full members of that integrated command structure. It \nis an institution that facilitates and orchestrates more effective \nmilitary operations by the NATO coalition. Its day-to-day operation is \na cornerstone of trust and credibility that in times of crisis and war \nnot only maximizes NATO's military effectiveness, but also its \npolitical unity.\n  As I just stated, numerous studies assessing the strategy behind \nOperation Allied Force are underway. Much attention will be directed, \nas it should, toward the factors that contributed to Milosevic's \ncapitulation. These, of course, include that regime's intensified \ninternational isolation, the actual damage done to its military and \ncivilian infrastructure, the role of the KLA, and the influence of \nslowly increasing NATO ground force deployments around Kosovo, among \nothers.\n  We also need to ensure a fair and objective assessment of the \nAlliance's decision to tailor the bombing campaign around a strategy of \ngradual escalation. And, there has to be a thorough review of the \ndecision to preclude the use of NATO ground forces for a forced entry \ninto Kosovo. An important question will be whether a more severe and \noverwhelming application of force would have more effectively prevented \nthe suffering that occurred in Kosovo over those 78 days.\n  Because so much attention will be directed toward these issues and \nothers related to what went right and wrong in Kosovo, we must, \nhowever, avoid the mistake of making Kosovo a singular template for \nNATO's planning and preparations for future conflicts. As a matter of \nprudence, we have to assume that the future will present contingencies \nthat are more demanding than that which we encountered over Kosovo.\n  Hence, the central focus of our assessments must be the following \nissue: Did Operation Allied Force demonstrate that NATO benefits from a \nforce structure that can deploy on suitably short notice, be sustained \nover long distances, and readily provide Alliance leaders the option of \nswiftly delivering overwhelming force, be it from the sea, from the \nair, or from the ground?\n  These are not new standards. The Alliance's Strategic Concept of \n1991, which was updated in the course of the Washington Summit last \nApril, postulated a NATO force featuring ``enhanced flexibility and \nmobility and an assured capability for augmentation when necessary.'' \nThat same doctrine also called upon the Alliance to have available \n``appropriate force structures and procedures, including those that \nwould provide an ability to build up, deploy and draw down forces \nquickly and discriminately.'' With this in mind, NATO established in \n1991 its ``Rapid Reaction Forces.''\n\n  So after eight years, just how rapid and overwhelming are NATO's \nforces?\n  Operation Allied Force yielded a very mixed answer to this question. \nAnd, it generates concern on my part about the overall readiness of \nAllied forces, including those of our own country, and, thus, the \noverall health of the Alliance.\n  First, it is clear that the Alliance's ability to deliver devastating \nfirepower from the air emerges almost solely from the United States. \nThe U.S. provided 70% of the aircraft flown in Operation Allied Force. \nAnd, an overwhelming majority of the precision\n\n[[Page S11020]]\n\nguided missions launched in the conflict were American.\n  While Allied Force demonstrated the awesome capacities of American \nair power, it also highlighted glaring shortfalls in European \ninventories, including: fighter-bombers; electronic jamming aircraft; \nadvanced command, control, and communications capacities; intelligence \ncapacities; and, precision-guided munitions.\n  Instead of becoming a symbol of NATO power, Operation Allied Force \nemerged as a symbol of the imbalance that exists between the military \ncapabilities of the United States and its Allies. While it is true that \nour allies are bearing their share of responsibility in Operation Just \nCause, we cannot ignore the unequal capabilities the Allies bring to \nthe forward edge of NATO's sword.\n  The Alliance's singular dependence upon the United States is neither \nconducive to transatlantic unity nor is it the best way to provide an \nAlliance capability that is robust in the fullest sense of the term. An \nAlliance is simply not healthy if it is solely dependent upon the \ncapabilities of but one member.\n  It is, thus, especially disturbing that both France and Germany \nannounced planned cuts in their defense budgets just weeks after the \nend of Operation Allied Force. It raises questions as to how seriously \nthey take this matter.\n  Second, the Kosovo war highlighted great gaps in inter-operability \nthat divide Allied forces. No military commander has dedicated more \ntime and focus on this urgent concern than General Klaus Naumann, who \nstepped down in April as Chairman of NATO's military Committee. He has \nrepeatedly warned that ``the growing gap of capabilities which we see \ninside NATO . . . will lead to an inter-operability problem.''\n  Operation Allied Force showed that this inter-operability problem is \nnot a matter of military theory, but that it is matter of real and \nurgent concern. As we all know, Serbian forces were given advance \nwarning of Allied attacks, including specific targets, when Allied \naircraft were forced to communicate over open and insecure radio \nchannels because they did not benefit from suitably compatible and \nsecure communications systems. This, needless to say, undercut the \neffectiveness of the bombing campaign. More importantly, it subjected \nAllied pilots to unnecessarily greater danger.\n  Third, the Kosovo war highlighted the limited mobility of Allied \nforces. In April, I was disturbed to hear our nation's premier military \nexperts assert that it would take months for the Alliance to deploy a \nground force in the Balkans suitable for a forced entry into Kosovo or \nSerbia. Considering the relative size and capability of Serbia's armed \nforces to that of NATO and the proximity of Kosovo to available staging \ngrounds for such a forced entry, this assertion does not reflect well \non the mobility of NATO military capacities.\n  This is a matter relevant not only to our European Allies, but also \nto the United States as well. As the Kosovo War demonstrated, not every \nconflict of the future will be like that of Operation Desert Storm \nwhere the United States was able to use literally months to build-up \nthe offensive force necessary to expel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. In \n1991, NATO established its Rapid Reaction Corps. I repeat in 1991! \nWhere was this corps and its rapidly deployable assets when NATO found \nitself confronted by a regime that was exponentially weaker and \nsituated in its backyard, if not on its doorstep?\n  These are not new issues nor new conclusions. Burden-sharing has \nalways been an acute thorn in the side of Alliance unity. For several \nyears, numerous European and American commanders, in addition to \nGeneral Naumann, have been warning of the growing technology gap \nbetween the armed forces of the United States and Europe. And, NATO's \nown Strategic Concepts have been urging the Alliance to field forces \nthat are rapidly deployable and assets that can sustain these forces \nover long distances and long periods of time. What is disturbing is \nthat after nearly a decade, the need for such forces has been so loudly \nreaffirmed by the Kosovo war.\n\n  Considering what can happen in war, Operation Allied Force provides a \nnot-so-gentle reminder of the need to more seriously address these \nchallenges. If one believes, as I do, that one has to assume that NATO \nwill in the future face contingencies more challenging than that \npresented in Kosovo, it is imperative that NATO do more than study \nthese issues. Alliance members must dedicate the resources necessary to \novercome these shortcomings. To quote General Naumann again, what ``we \nrequire [is] action, and not just more paper declarations.''\n  In addition to reviewing and studying the insights provided by \nOperation Allied Force upon Allied military strategy and capabilities, \nwe have to remember that NATO is first and foremost a political \nAlliance. The conduct and procedures used in the course of the Kosovo \nwar by NATO's political authorities must also be reviewed and \ncritiqued.\n  It was discomfiting, to say the least, to observe inter-Alliance \ndisputes over target lists emerge on the public scene. NATO stumbled in \nthe first phase of the campaign when individual NATO heads of state \nwere personally reviewing and squabbling over daily targets lists.\n  These disputes, which concerned how to achieve ends through the use \nof force, raise a number of questions that must be addressed over the \ncoming months. These include the following:\n  Was Operation Allied Force an example of coalition warfare or a ``war \nby committee.''\n  Should the Alliance establish procedures that will further separate \nthe political and diplomatic decisions defining the objectives of war \nas well as the decision to go to war from those military decisions \nthrough which the war is executed?\n  In the course of Operation Allied Force, did the SACEUR benefit from \nthe flexibility and freedom of action his office requires in the \nconduct of war? Are there alternative arrangements between the SACEUR \nand the NAC that the Alliance should consider?\n  Does the SACEUR have sufficient command and control over his \nsubordinate commanders?\n  With regard to the last question, it has been widely reported that in \nthe course of the NATO-Russia showdown over the Pristina airport, \nBritish Commander General Robertson refused an order from SACEUR \nGeneral Clark to seize that airport prior to the arrival of the Russian \nbattalion. General Robertson balked at the order and successfully \nappealed to his British senior political authorities to have that order \nrescinded. This example demonstrated the inherently political nature of \nNATO's multi-national command structures, one that warrants close \nexamination.\n  The questions I have raised constitute the core issues of coalition \nwarfare. They are central to the Alliance's ability to sustain unity in \ntimes of crisis and conflict. They are also core issues of civilian \ncontrol over the military, a cornerstone of democracy.\n  While it is widely known that many NATO officers were not totally \nenamored of the political constraints they were dealt in Operation \nAllied Force, the evidence currently available indicates that they \naccepted and respected these constraints. They fully respected the \nauthorities of their civilian leaders. That is another overlooked NATO \nsuccess story in Operation Allied Force.\n  In posing the aforementioned questions, the intention is not \nnecessarily to yield structural change, but to ensure a fuller \nunderstanding of what to expect and demand of our Alliance's political \nand military leadership in times of conflict. In doing so we may be \nbetter able, and I quote again General Naumann, ``to find a way to \nreconcile the conditions of a coalition war with the principles of \nmilitary operations such as surprise and the use of overwhelming \nforce.'' That sustaining Allied unity was one of the success stories of \nOperations Allied Force is a fact that shows how NATO manages war is as \nimportant a matter as the capacities NATO brings to war.\n\n  The Kosovo war also yielded lessons about another issue of great \nimportance to the Alliance, the relationship between NATO and Russia. \nOver the last decade the alliance has made great efforts to transform \nthat relationship into one of partnership. Toward that end, it invited \nRussia to join its Partnership to Peace Program, and in 1997 the NATO-\nRussia Founding Act was signed establishing a unique consultative \nrelationship between Brussels\n\n[[Page S11021]]\n\nand Moscow. This effort to build a genuine partnership must be \ncontinued, but it also must be pursued with greater realism.\n  The Kosovo war was the first major test of the progress made in \nrelations between the Alliance and Russia since the end of the Cold \nWar. Moscow's conduct in the course of this conflict and its immediate \naftermath demonstrated that while Russia may not be the protagonist it \nwas in the Cold War, it is certainly not a partner, at least not today. \nTo paraphrase Russia analyst Tom Graham, Russia is more often than not, \nsometimes purposely and sometimes inadvertently, a troublesome problem.\n  A brief review of Russia's role in the Kosovo conflict underscores \nthis point. First, remember that Russia still calls for NATO's \ndissolution. Second, from the very start of Operation Allied Force, \nMoscow harshly condemned the bombing campaign and sided with Slobodan \nMilosevic. Russia continued oil transfers to Serbia despite a request \nby nearly all other European democracies to impose an embargo. So-\ncalled ``Russian volunteers'' operated with Milosevic's forces in \nKosovo and Serbia and with the blessing of Moscow authorities. Third, \nRussia's successful dash to Pristina and its airport required a great \ndeal of coordination with Serbian authorities. Moreover, let us not \nforget that Russian and Serbian soldiers jointly manned roadblocks in \nKosovo that impeded the movement of Allied units in the initial days of \nOperation Just Cause.\n  Russia's conduct in the course of Operation Allied Force and its \nself-invited role in Operation Just Cause demonstrated the volatility \nthat still characterizes Russia's foreign policy, particularly its \napproach to NATO. Russian participation in NATO diplomatic and military \noperations is a double-edged sword, and has to be treated as such, \nparticularly when sensitive Alliance operations are at stake.\n  Engaging Russia should remain a significant priority of the Alliance. \nIntroducing greater realism to this effort does not mean isolating \nRussia. It does involve recognizing the difficult challenge of \nsimultaneously promoting cooperation and mutual accommodation while \navoiding propitiating risk-taking behavior by Moscow, such as that \nwhich occurred in Pristina.\n  The lesson from Kosovo is that while we must engage Russia with the \ngoal of creating partnership, greater realism and caution in this \nendeavor is more likely to yield more stable and enduring cooperation.\n  The Kosovo war demonstrated the continued centrality of NATO to \ntransatlantic security. It has demonstrated the awesome power that \nemanates from allied unity. It underscored the profound political and \nmilitary pay-off that comes from fifty years of intensive military \nconsultation, cooperation, coordination, joint planning, joint \ntraining, and all the day-to-day activities the Allied militaries \nconduct to protect and defend our common values and interests and \npeace.\n  The war over Kosovo tangibly reminded us of the military and \npolitical challenges NATO will likely face in the future. It was a firm \nreminder of the need for the Alliance's force structure to become more \nmobile and more capable of rapid deployment. It was an urgent call for \nimprovements in the inter-operability of Allied forces and in the \nbalance of transatlantic military capabilities. And it provided the \nfirst test of NATO's ability to manage war in the post-Cold War era.\n  As Operation Allied Force was NATO's first war, it is essential that \nwe ensure that it is comprehensively reviewed. In objectively assessing \nwhat went right and wrong, we must keep our eyes upon NATO's future. We \nmust also work to ensure that the lessons learned and relearned from \nOperation Allied Force will not just reside in dusty reports but \nactually prompt decisions and actions that improve NATO's ability to \ndecisively manage the political and military levels of war.\n  Mr. President, I have quoted General Klaus Naumann several times and \nwish to share with my colleagues the transcript of his farewell remarks \nof May 4, 1999, the last day of his tenure as Chairman of NATO's \nMilitary Committee. They provide sage advise concerning NATO's future \nfrom an experienced military commander, and I urge my colleagues to \ntake the time necessary to review them. I ask unanimous consent they be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Transcript of Press Conference\n\n     (By General Klaus Naumann, Chairman of the Military Committee)\n\n       General Naumann. Ladies and Gentlemen, first of all thank \n     you very much for coming. I thought I should not hand over my \n     Chairmanship of the Military Committee after three and a \n     quarter years without having addressed you once again and \n     giving you a little bit of I should say an up-date. Where do \n     we stand at this point in time, after three and a quarter \n     years which presumably will go down in history as the most \n     turbulent years in NATO's 50 years of history, years in which \n     the Alliance changed more profoundly than ever before.\n       I think it is best expressed by two political data which \n     marked my tour, It started more or less with the Berlin \n     Foreign Ministers meeting in June 1996 when the Alliance set \n     sail to give itself a new set of missions, and it ended more \n     or less with the Washington Summit a couple of days ago, \n     where we published a number of documents in which all this \n     progress which we made I think is really enshrined.\n       Of course you may be focused, as I am these days, on \n     Kosovo. But I think we should not forget the bigger picture \n     as well and I think I would like to bring to your attention a \n     few points which belong to the bigger picture. When I assumed \n     office as Chairman of the Military Committee, I had 14 \n     nations sitting around the table--14. Then France joined, \n     then Iceland, after 49 years, joined the military Committee. \n     And now we have three new members at the table. It is a clear \n     indication that NATO maintains and has strengthened cohesion \n     and achieved improvements.\n       One of the improvements which I would like to mention is \n     the new command structure which hopefully over time will lead \n     to marked improvements, particularly in the southern region \n     of NATO, and I dare to say no Chairman of the Military \n     Committee before me has invested so much time and devoted so \n     much attention to the problems of the southern region, and in \n     particular of southeastern Europe. And as a matter of fact we \n     have made big progress in this area and we planted seeds \n     which hopefully will produce over time a really big and \n     powerful tree.\n       We also began to work in these three years in the EAPMC \n     format. We got partners to contribute and to engage in a \n     dialogue. This has been for me the most fascinating \n     experience. We should never forget most of these partners \n     were just 10 years ago in the camp of NATO's enemy, and now \n     we are working together. And we got them in this new format \n     of the EAPMC to contribute, to engage in dialogue, and I \n     believe this instrument of the EAPMC has the biggest gross \n     potential for crisis management and conflict prevention in \n     Europe if we handle it properly. So this is something we \n     should dwell on in the future.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Question. General, that was the first confirmation we have \n     heard that the two planes lost by NATO were shot down. Can \n     you reconfirm that they were shot down?\n       General Naumann. I think that we have said in previous \n     statements that they were shot down.\n       Question. And I have a follow-up. You have been a key \n     player in the Kosovo operation since it started. How \n     difficult is it going to be for somebody else to take over \n     your position and how do you feel about it personally? Is it \n     going to be difficult for you to be no longer operationally \n     involved in something that you have been involved in from the \n     beginning, and is there a risk of you turning into one of \n     those people that you have criticised in the past, an \n     armchair General, who will be advocating sending in ground \n     troops the minute you take your uniform off?\n       General Naumann. Starting with your last point, I can \n     assure you I will not join the league of armchair generals \n     and I will refrain from any comment with regard to the \n     activities of any of my successors. That is for me part of \n     fair play. And I am pretty well aware that it is very easy to \n     sit in an armchair and to make wonderful proposals since you \n     do not feel the burden of responsibility on your shoulders. \n     The only responsibility you have is to cater for the cheque \n     you receive in some of the broadcasting stations for giving \n     interviews, and I do not want to join that league.\n       Secondly, with regard to how I feel personally, well of \n     course you are not entirely happy in such a situation. It is \n     like leaving a group of friends aboard a ship which is in \n     stormy seas and suddenly I am whisked away by a helicopter. I \n     haven't ordered the helicopter and I am not entirely happy \n     that I have to leave and pack, but there is no choice, that \n     is not my choice.\n       And with regard to how I feel to be replaced, I think no-\n     one is irreplaceable. Had I run my car into a tree yesterday \n     night, they had to face the problem to replace me as well, \n     or had I hit myself with a golf club by trying to have too \n     good a swing, they may have a problem as well. So that is \n     not a question, everyone is replaceable.\n       Mark Laity (BBC). You are not yet an armchair general so \n     can I invite you to talk\n\n[[Page S11022]]\n\n     about ground forces? You have said in interviews that \n     military doctrine states that air power has never yet won a \n     war on its own so do you think this one can and if so why? \n     And taking up your theme of the limitations of coalition \n     warfare, do you think the lack of a ground option is a result \n     of the limitations of coalition warfare and the lack of \n     agreement on that?\n       General Naumann. First of all, it's true that military \n     experience so far has suggested that an air campaign so far \n     in history never won a war, that is true and we have \n     mentioned this again and again. But as I said in my briefing, \n     we see a real chance that we can make it and for that reason \n     I think there is no necessity at this point in time to change \n     strategy. We would give out all the wrong signals. We are \n     making progress, we are nibbling away night by night and day \n     by day at some of his military capabilities? Why should we \n     change?\n       You should also not forget that this air campaign is after \n     all, as far as I can see, presumably one of, if not the most \n     successful one which we have seen so far. That is to some \n     extent related to technology since we have many new assets in \n     our inventory which we use successfully, and it is on the \n     other hand related to the fact that we succeeded in winning \n     the necessary air superiority in mid- to high-altitudes.\n       Furthermore, I should say this campaign was never planned \n     without a ground force option at the end but the ground force \n     option is based on a permissive environment. So that will \n     come at the end of the campaign, and for that reason we still \n     stick to military doctrine and, as you know, we are advised \n     to keep all our plans under permanent review--which by the \n     way is a good old military custom and experience. I hope with \n     that I have answered the question.\n       Mark Laity. Could you take up the point about whether \n     coalition warfare is the problem here that has restricted \n     your options regarding a non-permissive ground force?\n       General Naumann. I said earlier on that from my perspective \n     we have seen really good co-operation between the military \n     and the political sides in the planning and preparation of \n     this campaign. For that reason, I simply cannot confirm the \n     notion that the conditions of coalition warfare prevented us \n     from taking up any options at all.\n       Question. General, the strategy behind the air campaign has \n     been criticized in that it limited the number of initial \n     targets and that the phased nature of the campaign gave time \n     to the Yugoslav forces to adjust. With the benefit of \n     hindsight, what would you have done differently to make this \n     campaign more effective?\n       General Naumann. First of all, I really dispute that the \n     campaign is not effective. It is not working as quickly as \n     perhaps many of you had expected. What I think, with \n     hindsight, worth considering are the two points, which I made \n     earlier when I spoke about the two principles of military \n     operations, and that is surprise and overwhelming power. \n     That of course is not possible as far as I can see under \n     the conditions of coalition warfare and that makes a \n     difference between a coalition facing a national state and \n     a coalition facing another coalition. For that reason, I \n     think we need to think through how we can make sure in \n     future operations how we can achieve one or both of them.\n       Question. General, there are assessments that the present \n     operation would have been more effective if NATO had launched \n     the whole operation sooner. Can you share this view?\n       I would come back again to the air campaign. Taking just a \n     military point, what could we achieve just through an air \n     campaign within the different time-scale?\n       And thirdly, if I may, how seriously has NATO/Russian \n     military co-operation been damaged?\n       General Naumann. On the last point, better leave it to the \n     judgement of our Russian colleagues. It is not we who have \n     left co-operation, it is them, and so they have the onus to \n     come back.\n       With regard to the air campaign, I believe that the air \n     campaign is properly working but you should also take into \n     account that we have conditions which we have to follow which \n     are degrading to some extent the impact of the air campaign, \n     most notably the conditions that we have to avoid collateral \n     damage.\n       The Serb military forces are hiding their vehicles, their \n     armour, their artillery in Kosovo next to civilian buildings, \n     to churches, to mosques and what have you. We don't attack \n     them under these circumstances, although we technically could \n     do it, but this would destroy something which we don't want \n     to destroy. I think we have the justified value of all of our \n     society--after all in sharp contrast to Mr. Milosevic--that \n     we don't like war, we the democracies hate war. And for that \n     reason we have got the task of avoiding the loss of human \n     life and I think you would have to look for quite a time in \n     your history books to find an air campaign which lasted 41 \n     days, being conducted in quite an impressive air-defense \n     environment, without one soldier wounded let alone killed. It \n     is not a bad result.\n       On the question of how long it will take us, I cannot give \n     you an answer. There are two to tango and we have a lot of \n     patience if he wants to challenge us.\n       Question (New York Times). General Naumann, you said in \n     your opening statement that an air campaign alone can't stop \n     the ethnic cleansing operation.\n       General Naumann. Entirely, I said.\n       Same Questioner. Entirely. If President Milosevic doesn't \n     change his mind and back down and accept the five points, is \n     it possible do you think that ground forces would not be able \n     to go in a permissive environment and get the refugees back \n     home before the winter sets in, which comes early in Kosovo, \n     at the end of September or October?\n       General Naumann. First of all, when I said ``cannot \n     entirely stop ethnic cleansing and killing from the air'' I \n     think I simply referred to the fact that if we have a \n     policeman or one of these paramilitary thugs running \n     around chasing unarmed civilians with rifles or \n     threatening them with knives, you cannot stop this from \n     the air. It is asking the impossible. But what we can do \n     is to make life for these people so miserable that they \n     will think twice whether they should continue. And then of \n     course we should not speculate at this point in time under \n     which conditions an implementation force will go in. Of \n     course, we will see the impact of a continued air campaign \n     and we will see how they will feel after a few more weeks, \n     months or what have you of continuously pounding them into \n     pieces.\n       Question. General Naumann, I think you said, if I heard \n     right, that President Milosevic's campaign of mass \n     deportation is still achievable. Could you expand on that and \n     tell us what you mean? Although there are still many hundreds \n     of thousands of Albanians still in Kosovo, do you believe it \n     is still achievable?\n       General Naumann. I think if he really wants to get them out \n     and if he uses in the same way the brutal tactics he has used \n     so far, he may have a chance to do this. I don't know how \n     long they will be able to hide, how long they will be able to \n     sustain their lives under very miserable conditions. And we \n     should not forget what we have seen and statements we have \n     seen of his brutal shelling of unarmed civilians with \n     artillery and with tanks. This will have an impact over time \n     and I only hope that the appropriate international bodies \n     will take care of those who committed these crimes of war.\n       Question (Newsweek Magazine). General Naumann, this seems \n     to be a war in which we count the bodies of our friends and \n     the people we're defending. We count them by the hundreds of \n     thousands, the people we are defending, who have been thrown \n     out of their country and we are proud that we have killed a \n     couple of dozen of the enemy. Does this strike you, as a \n     soldier, as ironic or as a good way to fight a war?\n       And why do we think that the Serbs will capitulate if they \n     are left untouched while the people we are defending are \n     massacred and deported en masse?\n       General Naumann. First of all, I think it is a wrong \n     impression that they are untouched. What we do not know is \n     how many casualties they have, but if I take the fact which \n     presumably was briefed--I didn't have the time to follow the \n     briefing this afternoon--of what result they achieved last \n     night and during the day, if you take it that several tanks \n     and artillery pieces were hit, this is not free of cost of \n     life.\n       Same Questioner. But we don't count those, we are not given \n     those numbers, we are only given the numbers of the people \n     being deported.\n       General Naumann. We don't count--and we cannot count--\n     since, as you all know and you can hear it day by day if you \n     watch CNN when they issue their pictures from Serbia they \n     mention after--I would appreciate it much more if they could \n     do it in the beginning before they make their reports from \n     Mr. Sadler--they mention that this has been censored and that \n     they have to submit their film material to the Yugoslav \n     authorities so that they can control what they are allowed to \n     report. That is the daily statement which we hear on CNN and \n     for me it is quite amazing as a military man that we have not \n     heard one single statement about loss of military life from \n     the Serb side. They mention buses, just the one yesterday \n     which they alleged we had hit with an air bomb, but if you \n     looked at the bus only a layman could believe that this \n     was the impact of an air-delivered weapon, since the bus \n     looks different if you hit it with a bomb as we have seen. \n     But they get credibility for that and many of you take the \n     story up and say: ``This was NATO!''\n       I think you are all experts to some extent and I think many \n     of you are capable of differentiating whether a bus was hit \n     by a bomb or by something like infantry weapons and regarding \n     this last one, I have seen buses which were hit by real \n     weapons and they look different.\n       Same Questioner. But why are we so worried about Serb \n     civilians in fact? Why are we worried so much--not the \n     press--why are you so worried about killing Serb civilians \n     when the Serb government that they support very strongly is \n     massacring and deporting hundreds of thousands of people?\n       General Naumann. You may be right from a moral point of \n     view but we have got the clear order to avoid civilian \n     causalities and that order we execute. And so you should not \n     be surprised if we regard it as a mistake if one civilian has \n     been killed. And it is not our judgement to establish the \n     moral balance. For us it is a deficiency if we kill innocent \n     lives, and I leave aside what the inmates of this bus were \n     doing. That doesn't matter for us. It is deplorable that we \n     hit this bus--the one on the bridge I mean--and that people \n     lost their lives since it was something we were told to \n     avoid. But as I told you, the overall performance in \n     executing this order I think is good and if I compare the \n     number of\n\n[[Page S11023]]\n\n     approximately 15,000 pieces of ordnance dropped and six \n     mishaps, I think it is really not a bad performance.\n       Question (CBS News). General, you said just a few moments \n     ago that there is no reason to change tactics, to bring in \n     ground troops and then in the next breath you say that \n     Milosevic, if he really wants to, can ethnically-cleanse all \n     of Kosovo. We have had figures today of 90 percent of people \n     thrown out of their homes, of killings, of rapes. Is that not \n     reason enough?\n       General Naumann. You are asking a moral question, I \n     understand you fully and from a moral point of view I also \n     hate to see this news, but on the other hand, you can only do \n     what is achievable and what is acceptable by our nations in \n     this Alliance. And for that reason I have to tell you once \n     again that we have no reason at this point in time to change \n     the strategy which is focused to some extent on the \n     philosophy of our democracies that we should avoid \n     casualties, we should avoid the loss of life. That is the \n     basic point. You may be morally dissatisfied with that but \n     that is how life is.\n       Question. General, you had the opportunity and the \n     experience to meet Milosevic. You said before that we needed \n     two to tango. Do you think that the international community \n     can still ask Milosevic for a tango and make a political \n     agreement with him? Secondly, according to your statement \n     before, are the Albanians paying the price of an experiment \n     which wants to show that the war can be won without ground \n     troops?\n       General Naumann. No, to your last point definitely no. I \n     think I explained to you where we stand in our societies and \n     I think I also mentioned to you that we have to have \n     consensus among 19 nations and that is something which you \n     can't get on this critical issue. With regard  to Milosevic \n     and my personal experience of him, the only thing which I \n     am really looking forward to in my imminent retirement is \n     that this makes sure that I will never see him again!\n       Question: General, you said that Milosevic was the best \n     recruiting agent for the KLA but in fact it seems to me that \n     NATO is really the best recruiting agent of the KLA since the \n     air campaign which is taking place is partly to their \n     benefit. You pointed out that it was impossible to eliminate \n     the forces that merely clear villages and so on, two or three \n     policemen could do that, but it was possible of course to \n     degrade the Serb forces. Is in fact NATO, since there is no \n     consensus of putting in forces in a non-permissive \n     environment, basically hoping that the KLA will be able to do \n     that job for them, thereby really becoming the KLA's air \n     force?\n       General Naumann: We clearly do not want to become the KLA's \n     air force. We have no intention of clearly siding with the \n     KLA since we know pretty well what the political consequences \n     may be and we still stick to the line--and I hope that \n     President Milosevic will eventually understand it--that \n     Kosovo should remain part of the FRY, that is part of the \n     five points, and if he is really responsible with regard to \n     his own people and the future of his own country, he would \n     really grasp the opportunity.\n       Question: General, how serious is the lack of deeds you \n     mentioned in your statement that we need to see concerning \n     the ESDI and the Combined Joint Task Forces. How serious is \n     this lack in your opinion?\n       General Naumann: I have to tell you that if I read all \n     these wonderful declarations on European Security and Defence \n     Identity, I always admire the fantasy of those who are \n     drafting but I am a very pragmatic, very simple-minded \n     soldier, I would like to see something and then I compare \n     what the Europeans can do in this present campaign and what \n     they cannot do and for that reason for me the very simple \n     conclusion is that they have got to do something. And there \n     are very simple things which you can do that do not eat up a \n     tremendous amount of money. I am not talking of launching a \n     European satellite programme or what have you but you have \n     deficiencies in the European forces which have to be \n     corrected as a matter of urgency.\n       Many of our air forces, for instance, do not dispose of \n     stand-off weaponry. They have to fly more or less over the \n     target which is the most stupid thing you can do since you \n     expose yourself to the enemy air defence.\n       Another essential capability, the capabilities of the \n     Europeans with regard to combat search and rescue are not \n     very impressive. That is not a thing which costs tremendous \n     billions of dollars, it is not something which would make the \n     armaments industry open the bottles of champagne but it is \n     extremely important for the morale of the pilots and for them \n     nothing counts more than the assurance ``We'll get you out!'' \n     And for the morale of our pilots I think nothing was more \n     important than these two successful search-and-rescue \n     operations and that is something we need to do.\n       And if I look at the deplorably slow deployment of our \n     forces to Albania and FYROM, had we something like a European \n     transport aircraft capability then we could do better.\n       Take the example of the humanitarian effort. We looked into \n     this but most of the European transport aircraft are two-\n     engine aircraft and they cannot climb to an altitude where \n     you can safely travel without being exposed to missile air \n     defences.\n       These are all things which can easily be done and for that \n     you don't need another voluminous conceptual paper--we \n     Germans are very good at liking concepts, nothing without \n     concepts. It buys you time by the way so you have a lot of \n     time to talk of the concepts before you have to take \n     action!--and that is what we need to avoid. And we can take \n     decisions, we can take them now and it would not blow up the \n     defence budgets of the nations.\n       Another point which from my point of view is really the \n     core of the issue is that if we really want to do something \n     in Europe then we have to start to harmonise the research and \n     development programmes of our nations. The United States of \n     America is spending $36 billion dollars per year for research \n     and development, the Europeans all together--I think plus \n     Canada--spend $10 billion dollars per year but in contrast to \n     them, the European programmes are not co-ordinated. So what \n     we see expressed in these facts is an ever-growing gap \n     between the Europeans and the Americans, and this needs to be \n     redressed. And for something like this you don't need a \n     European summit, you need something like the will to decide.\n       Question. Are we positive that the VJ is digging-in in \n     Kosovo. Jamie Shea talked this afternoon about Maginot Line \n     kind of works. What conclusions do you draw from that and do \n     you have the impression that still quite a lot of the \n     refugees in Kosovo are being kept there for tactical reasons? \n     And did you solve the problem with spies when it was talked \n     about. That the target list was known in Belgrade at the \n     beginning of the campaign have you any news on that?\n       General Naumann. I do not wish to comment on such \n     speculations like the last one. That the VJ is digging-in we \n     have seen for the last couple of weeks. They are preparing \n     for the defence of Kosovo and they follow the good old \n     tactics which we learned in the days of the Cold War of the \n     Soviet tactics of defence, so it is exactly what we have in \n     our text books that we see right now. We are not surprised by \n     that and by the way, the more they dig in the more fixed the \n     targets will be, the easier to hit them.\n       Question. For the last question, General, to sum up all \n     this discussion, what would be your vision for the \n     development of NATO's armed forces for the future?\n       General Naumann. First of all, I think we need to find ways \n     in which we can achieve a complementary contribution between \n     the United States and Europe. This does not mean competition \n     but we need to harmonise our capabilities in such a way that \n     they really complement each other. I think that is feasible \n     and I think it is necessary since after all we will continue \n     to be confronted with very scarce defence dollars or euros \n     and so we have to follow the line which our American friends \n     are expressing with the simple sentence: ``We have to get the \n     biggest bang possible for the buck!'' That is something we \n     are not doing right now.\n       Secondly, we need armed forces which are ready for quick \n     deployment, which are capable of operating under austere \n     conditions. Whether this will be inside or outside the \n     NATO treaty is unimportant.\n       We need to have forces which have a mission effectiveness \n     and by that I mean they have to be able to project power from \n     a distance. This means in the initial phase presumably \n     something like unmanned vehicles like the Cruise missile, or \n     similar capabilities, but also it goes in the direction of \n     stand-off weaponry for our air forces and for some of our \n     ships.\n       Then we need the capability to command and control such \n     forces wherever they will be employed. We need very mobile \n     Command, Control and Communications (C3) and we need \n     excellent intelligence.\n       And if we think added as a fifth point that we have to be \n     able to sustain these forces then I think you have the \n     description of the future alliance forces. This means \n     employed only on their own territory, this does not fit into \n     NATO's future pattern and we have too think this through. By \n     the way that is not only a problem for Germany, it is a \n     problem for many other countries in this Alliance but if \n     politicians are serious about using their armed forces--which \n     I think is presumably the proper answer to the security \n     environment--then we have to be sure that the remaining \n     forces are so flexible and so deployable that we will be able \n     to defend an ever-increasing NATO treaty area with ever-\n     decreasing forces.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Congress has just sent to the \nPresident a tax relief package. I believe very strongly that we can do \nthree things: We can cut taxes, we can make substantial strides in \npaying down the debt, and we can save Social Security.\n  I do not think that asking for a tax cut of between 3 and 3.5 percent \nof the total anticipated budget spending in the next 10 years is being \nirresponsible. That is how this administration--the President and the \nVice President, Al Gore--would like to characterize it. We have the \nhighest tax burden since World War II. I think this Congress is being \nresponsible to the American people in saying: You deserve some relief, \ntoo.\n  I am very disappointed that the President is saying he is going to \nveto this tax-relief package. I have believed all along that he really \ndoes not support any tax cuts. I have believed all\n\n[[Page S11024]]\n\nalong that he really does not want to pay down the debt and that he \nreally does not care that much about Social Security. I have believed \nall along that his real agenda is spending. As we move forward this \nfall with some of the debate, I think it will become more and more \nclear that the President's agenda is really spending, while the \nRepublicans' agenda in the Congress--and I want to be part of that \nteam--will be to fight to keep taxes down, will be to fight especially \nhard to pay down the debt, and to save Social Security.\n  I would like to take a moment to make some comments on tax cuts. I \nbelieve we took an important step toward addressing our Nation's future \nby passing the $792 billion tax cut package last month. We passed a \nbill that pays down the debt, ensures that our obligations to Social \nSecurity are met, and provides tax relief for millions of Americans.\n  This tax cut package returns the tax overpayment to those who paid \nit. I believe this is a far better option than the plans we have seen \nfrom the other side of the aisle that would merely spend the extra \nmoney. Under our plan, a middle-class family of four will receive over \n$1,000 a year in tax relief when the plan is fully implemented.\n  In addition to broad-based relief for all taxpayers, the tax bill \nprovides relief in many important areas, including the marriage \npenalty, the alternative minimum tax, savings and investment, \neducation, health care, the estate tax, and housing.\n  I, for one, believe in the ``opportunity society.'' I believe in \nsuccess and that people should not be punished when they succeed and \nprosper. The surplus belongs to those who are succeeding and paying \nrecord levels of taxes. When we cut taxes, people are motivated to work \nharder, and the economy does well. When the economy does well, everyone \ndoes well.\n  Some are trying to claim that the Republicans want to return money to \nthe people instead of paying down the debt. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. In fact, in 2000, the Republican plan, along with a \nsignificant tax cut, leaves the public debt $220 billion less than the \nPresident's budget proposal. The Republican plan saves 75 percent of \nthe total surplus, as compared to the President's plan which only saves \n67 percent of the surplus.\n  I also point out that the Republican plan saves every penny of the \nSocial Security surplus. The President's budget spends $29 billion of \nthe Social Security surplus.\n\n  These numbers come from the Congressional Budget Office, which \nMembers of Congress can rely on, on a nonpartisan basis, to provide us \nwith accurate figures.\n  Clearly, the recent debate in the Senate was not about debt \nrepayment. The debate was about what to do with the surplus money after \naddressing debt repayment. I happen to believe we should refund this \noverpayment to the taxpayers. Some of my colleagues believe we should \nspend it. I believe the American people are in a better position to \nknow what they need than the Government, particularly the Government \nhere in Washington. I believe we should let the people keep more of \ntheir own money to spend on their priorities, not Washington's \npriorities. I believe the tax package we passed will do just that.\n  By contrast, the President's budget increases taxes--I repeat that, \nincreases taxes--by nearly $100 billion over 10 years. I find it \ninteresting that the President claims we cannot afford $792 billion in \ntax cuts but believes we can afford $1 trillion in new spending.\n  Although some have tried to portray the tax-relief package as large \nand irresponsible, I have to disagree. The tax cuts only equal 3.5 \npercent of what the Congressional Budget Office projects the Federal \nGovernment will take in over the next 10 years. In light of the fact \nFederal tax receipts are already at a record high, I consider this tax \ncut to be extremely modest.\n  In response to the claim that tax cuts only help the rich, first of \nall, tax cuts are for taxpayers. If you do not pay taxes, you can't get \na tax cut. Under the recently passed tax bill, every American who pays \nincome taxes will get an income tax cut.\n  Our income tax system is progressive. The top 1 percent of earners \nmake 16 percent of the income but pay 32 percent of the income taxes. \nThe top 25 percent of earners pay 81 percent of the income tax, and the \ntop half of earners pay nearly all of the income taxes.\n  Looking more closely at who pays the income taxes, as I noted, the \ntop half of earners pay nearly all of the Federal income taxes. As \ntaxpayers, they will be the ones to receive a tax cut.\n  I would like to examine who those so-called rich are. The rich are 62 \npercent of all homeowners; 66 percent of those between the ages of 45 \nand 64; 67 percent of those with a child in the home; 68 percent of \nthose who have attended college, even just one quarter of college; 69 \npercent of married couples; and 80 percent of two-earner households.\n  I want to comment about the 80 percent of two-earner households. I \nbelieve most of those are young Americans who are trying to get \nstarted. They are young families, people who have just graduated from \ncollege, maybe just come from high school and have the first job. They \nare trying to buy a house, get a family started, and pay for a very \nexpensive education. In order to do that, both the husband and the wife \nwork. We are taking 80 percent of those two-earner households and we \nare taxing them at record levels. This particular tax bill is going to \nhelp young families getting started, future citizens of this country, \nthe future leaders of this country.\n  I think this is a very good piece of legislation. I remind Senators, \nagain, to remember when they hear our Democrat colleagues talk about \nthe rich who benefit from those tax cuts, this is really who they are \ntalking about.\n  I am pleased this body has taken steps to address tax relief for \nhard-working Americans. I will continue to support efforts to cut taxes \nand downsize Government. I believe Congress should reject new taxes and \nnew spending in favor of meaningful tax relief. It is time we return \nGovernment money to the rightful owner--the American people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum).

Mr. President, today I am pleased to bring to the \nSenate floor the conference report making appropriations for the \nGovernment of the District of Columbia for fiscal year 2000. The \nconference report endorses the District's $5.3 billion operating budget \nand its $1.4 billion capital budget, as adopted by the mayor, the \nDistrict council, and the financial authority.\n  The conference report appropriates $429.1 million in Federal funds. \nIn fact, having worked out this legislation with the House, the \nconference report is actually $18.3 million more than the President's \nrequest. This is a good bill for the residents of the District of \nColumbia and for the people of America, whose capital this is.\n  Let me list some of the positive provisions.\n  For education, we have provided $17 million in funding for a new and \nunique tuition program that will allow D.C. students to pay instate \ntuition rates at universities. The District is home to only one public \nuniversity. This legislation will allow D.C. students the opportunity \nto attend universities outside the District of Columbia without\n\n[[Page S11025]]\n\nhaving to pay exorbitant out-of-State tuition rates. This is a major \nadvancement for D.C. students.\n  We have also provided equal funding for charter schools in the \nDistrict of Columbia. Charter schools are holding great promise to \nimproving education in the District. Just this week, I visited the \nEdison Friendship Charter School, less than a mile from the Capitol. \nThis is a school that has school uniforms, teaches Spanish in \nkindergarten, provides take-home computers by the third grade, and \nevery student there has doubled their test scores in 1 year. There are \n700 students in the school, with 900 on the waiting list. I have to \ntell you, that was one of the most fun experiences I have had, seeing \nthose bright, inquisitive kids who really love where they are. I asked \none young girl, as I walked in, if she liked the school, and she said, \n`` `Like' is not the right word.'' I said, ``Do you love this school?'' \nShe said, ``I love it.''\n  Good education in the District is possible. We just have to allow \ngood parents, teachers, and principals the flexibility to provide it \nwithout the top-down interference of the entrenched bureaucratic rule.\n  This conference report also addresses the issue of crime in the \nDistrict. No one doubts that there is a drug problem in the District. \nAt the request of Senator Durbin, our bill provides an extra $1 million \nfor the District police to wipe out open-air drug markets in the city.\n  The conference report also provides funds for drug testing people on \nprobation in the District. We know from studies that when people on \nprobation return to drug use, they also return to criminal behavior. \nThis bill will get them off the streets if they flunk the drug test.\n  Another important part of the bill is continuing on a path of fiscal \ndiscipline for the city. The city's finances used to be a disaster. In \nfact, it was the reason the control board was created. There was a time \nwhen the city's debt was rated ``junk'' status by the bond-rating \nagencies. With the leadership of Mayor Anthony Williams, the control \nboard, and the city council, working together, this situation has \nchanged dramatically. I want to keep it that way. In fact, I want to \nmake it better. The city's bond rating is still the lowest rank of \ninvestment-grade quality. I think it can be higher. The conference \nreport provides that the District budget maintain a $150 million \nreserve--a true rainy day fund.\n\n  We have also required the District to maintain a 4-percent budget \nsurplus. But we have provided the flexibility above that surplus to pay \ndown the debt and spend more on services, should the District have \nfunds. The triple combination of a strong reserve, a surplus budget, \nand the requirement above that surplus that half must go for debt \nreduction and half for increased spending will increase the bond rating \nof the District and reduce debt costs in the long run.\n  The economic revitalization of this city is also an important \npriority for me. For years, the city has lost population and many areas \nof the city have fallen into disrepair. In this conference report, I \nhave included a program that I believe will be helpful for the \nDistrict--a $5 million fund to be used for commercial revitalization. I \nhave introduced legislation similar to this in Congress for other \ncities, and I believe it will provide an incentive to rebuild and \nrefurbish blighted areas in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, \nhelping clean them up and make them more safe for the children and \npeople who live there.\n  For the environment, the conference report provides $5 million to \nclean up the Anacostia River. It has been a polluted river. Cleaning it \nup will be a significant environmental advancement for the people of \nthe District.\n  Finally, the conference report includes a provision that will allow \nthe D.C. Superior Court to spend $1.2 million in interest from its \nfiscal year 1999 appropriation to pay the District's defense attorneys \nfor indigents. Payment to these attorneys was halted by the Superior \nCourt this week.\n  Until the conference report is signed into law by the President, \nthese attorneys will not be paid salaries they have earned representing \nthe District's indigent clients and children.\n  The administration has signaled Congress that the President could \nveto this bill because of certain riders. I hope the President will \nlook at all of the provisions and realize that all of the so-called \nriders have been part of past D.C. appropriations bills he has signed.\n  This is a good conference report. It supports and strengthens the \nMayor's new administration. It supports the council's tax cut \nprovisions. It funds the District of Columbia Resident Tuition Support \nProgram and it adds $18.3 million over and above the President's \nrequest for the District. It does not allow the legalization of \nmarijuana, it does not allow needle exchanges, and it does not allow \ncity expenditures to sue the United States for voting rights for \nSenators and Congress representatives.\n  I think it is a good bill. I hope the President will not choose to \nveto the bill because it doesn't allow for the legalization of \nmarijuana and needle exchanges. I urge my colleagues to support this \nconference report so the District will have the funds in time to begin \nthe new fiscal year.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Today we are here to talk about the appropriations for the District \nof Columbia, a special city--the Nation's Capital--and our \nconstitutional responsibility to oversee it.\n  As the Senator from Texas has already said, a substantial portion of \ntax dollars is involved in the D.C. budget, and for that reason and \nothers, historically and legally, Congress has accepted the \nresponsibility to oversee the budget of the District of Columbia. About \n8 percent of the funds the District spends come from the Federal \nGovernment. As a result, we assume a responsibility in managing this \ncity unlike any other city in America.\n  I have been puzzled over the years as I have dealt with this \nchallenge about how many Members of Congress--House and Senate--who \nhave never given a thought to running for mayor or city council \nanxiously play that role when it comes to the District of Columbia. I \nthink that is unfortunate. I believe in home rule.\n  I have had some serious misgivings about policy changes made by the \nDistrict of Columbia City Council--for instance, when it comes to tax \ncuts--but I have made those public. I have gone no further in this bill \nbecause I think it is their decision to make.\n  I also want to say at this moment that it has been a pleasure to work \nwith my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison. It is the first time \nwe have been in this role together in her position as the Chair of the \nsubcommittee and mine as the minority spokesman. She has been honest, \nopen, and professional in our dealings. Though we disagree on many \nissues, it has been a pleasure to work with her on this.\n  I also want to compliment her staff, Mary Beth Nethercutt and Jim \nHyland for their cooperation.\n  I salute as well those on my side--Terry Sauvain, who is not only the \nminority clerk for this bill but who also serves as the minority deputy \nstaff director for the Appropriations Committee. Our good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Robert Byrd, was kind enough to lend Terry for our \neffort. And without him, we wouldn't be here today.\n  I also want to thank Marianne Upton, a member of my personal staff, \nwho has been working on this tirelessly since we received this \nassignment.\n  Let me say a word or two about some others who are not members of the \nSenate staff but deserve recognition. My former House colleague, \nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton has worked tirelessly for the \nDistrict of Columbia. And a difficult job she has. Not being a voting \nMember of the House of Representatives, she has to use the powers of \npersuasion to be an advocate for the people of this city. I admire her \ngreatly for the leadership she has shown. I also note that she opposes \nthis conference report before us, as do many of the leaders in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Finally, let me say a word about the new Mayor. I have the greatest \nhope for this Mayor. I think he is an exceptional individual. I have \nknown him for years in our professional relationship on Capitol Hill. \nHe marks a real change in pace in the District of Columbia. I think he \nhas done a great job to date with a very difficult assignment. I have\n\n[[Page S11026]]\n\nthe greatest hope that he will continue and be very successful in those \nefforts to make our Nation's Capital a source of pride for everyone in \nAmerica.\n  When people come to the District of Columbia to visit as tourists, or \nfrom other countries, there are certain impressions they leave with. \nThe beautiful buildings of our Nation's Capital, perhaps the workings \nof our Government, but, of course, an image of the city. I am sorry to \nsay that image is not always positive. I have cautioned people from \nIllinois and members of my family when they visit the District of \nColumbia to be careful. There is a lot of crime here, a lot of violent \ncrime. You have to take care where you might not at home. That is not \nto say this is the most dangerous city. That would be an overstatement. \nBut it is an urban city with many urban crime problems. Frankly, I \nthink we can and should do a better job in impressing them.\n\n  I also have to concede that there are problems in the District of \nColumbia that may not be obvious. But they go to the heart of these \nriders that have been put on the District of Columbia appropriations \nbills. Let me tell you what has happened.\n  Republican Members of Congress unable or unwilling to impose changes \nin legislation in their own home States or on the Nation use these \nappropriations bills as the happy hunting grounds for every extreme \nviewpoint you can find. It is the last recourse for scoundrels who will \nnot impose on their own cities and States changes in the law but will \ndo it to the District of Columbia.\n  Time and time again, limitations put on the District of Columbia are \nnot being imposed on other States across the Nation. Members of \nCongress think they have free reign; it is a playground to introduce \nany amendment to any issue they would like knowing the District of \nColumbia is almost powerless in this process. They are victims of this \ncongressional excess.\n  That is why the President should veto this bill and say to the \nRepublican leadership and those on the Democratic side who have joined \nthem that enough is enough. These riders are unfair to the people of \nthe District of Columbia. Let me give you an example.\n  You may visit Washington, DC, and be impressed with many things. You \nprobably would not know unless you were told that the District of \nColumbia faces a severe crisis. It has the highest rate of new HIV \ninfections and deaths due to AIDS in the Nation. It is more than seven \ntimes the national average right here in Washington, DC.\n  Exhaustive scientific studies that have been underway by the National \nInstitutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, and others, have concluded that some programs can help to \nreduce the spread of AIDS and HIV in the District of Columbia.\n  One of those programs, controversial as it is, is a needle exchange \nprogram. This bill bans the District of Columbia from using any funds, \nFederal or local, to operate a program for needle exchange. To make it \neven worse, it says any entity which carries out such a program using \nprivate money is barred from eligibility for any Federal funding for \nany purpose.\n  I will tell you, there are 113 needle exchange programs across \nAmerica. In virtually every instance they not only reduce the incidence \nof AIDS but they reduce the incidence of drug addiction.\n  I sat in that conference committee as my fellow colleagues in that \nconference said piously: We don't want to see this in the District of \nColumbia. I produced a map showing that many of these same Congressmen \nrepresent cities across America with similar programs and have never \nvoted to bar or prohibit but they do in the District of Columbia where \nwe have such a terrible epidemic of HIV and AIDS. That is sad.\n  Seventy-five percent of the babies born with HIV in the District of \nColumbia are due to the use of dirty needles by either their mother or \ntheir father. The District of Columbia has the highest rate of new HIV \ninfections in the country. And yet we would put this provision in the \nlaw to stop even a modest effort to reduce this epidemic. I think that \nis awful. For that reason alone, I hope the President will veto this \nbill. But there are others.\n  There is also a ban in this bill to stop the use of any funds to \nimplement a locally enacted law allowing District of Columbia employees \nto purchase health insurance or take family and medical leave to care \nfor a domestic partner. The bill unfairly singles out the District of \nColumbia, discriminating against law-abiding citizens who happen to be \nunmarried but cohabitating.\n  Over 67 State and local governments, 95 colleges and universities, \nalmost 70 of the Fortune 500 companies, and at least 450 other \ncompanies and not-for-profits and unions offer these same benefits. Not \none Member of Congress is proposing to stop these programs anywhere \nother than the District of Columbia. That is basically unfair.\n  On the question of voting representation, another rider precludes the \nDistrict of Columbia from using any funds, Federal or local, to finance \na court challenge aimed at securing voting rights in the District of \nColumbia. This effectively means that the lawyers for the District of \nColumbia are prohibited from even reviewing legal documents on the \nquestion. I cannot imagine a Member of Congress or the Senate imposing \na similar limitation on any municipality or unit of local government in \ntheir own State.\n  On the medical use of marijuana, I know it is controversial, but let \nme name some of the States which have decided if a doctor makes a \ndecision that the operative chemical in marijuana is important for \ntherapy, that it can be legal, if prescribed by a doctor. These States \ninclude the States of Washington, California, Oregon, Nevada, Alaska, \nand Arizona. All have voted for medical use of marijuana. Yet we have a \nsituation where Members of Congress and the Senate have said to the \nDistrict of Columbia: No, you cannot do the same. I think that is \nunfair.\n  There is a cap on attorney's fees in special education cases. If \nsomeone is trying to raise a child with a serious learning disability \nand wants that child in a special ed program, we have provisions in the \nlaw across America in terms of access to those programs and who will \npay for the attorney's fees. It is only in the District of Columbia \nthat some Members of Congress want to limit the amount paid to those \nattorneys to no more than $1,300 per case. It is basically unfair to do \nit only in the District of Columbia. The same Congressmen and Senators \nwould never impose that limitation on their own States and districts.\n  My friends, those and many others are riders which I find \nobjectionable. They are clear evidence of excess on the part of the \nconferees--primarily on the House side--who have insisted on keeping \nthese provisions in place. I am going to vote against this bill. I \nrefuse to sign the conference report. To my knowledge, I don't believe \nany Democratic Member did. Perhaps one did, I may be mistaken. For the \nmost part, the Democrats decided this bill went entirely too far.\n  One thing I put in this bill which I hope will have some benefit if \nultimately the President vetoes it and this provision survives is a \nrequirement that the District of Columbia city council and mayor report \nto Congress on some very basic things which we think need to be \naddressed in the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia has \ndecided they have so much money they will give away $59 million in tax \ncuts next year. They have declared a dividend in a city with a high \nmurder rate, in a city with terrible public health services, a city \noverrun with rats in the street, and a city where the schools are \ndeplorable. Despite all of these things, they have said: We have too \nmany dollars. We are going to give them away, give them back, $100 to a \nfamily.\n  I think it is more important that families in the District of \nColumbia have protection in their homes, protection in their \nneighborhoods, that visitors to the city feel safe on the streets; that \nenough policemen are hired, and others are brought in to make certain \nthat security is there. They are caught up in the notion that a $100 \ntax cut for each family will transform the District of Columbia. I \nthink they should get to the basics first.\n  That is why I requested a quarterly report from the District of \nColumbia to Congress on very basic things, including the reduction in \ncrime, providing the basic city services, the application and \nmanagement of Federal grants,\n\n[[Page S11027]]\n\nand most importantly, to deal with the problem that children in the \nDistrict of Columbia have been graded by many foundations as being \nworse off than any children in the United States of America.\n  When it comes to the basics, low-birthweight babies, infant \nmortality, child death rate, rates of teen death, teen birth rates, \nthese things, unfortunately, the District of Columbia is doing worse on \nthan any other State in the Nation. Wouldn't it be better to take some \nof the $59 million tax cut and put it back for the benefit of these \nchildren? I hope this quarterly report will demonstrate that the mayor \nand city council have proven me wrong. If they have, I will gladly \nconcede.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues on the Democratic side to \noppose this legislation, to vote no on this appropriations bill, to \nurge the Republican leadership to give a clean bill, send it to the \nPresident so it can be signed, and the District can continue in their \nefforts to reform this government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to highlight the points the \nSenator from Illinois raised and try to give the view of the majority \non those points because I think there are some clear differences.\n  I appreciate the working relationship that Senator Durbin and I have \nhad on this committee. In the main, we have agreed on this bill. I \nthink the very positive parts of the bill that I outlined earlier were \nagreed to and enhanced by our ability to work together. I do also want \nto thank the members of his staff, Terry Sauvain and Marianne Upton, \nfor working with our staff, Mary Beth Nethercutt and Jim Hyland.\n  I think our disagreements have been very open and honest. I will \naddress the points the Senator made. I think it should be understood \nwhy we are doing some of the things that are called riders in this \nbill.\n  The District of Columbia belongs to every American. This is our \nCapital City. Every American taxpayer pays for the upkeep of the city. \nWe all point to this city, hoping that it represents the best that \nAmerica is. The buildings in this city rival any, anywhere in the \nworld. I am proud of the city. That is why, when I was chosen to be the \nchairman of the D.C. Subcommittee, I readily agreed because it is \nimportant to my constituents in Texas, just as much as it is to the \npeople who live here full time. I think we do want to have standards \nthat every American believes are the right standards for our Capital \nCity.\n  Let me take the points that Senator Durbin said he believes the \nPresident may veto the bill over because these points are in \ndisagreement.\n  First, the needle exchange program. Yes, it is true we do not allow \nfor Government funding or city funding of needle exchanges for clean \nneedles for drug abusers. Barry McCaffrey, the drug czar of the United \nStates, who is the President's appointee, said the following about \nclean needle exchanges:\n\n       [General McCaffrey has] strongly objected to needle \n     exchange programs.\n\n  In his words:\n\n       The problem is not dirty needles, the problem is heroin \n     addiction. The focus should be on bringing health to this \n     suffering population, not giving them more effective means to \n     continue their addiction. One doesn't want to facilitate this \n     dreadful scourge on mankind.\n\n  That was in the Orlando Sentinel on March 13, 1996.\n  Janet Lapey, in the New York Times magazine, said this was probably \nnot in the best interests of the people who are suffering from \naddictions. We do put a lot in the District budget to help people with \ndrug addictions. We try to take the hard line on drug addiction so \npeople who are doing criminal acts in addition to using drugs, some of \nwhich also are criminal acts in themselves, do not prey on innocent \ncitizens.\n  In most of the drug needle exchange programs it has been shown that \nit has increased the use of illegal drugs. I think it would be a tragic \nmistake in our Capital City to have a federally funded or locally \nfunded needle exchange program that gives any indication that we want \nto foster this habit. We want to help these people get off drugs, not \nmake it easier for them to do it with clean needles.\n  Second, on the issue of marijuana, it is true this bill does ban \nlegalization of marijuana in the District of Columbia for any purpose. \nI think it is important that we not have this become a haven for \nmarijuana use, even for medicinal purposes, because I don't think we \nshould take an illegal drug and allow it to be legalized in our Capital \nCity. The majority on the conference committee agreed.\n\n  Last but not least, the other issue I think we have a legitimate \ndisagreement on is the voting rights in the District. In the District \nof Columbia, the people do elect a city council and a mayor. We work \nwith them because the Federal taxpayers do fund a good part of the \nDistrict of Columbia budget. I think because this is our Capital City \nand because it was provided that the city not be in a State, but, \nrather be overseen by Congress in our Constitution, that most certainly \nwe need to take those steps.\n  But the issue of having two Senators and a Congressman from the \nDistrict of Columbia should not be decided in a D.C. appropriations \nbill. That is banned, using city funds for that purpose. I stand by \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I think the time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 2587, the District of Columbia Appropriations \nbill for FY 2000.\n  The bill provides $429 million in new budget authority and $389 \nmillion in new outlays for federal contributions to the District of \nColumbia government. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and \nother completed actions are taken into account, the Senate bill totals \n$429 million in budget authority and $393 million in outlays for FY \n2000.\n  I commend the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee, \nSenator Hutchison, for her hard work and diligence in fashioning this \nbill. The bill is exactly at the Senate Subcommittee's revised 302(b) \nallocation. The bill is $36 million in budget authority above the \nPresident's request, due in part to the inclusion of a tuition \nassistance program for D.C. students who attend out-of-state colleges. \nThe Administration has requested these funds, however, through the \nDepartment of Education rather than directly to the District of \nColumbia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate Budget \nCommittee scoring of the conference agreement on the District of \nColumbia Appropriations bill be placed in the Record at this point, and \nI urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n H.R. 2587, D.C.

Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on the status of \nthe youth violence bill conference. Conferees from the House and Senate \nhad planned to meet later today to complete consideration of the \nconference report. Last night, conference staff met jointly with \nAdministration officials. And discussions on firearms and culture \nrelated issues are moving forward. Chairman Hyde felt that his talks \nwith Mr. Conyers are going very well. Accordingly, I felt we should \nkeep working. however, my hope and plan is to meet next week so we can \ncomplete action on this bill this month.\n  I also want to comment briefly on why this bill is so important. Too \nmany violent crimes involve juveniles. According to the Justice \nDepartment, the number of juvenile arrests for violent crime, including \ncrimes committed with a firearm, exceeds 1988 levels by 48 percent. Our \nyouth violence problem is a compel problems that demand comprehensive \nsolution. Our legislation makes our schools safer; it empowers parents; \nit recognizes the importance of prevention; and it emphasize the need \nfor enforcement and getting tough on violent criminals. Part of any \ncomprehensive solution to deal with crime must be a commitment to \nenforcing the laws on the books. Actions speak louder than words, \nwhether we're talking about how the government deals with gun offenders \nor how it deals with terrorists.\n  I am deeply saddened by the news out of Texas concerning a crazed \ngunman's senseless, hate-for-religion rampage at a Forth Worth church \nwhich left seven innocent people dead and many others wounded. My \nprayers go out to the victims and their families and my energies will \nbe all the more dedicated towards trying to reach a consensus on the \nyouth violence bill. This event--and others like it in recent months--\nhave energized a well-deserved and beneficial debate about the criminal \nuse of firearms. Limiting criminal access to firearms, beefing up \nprosecutions, and responding to a popular culture which glamorizes \nfirearms violence should all be parts of our response. But as I just \nnoted, violent crime--violent juvenile crime, in particular--is a \ncomplex problem which deserves a comprehensive response.\n  In today's Washington Post, which appropriately reports on the Texas \nshooting on its front page, is buried an article about how a Maryland \njuvenile court judge released from custody--over the objections of \nprosecutors--a 16-year-old, confessed violent sex offender who had been \nsent to Maryland's maximum security prison. He was released because the \nhe was not receiving ``individualized counseling.''--Washington Post, \nSept. 16, 1999, B-7. According to the article, the judge's view is that \nthe purpose of the juvenile justice system is to ``rehabilitate rather \nthan punish young offenders.'' The teenager in question--whose identity \nhas been protected, by the way--was one of six teenagers who, in March \nof last year, lured a 15-year-old girl from a bus stop to a vacant \napartment where they took turns raping, sodomizing, and beating her for \nthree hours. Three teenagers who participated in the rape were \nsentenced to life but this offender has been set free by a soft-headed \njuvenile justice system. According to the article, this violent sex-\noffender (whose fellow offenders are serving life-terms) will live with \nhis relatives in near-by Prince George's County and will be enrolling \nin High Point High School.\n  Where's the greatest threat to the public? Ask the parents of High \nPoint High School this question. The greatest threat to the public is \nfrom criminals who are set free by a soft-headed justice system, be \nthey rapists or terrorists. And criminals who commit crimes but are not \nprosecuted are left free to commit more crimes. yesterday, I released a \nreport reported entitled ``Crimes Committed With Firearms--A report for \nParent, Prosecutors, and Policy Markers.'' Our report found that over \n90% of criminals age 18 to 24 who had an substantial arrest record \nprior to being imprisoned are rearrested within three years for a \nfelony or serious misdemeanor.\n  I mention this article and our report to illustrate, as I have said \nrepeatedly, that this is a complex problem which demands a \ncomprehensive solution. Simply passing more laws which get printed in \nDOJ's law books but which go unenforced will not nothing to fight \nviolent crime, let alone violent juvenile crime. And legislation which \nfails to make meaningful reforms which promotes juvenile accountability \nand juvenile record disclosure--as the Hatch-Sessions bill does--will \nprove to be a hollow accomplishment.\n  In closing, we must do all we can to come together and resolve our \ndifferences and reach consensus. When I hear members drawing lines in \nthe sand over specific provisions in the youth violence bill, I get \nconcerned because it tells me that the politics of party are trumping \nthe obligation to lead and do what's right.\n  That is what I intend to do in this juvenile justice conference. I \nhope we have the cooperation of everybody on both sides. I hope the \nrumors that some want to play this as a political matter are not true. \nI think we need to pass a juvenile justice bill this year, and we need \nto do the very best we can do in doing that. I intend to get that\n\n[[Page S11029]]\n\ndone, and I thank all those who cooperate in helping to get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald).

Mr. President, I seek recognition because my comments \nfollow on the same topic as the Senator from Utah, who I know wants \nvery much to have a juvenile justice bill. But as I listened to his \ncomments, I fear that perhaps we are not headed in the right direction \nwith that legislation.\n  Yesterday, I know that all of us were shocked, as all Americans were, \nto hear about a gunman walking into the back of a church in Ft. Worth, \nTX, killing six people, wounding seven, and then killing himself.\n  I have a very simple message for my colleagues. If you can't feel \nsafe from gun violence in the sanctuary of your church, where can you \nfeel safe?\n  On Tuesday, in a story in my home State, not even widely reported, a \nman walked into the West Anaheim Medical Center and killed three \nhospital workers because he was grief stricken that his mother died in \nthat hospital. He went on the hunt for particular nurses. If you can't \nfeel safe from gun violence in a hospital in America, where can you \nfeel safe?\n  What seems like yesterday is actually a couple of months now when in \nthe Los Angeles region of California a crazed man walked into a Jewish \ncenter where there was a child care operation and shot his weapon. I \nwill never forget the picture of the police holding the hands of that \ntiny little toddler as they tried to escape from the situation.\n  These are memories that are imprinted in our minds. If we don't do \nanything about it in this Senate, we do not deserve to call ourselves \nthe Senate, let alone the greatest deliberative body in the world.\n\n  I feared, as I listened to the comments of the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, he seems to be saying that if we insist on modest \ngun control measures that are already in the Senate version, somehow we \nare playing politics.\n  I want to say right here in the most straightforward way I can that \nit is not playing politics to say we should keep guns out of the hands \nof criminals and people who are mentally disturbed and out of the hands \nof children. That is not playing politics. That is doing what needs to \nbe done in America in 1999 going into the next century.\n  The modest gun control measures that we passed on this floor of the \nSenate--those modest measures that the Vice President cast the tie \nbreaking vote for--are common sense and close the gun show loophole \nthat allows criminals and mentally unbalanced people to walk into a gun \nshow and immediately get a weapon. It is common sense to stop that.\n  Senator Lautenberg's amendment would do so.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment on banning the importation of high-\ncapacity ammunition clips which are used in semiautomatic weapons--\ncommon sense.\n  Senator Kohl's amendment requiring that child safety devices be sold \nwith every handgun--common sense.\n  My own amendment asking the FTC and the Attorney General to study the \nextent to which the gun industry markets to children--common sense.\n  The Ashcroft amendment making it illegal to sell or give a \nsemiautomatic weapon to anyone under the age of 18--that is all we did \nin that bill.\n  Yet we have the chairman of the Judiciary Committee out here talking \nas if, my goodness, those measures were political.\n  Listen. I don't think the American people can stand this anymore.\n  In closing my remarks, I am going to mention some of the shootings \nthat took place in 1999.\n  January 14, office building, Salt Lake City, Utah, one dead, one \ninjured;\n  March 18, law office, Johnson City, Tennessee, two dead;\n  April 15, Mormon Family History Library, Salt Lake City, Utah, three \ndead, including gunman (who was shot by police), four injured;\n  April 20, Columbine High School, Littleton, Colorado, 15 dead, \nincluding the two teenage gunmen, 23 injured;\n  May 20, Heritage High School, Conyers, Georgia, six injured;\n  June 3, grocery story, Las Vegas, Nevada, four dead;\n  June 11, psychiatrist's clinic, Southfield, Michigan, three dead, \nincluding the gunman, four injured;\n  July 12, private home, Atlanta, Georgia, seven dead, including the \ngunman;\n  July 29, two brokerage firms, Atlanta, Georgia, 10 dead, including \nthe gunman, 13 injured;\n  August 5, two office buildings, Pelham, Alabama, three dead;\n  August 10, North Valley Jewish Community Center, Los Angeles, \nCalifornia, five injured (Postal worker killed later);\n  September 14, West Anaheim Medical Center, Anaheim, California, three \ndead; and, just last night,\n  September 15, Wedgwood Baptist Church, Fort Worth, Texas, seven dead, \nincluding gunman, seven injured.\n  That is a partial list.\n  We have to do something. We have the opportunity. What are we waiting \nfor? I have to say that if we cannot vote out these modest gun control \nproposals which are common sense, and if we cannot pick up some votes \nfrom the other side of the aisle, including the President who is \nsitting in the Chair, if we can't do that, we should be ashamed to go \nhome and say we did the people's business.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to speak \non issues that are of importance to us. I will take the next 5 minutes \nto speak about a subject that is important to many Members of this \nbody--something that over 20 of us have been working on now very \ndiligently on both the House side, as well as the Senate, Republican \nand Democrat, to bring closure to this year in this Congress.\n  I come to the floor very appropriately today as this terrible storm, \nFloyd, actually rages outside of this building. The wind and the rain \nhave battered this building as we have worked through the day. Of \ncourse, we feel relatively blessed in that the storm damage has been \nkept to a minimum. It is quite a deadly storm and quite a tremendous \nthreat.\n  There are schoolchildren and families at home throughout the entire \neastern portion of our Nation because they have been unable to get to \nwork, or to school, or to other places because of the storm.\n  I want to speak for a few minutes about the Conservation and \nReinvestment Act and how it will help us deal not with the emergency of \nthe storm, not necessarily with the specific preparation for a \nparticular storm, but how this particular bill by rededicating a \nportion of our offshore oil and gas revenues could be used by States \nand counties and coastal areas throughout the United States to help \nrepair damages from these particular storms.\n\n  I want to take a minute to thank some Governors and Senators and to \nread a few statements into the Record about some of their thoughts \nregarding this bill.\n  As this storm moves through the eastern part of our Nation today, and \nhopefully will dissipate over the next few hours, we have experienced \ntremendous damage. Since 1960, the United States has sustained over $50 \nbillion in damage. From Florida to Louisiana, to Texas, to South and \nNorth Carolina and Virginia, many coastal States have been battered \nover and over by hurricanes just since 1960.\n  In a major publication last week, one of the headlines was reminding \nus of the deadly storm that literally wiped out Galveston, TX, in the \nyear 1900. It is now the 99th anniversary of one of the deadliest \nstorms to ever hit the United States.\n  While some on this floor might argue, what is the reason for setting \naside a specific amount of money to help coastal States, I suggest what \nwe see on television now says it better than I could say it on the \nfloor of the Senate. We see storms of this magnitude pounding the \ncoast, we see them\n\n[[Page S11030]]\n\nseason after season, gulf coast to east coast, sometimes very big \nstorms on the western coast, washing away our beaches, eroding our \nbarrier islands, causing tremendous damage.\n  It is important for this Senate to act now, while we have the \nopportunity, to set aside a portion of our offshore oil and gas \nrevenues, to join in partnership with our local officials, Governors \nand county commissioners, to help, whether the hurricane season is \ntough or not, whether we are in the mood for it or not, for Congress to \nprovide a permanent source of revenue, year in and year out, to help \nwith these matters. That is what S. 25 will provide. Hopefully, in a \nfew weeks we will be marking up this bill.\n  I will read into the Record and specifically thank several Governors \nwho have experienced over the last days the effects of Hurricane Floyd. \nI begin by thanking Governor Roy Barnes of the State of Georgia, whose \nState was spared the brunt of this particular storm but who did a \nbeautiful job preparing the people of Florida, along with the emergency \npersonnel.\n  I read from his letter:\n\n       This legislation [referring to S. 25] would provide \n     critically needed funding for a variety of wildlife-\n     conservation, land conservation, and coastal-area projects in \n     Georgia. I fully support this legislation and ask you to work \n     for its passage.\n\n  Jim Hodges, Governor of South Carolina, who probably hasn't slept in \nthe last 48 hours as his State has been battered by this storm, wrote a \ncouple of months ago:\n\n       South Carolina has a unique diversity of natural resources \n     which we must strive to conserve for future generations.\n       The current proposal which provides for a dedicated and \n     secure funding source has long-term significance for both our \n     natural resources and the people who enjoy all types of \n     outdoor recreation. The plans embodied in CARA are high \n     priorities for South Carolina. These include: coastal zone \n     management and impact assistance, wetlands restoration, state \n     and local outdoor recreation programs, fish and wildlife \n     conservation, and environmental education.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n       Congress enacted the Coastal Management Act in 1972 to \n     preserve, restore and enhance the resources of the nation's \n     coastal zone.\n\n  Mr. President, S. 25 is structured in such a way that it can build on \nthat good work. I thank Governor Jim Hodges of South Carolina for \nhaving the forethought and not waiting for the hurricanes, for thinking \nahead as to how we could provide some much needed dollars to minimize \nthe cost of the damage that has been caused.\n  Governor Jim Hunt of North Carolina writes:\n\n       We are making significant progress in North Carolina to \n     enhance and protect our environment and public spaces. We \n     have made historic commitments this year to the expansion of \n     public lands in our western mountains, and we recognize the \n     value of our public spaces for assuring a prosperous and \n     livable future.\n\n  I thank these Governors for their leadership and acknowledge the fact \nthat Governor Whitman, who was also prepared for the effects of this \nstorm, was here in the Capitol not that many months ago stating her \ncase for why we should come to the aid of States and local governments \nto help protect our coasts, to provide funding that will help to \nrestore beaches, and to help with hurricane evacuation and the \ninfrastructure necessary to provide for the fact that over two-thirds \nof the people in the United States live within 50 miles of a coast.\n  The State of Louisiana is happy to provide a lot of this money, or a \ngreat portion of it, from our oil and gas resources. I say thanks to \nSenator Campbell from Colorado; to Senator Breaux; to Senator Cochran; \nSenator Kit Bond; Senator Tim Johnson; Senator Mikulski; Senator \nSessions from Alabama, a sister southern State; Senator Cleland from \nGeorgia; Senator Lott; Senator Murkowski, the chairman of our \ncommittee; Senator Lincoln from Arkansas; Senator Bunning; Senator \nBayh; Senator Coverdell; Senator Frist; Senator Robb; Senator Tim \nHutchinson from Arkansas; Senator Bob Kerrey from an interior State; \nand Senator Roberts from Kansas, another interior State. I thank these \nSenators for joining the broad coalition of Senators both from our \ncoastal and interior States recognizing hurricanes are dangerous and \ncan have devastating impact to life and to property.\n  While we have all sorts of programs in effect--flood insurance and \nemergency preparedness--if we could spend a small amount of money \nmatching the efforts that States and local governments do year in and \nyear out, we could help to preserve the precious resources that are \nliterally washed away season after season.\n  I believe the American people want Congress to help. I believe they \nthink we have the resources to do so. Mostly, I believe they think this \nis the year we should act. Let's not wait until another storm rips up \nanother part of our coastline. Let's act in the next few months, as \nthis Congress comes to a close, to adopt this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I thank these Senators for their hard work and acknowledge the work \nof Chairman Murkowski and acknowledge the work of Members of the House, \nChairman Young and others in the House who are working on a similar \nproposal. I thank the Presiding Officer for his interest in this \nparticular piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several letters \nI discussed as well as the costs of hurricanes in this century.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 State of Georgia,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                   Atlanta, GA, February 10, 1999.\n     Hon. Jack Kingston,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Kingston: The U.S. Congress is \n     presently considering some important conservation legislation \n     that would benefit Georgia. The Conservation and Reinvestment \n     Act was introduced in the Senate (S. 25) on January 19 and \n     similar legislation is expected to be introduced in the House \n     soon. This legislation would provide critically needed \n     funding for a variety of wildlife-conservation, land \n     conservation and coastal-area projects in Georgia. I fully \n     support this legislation and ask you to work for its passage.\n       The Conservation and Reinvestment Act would dedicate 50% or \n     more of annual revenues from offshore gas and oil leases-\n     projected at $4.59 billion in the year 2000--into three \n     separate funds. Georgia would receive a wide range of \n     benefits from each of these titles as follows:\n       Title I would dedicate 27% of annual offshore oil and gas \n     revenue to coastal states and local communities. For impact \n     assistance, including environmental remediation and \n     infrastructure needs. Georgia would receive approximately \n     $5.8 million annually for air and water quality improvements, \n     coastal zone management, beach replenishment and similar \n     activities.\n       Title II would dedicate 16% in S. 25 or 23% in the 1998 \n     House version of offshore oil and gas revenue for funding the \n     Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Urban Park and \n     Recreation Recovery Programs. Georgia's share would be \n     roughly $8 million annually. I prefer the House version since \n     more funding would come to the states.\n       Title III deals with Wildlife Conservation and Restoration. \n     This section would dedicate 10% in the House version or 7% in \n     S. 25 of offshore oil and gas revenue to fund state-level \n     wildlife conservation, wildlife education and wildlife \n     associated recreation projects, such as hiking trails, \n     education centers and programs, and other wildlife \n     conservation projects. Georgia's share of this money would be \n     approximately $8 million annually in the House version which \n     I favor.\n       These bills would provide a much needed, permanent funding \n     source to meet a variety of environmental conservation needs \n     that face our growing state. I encourage you to use your \n     influence to help reconcile these bills in the House and \n     Senate to ensure their passage. It is important that states \n     receive as much of this funding as possible to address \n     critical conservation needs here at home.\n       Thank you in advance for your support of the legislation.\n       Kindest regards.\n           Sincerely,\n     Roy E. Barnes.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          State of South Carolina,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                      Columbia, SC, March 1, 1999.\n     Mr. R. Max Peterson,\n     Executive Vice-President, International Association of Fish \n         and Wildlife Agencies, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Peterson: It is with great pleasure that I write \n     to you to endorse the principles embodied in ``Conservation \n     and Reinvestment Act of 1999 (CARA),'' which was recently \n     introduced in the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of \n     Representatives introduction in the near future. South \n     Carolina has a unique diversity of national resources which \n     we must strive to conserve for future generations.\n       The current proposal which provides for a dedicated and \n     secure funding source has\n\n[[Page S11031]]\n\n     long-term significance for both our natural resources and the \n     people who enjoy all types of outdoor recreation. The plans \n     embodied in CARA are high priorities for South Carolina. \n     These include: coastal zone management and impact assistance, \n     wetlands restoration, state and local outdoor recreation \n     programs, fish and wildlife conservation, and environmental \n     education.\n       Congress enacted the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972 to \n     preserve, restore and enhance the resources of the nation's \n     coastal zone. Title I of CARA will allow South Carolina to \n     partner with the federal government in managing our coastal \n     zone for the improvement of air and water quality, fish and \n     wildlife habitat, and wetlands protection.\n       Title II will restore funding for the Land and Water \n     Conservation fund, allowing a continuation of the process of \n     building a national network of parks, recreation and \n     conservation areas to touch all communities. This reinvests \n     assets of lasting value for all Americans.\n       I am particularly pleased that Title III of the legislation \n     includes the principles from the original ``Teaming with \n     Wildlife'' initiative, and I trust that the language will \n     ultimately provide the states with the means to protect and \n     manage the vast majority of wildlife species which presently \n     have no reliable source of funding. I am hopeful that the \n     final bill will dedicate 10% of the annual revenue to Title \n     III, as was proposed in the House version last year.\n       I am impressed by the strong bipartisan support in Congress \n     for the CARA concept and I will be working with South \n     Carolina's delegation to secure their support. As a newly \n     elected governor, I have a clear vision of the legacy that I \n     want to leave the citizens of South Carolina in general and \n     our children in particular. A critical component of my \n     campaign platform included increasing the quantity and \n     quality of education opportunities in this state. This \n     legislation will not only help conserve natural areas and \n     enhance outdoor recreational opportunities, but also promote \n     conservation education programs for coming generations.\n       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of our valuable \n     natural resources.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jim Hodges,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          State of North Carolina,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                    Raleigh, SC, December 8, 1998.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to congratulate you on \n     your success with environmental initiatives in the past year, \n     and to urge inclusion of a significant environmental and \n     conservation funding package supported by offshore energy \n     royalties in your FY 2000 Budget.\n       We are making significant progress in North Carolina to \n     enhance and protect our environment and our public spaces. We \n     have made historic commitments this year to the expansion of \n     public lands in our western mountains, and we recognize the \n     value of our public spaces for assuring a prosperous and \n     livable future. We are aware of interest in Congress, among \n     the conservation and environmental communities, and elsewhere \n     in proposals for a truly significant recommitment of \n     available offshore royalty revenues to preserve and enhance \n     public lands, parks and recreation, wildlife habitat, coastal \n     protections, and other vital natural concerns. This type of \n     legislative package would put in place an ongoing source of \n     funds to support federal and state needs and enable us to \n     fulfill important environmental and conservation goals.\n       This would also be a fitting and winning follow up to your \n     successes this year with the American Heritage Rivers \n     Initiative and Clean Water Action Plan. I hope you can \n     include this type of broad conservation initiative supported \n     by offshore energy revenues in your priorities for the FY \n     2000 Budget.\n       My warmest personal regards.\n           Sincerely,\n     James B. Hunt Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n  testimony of governor christine todd whitman before the u.s. senate \n committee on energy and natural resources, washington, d.c., tuesday, \n                             april 27, 1999\n\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n       I am pleased to have the opportunity to testify on the \n     various legislative proposals before the Committee that \n     address land and natural resources conservation.\n       States and local governments are leading the way in the \n     preservation of land and natural resources, and we welcome \n     federal efforts that build on and complement what we are \n     already doing.\n       I want to applaud the Committee and the sponsors of the \n     various bills for the bipartisan and inclusive process that \n     recognizes the critical role of state and local governments \n     in preserving and protecting natural resources.\n       Before I comment specifically on the federal legislation, I \n     would like to briefly discuss what we have already done in \n     New Jersey.\n       By way of background, New Jersey is a state of 8 million \n     people living on 5 million acres. Ours is the most densely \n     populated state in the country, yet it maintains five \n     national wildlife areas, two national park areas, three \n     nationally designated estuaries, the internationally \n     recognized and environmentally sensitive New Jersey \n     Pinelands, and 127 miles of ocean shoreline.\n       The Garden State has made consistent and aggressive efforts \n     to preserve and protect its natural resources. In fact, \n     between 1961 and 1995, our voters approved bond issues \n     totaling more than $1.4 billion to acquire 390,000 acres of \n     open space, protect 50,000 acres of farmland, preserve \n     historic sites, and develop parks. And last November, by a 2-\n     to-1 margin, New Jersey voters approved a long-term stable \n     source of funding to preserve forever 1 million additional \n     acres of open space and farmland.\n       Saving our precious land is the centerpiece of New Jersey's \n     effort to build a future in which we can sustain both the \n     strength of our economy and the integrity of our environment.\n       That effort includes directing future growth to areas that \n     have the infrastructure already in place, such as our cities \n     and town centers. In support of that effort, we are working \n     hard to revitalize our cities as thieving centers of culture \n     and commerce. We are also committing some of our preservation \n     funds to protect and preserve our most significant historic \n     treasures.\n       New Jersey's commitment to land preservation dates back to \n     the 1960s. Since 1965, the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     and the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program have \n     provided New Jersey with over $145 million in matching funds \n     to acquire open space and develop and maintain recreational \n     facilities and urban parks.\n       Some recent projects the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     has supported include the first county park in Hudson County \n     in 80 years and the development of Liberty State Park, one of \n     New Jersey's most culturally and historically significant \n     attractions.\n       Clearly, while my state will continue to make open space \n     preservation a priority, the need to preserve land exceeds \n     state and local funding levels, particularly given the \n     federal government's decision in 1995 to stop the flow of \n     land and water conservation funds to the states.\n       Restoring the stateside funding of the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund would assist New Jersey's open space and \n     farmland preservation efforts by enhancing our ability to \n     partner with local governments and nonprofit agencies in \n     order to achieve our million acre goal.\n       Mr. Chairman, an important priority in New Jersey is \n     preserving our farmland, and I would encourage the Committee \n     to allow Land and Water Conservation Fund money to be used to \n     purchase farmland conservation easements to assist us in this \n     effort.\n       When it comes to wildlife, the reinvestment of Outer \n     Continental Shelf revenues will enable states to ensure that \n     we bequeath to our children and grandchildren healthy and \n     abundant species populations with adequate habitat.\n       Federal funding would allow New Jersey to fully implement \n     projects that protect critical wildlife habitats and species \n     and encourage private landowners to do the same. We have \n     saved the peregrine falcon and the osprey, and we have \n     increased the number of nesting bald eagles from one pair in \n     1988 to 22 pairs in 1999. Increased revenue would allow New \n     Jersey to continue these efforts and develop a strategic plan \n     for the preservation of all species and their habitat.\n        Mr. Chairman, I also want to comment on the coastal impact \n     assistance provision in your proposal. The New Jersey coast \n     generates more than $20 billion per year. Supporting a \n     thriving coastline is critical to our economy and our \n     environment. Coastal impact assistance could be used for \n     vital projects such as restoring beaches, dunes, and wetlands \n     as well as state and local smart growth planning.\n       New Jersey does not have oil and gas exploration or \n     production off our coast, and we support the existing \n     moratorium on oil and gas production off New Jersey's coast.\n       Members of the Committee, I recognize that approving the \n     proposals before you would require a shift in the budgets of \n     other federal programs. It is important that funds provided \n     to states under this legislation not come at the expense of \n     other federally supported state programs.\n       I do believe, however, that since Outer Continental Shelf \n     revenues come from a nonrenewable resource, it makes sense to \n     dedicate them to natural resource conservation rather than \n     dispersing them for general government purposes.\n       I would urge the Committee to give state and local \n     governments maximum flexibility in determining how to invest \n     these funds. In this way, federal resources can be tailored \n     to complement state plans, priorities, and resources.\n       I look forward to continuing to work with you as this \n     legislation moves forward. Thank you for this opportunity to \n     testify on an issue of great importance to New Jersey and the \n     nation. I would be happy to answer any questions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        THE COSTLIEST HURRICANES IN THE UNITED STATES, 1900-1996\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Ranking: Hurricane            Year  Category    Damage (U.S.)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1.

Mr. President, I rise, as did my other colleagues \ntoday, to talk about something of great importance to each Member \nindividually. I think we have not taken full advantage to discuss what \nI think is our greatest blessing in this world, one of our greatest \ninvestments. That is our children.\n  Today I will discuss the importance of education funding and why it \nis imperative the Senate act quickly and responsibly on this issue. We \nhave an opportunity to do something on behalf of our children, to give \nthem the capability they need. We talk about the magnitude of education \non behalf of our children, but we don't often talk about the timeliness \nthat is needed here on this issue today.\n  I question the wisdom of delaying the vote on the appropriations bill \nthat funds education, the Labor-HHS bill, until after we have completed \nthe other 12 spending bills. I know for myself, as a working mother, \nand as do all of my colleagues here as working family individuals--we \nhave to prioritize. We have to look at what is important and we make a \nlist. We recognize what is important and then we go about accomplishing \nit. It seems our priorities are in the wrong place when we vote on the \nlegislative appropriations bill before funding education, waiting until \nthe last minute, the last issue, to try and drum up the necessary \nfunding to educate our children for the future.\n  School has started all over this country. Kids are taking tests; they \nare turning in papers; they are getting grades. We, as parents, as \naunts and uncles, as mentors to our children all over this country, are \nencouraging them to aim for the best, to work towards that A, to do \nwhat it is they can to accomplish their best, to work hard at their \neducation because it will pay off for them in the end.\n  What are we doing? We are setting a very poor example. If this \nCongress was to be graded on its performance on prioritizing our \nchildren's education, it would be given a big red F.\n  I know there is always a contentious debate over how to fund \neducation, but it seems our colleagues on the Republican side are out \nof touch with the American people on this issue. A recent survey of the \nAmerican public found that 73 percent of Americans favor increased \nFederal investment in education and placed it as the highest priority \namong the 19 other issues they were asked about. Yet we in Washington \nhave failed to act, and the situation is only getting worse.\n  During the August recess, instead of having townhall meetings, I set \nabout having five back-to-school meetings across our State of Arkansas. \nI spent a great deal of time listening to parents, students, teachers, \nand school administrators at all of these different schools in these \nmeetings that I organized across our State. One school superintendent \ntold me that in his area, an enormously depressed area, they were \nstarting the school year with 22 job openings; short 22 people in that \nschool district. As a result, classrooms are overcrowded, teachers are \noverworked, and students are not receiving the kind of attention and \neducation they deserve. We must send Federal money immediately to hire \nnew teachers. We must look for incentives to get our young people into \nteaching.\n  Do you realize the enormous brick wall we will hit soon, as we are \nhaving fewer and fewer of our young people going into the teaching \nprofession? It doesn't matter if we have smaller class sizes or if we \nhave new school buildings; we are not going to have the teachers to put \nin them. That is essential.\n  We want to give our teachers the capability to be well qualified. We \nsend our children to school 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Teachers are \nsome of the most important people in their lives, and they are not \ngiven the appropriate time to prepare nor are they receiving the \nreasonable accommodation in resources they need to be able to teach our \nchildren. We must send those Federal dollars to hire new teachers. \nWaiting until next year is not an option. Schools are already open this \nyear. If we wait as planned, we will have missed an entire grade of \nchildren.\n  I have talked to my colleagues: Oh, we won't get to that this year, \nor we will do it next year, or we will do it in the next Congress. \nThink about those years. Think about those first graders from this \nyear. They will be second graders next year and then third graders. By \nthe time we have finally done something on their behalf, we will have \nmissed the most critical stage in their educational process. How \nirresponsible on our part.\n\n  By the time the money is allocated and school districts can begin to \nmake those hiring decisions, they have missed that opportunity. Our \nchildren will be the ones who suffer if we do not do the right thing in \nthe Senate. I also think it is such a shame, as we look at the tax \npackage that has been presented to the President, what it will do in \nrobbing our children of the money that is needed to build new schools, \nhire new teachers, reduce class size, wire classrooms with the latest \ntechnology, and enhance the access to affordable higher education.\n  Under the Republican plan that has been presented to the President, \neducation funding will be cut by 17 percent. How inexcusable is that, \nour greatest resource in this Nation, our children, our future, and not \neven anteing up what we need to do to meet those needs. That is an \nembarrassment.\n  It is in our Nation's long-term interest to give our children the \nvery best, highest quality education that we can. But even if we would \nnot do it for our children, should we not do it for our Nation? That is \nthe future of our Nation, our children, their capability to compete \nwith other children across this globe. We should make that a priority \nin the Senate. The American people have indicated to us that they have \nmade it a priority on their wish list. They are the future of our \nworkforce. They are the future of our country. If we fail our children, \nwe have failed our Nation.\n  So I rise today to encourage my Senate colleagues to reconsider their \npriorities and to support public schools by restoring full funding to \neducation and supporting efforts to hire more teachers, to build more \nschools, and to establish valuable afterschool programs. Now is the \ntime to act--not next year, not next Congress, but right here and right \nnow. Let's get over the partisan bickering and political posturing and \nget on with the people's work.\n  More important, let's move beyond the process posturing that the \nSenate is famous for and really reflect on our priorities, what our \npriorities should be, what is our greatest blessing, which I believe is \nour children. Their success is without a doubt the biggest measure of \nour Nation's success. I encourage my colleagues to do just as I am \ndoing, and that is to talk about the education of our children and move \nthis bill forward.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, for a great statement on education. That is why I am \ntaking the floor now, to talk about it and to lay out what has happened \nthis year in education funding.\n  I think my colleague, my friend from Arkansas, has really \nencapsulated it. There should be no higher priority in our country than \nthe education of our children. I thank my colleague. We will work \ntogether on this.\n  Education should not be a partisan issue. It should be bipartisan; it \nshould have strong support from both parties. However, I am constrained \nto say at the beginning of this year, the Republican leadership said \nthey were going to make education No. 1, the No. 1 priority. That is \nwhat the Senate majority leader said in January. That is what the \nchairman of the Budget Committee said. I am the ranking member on the \nappropriations subcommittee for education. When we got our initial \nallocation, we were then at a cut, in\n\n[[Page S11033]]\n\nthe beginning, of $8 billion below a freeze from last year.\n  I think my colleague, the chairman of our subcommittee, Senator \nSpecter, has done a splendid job trying to get us moving forward. We \nwere supposed to have a markup in May. That was postponed. This is for \neducation. Then in June, postponed. Then we were supposed to mark up \nafter the Fourth of July recess--postponed. They were supposed to do it \nbefore the August recess. We were supposed to have marked up last \nweek--postponed. We were supposed to mark up this week--postponed. Why? \nBecause the education subcommittee's funding has been raided to pay for \nother things. So I say to my friend from Arkansas, we have gone from \nNo. 1 to No. 13. We can act on every other appropriations bill in the \nSenate, but education is dead last.\n\n  Talk about priorities. I do not run the floor. The Republican \nleadership runs this floor and how we bring up the bills. We have not \neven brought the education appropriations bill up yet. We have 14 days \nleft in this fiscal year. We passed a bill today that includes a pay \nraise for all the Senators and Congressmen. We passed that. We had time \nfor that. We had the money for that. We had the money for defense. We \nhave had the money for everything else. But we do not seem to have the \nmoney for education.\n  What kind of a signal does that send? I said the other day, I feel \nsort of like that movie actor Bill Murray in ``Ground Hog Day.'' We \nkeep getting the promise we are going to mark up education and it never \nhappens. It never quite gets there. We never quite get to that day.\n  So we have gone from 1st to 13th--dead last--in the Senate in terms \nof the priority for education.\n  So what happened this week? Again, the education budget was raided, \nwith $7.5 billion taken out of the education budget for VA-HUD. I am \nall for veterans. We have to fund our veterans' programs and medical \ncare and housing. But they had to take it out of our education budget. \nIn fact, even as I speak right now, the Appropriations Committee is \nmarking up the VA-HUD bill with money that ought to be in there for \neducation.\n  So where does that leave us? That has left our Appropriations \nSubcommittee $15.5 billion below a freeze from last year. That \ntranslates into a 17-percent cut below last year.\n  What does that mean for education? When you factor out education from \nall the other things we have in our bill, that is a $5.6 billion cut in \neducation below what we had last year. And education is the No. 1 \npriority of the Republican leadership? Say again? I do not understand \nthis. We can fund everything else. We can pass every other bill. We can \ngive huge increases to the Pentagon. But right now, as we stand here \ntoday, education is going to take a $5.6 billion cut.\n  That translates into real cuts--real cuts for teachers, for example. \nWe figured this out. We had an initiative last year of reducing class \nsizes. Everyone agrees, reducing class sizes is a goal that we ought to \nbe pursuing diligently. This year we funded reducing class sizes by \n$1.2 billion. If this cut, where it stands right now, goes through, we \nwill have to fire 5,246 teachers we just hired will lose their jobs. So \n5,000 teachers we hired for this school year, to reduce class sizes, \nwill have to be let go with the 17-percent cut.\n  Then I looked to see what it would do in my own State of Iowa. In \nIowa, for example, some of the things that are most meaningful in \neducation, title I--the title I reading and math program will be cut \n$11.3 million with this 17-percent cut; special education, IDEA, will \nbe cut $8.5 million; class size reduction--the one I just spoke about; \ncutting the teachers--will be cut $1.6 million in the State of Iowa; \nsafe and drug-free schools will be cut $717,000 from a $3.6 million \nlevel. That is just in my State of Iowa.\n  I suggest to Senators that they might want to take a look at how much \nin each of their States' education funding will be cut where we are \nright now with that 17-percent across-the-board cut with what we have \nin our Education appropriations bill right now.\n  Check your State. Then go back and tell your Governors and tell your \nState legislators, tell your school boards, tell your principals and \nsuperintendents and teachers how much education is going to get cut and \nhow much they are going to have to come up with in increased property \ntaxes. I bet the Governors will love that in the States.\n  So right now education is dead last in the priorities in what is \ngoing on in the Senate. What does that say to our kids? What does that \nsay to the people in general? We have increased defense spending. Oh, \nyes, we increased defense spending $16 billion. We have cut education \nby $5.6 billion. I guess we are going to have the strongest military in \nthe world, and we are going to have a bunch of dummies in it or have \nmore money in the military for remedial math and reading programs to \nbring them up to standards.\n\n  Mr. President, I end where I started. We went from first in priority \nto dead last. That is unacceptable. We have to turn it around for the \nfuture of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin for his statement \nand his commitment to education and the tremendous job he is doing to \ndo the right thing, to get education back as the top priority of this \nSenate and not the last priority. I very much appreciate his strong \nwords and his work, and I look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues, at the beginning of this \nyear,--as we were discussing budget priorities--virtually every Member \nof this Chamber--Republican and Democrat--came before you to say how \nimportant education is. I was proud to see that the issues that \nAmerican families talk about around the kitchen table were finally \nbeing talked about here on the Senate floor.\n  As the year has progressed, however, we have seen that it was just \nthat--a lot of talk and no action. Members have not matched their talk \nabout education funding with actual funds.\n  For example, earlier this year, the budget chairman indicated he \nwould increase funding for education and training by $5.6 billion. \nIncluding yesterday's actions on VA-HUD appropriations, we are now \nlooking at--not an increase of $5.6 billion--but a decrease of more \nthan $15 billion in education funding from last year.\n  How are we going to look the American public in the eye and honestly \nsay that we are doing what we have promised?\n  This Congress has turned its back on the bipartisan commitment we \nmade only last year. Schools in my State--and all across the country--\nare using the Federal money we appropriated last year to hire more \nteachers right now. And it is working. But the current budget process \ncuts this progress off at the knees.\n  A budget document is a statement of our values. When you look at the \nbudgets that have come out this year, they show that Congress' values \ndon't match Americans' values. How can we say that education is a \npriority if it receives only 1.6 percent of Federal spending?\n  I cannot in good conscience sit quietly as this Congress goes back on \nits word and ignores the priorities of the American public.\n  This is the most important discussion we can have right now. School \nis back in session, and people are talking about improving education. \nOnly Congress is not listening.\n  Sometimes in this Chamber it is hard to hear what our actions sound \nlike across the country. Let me tell you what it sounds like to my \nconstituents. They have told me in no uncertain terms that education \nfunding matters.\n  The people are speaking, but Congress is not listening.\n  The American people have said that our children should not sit in \novercrowded classrooms. When a child's hand goes up in the classroom, \nwe all want the teacher to be able to focus on that child's question.\n  What is Congress's reply? The Republican budget will cut education \nfunding by more than 17 percent and guarantee that we keep our children \nin overcrowded classrooms.\n  The people are speaking, but Congress is not listening.\n  The American people have said that our teachers should be well-\ntrained and have the most recent skills and resources to meet today's \ncomplex\n\n[[Page S11034]]\n\nneeds-- including knowing how to use technology to boost student \nachievement.\n\n  What is Congress' reply? The Republican budget will cut education \nfunding by more than 17 percent and guarantee that we cannot give our \nstudents the well-trained teachers they deserve. The people are \nspeaking; Congress is not listening.\n  The American people have said they want their children to learn in \nmodern schools, not schools where plugging in a computer blows all the \nelectrical circuits. What is Congress' reply? The Republican budget \nwill cut education funding by more than 17 percent and guarantee that \nwe will not be able to modernize our aging schools. The people are \nspeaking; Congress is not listening.\n  Over the past year, one place where our children should be the \nsafest, our schools, has become a home to unspeakable acts of violence. \nAt the end of last school year, we had tragedies in Colorado and \nGeorgia. The American people have told us they want their children to \nbe safe in school. What is Congress' reply? The Republican budget will \ncut education funding by more than 17 percent and guarantee that we \ntake away resources for safe and drug-free schools now, when we need \nthem the most. The people are speaking; Congress is not listening.\n  When my colleagues say they are listening to the American people, \nthey must be listening with their hands over their ears because they \naren't getting the message.\n  Let me be clear: Cutting education funding by more than 17 percent is \nnot what the American people want. It is not what our students need, \nand it is not what this Congress said it would do.\n  Why do I feel so strongly about this? Because making sure that we \ninvest in public education and prepare our students and our country for \ntomorrow is at the core of who I am and why I am a United States \nSenator. When I was raising my children and my State was about to cut a \nsmall but very essential preschool program, I started talking to people \naround me about how we could keep that program. It wasn't very long \nbefore I had 15,000 people behind me making their voices heard in my \nState capital to save that preschool program. We fought very hard over \na very small program, and we prevailed. The program wasn't cut, and \ntoday it is still helping students as it has been for the past 40 \nyears.\n  These same parents and parents like them from around my State have \nresponded so deeply to the need to invest in education that they sent \nme to the school board, the State senate, and now to the United States \nSenate. I stand before you as a person with a mission--to make sure \nthat policymakers across this country do not walk away from their \nresponsibility to the future of America and that they understand the \nimportance of the Federal education dollar.\n  Since I have been in the Senate, I have noticed a change. Because of \nthe efforts of Members like myself, Tom Harkin, Ted Kennedy, Chris \nDodd, Barbara Boxer, Jack Reed, and Republicans such as Senator \nJeffords and others, this body is finally talking about education in a \nway that it never has before. This Chamber's discussion is more \nreflective of the discussions that go on around kitchen tables all over \nthis country. But you don't get points for talk alone.\n  I am sure that after my remarks today, some Members of this body will \ncome here to say our public schools are failing, and they will paint us \nall a picture of woe and despair. The truth is, our public schools are \ndoing a good job educating our children, and they are doing that good \nwork in the face of enormous challenges today.\n\n  I have to say it again because it has never been more clear: Our \npublic schools have not failed us, but if we don't stop this Republican \nbudget, we will be failing our public schools.\n  The American people say education should be the highest priority. \nThis Congress is making it our last priority. The American people say \neducation should be our first priority. This Congress made it the last \nbill we will debate, after all the dollars have been spent, and there \nis only a little bit of spare change left.\n  Some of the proposals out there would have you believe that we can \nsolve everything just by making our Federal programs more flexible. We \nall want our programs to be flexible. But you can have all the \nflexibility in the world, and it won't solve our education problems. \nOur schools need resources and our schools need funding.\n  The education budget has been left for the last. When we go home in a \nmonth, how will we explain the resulting decisions to our constituents? \nWhich 17 percent of the kids are we going to say are not worth \neducating? To which 17 percent of the parents and families are we going \nto say: Sorry, we didn't have enough money to teach your child? Which \n17 percent of schools are not worth making safe, secure, and drug free?\n  We cannot waste a single student. Even though it is very late in the \ngame, and there is a lot of work to be done, we can turn this around. \nWe can still decide to keep our word on education and to keep in step \nwith the wishes of the American public.\n  It is not too late. I urge all of my colleagues to act now to \nincrease education funding and do right by our children.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, is the Senate in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11034-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11034-S11035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         BELLEVUE INTERNATIONAL'S INNOVATION IN EDUCATION AWARD\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today is National Student Day. In honor of \nthis day, I would like to congratulate an outstanding group of students \nfrom my home state. Recently, the SAT scores for Washington state's \ngraduating classes of 1999 were released. At the top of the public \nschool list were the graduates of the International School of Bellevue, \naveraging 601 on verbal and 590 on math. Both scores surpassed the \nnational averages by almost one-hundred points.\n  In my visits to hundreds of schools across Washington state, I have \nseen the benefits of countless innovative reforms and programs. The \nInternational School of Bellevue is an example of what local educators \ncan do when they are given the freedom and flexibility to create new \nand better ways to educate.\n  The International School is a public school that was created \napproximately eight years ago by highly innovative teachers from the \nBellevue School District. The founders' vision was to create a school \nin which a student would be placed in the classroom based on his or her \nability--not his or her age. The founders also wanted to create an \natmosphere in which each student would maintain close relationships \nwith the teachers, and would gain clear understanding of how our \ncountry fits into today's world.\n  At the Bellevue International School, each student is required to \ntake seven classes each year which include humanities, international \nstudies, math, science, a foreign language, fine arts, and fitness. \nEven though this school serves grades 6-12, there are not specific \ngrade levels. Each student takes his or her courses at the student's \nown performance level, starting at level one and ranging up to level \nseven for each of the seven courses.\n  The students are also encouraged to spend one month abroad at one of \nthe International School's sister schools. While abroad, the students \nattend classes and are treated as regular students of their guest \nschools.\n  In order to attend the International School, students are not \nrequired to take an exam, submit test scores or previous grades. Any \nstudent with the desire and motivation to attend this school can submit \nhis or her name into a lottery out of which names of the new students \nare chosen.\n  The Principal of the International School said that her students, \n``are not necessarily the smartest kids, but they have a terrific work \nethic, converse with their teachers, and are highly resourceful and \nresponsible for themselves and for others.''\n  I applaud the International School's class of 1999 for its \nmagnificent scores\n\n[[Page S11035]]\n\non the SAT. I also applaud the rest of the student body for its passion \nfor learning and for taking advantage of this tremendous opportunity. I \nknow that each student who graduates from the International School will \nleave with an outstanding education and greater understanding of our \ncountry, our world, and his or her place in it.\n  The International School's impressive performance on the SAT \ndemonstrates that when given the flexibility to create a program, local \neducators will succeed. I believe that we must give control of federal \neducation dollars to the states and local school districts because \nthose who work with out children on a daily basis--their parents, \nteachers, principals, superintendents, and school board members--best \nunderstand the needs of our children and should have the most \nsignificant role in setting education policy and priorities in our \nschools.\n  Mr. President, I might be a bit disingenuous in sharing this praise \nwith you if I were not to point out that my oldest grandchild, my \ngranddaughter, Betsy Nortz, just won the lottery last spring and \nstarted last week as a sixth grader at Belleview International. \nAlready, in just a few days, she reports great interest in the \nintellectual challenges to which she is subjected. She and I and her \nparents look forward to a fine career in the single school, I believe, \nin the State of Washington in the public system with the highest SAT \nscores.\n  The students and educators at the International School of Bellevue \ndeserve our recognition and I hope my colleagues will join me in \napplauding their achievements.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk for a few \nmoments about the Transportation appropriations bill we just passed and \nabout one major component of that bill, and that is the U.S. Coast \nGuard.\n  I rise this afternoon to make one point very clear. The U.S. Coast \nGuard needs our help and needs our support. The future of the Coast \nGuard depends on a continued congressional commitment to provide \nadequate resources to the Coast Guard to carry out its very important \nmission.\n  Now, Congress--only in the last few years, with the leadership of a \nnumber of my colleagues--has begun to devote resources toward \nrebuilding the readiness of the Coast Guard. But we have to understand \nthat this is a continuous process. These investments we have made have \ncome at a time when we have seen the missions of this important agency \nincrease and expand.\n  Let me pause to congratulate Senators Shelby, Lautenberg, and the \nrest of the committee. They have been very supportive of the Coast \nGuard and have worked very hard to come up with the very scarce dollars \nthat are needed for the Coast Guard. I appreciate their work. I \nunderstand very well that they know and understand the challenges the \nCoast Guard faces. They have supported investments in the Coast Guard \nand understand the important role it plays in fighting drug \ntrafficking.\n  I also know that in crafting the Transportation appropriations bill, \nmy colleagues were faced with very difficult budget constraints. It is \nessential, however, that our overall investment in the Coast Guard \nkeeps pace with the demands we are now placing on the Coast Guard and \nthat we build on the recent successes we have seen in regard to the \nCoast Guard. We simply, as a Congress and as a Nation, in very tough \nand difficult budget times, must make funding for the Coast Guard a top \npriority.\n  It is obvious why a Senator from Ohio would have an interest in the \nCoast Guard. In my home State of Ohio, the Ninth Coast Guard District \nperforms many vital functions critical to human safety and economic \ndevelopment. With more than 2.3 million of America's 11.5 million \nrecreational boaters residing in the Great Lakes region, the Ninth \nCoast Guard District search and rescue units handle close to 7,500 \ncases annually, saving hundreds and hundreds of lives.\n  Further, to facilitate commerce on the Great Lakes during the winter \nmonths, Coast Guard cutters work closely with the Canadian Coast Guard \nto clear the way for approximately $62 million worth of commercial \ncargo annually. This Ninth District also maintains more than 3,300 \nbuoys, navigational lights, and fixed aids throughout this critical \nshipping region.\n  In addition to this role of the Coast Guard in my State of Ohio, it \nplays a significant role in the international drug fight. This may not \nbe what people have historically thought about regarding the Coast \nGuard, but let me tell you, based on my own experience in going out \nwith the Coast Guard and seeing what they do, if we give them the \nmoney, if we give them the resources, they are not only capable but \nthey are willing and eager to go out and fight our antidrug battle for \nus.\n  To quantify it, because of the Coast Guard, each year close to $3 \nbillion worth of drugs never reach our neighborhoods, never reach our \nschools, and never reach our children. They are stopped before they get \nthere, and they are stopped by our Coast Guard.\n  I have spoken on the Senate floor on several occasions in the past \nabout U.S. counternarcotics policy. I have spoken about the Coast \nGuard's ability to enforce that policy. As I have said before, I \nbelieve we need a balanced program to attack the drug problem on all \nfronts. We need to invest in domestic reduction and law enforcement \nprograms. But we also need to invest in international programs to \nincrease interdiction and reduce production of illegal narcotics, and \nwe need to do our best to stop drugs from ever reaching our shores.\n  A balanced program means international drug interdiction. It means \ndomestic law enforcement. It also means prevention, education, and \ntreatment. We have to do all of these, and we have to do all of them \nall the time.\n  Sadly, though, for the last 7 years this administration has pursued \nan antidrug strategy that I believe is clearly out of balance--a \nstrategy that has failed to reverse a dramatic rise in youth drug use \nand a strategy that has allowed drug trafficking organizations to \nbecome a dominant source of political instability in Latin America and \ncountries to our south.\n  Before the Clinton administration took office, almost a third of our \nentire antidrug Federal budget was committed to stopping drugs from \never getting into our borders--international drug interdiction and \neradication. We invested in a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week antidrug \noperation in the Caribbean. It worked. Drug prices increased and drug \nconsumption went down.\n  But tragically this all changed in 1993 when the Clinton \nadministration came into power and began to change things. Our \ncounternarcotics budget dedicated to international eradication and \ninterdiction efforts went from one-third of the total budget in the \nlate 1980s and early 1990s to less than 14 percent by 1995. This change \nin policy meant significant cuts in the Coast Guard. In fact, Coast \nGuard funding for counternarcotics decreased from $443 million in 1992 \nto $301 million in 1995, almost a one-third reduction. As a \nconsequence, the number of ship days that were devoted to overall \ncounterdrug activities declined from 4,872 in 1991 to 1,649 in 1994--a \nhuge decrease.\n  As a result, with the reduced Coast Guard presence, more and more \ndrugs are making their way into our country through the Caribbean. That \nis the main reason why drugs are more affordable. It is also one of the \nreasons why youth drug use in this country is dramatically higher now \nthan at the beginning of the Clinton administration.\n  Last year, as I have shared with Members of the Senate before, I saw \nfirsthand what the Coast Guard can do. I went with the Coast Guard to \nsee the counterdrug operations off the coast of Haiti, off the coast of \nthe Dominican Republic, and off the coast of Puerto Rico. These \npersonal visits convinced me that the Coast Guard can do more if we \nsimply provide the right levels of\n\n[[Page S11036]]\n\nmaterial and manpower to fight drug trafficking. They are ready to do \nit. They just need the resources. These visits also convinced me that \nthis Congress had to address the state of drug-fighting readiness in \nour country.\n  Thanks to the majority leader, Senator Lott, thanks to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, and thanks to my colleagues, Senator \nCoverdell, Senator Graham of Florida, Congressman McCollum, and Speaker \nHastert, who all share my dedication to fighting drugs, we passed, last \nyear, the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. This act authorizes \na $2.7 billion, 3-year investment to rebuild our drug-fighting \ncapability outside our borders to stop drugs, quite frankly, where it \nis easiest to stop them--at the source and in transit.\n\n  This new law that Congress passed is about reclaiming the Federal \nGovernment's sole responsibility to prevent drugs from ever reaching \nour borders. Last year, Congress made an $800 million downpayment for \nthis initiative, including $375 million for the Coast Guard.\n  Why is it significant? It is significant because international drug \ninterdiction--stopping drugs at the border, stopping them on the high \nseas, stopping them at the source--is the sole responsibility of the \nFederal Government. It is not a shared responsibility with the States \nor the local communities. Every other facet of our antidrug effort--\nwhether it is treatment, prevention, education, or domestic law \nenforcement--are all shared responsibilities between us in Congress, \nthe President, the Federal Government, and the local communities. But \nwhen we are talking about stopping drugs on the high seas, when we are \ntalking about funding the Coast Guard, that is solely the \nresponsibility of this body, the House, and the President of the United \nStates.\n  This year, thanks to this added investment that Congress made last \nyear for the Coast Guard, we are seeing results.\n  Just this week, the national media has focused, highlighted, and put \nconsiderable attention on the Coast Guard's successful use of force \ncapability to disable the drug trade's ``go-fast'' boats. These are \nboats I have talked about before on the Senate floor. These ``go-fast'' \nboats are souped-up motorboats capable of outrunning most ships in the \nCoast Guard fleet. They now carry more than 85 percent of all maritime \ndrug shipments--85 percent goes in these ``go-fast'' boats. These boats \ntypically carry drug shipments from the northern coast of Colombia, for \nexample, to the southern tip of Haiti, to the southern tip of that \ngreat island, Hispaniola. Drug traders use the boats along the coasts \nof the United States to pick up drugs dropped into the ocean by small \naircraft.\n  The Coast Guard traditionally has been cautious in using lethal \nairpower to stop these boats due to the high likelihood of casualties. \nBut thanks to a combination of technology and funding from this \nCongress, the Coast Guard has now demonstrated success in being able to \ntarget precisely the engines of ``go-fast'' boats and forcibly disable \nthem, thus allowing the capture of the perpetrators and the ceasing of \nthe illicit cargo, all while minimizing the risk to human life. It is \nbecause of these and other operations that cocaine seizures are now at \nan all-time high of 53 tons, with a street value of $3.7 billion.\n  We must continue to invest in Coast Guard readiness if we are to see \nthis kind of success over the long run. It has been a challenge for \nCongress, given the fact the administration has not made readiness and \nwell-being of the Coast Guard a national priority.\n  The fact is, despite the recent successes, readiness remains a \nproblem. According to Adm. James Loy, Commandant of the Coast Guard, \nthe Coast Guard is being stretched very thin. Aircraft deployments have \nmore than doubled, with helicopter deployments increasing by more than \n25 percent. These increases did not happen with extra manpower and \nresources. These increases were achieved by working existing crews \nharder. In some cases, crews were working continuous 72-hour shifts. \nThe Pacific area alone increased its temporary duty travel by 70 \npercent just to maintain the pace of routine operations.\n\n  So what we are saying is that we are asking the Coast Guard to do \nmore. We began to give them significant resources last year. They are \ndoing more. They are having successes. But unless we continue to \nsupport the Coast Guard, unless we continue to give them the resources \nthey need, they will not be able to do the job we are asking them to \ndo. It is as simple as that.\n  In placing these additional demands upon our service members, we have \nto worry about safety. I understand lost workdays and shore injuries \nare up 29 percent and aircraft ground mishaps are up almost 50 percent \nfrom previous years. This is something we need to be concerned about. \nWe are talking about human lives. Further, downtime of air and marine \ncraft is on the rise.\n  The demands on the Coast Guard are simply not decreasing; they are \nincreasing. They have to have our support. This is why I will continue \nto call for the strongest investment possible for our Coast Guard. I \napplaud my colleagues who worked with me, including the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Coverdell, and the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, who \nstepped up to the challenge to gain additional investments last year. \nThey and others in the House and the Senate and our Appropriations \nCommittee particularly in the Senate deserve a great deal of the credit \nfor the recent successes we are seeing in drug interdiction. These \nsuccesses simply would not have happened but for what Congress did last \nyear.\n  However, this is not a one-shot deal. This is not something we can do \nin 1 year and think it is done. We have to continue year after year. \nThe additional 1999 funding is simply not the sole cure. It is just the \ndownpayment.\n  We must have a sustained, multiyear effort if we expect our Coast \nGuard to be able to meet daily challenges and if we expect them to \nprovide the critical services the American people expect and demand. \nUnless we continue with the investments we began least year, we will be \nsending a signal to the drug lords that this is just a temporary, maybe \neven a headline-grabbing effort, a politically expedient exercise. In \nfact, the writing is on the wall. If we fail to maintain and build on \nour support for the Coast Guard, these drug dealers will not believe we \nare serious and the Coast Guard will not be able to continue the \ncurrent level of counterdrug operations in the future.\n\n  The bottom line is we need to continue more resources. I applaud the \nefforts of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee. I know they \ntried to allocate a more sizable portion of the budget. They were faced \nwith daunting challenges. As a Congress and as a people we must do \nmore. We have to. As further opportunities in this Congress present \nthemselves, we must take those opportunities and try to provide \nadditional funds. As I said, adequate funding for the Coast Guard \nshould be a top national priority. So much hinges on it.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in sending a message to all of the \nhard-working men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard that we do not take \nthem for granted. We will continue to make sure they have the tools \nnecessary to accomplish the many demanding missions we ask of them on \nbehalf of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11036-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11036-S11037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AMAZING GRACE\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am troubled today. I am troubled because \nI find myself standing on the Senate floor once again raising an issue \nthat cuts to the very core of human cruelty and moral disregard. I have \nstood here before, many of my colleagues have stood here before, \nrepeatedly speaking about my strong belief that the partial-birth \nabortion procedure is wrong. Not only is it wrong, it is evil. The \nprocedure is a reprehensible act of human violence, violence against a \nhuman being.\n  I recently stood here not too many weeks ago and told Members of the \nSenate about a helpless baby named ``Hope.'' On April 6, 1999, Baby \nHope's mother entered a Dayton, OH, abortion clinic with the intention \nof having her pregnancy terminated through a partial-birth abortion. \nHowever, the abortion did not succeed.\n  Here is what happened: Dr. Haskell, who we have heard so much about \non the Senate floor, the infamous Dayton abortionist, started the \nprocedure as\n\n[[Page S11037]]\n\nusual by inserting instruments known as laminaria into the woman and by \napplying seaweed. This process is supposed to slowly dilate the cervix \nso the child eventually can be removed and killed. That is the \nprocedure. That is what they do.\n  After this initial step, in this particular instance, Dr. Haskell \nsent the woman home because it usually takes 2 or 3 days before the \nbaby can be removed from the womb and the abortion completed. Expecting \nto return in 2 or 3 days, this woman followed the doctor's orders and \nwent home to Cincinnati.\n  Soon after she left the abortion clinic, her cervix started dilating \ntoo quickly, causing her to go into labor. Shortly after midnight, on \nthe first day of the procedure, she entered the hospital and gave birth \nto a very much alive but very tiny baby. The neonatologist determined \nthat Baby Hope's lungs were too underdeveloped to sustain life without \nthe help of a respirator. Baby Hope, however, was not placed on a \nrespirator. Instead, the poor, defenseless creature was left to die \nonly a little more than 3 hours after birth.\n\n  I am back on the floor again today because we now, tragically, have \nanother example of a partial-birth abortion in Ohio that did not go \naccording to the abortionist's plan, this one occurring on August 19, a \ncouple of weeks ago.\n  The Dayton Daily News reported this incident. The procedure was again \nat the hands of Dr. Haskell. Here, too, he started the barbaric \nprocedure by dilating the mother's cervix. Similarly, this woman went \ninto labor only 1 hour later, was admitted to Good Samaritan Hospital, \nand gave birth to a baby girl a short time later. This time, however, a \nmiracle occurred. This little baby lived.\n  A medical technician appropriately named this precious little ``Baby \nGrace.'' After her birth, she was transferred to a neonatal intensive \ncare unit at Children's Hospital in Dayton. The Montgomery County \nChildren's Services Board has temporary, interim custody of little Baby \nGrace. She likely will face months of hospitalization and possible \nlifelong complications, we don't know, all resulting from being \npremature and the induced abortion.\n  I am appalled and sickened by the fact that both of these partial-\nbirth abortions occurred anywhere. I am particularly offended by the \nfact they occurred in my home State of Ohio. But wherever they occur, \nit is a human tragedy.\n  I have said this before and I will say it again; the partial-birth \nabortion should be outlawed. Partial-birth abortion should be outlawed \nin our civilized society.\n  When we hear about the brutal death of Baby Hope and we think about \nthe miracle of Baby Grace, we have to stop and ask, to what depths have \nwe sunk in this country? Partial-birth abortion is a very clear matter \nof right and wrong, good versus evil. It is my wish there will come a \nday, I hope and pray, when I no longer have to come to this Senate \nfloor and talk about partial-birth abortions. Until that day arrives, \nthe day when the procedure has been outlawed in our country, I must \ncontinue to plead for the protection of unborn fetuses threatened by \npartial-birth abortions.\n  In the name of Baby Hope, let's stop the killing. In the name of Baby \nGrace, let's protect the living.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11037-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I would like to correct the record, \nbecause I know I heard a number of my colleagues say the Republican \nbudget is slashing education, it's at the lowest end, it's the last \nappropriation bill we are taking up. Let me correct the record. Let me \ngive you some facts.\n  One, the budget the Republicans passed earlier this year had an \nincrease for education, not a decrease. The Appropriations Committee \nhas yet to mark up the Labor-HHS bill. They are going to mark it up \nnext week. I understand from Senator Specter and others they plan on \nappropriating $90 billion. The amount of money we have in the current \nfiscal year is $83.8 billion. So that is an increase of about $6.2 \nbillion for FY2000. That is an increase of about 9 percent. That is \nwell over inflation. I think it is too much. I think we should be \nfreezing spending. We should not be increasing spending. But I just \nwant to correct the record. It bothers me to think some people are \ntrying to manipulate the facts, to build up their case.\n  The Democrats are well aware that the Appropriations Committee is \ngoing to be marking up a bill that is going to have at least as much \nmoney this year as we spent last year in education. I hope we change \nthe priorities. I hope we follow the guidance of my colleague from \nWashington, the Presiding Officer, and give the States some \nflexibility. I haven't heard anybody say ``Let's cut the total amount \nof funds going to education,'' but I have heard, ``Let's give the \nStates, Governors and school boards more flexibility so they can do \nwhat they need to do in improving quality education. Let's hold them \naccountable to improve the quality of education. Let's not just come up \nwith more Federal programs.''\n  I heard both of my colleagues say, ``Boy, we need more Federal \nteachers or more school buildings.'' Is that really the business of the \nFederal Government? Are we supposed to make that decision that this \nschool district or this school needs more teachers, or this school \nshould be repaired, or this school should be replaced? Is that a \nFederal decision? I don't think so. It just so happens that within the \nlast hour I met with the Governor of Oklahoma, the Governor of Nevada \nand the Governor of Utah. They say they have already reduced class size \nand some of them have already made significant investments in schools. \nBut, they need more help. They want flexibility. They want to be able \nto use the money for individual students with disabilities. We should \ngive them that flexibility. But our colleagues seem to think, ``Oh, no, \nwe have to have 100,000 Federal teachers. The Governor of Nevada said \nthat in the city of Las Vegas alone they hire 18,000 new teachers every \nyear. Why in the world should we be dictating? In last year's budget \nagreement we needed 30,000 teachers. Now we need to go to 100,000 \nteachers? Is that the Federal governments responsibility? I don't think \nso.\n  I don't think the Federal Government should be dictating that this \nState or this school district needs to hire more teachers or build more \nbuildings or put in more computers. Let's give them the money we \nspend--and altogether the Federal Government spends over $100 billion \non education--let's give the States the flexibility to spend that money \nin ways that will really improve the quality of education. Maybe that \nwill go to increasing the number of teachers or to buildings and \nconstruction. Maybe it will be in computers and in training. Maybe it \nwill be in retention or it will be in bonuses for the best teachers. \nWhy should we be making that decision? We don't know those schools. We \ndon't know those districts. We don't know those superintendents. We are \nnot serving on those PTAs. This really should not be a Federal \nresponsibility. Let's give that responsibility to the local school \nboards and to the States and not have more dictates and more Federal \nprograms.\n\n  There are already over 760 Federal education programs to date. Our \ncolleagues on the Democrat side would like to add even more programs, \nas if that is going to improve the quality of education. I don't think \nso.\n  Just a couple more facts: Labor-HHS funding, which is the \nappropriations bill we are talking about, has been rising and growing \ndramatically. Yet I\n\n[[Page S11038]]\n\nhear, ``Oh, they are slashing this bill by 17 percent.'' Wait a minute, \nlet's get the bill on the floor before we start saying we are slashing \nthe bill. What we passed and appropriated and spent in 1997 was $71 \nbillion. In 1996, it was $64.4 billion. It went to $71 billion in 1997, \nthat's over a 10 percent increase. From 1997 to 1998 it went from $71 \nbillion to $80.7 billion, again well over a 10 percent increase. Last \nyear it went from $80.7 to $83.9 billion, plus there were some advanced \nappropriations of about $6 billion.\n  So, again there was a big increase from last year and we are talking \nabout increasing it even further for next year, for the year 2000. So \nthis rhetoric by the Democrats that is designed to scare people and to \nget people activated on the education bill, is not substantiated by the \nfacts.\n  I want to address a couple of other things we can do for education \nand for the American taxpayer. But the President has to help us do it \nby signing the tax bill that is now before him. We have $11 billion of \ntax relief targeted towards education in the tax bill. If the President \nwants to improve education he can sign the tax bill and I hope he will. \nWe allow for student loans, greater deductions and we provide extended \nassistance for education. Right now, people can save $500 on \neducational savings accounts. We increase that to $2,000.\n  It is vitally important that the President sign the tax bill. In \naddition, we have a lot of relief for taxpayers in the bill. I will \njust mention a couple of them.\n  I have heard a lot of people, Democrats and Republicans, say the \nmarriage penalty is unfair. It's unfair for the present day Tax Code to \npenalize a couple because they happen to be married. In other words, \nwhen they get married their combined tax load should not be greater \nthen when they were single and paying separately. And it is. The \nmarriage penalty averages out about $1,400. For the privilege of being \nmarried you have to pay an extra $1,400. A lot of us think that is \ngrossly unfair. We want to change it.\n  The President can change it. We, in Congress, have changed it. We \nsent the bill to the President's desk. If he signs it we will be \neliminating the marriage penalty, for all practical purposes, for \nalmost all married couples.\n  We also want to give relief to individuals who, in many cases, are at \nthe lowest end of the economic ladder in the tax bill. I have heard \nsome people say, ``Oh, that tax cut package, that's a tax cut for the \nwealthiest people.'' That's hogwash. We cut taxes for taxpayers, people \nwho are in the lowest end of the income-tax schedule. They get a 7 \npercent reduction because we reduced the rate from 15 percent to 14 \npercent. It doesn't sound like much, but that is a 7 percent reduction \nfor somebody on the lowest end of the economic ladder. That is a \nsignificant tax reduction.\n\n  Wait a minute, what are you doing for the wealthier people? We are \nreducing the rate from 39.6 to 38.6, and we do not do that until the \noutyears. That doesn't happen until several years later. That would \namount to a little less than 3 percent. So we give a much greater \npercentage reduction in tax cuts to the people on the lower end of the \nscale. We actually make the tax schedule a little more progressive.\n  We provide a tax cut for taxpayers, and honestly it is not very much \nof one. Somebody says that's too much, you have cut taxes too much. \nThink about this for a second. When President Clinton was sworn into \noffice in January of 1993, the maximum tax bracket for any American, \npersonal income tax, was 31 percent. The Democrat controlled Congress, \nwith a tie vote broken by Vice President Gore acting as President of \nthe Senate--increased the maximum tax bracket from 31 percent to 39.6. \nSo, at the end of 10 years we reduce that 39.6 to 38.6, wow, we have \nreduced it about one tenth as much as he increased it. And that is too \nmuch? We are being too fair to the rich? Wait a minute, they increased \nthe rate from 31 percent to 39.6 percent; and we reduce it to 38.6 \npercent. It is still a whole lot higher than it was when President \nClinton was elected. That is too much? The President claims that if you \ncut taxes that much, you won't be able to pay for all these programs.\n\n  We take two-thirds of the surplus and use it to pay down debt, to pay \ndown our national debt by over $2 trillion. We take two-thirds of it \nand we pay down the national debt with the Social Security surplus. You \ncannot spend one dime of it for anything else.\n  In the President's original budget he said he wanted to spend \nbillions for other things. We said, no we are not going to do that. We \nwant to use 100 percent of the Social Security surplus to pay down the \ndebt, period--no ifs and or buts about it. The President wanted to try \nto raid the fund and we said no.\n  Then we said, out of the surplus we want two thirds of it to pay down \ndebt, one-fourth of it can go back to taxpayers. We do not want the \ntaxpayers to have to send all of their hard earned money to Washington, \nDC. We certainly do not want to have to return it, we want them to keep \nit in the first place. It is theirs. It is not ours. It is not the \nGovernment's to spend. If they are sending in too much in taxes, let \nthem keep it, why should they have to filter it through Washington, DC, \nand hope they get something back in the form of a so-called targeted \ntax cut?\n  President Clinton--his definition of ``targeted'' means: It applies \nto somebody--not you, not me, not anybody I know--so targeted that, in \neffect it is Government deciding who wins and who loses. It is \nGovernment making economic decisions. I think that is a mistake.\n  I would hope the President would sign the tax bill that we have on \nhis desk that makes these changes and includes many more. I also \nbelieve we should be repealing this so-called death tax. I do not think \nit is right to have a death tax of 55 percent on somebody's estate that \nthey worked their entire life on, and the Government comes in and says: \nBecause you passed away, and you are trying to give this to your kids \nor grandkids, the Federal Government is entitled to take 55 percent of \nit. That is the present law.\n  If you have a taxable estate of $3 million, the Government gets 55 \npercent. So people who have those estates, they spend their lives \ntrying to figure out ways to minimize this tax or get around this tax.\n  You do not have to be very wealthy to be paying a lot. You can have a \ntaxable estate of $1 million, and the Government gets 39 percent. So \nthat is 39 percent for a taxable estate of $1 million. Uncle Sam says: \nHey, give me about half of it. This tax bill repeals that.\n  Mr. President, I urge you to sign this tax bill. I know you have said \nthat you are going to veto it. I know you would rather spend the money. \nYou think you can spend the money better than the taxpayers. I remember \nthe statement you made in New York, in February I believe, that said: \nWell, wait a minute, I guess we could give it back to the taxpayers, \nand let them keep it, but what if they don't spend it right?\n  Obviously, there are lots of ways that this President wants to spend \nthe money. There is no limit. And there is no doubt Congress will find \nlots of ways to spend the money as well.\n  A lot of us believe it is the people's money. They should be the ones \nmaking the decision. If they want to spend it on education, or if they \nwant to spend it on housing, or if they want to spend it on a vacation, \nor if they want to spend it on helping their family in different ways, \nlet people make that decision instead of Washington, DC. We think it \nwould help the economy more and certainly be more pro-family. Let the \nfamilies make those decisions, not politicians.\n  So, Mr. President, again, I urge you to sign this bill. I do not have \nany doubt you are going to veto the bill and the real losers are going \nto be the taxpayers.\n  I also remember we passed a tax cut in 1995. The President vetoed it. \nWe came back in 1997 and passed another tax cut, and he eventually \nsigned it. He did not want to sign it, but he did.\n  As a matter of fact, in that tax bill, in 1997, we reduced the \ncapital gains from 28 percent to 20 percent. Secretary Rubin was \nagainst it and the President was against it although he eventually \nsigned it. He did not want to increase the estate tax exemption. We had \na small exemption rate from $650,000 to a $1 million. He was not in \nfavor of it, but he eventually signed it. Those very things have helped \nthe economy. They have helped grow the economy at a faster rate than \npeople\n\n[[Page S11039]]\n\nanticipated. And now we are in a position to make further gains.\n  In the bill we have on your desk, Mr. President, we cut capital gains \nfrom 20 percent to 18 percent, and index it for inflation in the \nfuture. That will help the economy. That will make the economy grow \nfaster. That will increase jobs. That will probably raise more money \nfor the Federal Government.\n  So, Mr. President, we once again, urge you to sign this tax bill. It \nwill be a good thing for the economy. It will be a good thing for \nAmerican taxpayers. It will be a good thing for American families.\n  Let's get rid of the marriage penalty. Let's get rid of the death \ntax. Let's cut taxes across the board for taxpayers. We do that in the \ntax bill and still save over two-thirds of the budget for debt \nreduction.\n  So, Mr. President, let's allow taxpayers to have one-fourth of the \nsurplus. Let's let them keep it. I urge you to rise to the challenge \nand sign the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. First, Mr. President, I thank Senator Nickles, the \nassistant majority leader, for the speech he just delivered. Probably \nmore of us should be making those points on the floor of the Senate \ntoday about the importance of the tax cut proposal, what it means to \nworking Americans, and the fact that the President could sign it so it \nwould become the law and we would have a fairer Tax Code. But if he \nvetoes it, it is going to be a real shame. I appreciate the specifics \nSenator Nickles pointed out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11039-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11039-S11041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOMINATION OF BRIAN T. STEWART TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                            DISTRICT OF UTAH\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in an effort to continue to move forward on \njudicial nominations, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of \nBrian Theadore Stewart to be a U.S. District Judge for the District of \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. No objection to going to the measure.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Chair notes there was no objection to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that there \nbe a time agreement on the pending nomination of not to exceed 2 hours \nunder the control of Senator Leahy and 30 minutes under the control of \nSenator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have spent a lot of time \ntalking about this issue.\n  I spoke to the chairman of the committee today. We really want to try \nto be helpful and move along these judicial appointments, including the \none that is so important to the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  But we would ask the majority leader if he would modify his request \nto provide for the same time limitation for those nominees: Berzon, \nWhite, and Paez. Maybe having made this suggestion, modification of the \ntime agreement, we could have all these done. We could do it probably \nin a morning or certainly with a little added time. In fact, we would \neven be willing to cut down the time or add to the time if the majority \nleader would agree.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the Senator from \nNevada on his proposal. If he can get this agreement I have just \npropounded worked out, we will be able to move not only this nomination \nof Mr. Stewart, we will also be able to move tonight the nominees, M. \nJames Lorenz, of California, for the Southern District of California, \nand Victor Marrero, of New York, for the Southern District of New York.\n  With regard to the nomination of Ronnie L. White, of Missouri, for \nthe Eastern District of Missouri, we do have a time agreement we had \nworked out earlier. I think it was for only 35 minutes. It might \nrequire more time than that since a lot of time has lapsed, but I am \nsatisfied we will get a time agreement on that, and we will have a vote \non that one.\n  I think there is a possibility we could get some sort of a time \nagreement to consider also the nominee, Raymond C. Fisher, of \nCalifornia, for the Ninth Circuit, which is a very controversial \ncircuit. But I have not had an opportunity to check on the time on that \none.\n\n  So I think if we could get an understanding, an agreement with regard \nto Mr. Stewart, we could, as a matter of fact, move as many as five \njudges--two in wrapup and three with time agreements and recorded \nvotes. The other two--Berzon and Paez--I will have to go to all of my \ncolleagues to check and see how we can handle those. I have not been \nable to get a time agreement as yet. I have to confess that I have not \ntried it lately because I have been trying to move the other judges \nwhere there was either not an objection or there were limited \nobjections or we could get time agreements.\n  So I think this is a way to keep moving the process forward. I remind \nthe Senate that we have moved six Federal judicial nominations over the \nlast 2 weeks and that we have the opportunity tonight to move three \nmore. We have the opportunity, within the next 2 weeks, to move three \nmore. That is pretty good progress. I understand the Judiciary \nCommittee is moving toward, reporting out a number of other \nnominations.\n  So I hope we will find a way to work through all this. Everybody \nknows that this nominee, Stewart, is important to the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. If we get into a situation where we are not going \nto move him until we get agreement on all others, then we will wind up \nwith an all stop. I have been through that before. I wish we wouldn't \ndo that. I don't think it is good for the people who have been \nnominated. Why hold up those who can be cleared or voted on and \nprobably approved because we want to get others who are a major problem \nand we haven't been able to get cleared?\n  I will have to object at this time because I haven't had a chance to \ndo a hotline to see how we could handle Raymond Fisher--I would have to \ncheck on all three of those. Having said that, I will have to object to \nthat change.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the majority leader, I think this dialogue on the \nfloor is constructive. I think the suggestion of the leader that we \nmove some of these other people is something we need to do. We, of \ncourse, need to have more hearings. I see the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, who has certainly been engaged in this and has \nspoken with the Senator from Utah, much more than either you or I, \nabout this issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wish they would work this out, frankly. Then you and I \nwouldn't have to worry with it.\n  I did object. The Chair has heard objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection was heard.\n  Mr. REID. We still have the leader's unanimous consent request \npending though.\n  Mr. LOTT. I could make another one, but before I do, I am glad to \nyield the floor to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the distinguished majority leader will yield, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Utah and I have been in discussion \nwithin the last 2 or 3 minutes. We are trying to move this along and \nwork it out. I understand the concerns the majority leader has.\n  As he knows, both the two times I have served here with the Democrats \nin the majority and the two times I have served with Republicans in the \nmajority, I have always respected the majority leader's prerogatives in \nbringing things up.\n  My concern is not that this be a lockstep matter, but I say to my \nfriend from Mississippi--and this is one of the things that concerns \nmany people on this side of the aisle--there were 30 pending judicial \nnominations that were received by the Senate prior to the Stewart \nnomination coming, and they deserve our attention, too.\n  Obviously, I understand the special circumstances of the Stewart \nnomination. If we work out some of these other things, I expect to be \nvoting for him. But there were 30 ahead of it, not all of which are on \nthe calendar, but were received ahead of it and 6 in front of him on \nthe Senate Executive Calendar. We have concern that they are\n\n[[Page S11040]]\n\ngoing to get consideration, that each of them will be accorded a Senate \nvote. People should be fair to them all. Some of them have been there \nfor 2 or 3 years, some for a matter of months. What I am trying to do \nwith the distinguished Senator from Utah is work out some kind of \nunderstanding where we have Senate votes on the nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar, will have the hearings that are needed to move \nothers along. I was hoping we could work out some kind of a package \nthat the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished \nDemocratic leader could agree to today, but I don't think we can.\n  Mr. LOTT. I just offered basically a package that could involve five \njudges.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do want to make the point that, as the majority leader, I \ncan nudge a chairman and/or his ranking member, but I am not chairman \nor ranking of Judiciary. The majority leader can only deal with the \nnominations that hit the calendar. With the proposal I just made, two \nwould be on the calendar, at which point I would then have the time to \nsee how those might be dealt with.\n  Mr. LEAHY. With all due respect, the last few years the Senate has \nmoved slower on judicial nominations than any time I think I can \nremember in my time here. I have attended more judiciary hearings, \nvoted on more judicial nominations, than virtually anybody in this \nbody, with the exception of the distinguished President pro tem, who \ntells me he may have been doing them in Thomas Jefferson's time. But \nfor the rest of us, I have. I have never seen it go quite so slowly. In \n1996, 1997 and again this year the Senate has been moving slowly with \nrespect to a number of judicial nominees.\n  We are trying to work that out. Obviously, it is not going to get \nsolved today. I do not want to get having to invoke cloture on judicial \nnominations. I think it is a bad precedent. That may be necessary.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could reclaim my time, I agree with you on that. I \ndon't want to do that. I have discouraged it ever since I have been the \nmajority leader. I don't believe we have had cloture on a Federal judge \nsince I have been majority leader. The idea that we would begin \ndefeating Federal judicial nominations with 41 of the 100 Senators' \nvotes, that is a bad thing to start. I hope we will not do it.\n  I have to try to find a way to force us to some agreements and to \nforce us into some action. I would be inclined to file cloture today. I \nwant to emphasize, I would prefer to vitiate and not do that. I will go \nahead and put it in place tonight, but if Senator Hatch and Senator \nLeahy will come to me and say, we have something worked out here, or if \nwe can work it out to move these five judges, I will be delighted to \nmove to vitiate that and not go forward with it. Then we can keep this \nprocess moving.\n\n  Remember, right before the August recess, I was the one who tried to \nmove judges. I would get an objection from the Democratic side, if I \ndidn't include certain judges. Then, if I did it a different way, I \nwould get objections from the Republican side because certain judges \nweren't included. The net result was, none of them were included.\n  When I came back, I called Senator Daschle and I called Senator \nHatch. I said: I am going to start at the beginning. I am going to \nstart with the easiest ones to get done, and if people are going to \nobject, then they will have to object to them one by one. As a result \nof that, everybody kind of relaxed and we moved six of them. We are now \nready to move at least two more, and I thought we could move three \nmore. If we keep this thing going, it has a lubricating effect. When \nyou act, you tend to act.\n  Let me say this about the vacancies, the number of judges appointed. \nThis Sunday, I am going to be in Cleveland, MS, to attend the \ninvestiture of my college roommate, one of the finest men I have ever \nknown in my life. He was nominated by President Clinton to be a Federal \njudge. He is going to be the North Mississippi Federal judge.\n  I guess on paper he is a Democrat, but aside from that, he is a great \nguy and will make a wonderful, ethical judge. But when I attend this \nmeeting, I am going to be basically saying: My good friend, Judge \nPepper, goodbye. I hope to see you again some day. You are going to the \nFederal bench.\n  I am glad he is going there. He is going to be a credit. But let me \ntell you, out there, there are not a lot of people saying: Give us more \nFederal judges. They just are not. For us to be pontificating about \nthis and gnashing, how unfair, this appointment of more Federal judges, \nit is just not there.\n  I am willing to do my job. I know they deal with a lot of important \nissues. I know there is a problem when we don't have a full complement. \nSome people might argue that we have plenty of Federal judges to do the \njob. I hope they will do that. I am saying to you, I am trying to help \nmove this thing along, but getting more Federal judges is not what I \ncame here to do.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the distinguished leader will yield on that point, I \nbelieve, of course, he is gaining himself a higher place in Heaven for \nthe suffering he goes through with this--probably not made up by the \noffice and the limo in the meantime. In Heaven, he will finally have \nhis reward, I am sure.\n  Mr. LOTT. I look forward to that great day.\n  Mr. LEAHY. When you get there, you will be able to tell St. Peter \nthat one of the trials you had on Earth was the senior Senator from \nVermont, who is your friend, as you know. We have been friends for many \nyears.\n  On the number of Federal judges, though, I do get letters from \nlawyers all over the country, and I believe even from the State of \nMississippi, from their trial bar, in several cases where, having paid \nall kinds of taxes, they now have to hire arbitrators to hear the cases \nbecause the dockets are too full. I am hearing from Federal prosecutors \nall over this country this is a matter of some concern, that because of \nthe speedy trial rules under the Constitution and practice, they are \nconcerned about their cases. There aren't enough judges to try them. So \nthere are some areas where we do have some serious problems. We know \nthat the Chief Justice of the United States has criticized the lack of \nenough judges to do the work of the courts and the time it takes to get \nvacancies filled.\n  We have two judges we could voice vote right now--there would be no \nobjection--James Lorenz and Victor Marrero, Calendar Nos. 213 and 214.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to move those. If we can get an agreement \non Stewart, they will be moved immediately.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What I would suggest is this: Obviously, the distinguished \nleader can file cloture on any motion at any time. I think that is \nappropriate, and whoever is the majority leader should always have that \nright. I have always supported that. Such a vote would not ripen, it is \nmy understanding, until Tuesday evening.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Tuesday at 5:30. That would give you and us time to talk \nmore tonight, or Tuesday.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Republicans will probably be having a caucus, as we \nwill be, in the normal course of business. Might I suggest to the \nleader that might be the thing to do. We would have an objection today, \nhe can file the cloture today if he chooses, and still Senator Hatch \nand I will continue our discussions. He and the distinguished \nDemocratic leader would continue theirs. I think there have been a \nnumber of times when the 4 of us, in 5 minutes off the floor, have \naccomplished more than we could in 5 hours on the floor. Then we can \nsee where we are at that time. We may be in a situation where having \nprayed about it over the weekend and thought about it--and you have had \nthe great feeling of being in Cleveland, and I didn't know there was a \nCleveland, Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. They don't have a professional football team, but they have \nan excellent college team, Delta State University.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have been in Mississippi a number of times. I have gone \ndown with your distinguished colleague, Senator Cochran, in different \nhearings. I have always enjoyed it. I have always eaten too much, and I \nhave always felt I understood what Southern hospitality means. I tried \nto reciprocate with his colleague on a visit to Vermont, and it dropped \nto 30 below zero. He didn't think it was very good reciprocation, so he \ncame back in the summertime.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to make one last point.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the leader this. I have listened to \nthe two\n\n[[Page S11041]]\n\nof you in your dialog. I have a different idea. I think that and I \nrespectfully submit this--we would be better off if you did not file \nyour motion for cloture. You can do that next week. I feel that, \nknowing the minority as well as I do, we would be better off. If things \ndon't work out by Tuesday at this time, you can still file your motion \nto invoke cloture.\n  I don't think we should be filing motions to invoke cloture on these \njudges. I don't think we need to do that. Give us a little time to work \nthis out. I respectfully submit to my dear friend that I think we would \nbe making a mistake procedurally. I have only been to Mississippi once, \nand that was when I went to Senator John Stennis' funeral, a man who I \nhad the pleasure of serving with years ago. I had great respect for \nhim. I feel that, in the Stennis way of doing business, we need to do a \nlittle more deliberating and less pushing people's backs to the wall. I \nfeel this motion would be the wrong thing.\n  As I say, I have spoken to the Senator from Utah. I know how badly he \nwants this judge to be approved. I think you have gone some way this \nevening in saying that you have mentioned four people that I think we \ncan approve pretty quickly.\n  Mr. LOTT. Possibly a fifth one. I would have to get clearance on it.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend--and I am not begging; I don't want to \ndo that--I think we would all be better off if the cloture motion were \nnot filed today. If you need to do it, do it Tuesday. That is going to \nmove along, and we are going to be around here next week and the week \nafter. I think we would be better off. Let's not get into a motion to \ninvoke cloture on judges. The big problem is with Ted Stewart from \nUtah. Let's see if we can work through that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is there any possibility that we can get a time agreement \non Stewart? I know Senators would like to make themselves heard, \nperhaps, on that nomination, or perhaps as it relates to other \nnominees. I have no desire to cut Senators off at will. Maybe the time \nI asked for was too short, with 2 hours for Senator Leahy and only 30 \nminutes for Senator Hatch, where the nominee is from. We can go to 4 \nhours on each side.\n  Mr. REID. I respectfully submit that I don't think the time is the \nissue. I think we have to work our way through a little bit of the \npolitics of this judicial appointment stuff. In my opinion, I think we \ncould do it much easier if there weren't that cloture motion filed.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I have a couple of problems: One, Senator Hatch, I think, \nfeels that I embarked upon a strategy that has disadvantaged him \nbecause I started moving judges--6 of them. And now 2 more are ready to \ngo. Then when we got to the ninth one, his judge, we are told, no. Even \nthough you have 8 judges nominated by Democrats, we have one now that \nis supported by Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nand you can't do that unless we get an agreement to move 5 other \njudges.\n  So I understand what you are saying. I really prefer not to do this. \nBut the problem I have now is that I told Senators who have now left \nthat I would do this, and I believe we have told Senators we will have \ntwo votes at 5:30 Tuesday. This is one of them. That is my problem. \nAnother problem is time. We are getting to the end of the fiscal year. \nIf we don't do this now and get closure on Judge Stewart, with next \nweek being a four-day week--assuming we can get the Senators to work 4 \ndays--and with five the next week, which are the last 2 weeks of the \nfiscal year, we are not going to be able to get through any of these \njudges until October. I hope that we can go ahead and resolve the \nStewart matter. I could vitiate the request, and then we could move \nfive judges, I hope.\n  Mr. REID. The problem that I have, though--and you already touched \nupon it--we know where the votes are on this issue. We don't need to \nhave a Federal judge decided on less than a majority vote. So why can't \nwe just wait and see if we can work this out? I think it would be \nbetter. I think we are going to be forced into a vote here.\n  Mr. LOTT. Can you give me a commitment that we will get a vote next \nweek on Judge Stewart?\n  Mr. REID. Well, the only problem with that is, if we can't work \nthings out, then you will be stuck with the cloture motion. I think it \nwould be better if that were done after we really saw, based upon the \nfeelings that the Judiciary Committee chairman has on this----\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to pay a compliment to Senator Reid. As always, he \nis persistent, and he is trying to find a solution. That is the way we \nhave to work around here. I appreciate that attitude. I appreciate the \nway he has done his job since he has been the assistant Democratic \nleader and whip. So I weigh that carefully.\n  At this point, I think I will have to go forward with this. But I \nwill be here tomorrow. I will be here all day Tuesday. Senator Hatch \nand Senator Leahy will be working together. I will not let this happen \nwithout personal conversation with Senator Daschle. I talked with him \nbriefly about it this morning. He won't be here tomorrow, but he will \nbe back next Tuesday. It is a high holy day for the Jewish community. I \nbelieve he will be around during the day. We will try to work this out. \nI want to work this out. ``I ain't got a dog in this fight,'' except \nI'm trying to do my job. So I want to do it in such a way that \neverybody is satisfied that we are being fair. I don't think it is fair \nthat the nominees from California, New York, Utah, and Missouri all get \nballed up in this web. I hope we can avoid that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Touching on another subject--and obviously the two leaders \ncan determine what they want as far as the cloture point is concerned--\non the timing on Mr. Stewart's nomination, in my experience and my \njudgment, I say to my friend from Mississippi that: If we had worked \nout an arrangement to vote on these judicial nominees on the calendar, \nthe sort of thing we are talking about doing now, working out the \namount of time to be taken on Stewart would be the least of our \nworries; it would be a relatively short time because it would be all \npart of the same package.\n  We could spend more time talking about how much time there will be on \nthe floor than probably what there would be at that time. That is going \nto be the least of our problems. If we get some of these judges worked \nout and some idea of when other judges are coming up, that is going to \nbe the easy thing to do.\n  Mr. LOTT. I may have an idea or the staff, as quite often is the \ncase, may have come up with an idea.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have a constitutional impediment to the staff, I say to \nthe leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me explain what it is. Then I will explain what it \nmeans.\n  First of all, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, \nit be in order for the majority leader to file a cloture motion on the \npending nomination at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, and if that motion is \nfiled, that vote occur on Tuesday immediately following the 5:30 p.m. \nvote. Needless to say, this will give all Members until 5:30 on Tuesday \nto discuss the nomination.\n  What I am asking for is an opportunity to not file it, but by getting \nthis agreement, it will be the same as if I had filed it. If we get an \nagreement, no problem. If we don't, then there will be a vote at 5:30.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is OK with me.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has a previous unanimous consent \nrequest. Does he withdraw that?\n  Mr. LOTT. I do, and I propound this one which I just read, and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid and Senator Leahy very \nmuch for their cooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11041-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11041-S11042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, on August 14, I landed in Amsterdam, \nHolland, and proceeded directly to the War Crimes Tribunal in The \nHague. There, I met with a team of the leading prosecutors/\ninvestigators at the Tribunal including John Ralston, Bob Reid, Graham \nBlewitt, and J. Clint Williamson. Ralston, Reid, and Blewitt are all \nAustralians who got their start together hunting Nazis who had \nimmigrated to Australia following World War II. They have been at War \nCrimes Tribunal since 1994. Williamson is an American who used to work \nfor the Department of Justice.\n  Recently the prosecutors obtained a very important indictment against \nfive individuals: Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the President \nof Serbia, the Serbian Interior Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister of \nYugoslavia, and the Chief of Staff of the Yugoslav Army. They have been \ncharged with crimes against humanity in the deportation of more than \n700,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and mass murder. Their theory of \nprosecution is that the atrocities in Kosovo were so systematic and \nwidespread that they must have been orchestrated at the highest levels \nof the Yugoslav/Serbian government and military.\n  No arrests in connection with this indictment have been made to date. \nWhen I asked about the prospects of detaining Milosevic and bringing \nhim to trial, my hosts told me that this will happen only when a new \ngovernment comes to power in Yugoslavia. It is possible that such a \ngovernment may quickly find that Milosevic is too great a liability and \nhand him over.\n  I also asked about the prospects of capturing another indicted war \ncriminal, Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the \nfighting in Bosnia. Karadzic is still in Bosnia and to date remains at \nlarge. Karadzic is believed to be in the French sector of Bosnia, and \nthe French have shown no interest in arresting him. Unfortunately, the \nUnited States has also shown a lack of resolve on this issue. I believe \nthat capturing Karadic and trying him before the War Crimes Tribunal \nwould send a powerful signal to leaders around the world that they are \nnot immune from prosecution, and that prosecution will not be limited \nmerely to the troops on the ground. Had Karadzic been in custody in the \nHague awaiting or standing trial, one wonders whether Milosevic would \nhave acted as brazenly as he did in Kosovo.\n  The war crimes team all stressed that there was a great deal of work \nto do collecting evidence of the war crimes in Kosovo and that this \nwork needed to be done prior to October, when winter weather would \nprevent further excavations until the Spring. They also told me that \nthe work was particularly challenging because the Serbs had gone to \ngreat lengths to hide their crimes, including burning the bodies of \ntheir victims, bulldozing houses in which mass murders took place, and \ndispersing bodies from mass graves.\n  In early summer, the FBI sent a team of forensic experts to help \ncollect evidence of war crimes in Kosovo, and the FBI was preparing to \nsend a second team at the end of August. I had helped to get funding \nfor these FBI missions, and was interested in hearing about what the \nFBI was doing. The team at the War Crimes Tribunal told me that the FBI \nhad been sent to work at a number of massacre sights where most of the \nevidence had been destroyed, usually by burning the victims' corpses. \nDespite the difficulties, the FBI was able to find evidence, including \nbone fragments, blood stains, shell castings, and petrol cans used to \nstart the fires. They have exhumed victim bodies and conducted \nautopsies. This evidence will prove invaluable when the individuals \nunder indictment are finally brought to trial.\n  I asked my hosts if they needed any additional resources. Mr. Blewitt \ntold me that resources continued to be a problem--the tribunal was \ncurrently borrowing against other areas of its budget in order to fund \nits Kosovo operations and would run out of money by early October. He \nmentioned that the $9 million dollars recently pledged by President \nClinton would carry them through the end of 1999.\n  After leaving the War Crimes Tribunal, we proceeded to meet with \nGeneral Wesley Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces. \nGeneral Clark ran our war effort in Kosovo and continues to manage the \nday-to-day operations there, and is a valuable source of information \nabout the situation on the ground.\n  I asked the General about the odds of capturing Milosevic and \nbringing him to trial. The General stated that he was optimistic that \none day Milosevic and the others would indeed be captured and brought \nto justice. I also asked him about the chances of capturing Karadzic. \nHe mentioned that Karadzic is in hiding, surrounded by guards, and goes \nto great lengths to avoid being located such as avoiding the use of \ncell phones. Still, I got the impression that if NATO were truly \ndetermined to capture him, they could do so.\n  I also asked General Clark about the Apache helicopters that were \nsent to Kosovo with much fanfare but were never used. He told me that \nthe Pentagon had conducted a risk/benefit analysis and decided that the \nrisk of losing one of these expensive helicopters outweighed the \nbenefit that could be derived by their use. I expressed my view that \nthere is no point in having all of this high priced machinery unless it \nis going to be used.\n  Our next stop was Kiev, the capitol of Ukraine. We arrived in Ukraine \nshortly before the celebration of its 8th Independence Day. During this \nshort period, Ukraine has become an important country for U.S. foreign \npolicy. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was left \nwith one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world. Our work with \nUkraine has eliminated all of these nuclear weapons. In addition, \nUkraine is a young country making the difficult transition from \ntotalitarian rule to democracy and from a planned economy to a market \neconomy. If Ukraine succeeds, it can lead the way for Russia and other \nformer Soviet Republics to follow. If Ukraine fails, it could revert to \ncommunism and possibly join Russia and others in a union that would \nonce again seek to pursue global power through militarism. The United \nStates has a lot at stake here.\n  During my stay in Ukraine, I met with the top leadership of the \ncountry including President Leonid Kuchma, Prime Minister Valeriy \nPustovoitenko, Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Chalyi, and Secretary \nVolodymyr Horbulyn, who is the head of the National Security and \nDefense Council. These meetings provided valuable information on the \nchallenges facing Ukraine and the role the United States can play to \nhelp this country on the difficult path to democracy and free markets.\n  President Kuchma is up for reelection this October. He is generally \nconsidered to be a reformer and a man who will continue down the path \ntowards democracy and free markets. His strongest opponents are the \nCommunists and the Socialists, who have opposed Kuchma's market \nreforms.\n  I was curious to know what my hosts thought would be the major issues \nin the campaign. Both President Kuchma\n\n[[Page S11043]]\n\nand Prime Minister Pustovoitenko agreed that one of the most important \nissues in the campaign would be unpaid pensions and government \nsalaries. The government has missed a number of monthly payments of \npensions and salaries this year and last. Naturally, people owed money \nare likely to vote for the party they believe is most likely to pay it \nto them.\n  Beyond the specific issue of back pay, the economy in general will \nalso play a pivotal role in the campaign. My hosts told me that they \nfelt threatened on economic issues, because there are many who believe \nthat their lives were better under Communism and would therefore \nsupport the Communists. The Prime Minister noted that as an opposition \nparty, the Communists have been criticizing President Kuchma's economic \nreforms and have blocked more meaningful reform. President Kuchma \nagreed that it is possible, although unlikely, that the Communists \ncould come to power and return the country to totalitarian rule.\n  Although Kuchma is considered to be a reformer, there have been \ncomplaints that the pace of reform is too slow and that his initiatives \nhave been too modest. When asked about the pace of reform, my hosts put \nthe blame largely on the shoulders of the left wing parties. They told \nme that the Communists, Socialists and some others are blocking the \nmost important reform legislation his government has introduced. They \nsuggested that the pace of reform would pick up after the election, \nprovided President Kuchma wins.\n  Prime Minister Pustovoitenko confirmed that Ukraine has eliminated \nall of the nuclear arms in the substantial arsenal it inherited from \nthe Soviet Union. Today, of course, countries are competing in the most \naggressive way to acquire nuclear arms. Being a member of the nuclear \nclub gives a country great prestige and bargaining power in the world. \nIt is for this reason that I find it truly remarkable that Ukraine had \nvoluntarily given up its nuclear arsenal.\n  I asked my hosts why they would agree to do this voluntarily. \nPresident Kuchma mentioned that after the disaster at the Chernobyl \nnuclear reactor, which is in Ukraine, Ukrainians understand better than \nmost people the danger posed by nuclear power and simply did not want \nthem. Deputy Foreign Minister Chalyi also gave me an interesting \nanswer. He told me that he and others decided that the best development \nmodel for Ukraine to follow was Japan, which disarmed and focused on \nbuilding its economy. Nuclear arms do not bring prosperity.\n  Given Ukraine's voluntary disarmament, I was interested to know what \nmy hosts thought about the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and \nthe failure of the U.S. Senate to ratify this treaty. All of the \ngovernment officials I spoke with felt very strongly that the Test Ban \nTreaty was an extremely important way to seek to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear arms and slow this dangerous arms race. \nLikewise, they all agreed that the failure of the U.S. to ratify this \nTreaty was a serious impediment to the goal of disarmament. As \nPresident Kuchma noted, ratifying the Treaty gives a country the moral \nright to pressure others to stop their testing and construction of \nnuclear arms. Prime Minister Pustovoitenko sounded a similar note when \nhe said that the United States must set an example for the world when \nit comes to disarmament and would be in much stronger position to \npressure other countries to stop their tests once they formally \ncommitted to stopping their own.\n  Deputy Foreign Minister Chalyi told me a very interesting story in \nresponse to my question about the Test Ban Treaty. Mr. Chalyi serves as \nthe Chairman of the South Asia Taskforce, a group of Asian nations and \ntheir trading partners including China, Japan, Australia, Argentina and \nBrazil. He told me that during a visit to Pakistan, he urged his \nPakistani counterparts to ratify the Treaty. A Pakistani official \nresponded that he did not see why Pakistan should have to ratify the \nTreaty when the Americans had not.\n\n  While in Ukraine, I also had a meeting with representatives of the \nUkrainian Jewish Community. Of the 6 million Jews killed in the \nHolocaust, 1.7 million came from Ukraine. After the War, the Holocaust, \nand continuing emigration, the Ukrainian Jewish community now numbers \napproximately 500,000. I feel special concern for this community since \nboth of my parents were Ukrainian Jews.\n  I found these Jewish leaders to be upbeat, even optimistic, about the \nfuture of their community. They told me that since the break-up of the \nSoviet Union, the Jewish community has begun to develop rapidly. Rabbis \nare coming to the country, and many Jewish schools and camps are \nopening. They told me that there is religious freedom and opportunities \nfor Jews in every sector of society.\n  During the Communist era, I was told, Ukraine was one of the most \nanti-Semitic republics in the Soviet Union. No Jew could hope to be a \nleader in politics or industry. In contrast, one of the Jewish leaders \nwe met with was a successful businessman and an advisor to President \nKuchma. I was informed that a former Prime Minister of Ukraine was \nJewish. Another Rabbi from the Lubavitcher Hasidic movement told me \nthat he has been walking back and forth to synagogue in his town for \ntwo years without any incident. This is certainly different from the \ndays when the Cossacks used to ride up and down the streets of my \nfather's town looking for Jews to harass.\n  The only complaint I heard was on the issue of communal property. \nJewish property confiscated by the Nazis became government property \nunder the Soviet Union. Now that Communism is gone, representatives of \nthe Jewish community would like to retrieve Jewish communal property--\ngraveyards, synagogues, schools, etc. Some feel that the government has \nnot moved fast enough on this issue. Others stressed that this is a \nsensitive topic affecting many ethnic groups in Ukraine and feared that \nto push too loudly for restitution would lead to anti-Semitism.\n  A number of the leaders I met with, including President Kuchma, asked \nthat the United States repeal the Jackson-Vanik Amendment as it applies \nto Ukraine. Jackson-Vanik was originally passed during the days of the \nIron Curtain as a way of pressuring the Soviet Union to allow Jews and \nother religious minorities to emigrate. Today in Ukraine, there are \nopen borders and free emigration. The Ukrainians don't understand why \nthey must come to the U.S. every year and ask for a waiver from the \nJackson-Vanik sanctions, and they believe that the repeal of the \namendment would have great symbolic importance.\n  When I met with the Jewish leaders, I asked them about this issue. \nThey agreed that there is free emigration from Ukraine and seemed open \nto the idea of repealing Jackson-Vanik. Some raised a concern, however, \nthat today Jackson-Vanik applies to issues beyond emigration, such as \nthe restoration of communal property, and should therefore not be \nrepealed until the communal property issue is settled. The U.S. \nCongress should review this issue.\n  On my final night in Kiev, I met with a group of American businessmen \nliving in Ukraine to hear their view of the Ukrainian economy and \nbusiness climate. They all complained about the slow pace of reform, \ncorruption and inefficiency. They contrasted Ukraine with countries \nsuch as Poland, which have converted well to capitalism. Ukraine, they \nargue, is still a state run economy in many important ways. Private \nfirms have made progress in some consumer product fields such as \nbrewing beer and making chocolates. But in major industries, the \ngovernment-owned companies still dominate. Despite these problems, \nhowever, these Americans still believed in the potential of Ukraine and \nwere devoting themselves to the task of developing their economy.\n  From Ukraine we flew to Israel where we had a series of meetings \nrelating to the Mid-East peace process. Our first meeting was with \nIsraeli Prime Minister Barak. I found the Prime Minister to be \noptimistic about the prospects for peace in the Middle East. He stated \nthat Israel will resume implementation of the Wye Accords as soon as \npossible. When I asked him about the risks of peace making, Barak \nexplained to me why he is seeking to make peace so quickly. If Israel \ndoes not make peace now, he said, then he is certain that there will be \nanother war in the Middle East. While he is confident that Israel will \nwin this war and survive, he knows that Israel will never\n\n[[Page S11044]]\n\nwin an unconditional surrender from her Arab neighbors. So after Israel \nand her neighbors have buried their dead and repaired their cities, \nthey will sit down to negotiate exactly the same issues that are on the \ntable now. The Prime Minister believes that by making peace now he will \navoid this futile loss of life.\n  In addition, Barak believes that Israel is strong enough to take the \nrisks inherent in pursuing peace. He drew a strong contrast between his \nview of Israel in the Middle East and the view of his predecessor, \nBinyamin Netanyahu. He noted that Netanyahu once analogized the \nsituation of Israel in the Middle East to that of a carp in a tank of \nsharks. Barak rejected this analogy and stated that Israel is not a \ncarp, but a ``benign killer whale.'' His message was clear--Israel is \nstrong enough that it does not have to fear making territorial \nconcessions to its neighbors.\n  But the Prime Minister is also a realist and he stressed that Israel \nwill only enjoy peace so long as it is stronger than its neighbors. He \nstated, I believe correctly, that there is no second chance for the \nweak in the Middle East. During the peace process, Israel must stay \nmilitarily strong and even supplement her strength to compensate for \nlost military assets, namely land and strategic depth. Towards this \nend, he stressed the importance of U.S. aid and the need to continue to \nprovide the aid to help convince the Israeli public that the peace \nprocess will not jeopardize Israel's security.\n  Under the Wye River accords, the U.S. pledged to provide $1.2 billion \nin aid to Israel beyond the almost $3 billion it currently receives in \nannual economic and military assistance. This $1.2 billion is meant to \npay for the costs of moving two military bases that are currently \nlocated in territory that will be handed over to the Palestinians under \nWye. The money will also pay for additional missile defense deployments \nand research.\n  I told the Prime Minister that while there is support in Congress for \nsuch aid, there will be difficulties in procuring it. Because of the \ncaps established under the '97 Budget Act, there is great difficulty in \nmeeting existing requirements in the FY 2000 budget. Nevertheless, I \ntold the Prime Minister that I believed the U.S. would ultimately \nprovide the promised funds to implement the Wye Accord.\n  After leaving Prime Minister Barak's office, we drove directly to \nRamallah, a city in the West Bank which is under the control of the \nPalestinian Authority. There we met with Chairman Yasser Arafat and a \nnumber of his deputies. Mr. Arafat had some complaints about the pace \nof negotiations with Israel, but he was still optimistic that there \nwould be progress.\n  Some of Arafat's deputes seemed more pessimistic. Towards the end of \nmy talk with Arafat, Saeb Erakat entered the room. Mr. Erakat is the \nPalestinians' chief negotiator with the Israelis over the terms for \nresuming implementation of the Wye accord, and he had just returned \nfrom a negotiating session with the Israelis. I asked Mr. Erakat how \nthe negotiations went. He refused to go into details, but was clearly \nfrustrated with the lack of progress. He complained that the Israeli \nsettlers had too much influence and were refusing to compromise. The \nnext day the papers reported that the Israeli-Palestinian talks had \nreached and impasse over the release of Palestinian prisoners in \nIsraeli jails.\n  Under the Wye Accords, the U.S. agreed to provide $400 million in aid \nto the Palestinians. I asked Arafat how he would use this money. He \ntold me that it would go towards a variety of projects, including \nbuilding a road from Jenin to Nablus, building a high tech industrial \nzone, and funding programs to help establish the rule of law in the \nPalestinian Authority territories.\n  I also asked Chairman Arafat about Syria and the possibility that \nSyria would cease to harbor Palestinian groups still pursing terrorism \nagainst Israel. Mr. Arafat told me that some of these groups may \nabandon terrorism on their own initiative. He told me that he is \nconducting negotiations with two reductionist groups--George Habash's \nPoplar Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Nayef Hawatmeh's \nDemocratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine about the terms for \nending hostilities against Israel and entering the political arena. If \nthese negotiations succeed, the only major Palestinian groups opposed \nto peace with Israel will be the fundamentalist groups such as Hamas \nand Islamic Jihad.\n  Despite rumors about his poor health and the lip tremors that have \nbeen evident for some time, Mr. Arafat met me at his office at 8:30 in \nthe evening. When our meeting ended at 9:40 he walked me out the door \nand then, I'm sure, returned to work.\n  The next morning we drove to Tel Aviv for a meeting with Foreign \nMinister David Levy. Mr. Levy was born in Morocco and moved to Israel \nin his teens. He speaks French, Arabic and Hebrew, but no English, so \nwe spoke with the assistance of a translator. Mr. Levy reiterated the \nPrime Minister's commitment to quickly resume implementation of the Wye \nAccords. On Syria, he sounded a less optimistic note than Prime \nMinister Barak had. He stated that Israel cannot accept Syria's \nprecondition for resuming negotiations that Israel accept Syria' \ninterpretation of where negotiations with Prime Minister Rabin left \noff. Foreign Minister Levy stressed that Barak would be a tougher \nnegotiator.\n  After these meetings with Barak and Levy, I though it would be \nworthwhile to hear from someone who is opposed to the peace process \nthey are pursing. Perhaps no Israeli politician has been more \nconsistent in his opposition to territorial concessions that former \nPrime Minister Yitzhark Shamir. So we dropped by Mr. Shamir's office in \nTel Aviv for a visit. True to form, Mr. Shamir dismissed Oslo and Wye \nas dangerous concessions by Israel to her implacable enemies. He said \nthat the Palestinians are real enemies of the State of Israel and that \nSyria will never be able to change. Shamir added that he would like to \nsee 5 million more Jews move to Israel, but that there would be no room \nfor such an expansion if the proposed territorial concessions take \nplace.\n  After finishing our business in Jerusalem, we drove to Amman for a \nbrief stay in the Jordanian capitol. Each time I visit Amman, I notice \nthat the city has grown and developed substantially since my last \nvisit.\n  We met with he new King of Jordan, King Abdullah, at his palace. I \nexpress my  condolences to the King on the loss of his father, King \nHussein. King Hussein was truly a valuable force for peace in the \nMiddle East, and I am hopeful that King Abdullah will fill the void his \nfather's death left behind.\n\n  The King was upbeat about the situation in the Middle East. He \nbelieved that Ehud Barak was sincere about pursuing peace and making \nthe sacrifices it entailed. He was also optimistic that President Assad \nwould be flexible about negotiating with Israel and would relent on its \ninsistence that the peace talks pick up exactly where he believes they \nleft off with Rabin. He told me that Syria is prepared to accept all of \nIsrael's requests regarding security arrangements in exchange for the \nGolan.\n  I also asked the King about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the \nfailure of the U.S. to ratify it. He expressed his view that this was \nan important treaty for the safety of the world and told me that he \nhoped that the United States would ratify it.\n  From Amman we flew to Alexandria, Egypt, a teeming city on Egypt's \nMediterranean Coast. Egypt's leaders often spend the hot summer months \nby the sea in Alexandria. When I met with President Mubarak in \nWashington this past June, he told me that he, too, would be in \nAlexandria for much of the summer.\n  President Mubarak shared the optimism of the other leaders I met that \nthe Israeli-Palestinian track was going in the right direction. He was \nless sanguine about the Israel-Syria track, but felt that progress with \nthe Palestinians would help bring the Syrians along. He suggested that \nSyria is looking to receive more from the Israelis than the Egyptians \nreceived in their peace treaty to justify the 20-year delay in making \npeace.\n  President Mubarak also stressed that it is essential that Israel and \nthe Palestinians reach a peace agreement while Yasser Arafat is still \nalive. Mubarak fears, for good reason, that after Arafat's death there \nwill be a power struggle among various Palestinian\n\n[[Page S11045]]\n\nfactions for control of the Palestinian Authority, and that terrorism \nagainst Israel will become a feature of this competition.\n  I asked Mubarak about reports that he wanted to hold a summit on \nterrorism. He told me that he does intend to hold such a summit, and \nthat he would like the focus of this summit to be terrorism and weapons \nof mass destruction. I think this is an excellent idea and encouraged \nPresident Mubarak to proceed with his plans.\n  I asked the President his opinion of the situation in Iran and what \nthe U.S. policy towards Iran should be. Mubarak was not optimistic that \nIran would abandon its extremism any time soon. He told me that the \nIranians have named a street in Teheran after the man who assassinated \nPresident Sadat. When President Mubarak complained about this, the \nIranians placed a large mural of the assassin above the street that \nbears his name.\n  I next asked President Mubarak when he would warm up his relations \nwith Israel. Mubarak blamed the cold peace with Israel on Prime \nMinister Netanyahu. He told me that prior to Netanyahu, things were \nwarming up and economic cooperation was beginning. When I asked him if \nEgypt's relations with Israel would warm up now that Netanyahu was out \nof office, he responded that this would ``take time.'' I reminded \nPresident Mubarak that a lot of time has already passed since Egypt and \nIsrael signed their peace treaty.\n  From Alexandria we flew to Skopje, Macedonia, where we met \nrepresentatives of the U.S. army for a one-day tour of neighboring \nKosovo. We were flown by helicopter from Skopje to Prishtina, the major \ncity in Kosovo. On the way, we flew over a number of Kosovar villages \nand towns. In almost every village, we saw the burnt-out remains of \nhouses that once belonged to the Kosovor Albanians.\n  In Prishtina, we met with Bernard Kouchner, the UN's top official in \nKosovor. Mr. Kouchner told us that he has witnessed some positive \ndevelopments since coming to Kosovor. Most importantly, he noted that \nthe large majority of Albanians who fled Kosovor during the war have \nalready returned home. In addition, the Kosovo Liberation Army appears \nwilling to accept the transition from paramilitary force to civil \nservice. KLA members will be given approximately 2,500 places in the \nUN-sponsored Kosovor police force.\n  The return of the Kosovor Albanians to Kosovor is creating challenges \nfor the UN. Mr. Kouchner told us that 60,000 homes were destroyed in \nKosovor during the war, and that the UN would not be able to provide \nsufficient housing for all of the returnees prior to winter. The UN is \ngoing to have to rely on winterized tents and rehabilitating damaged \nhomes to make up for the shortfall.\n  Mr. Kouchner told us that the major challenge facing the UN in Kosovo \nis protecting the Serbian community from Albanian retribution attacks. \nWhile he felt he was making some progress in this area, Mr. Kouchner \nnoted that there were still a number of attacks taking place on a daily \nbasis, including assault, arson, and murder.\n  I asked Mr. Kouchner how long the UN would have to stay in Kosovor. \nHe estimated that it would take ``several years'' until the UN could \nleave.\n  From Prishtina we flew by helicopter to Camp Bondsteel, the base for \nthe U.S. contingent in NATO's Kosovo Force. There we were briefed by \nBrigadier General Peterson and his staff on the Army's mission in \nKosovo. Although U.S. forces had only been in the country for 63 days, \nwe saw a small city coming to life with rows of tents and some more \npermanent structures being built.\n\n  Although the war may be over, our forces still face great danger in \nKosovo. General Peterson told us that up until 6 nights prior to our \nvisit, U.S. forces had taken hostile fire every night since their \narrival, mostly in the form of sniper and mortar fire at U.S. \npositions. Although there have been no fatalities from these attacks, \nsome U.S. soldiers have been injured.\n  Our briefers confirmed that almost all of the Kosovar Albanians who \nleft the U.S. sector during the fighting have since returned. Echoing \nwhat the UN's Kouchner told us, the soldiers said that one of the major \nproblems they are now confronting is protecting the Serb population \nfrom retribution attacks by Albanians. Since some Albanians have sought \nto prevent the Serbs from harvesting their crops by targeting Serbian \nfarmers, the U.S. must provide protection to Serbian farmers in the \nfields.\n  I asked the soldiers how long they thought the U.S. Army would need \nto be in Kosovo. They refused to hazard a guess. They pointed out that \nthe region is less complex than Bosnia, since there are only two \nnationalities fighting each other in Kosovo, as opposed to three in \nBosnia. On the other hand, they told me that by time the U.S. entered \nBosnia, the Bosnians were exhausted from fighting and ready to lay down \ntheir arms. It is not clear that the parties in Kosovo have exhausted \ntheir will to fight.\n  Next we flew to the Kosovar village of Vlastica to view the sight of \na massacre that took place during the war. As we entered the village, a \nlarge crowd of Albanian villagers came out to greet us. These people \nwere clearly grateful for what the U.S. had done for them, and they \nwere excited to hear that we wanted to help them rebuild and wanted to \nbring the war criminals to justice.\n  As we walked through the village, we passed a number of burned-out \nhouses. Even the village mosque had been burned. We stopped at the \ncharred remains of a home where 13 Albanians had been killed in one \nnight. There, we met a 13-year-old girl named Vlora Shaboni. Vlora used \nto live in the house with her family, and she was at home the night the \nSerb soldiers came. She told us that the Serbs broke down the door and \nordered everyone in the house to line up with their hands above their \nheads. Then they shot everyone with automatic weapons. To hide the \nevidence of this massacre, the Serbs set the house on fire and \nbulldozed the remains.\n  That night, Vlora saw the Serbs kill her mother and her brother. \nVlora herself was shot in her face and the bullet lodged in her jaw, \nbut she remained conscious and was able to escape before the house \nburned down. Vlora told me that she did not know her attackers but that \nshe would be able to recognize them if she ever saw them again.\n  Vlora told her story with an anxious tremble in her voice and the \nfrightened, downcast eyes. I don't know where she found the strength to \ntalk about what happened that night at all.\n  The burnt remains of the victims of this massacre were left in the \nhouse, and have been recovered by a Canadian forensic team. That \nevidence, together with the statements of Vlora and others, will help \nthe War Crimes prosecutors in The Hague prove their theory that \nSerbia's leaders orchestrated the systematic and widespread destruction \nof Albanian life in Kosovo.\n  From Skopje we flew to Naples, Italy, to visit the headquarters of \nAllied Forces Southern Europe, or ``AFSouth,'' which is NATO's southern \ncommand. There we were briefed by Lieutenant General Jack Nix, Jr., the \nChief of Staff of AFSouth, and members of his staff. AFSouth is \nresponsible for the region surrounding the Mediterranean and Black \nSeas. This region includes a number of hot spots such as the Middle \nEast and the Balkans. AFSouth has been responsible for operations in \nboth Bosnia and Kosovo.\n  We were briefed on the details of the air war in Kosovo. The allied \nbombing campaign was effective in Kosovo, and only 12% of bombing \ntargets escaped without some damage. Still, our hosts agreed that there \nwere problems with the air campaign. Most importantly, they noted that \nour forces were largely incapable of mounting the air campaign during \nbad weather. This experience convinced these soldiers that the U.S. \nmust develop all-weather munitions that will free our forces from these \nweather-related limitations.\n  I asked if any broader military lessons could be learned from the \nKosovo campaign. I noted that during the debate over whether to \nauthorize the air campaign, some military experts had argued that a war \ncan never be won by air power alone. Did Kosovo prove these experts \nwrong? My hosts responded that, in fact, our forces did not win in \nKosovo by air power alone. Ground forces played a pivotal role in the \nconflict--they just weren't NATO ground forces. Towards the end of the \nconflict, the Kosovo Liberation Army began major ground operations \nagainst\n\n[[Page S11046]]\n\nSerbian positions. These operations pinned down large numbers of Serb \ntroops in concentrated groups. These concentrations made the Serbian \nforces vulnerable to Allied air attacks for the first time in the war, \nand they sustained large numbers of casualties during this period. Had \nthe KLA not undertaken this campaign, Serbian forces would have \nremained spread out and largely invulnerable to air attack.\n  During the air campaign, AFSouth was in charge of Operation Allied \nHarbor, which provided shelter to the hundreds of thousands of refugees \nwho fled Kosovo. My hosts told me that during the height of the crisis, \nAFSouth actually exhausted the world's supply of tents in its effort to \nprovide shelter for all the refugees. Now AFSouth is overseeing the \nrepatriation of the Kosovar refugees to Kosovo. Our briefers confirmed \nwhat we heard in Kosovo--that most of the Kosovar Albanians who fled \nKosovo during the war have already returned home. All of the refugees \ncamps in Albania have been shut down. Among the small percentage of \nrefugees who have not returned to Kosovo are the 20,000 who were \nbrought to the United States and will most likely choose to remain \nhere.\n  On August 26, I returned from Rome to Philadelphia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11046-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE NEED FOR MEDICARE COVERAGE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in the coming weeks, the Finance \nCommittee will begin consideration of legislation to reform the \nMedicare program. While I am not a member of that Committee, I would \nlike to urge my colleagues to take this opportunity to address one of \nthe most widespread problems facing senior citizens today--the lack of \nprescription drug coverage under the Medicare program.\n  Providing access to prescription medication is essential to ensuring \nour older Americans receive the health care they need. Today more than \never, medical treatment is focused on the use of drug therapies. \nPrescription drugs are an effective substitute for more expensive care \nor surgery, and they are the only method of treatment for many \ndiseases.\n  Medicare beneficiaries are particularly reliant on prescription \nmedication. Nearly 77 percent of seniors take a prescription drug on a \nregular basis. Consequently, although seniors make up only 14 percent \nof the country's population, they consume about 30 percent of the \nprescription drugs sold. However, the Medicare program, the national \nprogram established to provide seniors with vital health care services, \ngenerally does not cover prescription drug costs.\n  Medicare beneficiaries can obtain some coverage for drugs by joining \nMedicare HMOs. However, these HMOs are not available in many parts of \nthe country, particularly in the rural areas. As we have learned in \nMaryland, where 14 of our rural counties will no longer be served by \nany Medicare HMO as of next year, private companies cannot be relied \nupon to provide a benefit as crucial to the health of our older \nAmericans as prescription drug coverage. Drug coverage must be added as \na core element of our basic Medicare benefits package.\n  Beneficiaries may also purchase drug coverage through a Medigap \ninsurance policy. However, these plans are extremely expensive and \ngenerally provide inadequate coverage. In addition, for most Medigap \nplans, the premiums substantially increase with age. Thus, just as \nbeneficiaries need drug coverage the most and are least able to afford \nit, this drug coverage is priced out of reach. This cost burden \nparticularly affects women who make up 73 percent of people over age \n85.\n  Those with access to employer-sponsored retiree health plans do \ngenerally receive adequate drug coverage. However, only about one \nquarter of Medicare beneficiaries have access to such plans. Thus, \nalthough most beneficiaries have access to some assistance, only a \nlucky few have access to supplemental coverage that offers a \nsubstantial drug benefit. Moreover, at least 13 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries have absolutely no prescription drug coverage.\n  To make matters worse, the cost of prescription drugs has been rising \ndramatically over the past few years. Pharmaceutical companies claim \nthat today's higher drug prices reflect the growing cost of research \nand development. However, recent increases in drug prices have also \nresulted in large part from the enormous investment the industry has \nmade in advertising directly to the public.\n\n  Moreover, recent studies have shown that seniors who buy their own \nmedicine, because they do not belong to HMOs or have additional \ninsurance coverage, are paying twice as much on average as HMOs, \ninsurance companies, Medicaid, Federal health programs, and other bulk \npurchasers. Medicare beneficiaries are paying more as the \npharmaceutical industry is facing increasing pressures from cost-\nconscious health plans to sell them drugs at cheaper prices. In \naddition, the industry offers lower prices to veterans' programs and \nother Federal health programs because the price schedule for these \nprograms is fixed in law. Apparently, pharmaceutical companies are \nmaking up the revenues lost in bulk sales by charging exorbitant prices \nto individual buyers who lack negotiating power.\n  Despite these market pressures and increased research and development \ncosts, the prices being charged to seniors and other individual \npurchasers are hardly justified when financial reports show drug \ncompanies reaping enormous profits.\n  Many seniors live on fixed incomes, and a substantial number of them \ncannot afford to take the drugs their doctors prescribe. Many try to \nstretch their medicine out by skipping days or breaking pills in half. \nMany must choose between paying for food and paying for medicine.\n  In the context of the budget resolution debate, proposals were made \nto provide for the added cost of including prescription drug coverage \nin the Medicare program. I voted for an amendment to create a reserve \nfund of $101 billion over 10 years to cover the cost of Medicare reform \nincluding the addition of a prescription drug benefit. This provision \nwas included in the final version of the Senate budget resolution. \nHowever, legislation creating the drug benefit still must be enacted \nbefore coverage could be extended.\n  Helping senior citizens get the prescription drugs they need should \nbe one of our top priorities this session. Unfortunately, the Majority \nis more interested in enacting deep and unreasonable tax cuts that \nlargely benefit the wealthy. Just before the August recess, Congress \npassed the Majority's FY 2000 budget reconciliation bill. I voted \nagainst this bill because it would spend nearly all of the on-budget \nsurplus projected to accrue over the next ten years and would use none \nof this projected surplus to protect the Social Security System, to \nshore up Medicare, or to give senior citizens the prescription drug \nbenefit they so desperately need.\n  I am pleased that the Finance Committee will be focusing on Medicare \nreform, and I hope that the legislation they develop will establish a \nprescription drug benefit for our older Americans. Providing seniors \nwith drug coverage is essential to ensuring they receive quality health \ncare. I believe that access to quality health care is a basic human \nneed that in my view must be a fundamental right in a democratic \nsociety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11046-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11046-S11047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE ABCs OF GUN CONTROL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, students in Detroit are now back in school, \njust like their peers across the river in Windsor, Ontario. Each \nclassroom of students is going through virtually the same routine. They \nare writing about their summer vacations, obtaining textbooks, signing \nup for sports teams, and trying to memorize locker combinations. They \nare figuring out bus routes, testing new backpacks and worrying about \nthat third period teacher who assigns too much homework. There is just \none major difference between the students in Detroit and those in \nWindsor. Students in Detroit have to worry about guns in school.\n  In the United States, another classroom of children is killed by \nfirearms every two days. That doesn't mean that every few days, there \nis another Columbine mass murder. But statistics show that each day 13 \nchildren die from gunfire, and every two days, the equivalent of a \nclassroom of American children is struck by the tragedy of gun \nviolence. In Windsor, the Canadian town\n\n[[Page S11047]]\n\nthat borders Detroit, there were only 4 firearm homicides in 1997. In \nDetroit, for that same year, there were 354 firearm homicides. If the \npopulation of Detroit and Windsor were equal, the number of firearm \ndeaths would be nearly eighteen times higher in Detroit, a city less \nthan 1,000 yards away.\n  I'd like to include in the Record, an op-ed printed in the USA Today, \nshowing the differences between Canadian and American death rates \ninvolving firearms, and specifically the differences between Windsor \nand Detroit. If there's one thing Congress needs to study this school \nyear, it's how to rewrite the books and end the senseless slaughter of \nour school children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the USA Today, Aug. 30, 1999]\n\n                   Canada Shows Gun Restrictions Work\n\n                          (By Paul G. Labadie)\n\n       I was crossing the bridge that spans the one-half mile of \n     the Detroit River, a physical buffer separating Detroit from \n     Windsor, Ontario. The lineup at the Canadian Customs \n     checkpoint was unusually long. Inching forward, I finally \n     arrive at the custom agents' booth.\n       ``Citizenship?'' he asks.\n       ``United States,'' I reply.\n       ``Are there any firearms in the vehicle or on your \n     person?''\n       ``No.''\n       The customs agent shined a flashlight behind the seats as \n     he circled my car.\n       ``You're sure, no long guns, handguns, shotguns?''\n       ``No, none.''\n       ``No ammunition, bullets?''\n       ``None,'' I replied.\n       After a search of my trunk and a last looking over, he \n     waved me through.\n       I later found out the reason for the guard's concerns. \n     Someone had been caught with a gun in Windsor.\n       In Canada, that's all it takes. Its strict policies on gun \n     ownership are strongly enforced and get progressively \n     tougher, with even more stringent laws set to go into effect \n     in the year 2001. To argue against the results of their \n     efforts would be foolhardy, as the statistics are too \n     impressive.\n       In 1997, Detroit had 354 firearm homicides. Windsor, 1,000 \n     yards away, had only 4. Even taking into account the \n     population difference (Windsor's population is about one-\n     fifth of Detroit's) the comparison is still staggering. And \n     as of July, with Detroit opening its first casino, both \n     cities have legalized gambling. It will be elementary for \n     gamblers to calculate on which side of the river the better \n     odds lie of reaching your car in the parking lot unscathed.\n       To many Americans, the Canadian solution of handgun bans \n     and restrictions is, at the least, unpalatable and, at the \n     most, unconstitutional. Instead of dealing with the situation \n     directly and restricting civilian ownership of handguns, it \n     has become fashionable to pick the group of one's choice and \n     point the j'accuse-atory finger: the NRA, profiteering gun \n     manufacturers, absentee parents, genetically flawed children, \n     paranoid gun owners, lazy teachers, a fast and loose legal \n     system, and a society of victims. A multiple-choice public \n     indictment of blame, in which, since everyone is at fault, no \n     one is accountable.\n       The recent school shootings in Colorado and Georgia have \n     many laying blame on the media, pointing to television and \n     movies that glorify violence and gunplay, and music that is \n     designed to incite a riot of anger, resentment and sarcasm in \n     youths who are barely off their training wheels.\n       But if these mediums are to blame, then how do the youths \n     of Windsor have such immunity? They watch the same TV \n     stations, go to the same movies, listen to the same music as \n     Detroit youths, and yet they have a juvenile crime rate that \n     is a fraction of Detroit's. The lack of availability of \n     handguns certainly must play a role.\n       According to the Office of Juvenile Justice, in the States \n     between 1983 and 1993, juvenile homicides involving firearms \n     grew 182%. By contrast, only a 15% increase was seen among \n     homicides involving other types of weapons. In the U.S. from \n     1985 to 1995, 52% of all homicides involved handguns, \n     compared with 14% for Canada.\n       Canada's willingness to accept gun restrictions might rise \n     from its history. The settlement of Canada's ``Wild West'' \n     was far different from the settlement of the United States'. \n     In Canada, wherever settlers moved west, law and order was \n     already in place in the form of the Hudson's Bay Company. \n     From that spawned a culture that was more structured, less \n     creative, less violent and more likely to look to established \n     authorities for the settlement of disputes. In the United \n     States, however, as the settlers moved west they found \n     virtually no law existed, causing them to take matters into \n     their own hands. Thus a culture was spawned that was more \n     independent, more creative, more violent and more likely to \n     settle disputes themselves. And when an abundance of numerous \n     and easily available firearms are factored in, the results \n     can be bloody.\n       According to statistics, Canada in 1997 had 193 homicides \n     by firearms. The United States had 12,380. It is hard to \n     change a culture, but clearly the easy access to firearms has \n     to be addressed before we can expect any significant drop in \n     our homicide rate.\n       I used to be a member of the National Rifle Association. I \n     had the logo on my car, was skilled in the parry and thrust \n     of debates, and was saturated with persuasive data from this \n     organization, which covets statistics more than major league \n     baseball. I am not a member anymore, not because of any \n     complete, radical shift in beliefs, but more from a \n     weariness, a battle fatigue of being caught in the No Man's \n     Land among the immutable NRA, the anti-gun lobby and the \n     evening news, lately filled with terrified schoolchildren, \n     emergency-response crews and black-clad SWAT teams. Perhaps \n     the time has come to lose our ``Wild West'' roots and, at the \n     least, look to put the same restrictions on our guns that we \n     put on our automobiles and the family dog: licensing and \n     registration.\n       On my way back to Detroit, I stopped at the American \n     Customs booth. I faced a U.S. customs agent.\n       ``Citizenship?'' he asks.\n       ``United States,'' I reply.\n       He waves his hand to pass me on.\n       And I could not help but wonder whether the next students \n     getting diplomas would be the ``Class of 2000'' or the \n     ``Class of .357.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11047-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11047-S11048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FISCAL YEAR 2000 VA HEALTH CARE FUNDING\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I was informed of the concern of two \nNorth Dakotans who have distinguished themselves on behalf of veterans \nand their families regarding FY' 2000 funding for VA medical care-\nincoming National Commander of the Disabled Veterans of America Michael \nDobmeier of Grand Forks, North Dakota and Lorraine Frier, National \nPresident of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of \nWest Fargo. Let me take this opportunity to warmly congratulate Mike \nand Lorraine on their recent election to these important national \noffices, and to thank them for their many years of distinguished \nservice to our country.\n  Yesterday, the Senate VA-HUD Subcommittee reported an appropriations \nmeasure for the Department of Veterans Affairs that will provide $18.4 \nbillion for medical care for veterans. This figure is $1.1 billion \nabove the Administration's budget request of $17.3 billion earlier this \nyear, however, more than $600 below House appropriations recommendation \nof $1.7 billion for veterans medical care. The House action would \nincrease VA medical care funding to $19 billion.\n  While the House action does not meet the recommendations from the \nIndependent Budget, Fiscal Year 2000 of $20.2 billion, the funding \nlevel does come closer to ensuring that the VA may not have to curtail \nmedical services, close community-based clinics or layoff critical \nhealth care workers. Earlier this week, the Veterans of Foreign Wars \nwarned that unless the Senate approves funding close to the House level \nof $19 billion, ``scores of community-based clinics will have to be \nclosed, veterans will wait longer for care and some 8,500 health care \nworkers laid off''.\n   Mr. President, the crisis in funding for veterans medical care is \nshameful, particularly in light of the strong economic news that we \nhave received almost daily over the past few months. How can a nation \nthat has experienced such strong economic growth during the past few \nyears, witnessed stock market growth beyond all expectations and \ndiscussed how to spend the Federal surplus, deny veterans the very best \nhealth care. How can we justify making veterans wait for months for \nspecialized health care, closing outpatient clinics or reducing VA \nstaffing levels. In my state of North Dakota, we have been working for \nseveral years to secure funding for $10 million in critical patient \nprivacy and environmental improvements at the Fargo VA Medical Center--\na medical center more than 70 years old.\n  Earlier this year when the Senate, during consideration of the budget \nresolution, failed to increase funding for VA medical care as \nrecommended in the Independent Budget, Senator Dorgan and I introduced \nlegislation, S. 1022, to authorize an emergency appropriation of $1.7 \nbillion, above the Administration request, for veterans health care. In \nview of VA-HUD Subcommittee action in the Senate this week, we must \nwork together to find additional funding for VA health care to bring \nthat level closer to the recommended level in the Independent\n\n[[Page S11048]]\n\nBudget. We must do better for our veterans; we can do no less for the \nsacrifices they and their families have made on our behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11048-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 17\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

However, because \nthis condition was not met until August 12, 1999, the 1997 Amendment \nwill enter into force on November 10, 1999.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe 1997 Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and give its advice and \nconsent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.

Also transmitted herewith is a section-\nby-section analysis.\n  There is little question that continuing advances in technology are \nchanging forever the way in which people live, the way they communicate \nwith each other, and the manner in which they work and conduct \ncommerce. In just a few years, the Internet has shown the world a \nglimpse of what is attainable in the information age. As a result, the \ndemand for more and better access to information and electronic \ncommerce continues to grow--among not just individuals and consumers, \nbut also among financial, medical, and educational institutions, \nmanufacturers and merchants, and State and local governments. This \nincreased reliance on information and communications raises important \nprivacy issues because Americans want assurance that their sensitive \npersonal and business information is protected from unauthorized access \nas it resides on and traverses national and international \ncommunications networks. For Americans to trust this new electronic \nenvironment, and for the promise of electronic commerce and the global \ninformation infrastructure to be fully realized, information systems \nmust provide methods to protect the data and communications of \nlegitimate users. Encryption can address this need because encryption \ncan be used to protect the confidentiality of both stored data and \ncommunications. Therefore, my Administration continues to support the \ndevelopment, adoption, and use of robust encryption by legitimate \nusers.\n  At the same time, however, the same encryption products that help \nfacilitate confidential communications between law-abiding citizens \nalso pose a significant and undeniable public safety risk when used to \nfacilitate and mask illegal and criminal activity. Although \ncryptography has many legitimate and important uses, it is also \nincreasingly used as a means to promote criminal activity, such as drug \ntrafficking, terrorism, white collar crime, and the distribution of \nchild pornography.\n  The advent and eventual widespread use of encryption poses \nsignificant and heretofore unseen challenges to law enforcement and \npublic safety. Under existing statutory and constitutional law, law \nenforcement is provided with different means to collect evidence of \nillegal activity in such forms as communications or stored data on \ncomputers. These means are rendered wholly insufficient when encryption \nis utilized to scramble the information in such a manner that law \nenforcement, acting pursuant to lawful authority, cannot decipher the \nevidence in a timely manner, if at all. In the context of law \nenforcement operations, time is of the essence and may mean the \ndifference between success and catastrophic failure.\n  A sound and effective public policy must support the development and \nuse of encryption for legitimate purposes but allow access to plaintext \nby law enforcement when encryption is utilized by criminals. This \nrequires an approach that properly balances critical privacy interests \nwith the need to preserve public safety. As is explained more fully in \nthe sectional analysis that accompanies this proposed legislation, the \nCESA provides such a balance by simultaneously creating significant new \nprivacy protections for lawful users of encryption, while assisting law \nenforcement's efforts to preserve existing and constitutionally \nsupported means of responding to criminal activity.\n  The CESA establishes limitations on government use and disclosure of \ndecryption keys obtained by court process and provides special \nprotections for decryption keys stored with third party ``recovery \nagents.'' CESA authorizes a recovery agent to disclose stored recovery \ninformation to the government, or to use stored recovery information on \nbehalf of the government, in a narrow range of circumstances (e.g., \npursuant to a search warrant or in accordance with a court order under \nthe Act). In addition, CESA would authorize appropriations for the \nTechnical Support Center in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which \nwill serve as a centralized technical resource for Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement in responding to the increasing use of encryption \nby criminals.\n  I look forward to working with the Congress on this important \nnational issue.\n                                                  William J.

A resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     Legislature of the State of New Jersey relative to funding \n     for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund Program; to the \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n\n[[Page S11052]]\n\n                        Assembly Resolution 163\n\n       Whereas, the proposed Federal Fiscal Year 2000 budget \n     contains a cut of $535 million in funding for the Clean Water \n     State Revolving Fund (Clean Water SRF) program established \n     pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act in 1987, which, if \n     allowed to stand, will have a significant negative impact on \n     New Jersey's ability to enhance water quality conditions, \n     protect the public health and safety and preserve and \n     maintain the State's surface and ground water resources; and\n       Whereas, since the federal government ended the \n     Construction Grants Program in the 1980's, the Clean Water \n     SRF program has been the only significant source of federal \n     funds for addressing the severe water pollution problems that \n     continue to plague this State and our Nation; and\n       Whereas, addressing the State's water pollution problems, \n     preserving clean water and enhancing water quality conditions \n     are essential to the public health and safety, and are \n     fundamental requirements for a thriving economy, in \n     particular New Jersey's tourism industry, the second largest \n     in the State, which is heavily dependent on our reputation \n     for clean ocean waters and beaches; and\n       Whereas, since 1987 the New Jersey Environmental \n     Infrastructure Trust and the Department of Environmental \n     Protection have leveraged the federal moneys in the Clean \n     Water SRF to enable the investment of more than $1.5 billion \n     in wastewater treatment and other water pollution abatement \n     strategies under the New Jersey Environmental Infrastructure \n     Financing Program, a consolidated approach to federal and \n     State clean water, drinking water and stormwater management \n     project financing; and\n       Whereas, the New Jersey Environmental Infrastructure \n     Financing Program, which has been the primary source \n     available for either federal or State funding to assist local \n     governments in financing necessary wastewater treatment and \n     water quality improvements, may justifiably be characterized \n     as an unqualified success and, without exaggeration, is \n     genuinely considered one of the most successful Clean Water \n     SRF programs in the country; and\n       Whereas, it is altogether fitting and proper that the \n     Legislature memorialize Congress to restore funding for the \n     Clean Water State Revolving Fund program in the proposed \n     Federal Fiscal Year 2000 budget, as the uninterrupted full-\n     funding for, and unimpaired continuation of, New Jersey's \n     thriving Clean Water SRF program is in the public interest; \n     now, therefore,\n       Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The Congress of the United States is respectfully \n     memorialized to restore the $535 million cut in funding for \n     the Clean Water State Revolving Fund program in the proposed \n     Federal Fiscal Year 2000 budget.\n       2.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to the export of \n     cryptographic products; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \n     and Urban Affairs.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 10\n\n       Whereas, current United States export control laws \n     governing cryptographic products are adversely affecting \n     California and American companies; and\n       Whereas, with California poised to greatly benefit from the \n     rapid growth of electronic commerce, which is predicted to \n     amount to as much as $200 billion per year by the year 2000, \n     outdated cryptographic provisions dating back to World War II \n     and the Cold War retard the ability of California producers \n     of cryptographic products to compete and succeed in the \n     global market; and\n       Whereas, there exists a tremendous worldwide market for \n     cryptographic products incorporating secure encryption \n     features; and\n       Whereas, foreign competitors of data-scrambling technology, \n     unfettered by strict government export controls on \n     cryptographic products, are able to successfully develop, \n     market, and sell sophisticated encryption systems well above \n     the United States limit; and\n       Whereas, any benefit to American law enforcement or \n     national security realized by American export controls on \n     cryptographic products has been minimized by the rapid \n     availability of strong, robust cryptographic systems produced \n     by non-American companies and even by the ability to lawfully \n     import these systems into the United States; and\n       Whereas, the Computer Systems Policy Project estimates that \n     if the current outdated policy remains in effect, the cost to \n     American companies could be up to $96 billion by the year \n     2002 and the loss of over 200,000 high-skill, high-wage jobs \n     by the year 2000; and\n       Whereas, the National Research Council of the National \n     Academy of Sciences has concluded after exhaustive study that \n     United States export controls on cryptography may be causing \n     American software and hardware companies to lose a \n     significant share of a rapidly growing market, with losses of \n     at least several hundred million dollars per year; and\n       Whereas, the current administration supports a ``key \n     recovery'' system that would force computer users to give the \n     government access to their encryption keys, thus allowing the \n     federal government to monitor an individual's communications \n     and on-line transactions without that individual's knowledge \n     or consent; and\n       Whereas, there is pending in the United States Congress \n     H.R. 850, which will substantially ease or eliminate current \n     federal export controls on American cryptographic products, \n     and other legislation related to cryptography and export \n     controls is being introduced and considered in the Congress; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That there be greater discussion between \n     industry, government, and the public in this policy area; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California \n     respectfully memorializes the President and the Congress of \n     the United States to act immediately to consider the \n     relaxation of current United States export control laws \n     governing cryptographic products and to discourage the \n     implementation of a federally mandated ``key recovery'' \n     program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-352. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to special education \n     funding; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States enacted the \n     Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (P.L. 94-\n     142), now known as the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA), to ensure that all children with \n     disabilities in the United States have available to them a \n     free and appropriate public education that emphasizes special \n     education and related services designed to meet their unique \n     needs, to assure that the rights of children with \n     disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected, to \n     assist states and localities to provide for the education of \n     all children with disabilities, and to assess and assure the \n     effectiveness of efforts to educate children with \n     disabilities; and\n       Whereas, since 1975, federal law has authorized \n     appropriation levels for grants to states under the IDEA at \n     40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure and public \n     elementary and secondary schools in the United States; and\n       Whereas, Congress continued the 40-percent funding \n     authority in Public Law 105-17, the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997; and\n       Whereas, Congress has never appropriated funds equivalent \n     to the authorized level, has never exceeded the 15-percent \n     level, and has usually only appropriated funding at about the \n     8-percent level; and\n       Whereas, the California Master Plan for Special Education \n     was approved for statewide implementation in 1980 on the \n     basis of the anticipated federal commitment to fund special \n     education programs at the federally authorized level; and\n       Whereas, the Governor's Budget for the 1999-2000 fiscal \n     year proposes $2.2 billion in General Fund support for the \n     state's share of funding for special education programs; and\n       Whereas, the State of California anticipates receiving \n     approximately $410,500,000 in federal special education funds \n     under Part B of IDEA for the 1999-2000 school year, even \n     though the federal authorized level of funding would provide \n     over $1.8 billion annually to California; and\n       Whereas, local educational agencies in California are \n     required to pay for the underfunded federal mandates for \n     special education programs, at a statewide total cost \n     approaching $1 billion annually, from regular education \n     program money, thereby reducing the funding that is available \n     for other education programs; and\n       Whereas, the decision of the Supreme Court of the United \n     States in the case of Cedar Rapids Community Sch. Dist. v. \n     Garret F. ((1999) 143 L.Ed 2d 154), has had the effect of \n     creating an additional mandate for providing specialized \n     health care, and will significantly increase the costs \n     associated with providing special education services; and\n       Whereas, whether or not California participates in the IDEA \n     grant program, the state has to meet the requirements of \n     Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 701) and its implementing regulations (34 C.F.R. \n     104), which prohibit recipients of federal financial \n     assistance, including educational institutions, from \n     discriminating on the basis of disability, yet no federal \n     funds are available under that act for state grants; and\n       Whereas, California is committed to providing a free and \n     appropriate public education to children and youth with \n     disabilities, in order to meet their unique needs; and\n       Whereas, the California Legislature is extremely concerned \n     that, since 1978, Congress has not provided states with the \n     full amount of financial assistance necessary to achieve\n\n[[Page S11053]]\n\n     its goal of ensuring children and youth with disabilities \n     equal protection of the law; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature respectfully \n     memorializes the President and Congress of the United States \n     to provide the full 40-percent federal share of funding for \n     special education programs so that California and other \n     states participating in these critical programs will not be \n     required to take funding from other vital state and local \n     programs in order to fund this underfunded federal mandate; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to the \n     Chair of the Senate Committee on Budget, to the Chair of the \n     House Committee on the Budget, to the Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations, to the Chair of the House Committee on \n     Appropriations, to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, and to the \n     United States Secretary of Education.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-353.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act and Small Business \nInvestment Act of 1958; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n         community development and venture capital act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the bill that I am sending to the desk is \nthe Community Development and Venture Capital Act of 1999. I am pleased \nto share the introduction of this with Senators Wellstone, Bingaman, \nSarbanes, Levin, and Cleland as cosponsors of it. This small business \nlegislation is designed to promote economic development, business \ninvestment, productive wealth, and stable jobs in new markets.\n  It establishes a New Markets Venture Capital program that is part of \nPresident Clinton's New Markets Initiative that he mentioned in the \n``State of the Union Address'' and promoted on a 4-day tour this \nsummer.\n  New Markets are our country's low- and moderate-income communities \nwhere there is little to no sustained economic activity but many \noverlooked business opportunities. According to Michael Porter, a \nrespected business analyst who has written extensively on \ncompetitiveness, ``. . . inner\n\n[[Page S11055]]\n\ncities are the largest underserved market in America, with many tens of \nbillions of dollars of unmet consumer and business demand.'' Many rural \nareas also contain low- and moderate-income communities.\n  Think of the inner-city areas of Boston's Roxbury or New York's East \nHarlem, or the rural desolation of Kentucky's Appalachia or \nMississippi's Delta region. These are our neediest communities--urban \nand rural pockets that are so depleted that no internal resource exists \nto jump start the economy. These are places where there have been \nmulti-generations of unemployment and abandoned commercial centers and \nmain streets.\n  To get at this complex and deep-rooted economic problem, this \nlegislation has three parts: a venture capital program to funnel \ninvestment money into our poorest communities, a program to expand the \nnumber of venture capital firms that are devoted to investing in such \ncommunities, and a mentoring program to link established, successful \nbusinesses with businesses and entrepreneurs in stagnant or \ndeteriorating communities in order to facilitate the learning curve.\n  The center piece is the New Markets Venture Capital Program. Its \npurpose is to stimulate economic development through public-private \npartnerships that invest venture capital in smaller businesses that are \nlocated in impoverished rural and urban areas or that employ low-income \npeople.\n  Both innovative and fiscally sound, this legislation creates a new \nventure capital program within the Small Business Administration that \nis built on two of the agency's most popular programs. It is \nfinancially structured similar to the Agency's successful Small \nBusiness Investment Company program, and incorporates a technical \nassistance component similar to that successfully used in SBA's \nmicroloan program.\n  However, unlike the SBIC program which focuses solely on small \nbusinesses with high-growth potential and claims successes such as \nStaples and Calloway Golf, the New Markets Venture Capital program will \nfocus on smaller businesses that show promise of financial and social \nreturns--what we call a ``double bottomline.'' These businesses tend to \nbe higher risk, need longer periods to pay back money, need intensive, \nongoing financial, management and marketing assistance, and have more \nmodest prospects for return on investment than SBIC investments. For \nexample, the returns on investments typically range from five to ten \npercent for community development venture capital funds versus SBIC's \nexpected 20 to 30 percent rates of returns.\n  To balance out the equation, they also provide quality, stable jobs, \ncreate productive wealth in and among our neediest communities and need \na smaller equity investment. Equity investments for community \ndevelopment investment funds will range from $50,000 to $300,000 versus \nthe $300,000 to $5 million of typical deal sizes in the Agency's SBIC \nprogram.\n  Among other conditions, in order for an organization to be eligible \nto participate and approved as a New Markets Venture Capital company, \nit must have a management team with experience in community development \nfinancing or venture capital financing, be able to raise at least $5 \nmillion of non-SBA money for debentures, and raise matching funds for \nSBA's technical assistance grants.\n  Community development venture capitalists, we should be reminded, use \nall the discipline of traditional venture capitalists.\n  At the Small Business Committee roundtable we held in May on the \nAgency's SBIC program and other venture capital proposals, community \ndevelopment venture capital groups from Massachusetts to Minnesota to \nKentucky talked about profit. Like traditional venture capital funds, \ncommunity development funds have to make prudent investments to earn \nprofits in order to attract and keep investors. But they balance that \nwith social objectives. One of the most important social goals for \nBoston Community Venture Fund is job creation and job quality.\n  Elyse Cherry, who is President of the Boston Community Venture Fund, \ninvited me, former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and former \nCongressman Joseph P. Kennedy II and others to tour a company her Fund \ninvested in called City Fresh Foods. Located in Roxbury, one of \nBoston's neediest neighborhoods, Glynn and Sheldon Lloyd started a \ncompany that manufactures prepares African-American and Hispanic meals \nfor the community and corporate clients. And through the Meals-on-\nWheels program, this company serves the elderly in Roxbury and \nDorchester districts. In addition to providing a needed service, City \nFresh Foods has created 20 jobs, hires from the community, pays its \nemployees from $8 to $16 per hour, and offers training and opportunity \nfor them to move from entry-level jobs to supervisory positions.\n  There are more success stories like this around the country. The \nCommunity Development Venture Capital funds across the country have a \nproven track record in making smart, responsible investments in small \nbusinesses in their communities, but the capital needs of firms in \neconomically distressed areas far outweigh the existing capacity of \nthese organizations. Compared to the more than 1,143 traditional and \nSBIC venture capital firms in the U.S., only some 40 funds nationwide \nconcentrate on investing in companies that show promise of financial \nand social returns. We simply need more community development venture \ncapital funds to reach more of these underserved communities.\n  The second component of this bill, the ``Community Development \nVenture Capital Assistance Program,'' recognizes that need and is \ndesigned to increase the number and expertise of community development \nventure capital funds, such as New Markets Venture Capital companies, \naround the country. A Community Development Venture Capital \norganization has a primary mission of promoting community development \nin low-income communities through investment in private businesses.\n  Senator Wellstone has carried the water on community development \nventure capital concept and deserves special credit for educating the \nSmall Business Committee about this important economic development \ntool. He introduced this initiative in March. It is virtually identical \nto the bill he introduced in the last Congress and passed the full \nSenate as part of a comprehensive small business bill, H.R. 3412.\n  First, the Community Development Venture Capital Assistance program \nwould authorize $15 million for SBA grants to private, nonprofit \norganizations with expertise in making venture capital investments in \npoor communities. These organizations would use these grants to provide \nhands-on technical assistance to spawn and develop new and emerging \nCDVC or NMVC companies. The intermediary organizations would match the \ngrants dollar-for-dollar with non-Federal sources.\n  Second, this program would provide $5 million in SBA grants to \ncolleges, universities, and other firms or organizations--public or \nprivate--to create and operate training and intern programs, organize a \nnational conference, and fund academic research and studies dealing \nwith community development venture capital.\n  Finally, to complement the venture capital investments and the \nprogram to foster the emergence and growth of more community \ndevelopment venture capital companies, this legislation would build on \nthe BusinessLINC grant program. Already a successful public-private \npartnership that the SBA and Department of Treasury launched last June, \nit encourages larger businesses to mentor smaller businesses, enhancing \nthe economic vitality and competitive capacity of small businesses \nlocated in the targeted areas. This Act will authorize $3 million a \nyear to further promote and expand this program.\n  It's easy to stare past the broken inner cities and boarded up rural \ntowns to the intrigues and fantasies of a booming Wall Street, \nflourishing suburbs and record-low national unemployment. But as we \ntrumpet the successes of our economy, we must be smart and leverage \nthat prosperity to jumpstart and strengthen our communities that are \nstruggling. This legislation aims to do just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11056]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Boston Community Capital,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, July 16, 1999.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I am writing to you as president of \n     Boston Community Venture Fund, an affiliate of Boston \n     Community Capital, and as a Board Member of the Community \n     Development Venture Capital Alliance (CDVCA), in strong \n     support of your leadership regarding the Administration's New \n     Markets Venture Capital legislative proposal. I appreciate \n     your positive public remarks concerning New Markets, \n     including at your Committee's recent ``roundtable.'' It is my \n     understanding that you plan to introduce the administration's \n     proposal soon, and I will be extremely pleased and proud to \n     have you as our leading advocate in the Senate. CDVCA has \n     worked closely with the Small Business Administration as they \n     have drafted their proposal, and I have enjoyed working with \n     Patty Forbes of your Small Business Committee staff, as well.\n       As you know, a New Markets Venture Capital program would \n     help to direct private, equity financing to small, high-\n     potential growth firms in economically distressed urban and \n     rural areas. As the nation's leading practitioners of \n     community development venture capitalism, the Alliance and \n     its member organizations have begun to establish a strong \n     record of effectively promoting such investment through what \n     we call social entrepreneurship--equity investing with a \n     ``double bottom-line'' mission of creating jobs and wealth \n     among economically disadvantaged populations.\n       CDVCA strongly supported the Senate's action last year in \n     passing community development venture capital ``capacity-\n     building'' legislation. Unfortunately, that effort, initiated \n     by Senator Wellstone, did not pass in the House before the \n     end of the last Congress. We continue to believe that \n     capacity-building assistance for the community development \n     venture capital field would be crucial to the success of a \n     New Markets program at SBA. We urge you to consider adding a \n     provision to incorporate this capacity-building, or \n     ``Wellstone,'' concept into any bill you might introduce.\n       CDVCA also believes that a New Markets Venture Capital \n     program could be more workably and effectively targeted if \n     the Administration's discussion draft were modified. CDVCA's \n     member-organizations all have a primary mission of serving \n     low-income people. Indeed, we would prefer that such a \n     mission be a requirement for eligibility for applicants to \n     become New Markets Venture Capital companies in the bill. \n     However, even as our organizations pursue that mission, none \n     of our member-funds restricts itself to investing within \n     geographical bounds as narrow as those suggested by the \n     Administration. Serious pockets of poverty exist outside the \n     census tracts which are the primary basis for that \n     Administration proposal's geographical targeting. We have \n     provided your staff with suggestions for amending that \n     provision, and we would appreciate it if you could consider \n     such changes before introducing a bill.\n       We strongly support the Administration's proposal, and we \n     are especially hopeful regarding its prospects for enactment \n     following the President's important recent tour of low-income \n     urban and rural communities. I look forward to continuing to \n     work with you and your office, and I hope you will feel free \n     to contact me or Bob Rapoza, who represents our Alliance in \n     Washington, should you have any questions. Bob's number is \n     292-393-5225.\n       Thank you for your attention to this issue. I hope to be \n     discussing it further with you in the very near future.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Elyse D. Cherry,\n\n                                                        President,\n     Boston Community Venture Fund.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 15, 1999.\n       Dear Members of Congress: We urge you to support the \n     President's proposal for a ``New Markets Venture Capital \n     Companies'' program to be administered by the Small Business \n     Administration. The program would help establish 10-20 new \n     venture capital investment funds with a mission of creating \n     good jobs and new businesses in economically distressed \n     communities across America.\n       The remarkable prosperity now enjoyed by much of the \n     country unfortunately is leaving large numbers of Americans \n     behind. One reason is lack in many urban and rural \n     communities of the needed equity capital and technical \n     assistance which are key to starting and expanding new \n     businesses.\n       An emerging industry of community development venture \n     capitalists is addressing this need. Committed to a ``double \n     bottom-line'' of rigorously promoting profit-making growth \n     companies while also creating large numbers of good jobs in \n     low-income communities, these funds have demonstrated \n     impressive results. The same model of business development \n     that has driven economic expansion in the Silicon Valley and \n     Route 128 in Massachusetts, coupled with a focus on poor \n     communities and job creation, is beginning to make a powerful \n     difference in areas such as rural Appalachia, Minnesota's \n     Iron Range, inner-city Baltimore, Boston and elsewhere.\n       We need to build on the success of this grassroots model to \n     help ensure that all of America's communities have a chance \n     to participate in current growth. A modest public investment, \n     leveraging significant private capital, would yield \n     tremendous national benefits.\n       The Administration's proposal is contained in the \n     President's FY 2000 budget request. Bills to be introduced by \n     Senator John Kerry and Representative Nydia Velazquez, the \n     Ranking Members of their respective Small Business \n     Committees, faithfully embody the same concept. We are very \n     hopeful that this idea, grounded in local self-help \n     principles and targeted to where it is most needed, can be \n     enacted as a bipartisan legislative accomplishment.\n       A New Markets Venture Capital program would allow \n     participating funds to issue SBA-guaranteed debentures for \n     urgently needed equity capital and to receive matching \n     technical assistance grants to allow the intensive, hands-on \n     management and direction which is key to the success of \n     community development venture capital. A $45-million Federal \n     investment would match other sources on a dollar-for-dollar \n     basis and be directed over 10 years to generate hundreds of \n     millions of dollars in economic activity.\n       All this would take place in communities that currently \n     have the most trouble attracting private investment, despite \n     numerous potential business opportunities with good returns \n     and outstanding social benefits. Participation would be on a \n     competitive basis and geared toward funds with a combination \n     of a strong financial track record and a mission of community \n     development. The program would be community-based to meet the \n     specific needs of each area in which it operates.\n       Community development venture capital funds are proving \n     that the tools of venture capital can fuel business creation \n     and expansion, create good jobs and improve the lives of \n     people in low-income communities. We hope you can give a \n     boost to this extremely promising new tool for genuine \n     economic development by supporting and passing New Markets \n     Venture Capital legislation this year.\n           Sincerely,\n     African-American Venture Capital Fund, LLC, Louisville, KY\n     Alternatives Federal Credit Union, Ithaca, NY\n     Appalachian Center for Economic Networks, Athens, OH\n     Arkansas Enterprise Group, Arkadelphia, AR\n     Association for Enterprise Opportunity, Chicago, IL\n     Banc of America SBIC Corporation, Charlotte, NC\n     Bank One, Chicago, IL\n     Boston Community Capital, Boston, MA\n     Carras Community Investment, Inc, Fort Lauderdale, FL\n     Cascadia Revolving Fund, Seattle, WA\n     CDFI Coalition, Philadelphia, PA\n     CEI Ventures, Inc, Portland, ME\n     Center for Community Self-Help, Durham, NC\n     Commons Capital, Nantucket, MA\n     Community Loan Fund of Southwestern Pennsylvania, Inc, \n         Pittsburgh, PA\n     Development Corporation of Austin, Austin, MN\n     DVCRF Ventures, Philadelphia, PA\n     Enterprise Corporation of the Delta, Jackson, MS\n     Enterprise Foundation, Columbia, MD\n     First Nations Development Institute, Fredericksburg, VA\n     Gulf South Capital, Inc, Jackson, MS\n     Illinois Facilities Fund, Chicago, IL\n     Impact Seven, Inc, Almena, WI\n     Intrust USA, Wilmington, DE\n     J.P.

Kerry,\n     Small Business Committee/Democratic Staff, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I am writing in support of the New \n     Markets Venture Capital bill, which I understand you are \n     introducing today. I serve as chair and chief executive \n     officer of Northeast Ventures, a $12 million community \n     development venture capital firm investing in northeastern \n     Minnesota, a restructured iron mining area of the country. \n     Over the last ten years, we have invested almost $10 million \n     in 21 growth companies which would not exist but for the \n     presence of our equity capital. We apply market disciplines \n     along side a frankly stated social purpose of intervening in \n     this distressed area.\n       I also serve as chair of the Community Development Venture \n     Capital Alliance, a national alliance of community \n     development venture capital funds. We have 40 funds \n     throughout the United States and eastern Europe. All these \n     funds have a mission of poverty alleviation through the \n     disciplined use of venture capital in distressed areas and \n     among distressed populations.\n       The New Markets Venture Capital legislation has the \n     potential of providing significant additional funding and \n     catalyzing the creation of a significant number of new funds \n     for this important purpose.\n       We thank you very much for your support. Nothing could be \n     more important than job and wealth creation in the most \n     distressed urban and rural areas of our country.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                       Nick Smith,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we have spent a lot of time in \nthe Senate praising the booming American economy and low unemployment \nrates. I, like the rest of the colleagues, am proud to see our country \nbenefitting from such prosperity, but all Americans are not \nparticipating in these benefits.\n  In reality, Americans that live in low income areas, either in cities \nor rural areas, are not experiencing today's prosperity. This is \nlargely because they do not have the economic infrastructure in their \ncommunities to take advantage of it. Poor communities frequently lack \nlocal businesses to employ residents and provide services, creating no \npoint of entrance for participation in the larger American economy.\n  It is for these reasons that I am co-sponsoring the Community \nDevelopment and Venture Capital Act of 1999 introduced by Senator \nKerry. This legislation is part of President Clinton's New market \nInitiatives Proposal. As my colleagues know, I have already introduced \nAmerica's Private Investment Companies Act of 1999, or APIC, which is \nanother part of the New Market initiative.\n  The Community Development and Venture Capital Act makes a three \npronged effort to infuse capital into distressed communities, and \nestablish small businesses in our nations most needy neighborhoods. \nFirst, the bill will use federal money to leverage private funding for \nventure capital companies with a commitment to community development, \nreferred to as New market Venture Capital Companies (NMVC). This will \nhelp to nurture new businesses in poor areas. The companies funding by \nthis bill will function much like the successful SBIC program that the \nSmall Business Administration sponsors, but will focus on businesses in \ntargeted neighborhoods that need more patient, long term capital \nfunding, and added technical assistance to ensure success.\n  Furthermore, the bill will increase the number of community \ndevelopment venture capital funds so that more communities can be \nserved by the program and expand the successful business mentoring \nprogram, BusinessLINC, already in place.\n  I have long argued that the best social policy is a job. This \nlegislation, combined with the APIC bill and the New markets Tax Credit \nintroduced by Senator Rockefeller, will be a catalyst to the creation \nof new businesses and the jobs and economic opportunities they bring in \nthose areas most in need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERREY:\n  S. 1597. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nenhanced tax incentives for charitable giving, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         enhanced incentives for charitable giving act of 1999\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nto provide enhanced incentives for charitable giving.\n  I very much believe that we ought to do what we can to encourage \nthose who are doing so well in this economy to give generously to \norganizations who serve those who have been left behind in these \nprosperous times. I worked to have a number of charitable giving \nprovisions included in the Senate version of the tax bill we passed \nearlier this year and was delighted that those provisions were included \nin that bill. Regrettably these provisions were deleted from the final \nversion of the tax bill, something which contributed to my decision to \nvote against the conference report on that bill. The bill I am \nintroducing today is a stand-alone version of the charitable giving \nprovisions that I was proud to have worked to include in the Senate \nversion of the tax bill.\n  The purpose of this bill is simple: to provide powerful incentives \nfor those who have more to give to those who have less.\n  The first provision in this bill would allow taxpayers some extra \ntime to decide to make donations to low-income schools in a given tax \nyear. Under current law individuals can already take charitable \ndeductions for contributions to public and private schools. Clearly, \nwealthier schools, where parents have the resources to make these \ncontributions, benefit most from this tax treatment.\n  What this provision attempts to do is highlight the fact that a \ncharitable deduction can be taken for these types of donations \ngenerally while providing an incentive for giving to low-income private \nand public schools in particular. Since the parents in these schools \nare low-income, this provision is not aimed at getting them to give--it \nis aimed at getting taxpayers outside of these low-income schools to \nhelp the children in those schools. Wealthier public and private \nschools already get these contributions, this provision attempts to get \nsome contributions going to schools where more than half of the \nchildren are economically disadvantaged.\n  This provision tracks the way we allow contributions to Individual \nRetirement Accounts, IRAs, to be made. Under current law, taxpayers can \nmake contributions to an IRA up until the date their taxes are due--\nApril 15--and still have those contributions qualify for the previous \ntaxable year. This provision would simply allow contributions to low \nincome elementary and secondary schools to be made up until April 15--\nthereby highlighting and encouraging taxpayers to make these \ncontributions.\n  The second provision in this bill allows taxpayers who do not itemize \ntheir deductions, to take a small deduction for charitable \ncontributions. Across the country, seventy-three percent of all \ntaxpayers do not itemize and therefore are not able to take a \ncharitable deduction. In Nebraska, that number is even higher, a full \nseventy-eight percent of Nebraska's taxpayers do not itemize. This bill \nwould allow a single taxpayer who does not itemize a $50 deduction and \ntaxpayers filing jointly a $100 charitable deduction. While this \nprovision may not cover all of the charitable giving that these \nindividuals and families make, it recognizes and encourages \ncharitable giving by people who may not give a million dollars, but \ngive donations that are meaningful nonetheless to good causes like \ntheir church or synagogue, or their children's PTA, or the Girl Scouts \nor the Salvation Army. We ought to encourage that giving and provide a \nsmall incentive to do so. That is the purpose behind this provision.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today also raises the percentage \namount of income that an individual may deduct in a given year from 50 \npercent of their adjusted gross income to 75 percent. It also raises \nthe limits on gifts of capital gain property to charities from 30 \npercent to 50 percent. In\n\n[[Page S11058]]\n\naddition, this bill increases the corporate charitable deduction limit \nfrom 10 to 20 percent of taxable income.\n  These provisions are designed to encourage those who give a lot, to \ngive even more. While I recognize that those who receive these tax \nbenefits are apt to be higher-income taxpayers, I also recognize that \nthe charities that will receive these increased donations are apt to \nuse these donations to help low-income individuals. In short, I'm not \noverly troubled by distributional tables on a policy which will induce \nthose with more to give to those who need help the most.\n  And finally, this bill contains an important reform of what is known \nas the excess business holdings rule. That rule limits the ability of a \nprivate foundation to hold more than twenty percent of a corporation's \nvoting stock for more than five years. At present, I believe this rule \ndiscourages potential donors with major stockholdings in publicly-trade \ncorporate stock from making significant contributions of these holdings \nto charitable foundations. This is just the opposite of what we should \nbe doing, particularly at a time when we are expecting more, not less, \nfrom organizations with charitable purposes. The proposal I have \nincluded in this bill would allow private foundations to increase their \nholding in publicly traded stock of a corporation received by bequest \nfrom 20 percent to 49 percent.\n  Taken together I believe these proposals do much to encourage people \nto give more. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and hope \nthat it will be included in any broad tax legislation that we consider.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1597\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to sell or \nexchange all or part of certain administrative sites and other land in \nthe Black Hills National Forest and to use funds derived from the sale \nor exchange to acquire replacement sites and to acquire or construct \nadministrative improvements in connection with Black Hills National \nForest; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                Black Hills National Forest Legislation\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nauthorize the Black Hills National Forest to sell or exchange property \nit owns in order to acquire new property for the purpose of \nconstructing two new district offices for the forest. The legislation \nis cosponsored by my colleague from South Dakota, Senator Johnson.\n  On February 27, 1998, the Forest Service approved the consolidation \nof the Black Hills National Forest's seven Ranger Districts into four \ndistricts. As a result, the Pactola/Harney and Spearfish/Nemo Ranger \nDistricts are each currently managed by one District Ranger, but \nutilize two offices each. Combining these four separate offices into \ntwo district offices would save money in the long-term, be more \nefficient, and ensure good customer service for users of the forest.\n  One of the new district offices would be located on federally-owned \nproperty in Spearfish Canyon and house the Spearfish/Nemo Ranger \nDistrict employees. The other new district office would be located on \nproperty to be procured near Rapid City, and would house the Pactola/\nHarney Ranger District and the Rapid City Research Station employees.\n  It is important to note that this legislation is particularly \nnecessary given the extraordinarily poor working conditions experienced \nby the employees of the Rapid City Research Station. Their building is \nliterally falling apart and fails to meet basic safety standards. In \nfact, due to a lack of proper ventilation and a failure to meet fire \ncodes, the fire marshal has prohibited the research station from \ncarrying out any of the chemical analysis critical to its mission. As a \nresult, that work must be contracted out, using funds that could more \nappropriately be spent elsewhere.\n  Much of the resources necessary for the implementation of this \nlegislation can be gained by selling property that will be made \nunnecessary by the construction of the new offices. However, the \nlegislation does authorize any additional funds that may be necessary \nto complete this important project.\n  I have worked carefully with the Forest Service to develop this \nlegislation. I believe it is a sensible and efficient way to ensure \nthat the agency can meet the needs of the public. I urge my colleagues \nto give it their support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 1601. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexclude small rural providers from the prospective payment system for \nhospital outpatient department services; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    small rural provider act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Rural \nProvider Act of 1999.\n  Small, rural hospitals have always played a vital role in ensuring \naccess to quality health care. Today, rural hospitals are as important \nas ever. Half of all American hospitals are in rural areas, and these \ninstitutions account for fully one-quarter of the hospital beds in our \ncountry. And rural hospitals across America are expanding and improving \ntheir services, from disease prevention to rehabilitation to outpatient \nsurgery.\n  But if the outpatient prospective payment system (PPS) goes into \neffect as currently proposed, rural hospitals in Montana and across the \nnation will lose millions of dollars in Medicare payments each year. \nSome of our smallest hospitals--the ones we should be supporting the \nmost--will lose more than half of their current payments. That's just \nnot right, and we should pass legislation to fix it.\n  Why does the outpatient PPS pose such a threat to small, rural \nhospitals? As you know, Mr. President, instead of reimbursing hospitals \nfor the actual costs that they incur, a PPS would pay hospitals on a \nfixed, limited rate. That might make sense for a large hospital in \nChicago or New York City that sees thousands of patients every day. But \nit doesn't make sense for a small hospital that doesn't enjoy the same \neconomies of scale. It certainly doesn't make sense for Madison Valley \nHospital, in Ennis, Montana, which would face an estimated 62.6 percent \ncut in outpatient payments under PPS.\n  Mr. President, how can small, rural hospitals, already struggling to \nimprove their services with limited funds, survive and operate with \nhalf as much money? How can hospitals that rely on Medicare patients \nfor most of their revenue endure a 50 percent pay-cut? The simple \nanswer is: they cannot.\n  And let's remember, Mr. President, many of these hospitals are home \nto skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and home health agencies (HHAs). \nThese are the same SNFs and HHAs that have already been harmed by new \nprospective payment systems of their own.\n  This is a very simple bill. It would allow small, rural hospitals to \nopt out of the outpatient PPS. Without this bill, hospitals all across \nrural America will face devastating shortfalls in the coming year--and \nthe quality of our country's health care will suffer. With this bill, \nthe small hospitals that serve rural Americans throughout the nation \ncan continue to improve the quality of their services.\n  Passing this bill is the right thing to do, and I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1601\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Rural Provider Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXCLUSION OF SMALL RURAL PROVIDERS FROM PPS FOR \n                   HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT SERVICES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1833(t)(1) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C.

adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) Exclusion for services furnished by small rural \n     providers.--The term `covered OPD services' does not include \n     services furnished by a--\n

     ``(I) has less than 50 beds; and\n       ``(II) performed less than 5,000 outpatient procedures \n     during the 12-month period ending on such date;\n     if such hospital, within the 180-day period beginning on the \n     date of enactment of the Small Rural Provider Act of 1999, \n     requests the Secretary to exclude services furnished by such \n     hospital from the prospective payment system established \n     under this subsection.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the \n

Mr. President, I respectfully request that the \nattached statement delivered by Governor Pedro Rossello, of Puerto \nRico, before the Human Resources Committee of the National Governors' \nAssociation be printed in the Record. This statement was made in \nreference to S. 1364, the Promoting Responsible Fatherhood Act of 1999.\n  The statement follows.\n\n Remarks by the Honorable Pedro Rossello, Governor of Puerto Rico and \nCo-Lead Governor on Fatherhood in the National Governors' Association, \n   Delivered at a Meeting of the Committee on Human Resources of the \n National Governors' Association, Saint Louis, Missouri, August 8, 1999\n\n       Thank you, Mister Chairman.\n       Governor Tom Ridge and I are extremely enthusiastic about \n     the duties we have been discharging as the N-G-A's Lead \n     Governors on Fatherhood.\n       And in that regard, I certainly want to acknowledge the \n     superb collaboration that we have received from the \n     colleagues who serve with us as fellow members of the \n     Governors' Task Force on Fatherhood Promotion.\n       As has been documented by the N-G-A Center for Best \n     Practices, the efforts we've been undertaking have yielded a \n     rich harvest.\n       That harvest encompasses: An intensification of public \n     awareness campaigns--in nearly all of the states and \n     territories--to promote positive father involvement; a \n     sharper focus for programs, throughout the nation, that are \n     aimed at developing the parenting skills of new fathers; and \n     better targeted support services for disadvantaged or non-\n     custodial fathers, so that they can learn how to improve \n     their relationships with their children.\n       During this past year, our Task Force also expanded its \n     outreach, while joining with the National Fatherhood \n     Initiative, as a co-sponsor of the 1999 National Summit on \n     Supporting Urban Fathers.\n       At the event 2 months ago, we helped spearhead the creation \n     of a brand new Mayors' Task Force on Fatherhood Promotion.\n       As a result, Governors and Mayors are now pooling their \n     resources and putting their heads together on multi-sectoral \n     approaches that can meet the challenge of promoting \n     responsible fatherhood in those urban communities where \n     absenteeism and neglect place very large numbers of children \n     at risk.\n       We Governors can take considerable satisfaction in the \n     progress we have made since we last gathered to discuss the \n     need for an aggressive campaign to foster conscientious \n     fatherhood.\n       Nevertheless, it remains a fact that we still have a long \n     way to go in this important quest to improve the home \n     environments and--by extension--the learning environments of \n     countless thousands of girls and boys and teenagers . . . all \n     across America.\n       And with that in mind, I strongly recommend that this \n     Committee renew its support for N-G-A Policy H-R 28, on the \n     subject of Paternal Involvement in Child-Rearing.\n       However, I would also submit that we must go further.\n       In addition to re-committing ourselves to a policy \n     statement which underscores our collective determination to \n     enter the new millennium with stronger families and a \n     brighter future for the nation's young people, we must \n     likewise re-commit ourselves to a partnership with other \n     elected officials who share those indispensable aspirations.\n       So it is that I hope each and every one of us will \n     emphatically endorse Congressional enactment of the \n     Responsible Fatherhood Act of 1999.\n       This bill, introduced less than a month ago by Senators \n     Evan Bayh and Pete Domenici, will empower states and \n     communities with new tools to encourage the formation--and \n     the maintenance--of two-parent households, as well as the \n     acceptance by absent fathers of personal responsibility for \n     their children. This bipartisan legislation will provide \n     states and communities with flexible funding to promote \n     responsible fatherhood, through alliances with news media, \n     charities, community-based organizations and religious \n     institutions.\n       The bill will also amend the ``high-performance bonus'' \n     that was created by the 1996 Federal welfare reform statute; \n     the amendment will establish that the formation and \n     maintenance of two-parent families shall henceforward be \n     taken into account as one of the factors considered when \n     granting bonuses to states that are successful in obtaining \n     private-sector jobs for welfare recipients.\n       These and other provisions of the Responsible Fatherhood \n     Act of 1999 will lend tangible support to our own pioneering \n     efforts on behalf of fatherhood promotion.\n       And I am confident that the initiatives contemplated under \n     this bill can be put into effect without jeopardizing any of \n     the existing appropriations that mean so much to our states \n     and communities.\n       In summary, then, I invite your attention and your \n     allegiance to both the renewal of our N-G-A Policy-Plank, H-R \n     28, and to this very promising new Federal legislation \n     measure.\n       That concludes what I hope we can agree has been a report \n     that was at once brief and to the point.\n       Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11062-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL PAYROLL WEEK\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

As you may know, this week, September 13 \nthrough 17, has been designated National Payroll Week, a time to take \nnote of the efforts of our nation's payroll professionals.\n  Payroll taxes are the largest source of revenue for the federal \ngovernment. While I for one would like to see these rates reduced, we \nshould not let this detract from the hard work which payroll \nprofessionals put into their efforts. Payroll work is also a vital \ncomponent of facilitating child-support payments. It is my \nunderstanding that more than 60 percent of all child support \ncollections are derived from payroll deductions for this purpose.\n  While many of us here often make note of Americans working in the \nfactories, in our retail outlets, and on our farms, many times we \noverlook those who monitor the systems that ensure Americans receive \ntheir wages quickly and efficiently. I encourage my colleagues to also \nacknowledge our nation's payroll professionals during this \nweek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11062-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11062-S11063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONDEMNATION OF PREJUDICE AGAINST INDIVIDUALS OF ASIAN AND PACIFIC \n                            ISLAND ANCESTRY\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of S. Con. Res. 53, \na sense of Congress resolution relating to the recent allegations of \nespionage and illegal campaign financing that have brought into \nquestion the loyalty of individuals of Asian Pacific ancestry.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about the negative impact that the \nrecent investigation of Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at Los Alamos, New \nMexico, is having on the Chinese American community. Certain recent \nmedia coverage of this investigation has chosen to portray Chinese and \nChinese Americans with a broad brush, using loaded words that are \noffensive and implying that certain people should be treated with \nsuspicion solely because of their ethnicity or national origin. \nCartoons exaggerate and poke fun at physical appearances of individuals \nby depicting slanted eyes and buck teeth.\n  In one particularly offensive example, a recent editorial in a Santa \nFe, New Mexico, newspaper made fun of Asian accents, unnecessarily \nreferred to the ``Fu Manchu'' character, and tried to link the \nallegations of stolen nuclear secrets and the bombing of the Chinese \nembassy in Belgrade.\n  Mr. President, Asian Pacific Americans are an important part of our \nbody politic. They have made significant contributions to politics, \nbusiness, industry, science, sports, education, and the arts. Men and \nwomen like the late Senator Sparky Matsunaga, Olympic Champion Kristi \nYamaguchi, Architect I.M. Pei, Maxine Hong Kingston, Ellison Onizuka, \nand many others have enhanced and invigorated the life of this nation.\n  Asian Americans have played a fundamental part in making this country \nwhat it is today. Asian immigrants helped build the great \ntranscontinental railroads of the 19th century. They labored on the \nsugar plantations of Hawaii, on the vegetable and fruit farms of \nCalifornia, and in the gold mines of the West. They were at the \nforefront of the agricultural labor movement, especially in the \nsugarcane and grape fields, and were instrumental in developing the \nfishing and salmon canning industries of the Pacific Northwest. They \nwere importers, merchants, grocers, clerks, tailors, and gardeners. \nThey manned the assembly lines during America's Industrial Revolution. \nThey opened laundries, restaurants, and vegetable markets. They also \nserved our nation in war: the famed all-Nisei 100th/442nd combat team \nof World War II remains the most decorated unit in U.S. military \nhistory.\n\n[[Page S11063]]\n\n  Despite their contributions, Asian immigrants and Asian Pacific \nAmericans suffered social prejudice and economic, political, and \ninstitutional discrimination. They were excluded from churches, barber \nshops, and restaurants. They were forced to sit in the balconies of \nmovie theaters and the back seats of buses. They attended segregated \nschools. They were even denied burial in white cemeteries; in one \ninstance, a decorated Asian American soldier killed in action was \nrefused burial in his hometown cemetery. Rather than receive equal \ntreatment, Asians and Pacific Islanders were historically paid lower \nwages than their white counterparts, relegated to menial jobs, or \nforced to turn to businesses and industries in which competition with \nwhites was minimized.\n  For more than 160 years, Asians were also denied citizenship by a law \nthat prevented them from naturalizing, a law that remained in effect \nuntil 1952. Without citizenship, Asians could not vote, and thus could \nnot seek remedies through the Tammany Halls or other political \norganizations like other immigrant groups. The legacy of this injustice \nis seen today in the relative lack of political influence and \nrepresentation of Asian Americans at every level and in every branch of \ngovernment.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Energy Committee and governmental \nAffairs Committee, where I am Ranking Member on the International \nSecurity, Proliferation, and Federal Services Subcommittee, I have \nexpressed my concern about the unfair and unwarranted negative impact \nthis issue is having on the image of the Asian Pacific American \ncommunity. We need to move quickly beyond the search for ethnic \nscapegoats. This is the lesson of the recent concern over national \nsecurity leaks. We should not overreact.\n  Mr. President, I applaud President Clinton's executive order of June \n7, 1999, to establish a commission to study and suggest ways to improve \nthe quality of life for Asian Pacific Americans. President Clinton \nrightfully stated that many Asian Pacific Americans are underserved by \nfederal programs. The order outlines steps to ensure that federal \nprograms, especially those that gather data on health and social \nservices, are responsible to Asian Pacific Americans needs. It's a step \nin the right direction and it may focus on some of the more compelling \nissues involving Asian Pacific Americans in terms of improving the \nquality of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11063-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM B. GREENWOOD ON COMPLETION OF TERM AS PRESIDENT OF \n                INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a fellow \nKentuckian and my friend, William B. Greenwood of Central City, who is \ncompleting his highly successful term as president of the Independent \nInsurance Agents of America (IIAA)--the nation's largest insurance \nassociation--later this month in Las Vegas. Bill is president of C.A. \nLawton Insurance, an independent insurance agency in Central City.\n  Bill's career as an independent insurance agent has been marked with \noutstanding contribution and dedication to his clients, community, \nIIAA, the Independent Insurance Agents of Kentucky, and his independent \nagent colleagues.\n  Bill began his service to his industry colleagues with the \nIndependent Insurance Agents of Kentucky. He served as president of the \nState association in 1983, and was named its Insuror of the Year in \n1986. He was Kentucky's representative to IIAA's national board of \nState directors for seven years beginning in 1985.\n  Bill also was very active with IIAA activities before moving into the \norganization's leadership structure. He was chairman of its \ncommunications and membership committees as well as chairman of the \nfuture one communications task force. Bill was elected to IIAA's \nexecutive committee in 1992 as an at-large member. Since that time, he \nhas exhibited a spirit of tireless dedication to and genuine concern \nfor his 300,000 independent agent colleagues around the country.\n  In addition to his outstanding work with IIAA and the Kentucky \nassociation, Bill also is involved with numerous Central City-area \ncommunity activities. He is a past recipient of the Kentucky Chamber of \nCommerce Volunteer of the Year Award. He is on the boards of directors \nfor the Leadership Kentucky Foundation, Kentucky Audubon Council Boy \nScouts of America, and Central City, Main Street, Inc.\n  In the past, Bill served on the board of directors of the Muhlenberg \nCommunity Theatre, the Everly Brothers Foundation, and the Central City \nMain Street and Redy Downtown Development Corporation. Also, Bill is \npast president of the Central City Chamber of Commerce and the Central \nCity Lions Club.\n  I laud Bill for leading the Independent Insurance Agents of America \nwith distinction and strong leadership over the past year. Even though \nBill will step aside as IIAA president soon, he will remain actively \ninvolved with the association because he is a concerned leader and \nwants to continue helping his colleagues build for the new \nmillennium.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11063-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11063-S11064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND VENTURE CAPITAL ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the \nCommunity Development and Venture Capital Act of 1999 introduced today \nby Senator Kerry. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nmeasure which, if enacted, will make a real difference in the growth of \nsmall business, and the creation of quality jobs, in underdeveloped \nareas around the country.\n  I think the critical issue in communities which experience enduring \npoverty is job creation through promotion of business opportunities and \nentrepreneurship. This has been my experience when I have traveled to \nplaces like rural Appalachia, inner city Minneapolis or Chicago or the \nIron Range in Minnesota. I also believe that an area can be made as \npro-business as possible though tax policies and zoning ordinances, but \nat some point businesses simply need capital so that they can grow and \ncreate good jobs.\n  No business can grow without infusions of capital for equipment \npurchases, to conduct research, to expand capacity, or to build \ninfrastructure. At some point all successful ventures outgrow \nincubation in the entrepreneur's garage or living room; additional \nstaff must be hired and the complexity of managing supply and demand \nincreases. Yet it is clear that throughout the country there are small \nbusiness owners who are being starved of the capital necessary to take \nthis step. They have viable businesses or ideas for businesses but \ncannot fully transform their aspirations into reality because of this \nfinancial roadblock.\n  Businesses can secure capital through loans, but there is a limit to \nthe amount of debt that a business can safely carry and lenders are \nwary of businesses with low equity. Equity investment also differs from \nlending in that the equity investor acquires an ownership stake in the \nbusiness. The fortunes of the investor rise and fall with the success \nof the venture. This means making an equity investment is riskier than \nmaking a loan, and it also means that the investor has a greater vested \ninterest in promoting healthy growth. Investment of equity capital into \nan enterprise has a multiplier effect in that it allows the business \nowner to access necessary credit.\n  Traditional venture capital firms are not meeting the need for equity \ncapital in disadvantaged communities. In addition, the Small Business \nAdministration's Small Business Investment Companies program--with a \nfew exceptions--has not reached into the most economically backward \ncommunities in the country. Such investments are risky in the best of \ncircumstances, but they can and do succeed with adequate time and \nattention. These communities need patient investors who are willing to \nwork closely with small business owners to realize a financial return \nover the long term. Often, the investments needed are smaller than \nthose made by traditional sources.\n  There is no question that the lack of access to equity capital in \ndisadvantaged areas around the country is a prime reason why those \ncommunities have been left behind by the historic economic expansion \nthat the rest of the nation has enjoyed. But there are success stories \nin many states which I\n\n[[Page S11064]]\n\nbelieve that we can emulate and build on to allow distressed \ncommunities to reach their full potential.\n  Throughout America, organizations known as Community Development \nVenture Capital funds are making these kinds of equity investments in \ncommunities and are producing excellent results. CDVC funds make equity \ninvestments in small businesses for two purposes: to reap a financial \nreturn to the fund, and to generate a social benefit for the community \nthrough creation of well paying jobs. This ``double bottom line'' is \nwhat makes CDVC funds unique. There are around 40 CDVC funds currently \noperating throughout the country, in both rural and urban areas.  These \nfunds are demonstrating the success of socially conscious investment \nand entrepreneurial solutions to social and economic problems.\n\n  My own state of Minnesota is home to a good example of a seasoned, \nand successful CDVC fund: Northeast Ventures Corporation of Duluth. NEV \nserves a seven country rural area and focuses on creating good jobs in \nhigh value-added industries. NEV targets 50% of the jobs created \nthrough investments to women, and to low-income and structurally \nunemployed persons.\n  In 1990 a group a entrepreneurs approached Northeast Ventures about \nsetting up a car wash equipment manufacturing facility in Tower, a town \nof 508 people, in one of the poorest parts of northeastern Minnesota. \nWhile NEV thought that the market opportunity was attractive, the \ncompany, called Powerain, had an incomplete business plan and lacked a \nChief Operating Officer. NEV also felt that the business provided a \ngood opportunity to create jobs and bring some economic vitality to an \narea that needed it badly.\n  Other assistance was needed before NEV could provide financing for \nthe effort. Northeast worked closely with Powerain's founders to revise \nthe business plan and identify a strong CEO candidate for the company. \nNortheast also invested $200,000 in equity into the business.\n  NEV staff conducted the strategic planning sessions of Powerain and \ncontinue to be essential in developing the company's strategic plan. \nThey assist in identifying the need for key personnel; recruit the \nnecessary staff; and are integral in qualifying the short list of \ncandidates. Over a multi-year period, NEV has talked daily with the \nPowerain CEO regarding subjects as diverse as sales, distributor \nrelationships and the financial structure of loans. Over an eight year \nperiod, NEV has assisted Powerain in all subsequent rounds of financing \ntotaling $826,932.\n  Powerain had a record sales year in 1998 and is expecting another \nrecord year in 1999. The company currently employs 20 full-time people, \nand expects to increase that number significantly in the future. The \ncompany provides ongoing training to its staff and entry level \npositions begin at $8 an hour--with full benefits. Most employees earn \nwell in excess of $10 per hour.\n  The Community Development and Venture Capital Act of 1999 is designed \nto build on the successful CDVC model by promoting equity investment in \neconomically distressed communities. The first title of this \nlegislation would create the New Market Venture Capital Companies \nProgram, a new program within SBA that will fund at least ten venture \ncapital companies dedicated to new markets--low- and moderate-income \ncommunities. $15 million in annual appropriations would support a $100 \nmillion program level for SBA-guaranteed debentures, and $30 million in \nmatching technical assistance grants.\n  Title II of the bill basically consists of legislation I introduced \nlast year, and again this year, entitled the Community Development \nVenture Capital Assistance Act. Last year, the Senate passed this \nlegislation as part of a SBA technical amendments bill. This title is \nintended to build the capacity of the existing CDVC industry through \ntechnical assistance and SBA grants to colleges, universities, and \nother firms or organizations--public or private--to create and operate \ntraining programs, intern programs, a national conference, and academic \nresearch and study dealing with community development venture capital.\n  Title III would build on the BusinessLINC grant program which is a \npublic-private partnership that the SBA and Department of Treasury \nlaunched last June. It encourages larger businesses to mentor smaller \nbusinesses, promoting the viability of small businesses located in \ndisadvantaged areas.\n  I think this legislation speaks to the heart of reversing persistent \npoverty in America by promoting entrepreneurship, and encouraging \nresponsible equity investment. The small business growth sparked by \nthis legislation would in turn create jobs and wealth in those \ncommunities which have heretofore been overlooked. It is an absolutely \nessential addition to the SBA's current program offerings and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11064-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11064-S11065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. McCAIN.

All too often, the various groups that make up \n``Hispanics'' are lumped together and some forget the dynamic \ndifferences between Mexicans and Puerto Ricans, or Salvadorans and \nChileans, for example. But when Hispanics come together--tied by social \nand cultural similarities--they form a powerful group to whom we must \nlisten.\n  Much has been said lately about the Hispanics' burgeoning economic \nand political power. This group's contribution to the economy is \nsignificant. Their buying power has increased at an annual rate of 5.5 \npercent, far out-distancing inflation. This has resulted in an \nexplosion of Hispanic advertising dollars. According to Hispanic \nBusiness Magazine, from 1997 to 1998, ad budgets targeting the Hispanic \nmarket jumped 21 percent to $1.71 billion. And study after study \nindicate that Hispanic businesses are the fastest growing segment of \nthe small business community.\n  Politically, Hispanics are becoming a great force. They are voting in \never-larger numbers, projected as high as 5.5 million in the 2000 \nelections, up from 4.2 million in 1992. Currently, however, only one in \nevery 20 votes is cast by a Hispanic, even though one in nine Americans \nis Hispanic. Unfortunately, low voter turnout, because of political \ncynicism, is a trend that is not only affecting the Hispanic community.\n  It is important that the political voice of Hispanics is not drowned \nout by money from special interests. When I look down the list of soft \nmoney donors to both political parties, I see corporate giants; I see \nlarge labor unions; I see the Fortune 500. I don't see the name of my \nfriend Victor Flores, who started a small bakery in the town of \nGuadalupe, Arizona, and labored hard for years to feed the community \nand support his family. I don't see Victor's name or, frankly, the \nmajority of Americans who deserve the attention, access and priority \nrepresentation that only a select few can afford under today's corrupt \ncampaign finance system. I will continue to fight for campaign finance \nreform, because without it, we will not achieve the other reforms that \nhave a direct bearing on better quality of life for Hispanic Americans \nand all who make up the great American tapestry.\n  In today's global economy, education is essential for success. If the \nHispanic high school dropout rate remains stubbornly high, resulting in \na lack of needed job skills for the 21st century, income gaps will grow \nand our poverty rates will rise. This is bad for America. We must work \nharder on these issues.\n  Knowledge of English is as important as education in order to \nsucceed. However, I will consistently oppose positions that are \ndivisive, such as ``English-Only'' laws. There is no need to abandon \nthe language of your birth to learn the language of your future. \nHispanics should use and cherish both.\n  Finally, I wish to recognize the outstanding contributions Americans \nof Hispanic descent have made to our national defense. In 1997, I was \npleased to successfully co-sponsor legislation to\n\n[[Page S11065]]\n\ngrant a Federal charter to the American G.I. Forum, the largest \nassociation of Hispanic veterans in the United States. I remain \nterribly proud that our Armed Forces, in which I was privileged to \nserve many years ago, today reflect the composition of American society \nbetter than any other institution. Hispanic Americans have sacrificed \nenormously to secure the liberties many of us take for granted today; \ntheir service honors all of us.\n  Hispanic Americans are honest, hard working patriots, who want and \ndeserve the equal opportunity that is our nation's promise. Hispanics \nhave distinguished themselves in every walk of life. This month, let's \nrecognize their contributions that exemplify the American \nDream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11065-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11065-S11066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nU.S. BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE, FEDERAL OFFSHORE DRILLING ROYALTIES AND THE \n                             McGREGOR RANGE\n\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, at the request of the Honorable \nElton Bomer, Secretary of State for Texas, I rise today to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues House Concurrent Resolutions 2, 59 and 133, \nas passed by the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas. House \nConcurrent Resolution 2 urges the United States Congress to provide \nfunding for infrastructure improvements, additional personnel and \nextended hours of operation at border crossings between Texas and \nMexico. In order for all Americans to fully enjoy the economic benefits \nof trade, we must ensure that the Customs Service obtains the resources \nnecessary to reduce delays, promote commerce and combat illicit drug \ntrafficking. The Senate recently passed the Customs Authorization Act \nof 1999--largely based on legislation I crafted to facilitate trade \nalong the Southwest border--which authorizes the funds necessary to \nimprove our border infrastructure and stem the flow of illegal drugs \ninto the United States.\n  Secondly, House Concurrent Resolution 59 urges the United States \nCongress to pass legislation allocating a portion of federal offshore \ndrilling royalties to coastal states and local communities. I believe \ncoastal states deserve more than the 5 percent of the $120 billion they \nhelped generate during the past 43 years. States and local communities \nare more qualified than bureaucrats in Washington to allocate resources \nto address their specific local needs, and should be given the freedom \nto do so. By passing this resolution, the Texas Legislature has sent a \nclear message, and it is time for Congress to act. Common sense invites \nit, and fairness demands it.\n  In addition, House Concurrent Resolution 133 supports the United \nStates Congress in ensuring that the critical infrastructure for the \nUnited States military defense strategy be maintained by withdrawing \nfrom public use the McGregor Range land beyond the year 2001. The \nMilitary Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 requires that the withdrawal from \npublic use of all military land governed by the Army, including the \nMcGregor Range, must be terminated on November 6, 2001, unless the \nwithdrawal is renewed by an Act of Congress. As my colleagues may know, \nthe McGregor Range at Ft. Bliss is America's principal training \nfacility for air defense systems, maintaining our military readiness in \nair-to-ground combat by providing the highest level of missile defense \ntesting for advanced missile defense systems. Texas has a long and \nimpressive history of supporting America's defense, both at home and on \nthe front lines, and I strongly believe that no state contributes more \nto the defense of our nation than Texas. I look forward to working to \nensure that if the lion and the lamb lie to down together in this \nworld, that the United States of America always be the lion.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Texas Legislature for passing these \nresolutions and ask that they be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                               The State of Texas,\n\n\n                             Office of the Secretary of State,\n\n                                      Austin, TX, August 20, 1999.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: Enclosed is an official copy of Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 2, as passed by the 76th Legislature, \n     Regular Session, 1999, of the State of Texas, wherein the \n     76th Legislature of the State of Texas respectfully urges the \n     United States Congress to provide funding for infrastructure \n     improvements, more customs inspection lanes and customs \n     officials, and 24-hour customs operations at border crossings \n     between Texas and Mexico.\n       The 76th Legislature of the State of Texas requests that \n     this resolution be officially entered in the Congressional \n     Record as a memorial to the Congress of the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Elton Bomer,\n                                               Secretary of State.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, Bottlenecks at customs inspection lanes have \n     contributed to traffic congestion at Texas-Mexico border \n     crossing areas, slowing the flow of commerce and detracting \n     from the economic potential of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement (NAFTA); and\n       Whereas, Smuggling of drugs inside truck parts and cargo \n     containers compounds the problem, necessitating lengthy \n     vehicle searches that put federal customs officials in a \n     crossfire between their mandate to speed the movement of \n     goods and their mandate to reduce the flow of illegal \n     substances; and\n       Whereas, At the state level, the Texas comptroller of \n     public accounts has released a report titled Bordering the \n     Future, recommending among other items that U.S. customs \n     inspection facilities at major international border crossings \n     stay open around the clock; and\n       Whereas, At the federal level, the U.S. General Accounting \n     Office is conducting a similar study of border commerce and \n     NAFTA issues, and the U.S. Customs Service is working with a \n     private trade entity to review and analyze the relationship \n     between its inspector numbers and its inspection workload; \n     and\n       Whereas, Efficiency in the flow of NAFTA commerce requires \n     two federal customs-related funding commitments: (1) improved \n     infrastructure, including additional customs inspection \n     lanes; and (2) a concurrent expansion in customs personnel \n     and customs operating hours; and\n       Whereas, Section 1119 of the federal Transportation Act for \n     the 21st Century (TEA-21), creating the Coordinated Border \n     Infrastructure Program, serves as a funding source for border \n     and infrastructure improvements and regulatory enhancements; \n     and\n       Whereas, Domestic profits and income increase in tandem \n     with exports and imports, generating federal revenue, some \n     portion of which deserves channeling into the customs \n     activity that supports increased international trade; and\n       Whereas, Texas legislators and businesses, being close to \n     the situation geographically, are acutely aware of the fixes \n     and upgrades that require attention if NAFTA prosperity is \n     truly to live up to the expectations of this state and \n     nation; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     provide funding for infrastructure improvements, more customs \n     inspection lanes and customs officials, and 24-hour customs \n     operations at border crossings between Texas and Mexico; and, \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and the President of the Senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the Congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               The State of Texas,\n\n\n                             Office of the Secretary of State,\n\n                                        Austin, TX, July 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: Enclosed is an official copy of House \n     Concurrent Resolution 59, as passed by the 76th Legislature, \n     Regular Session, 1999, of the State of Texas. In this \n     resolution the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas urges \n     the United States Congress to pass legislation allocating a \n     portion of federal offshore drilling royalties to coastal \n     states and local communities.\n       The 76th Legislature of the State of Texas requests that \n     this resolution be officially entered in the Congressional \n     Record as a memorial to the Congress of the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Elton Bomer,\n                                               Secretary of State.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 59\n\n       Whereas, One of Texas' richest and most diverse areas is \n     that of the Gulf Coast; the Coastal Bend abounds with \n     treasures for all, and every year thousands of visitors flock \n     to its beaches and wetlands to enjoy the sun, fish the \n     waters, appreciate its unique scenery and wildlife, and \n     bolster their spirits simply by being near such awe-inspiring \n     beauty; and\n       Whereas, In addition to $7 billion per year generated by \n     coastal tourism, the area is also home to half of the \n     nation's petrochemical industry and over a quarter of its \n     petroleum refining capacity; and\n       Whereas, Coastal tourism, the petrochemical and petroleum \n     industries, a robust commercial and recreational fishing \n     trade,\n\n[[Page S11066]]\n\n     and significant agricultural production make this region a \n     vital economic and natural resource for both the state and \n     the nation; and\n       Whereas, Like other coastal states located near offshore \n     drilling activities, Texas provides workers, equipment, and \n     ports of entry for oil and natural gas mined offshore; while \n     these states derive numerous benefits from the offshore \n     drilling industry, they also face great risks, such as \n     coastline degradation and spill disasters, as well as the \n     loss of nonrenewable natural resources; and\n       Whereas, Although state and local authorities have worked \n     diligently to conserve and protect coastal resources, \n     securing the funds needed to maintain air and water quality \n     and to ensure the existence of healthy wetlands and beaches \n     and protection of wildlife is a constant challenge; and\n       Whereas, The federal Land and Water Conservation Fund was \n     established by Congress in 1964 and has been one of the most \n     successful and far-reaching pieces of conservation and \n     recreation legislation, using as its funding source the \n     revenues from oil and gas activity on the Outer Continental \n     Shelf; and\n       Whereas, The game and nongame wildlife resources of this \n     state are a vital natural resource and provide enjoyment and \n     other benefits for current and future generations; and\n       Whereas, The federal government has received more than $120 \n     billion in offshore drilling revenue during the past 43 \n     years, only five percent of which has been allotted to the \n     states; it is fair and just that Texas and other coastal \n     states should receive a dedicated share of the revenue they \n     help generate; and\n       Whereas, Several bills are currently before the United \n     States Congress that would allocate a portion of federal \n     offshore drilling royalties to coastal states and local \n     communities for wildlife protection, conservation, and \n     coastal impact projects; and\n       Whereas, States and local communities know best how to \n     allocate resources to address their needs, and block grants \n     will provide the best means for distributing funds; and\n       Whereas, These funds would help support the recipients' \n     efforts to renew and maintain their beaches, wetlands, urban \n     waterfronts, parks, public harbors and fishing piers, and \n     other elements of coastal infrastructure that are vital to \n     the quality of life and economic and environmental well-being \n     of these states and local communities; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     pass legislation embodying these principles; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and tot all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               The State of Texas,\n\n\n                             Office of the Secretary of State,\n\n                                        Austin, TX, July 28, 1999.\n     Hon.

In this \n     resolution, the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     supports the United States Congress' efforts to ensure that \n     the critical infrastructure for the United States military \n     defense strategy be maintained be withdrawing from public use \n     of the McGregor Range land beyond 2001.\n       The 76th Legislature of the State of Texas requests that \n     this resolution be officially entered in the Congressional \n     Record as a memorial to the Congress of the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Elton Bomer,\n                                               Secretary of State.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 133\n\n       Whereas, Future military threats to the United States and \n     its allies may come from technologically advanced rogue \n     states that for the first time are armed with long-range \n     missiles capable of delivering nuclear, chemical, or \n     biological weapons to an increasingly wider range of \n     countries; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. military strategy requires flexible and \n     strong armed forces that are well-trained, well-equipped, and \n     ready to defend our nation's interests against these \n     devastating weapons of mass destruction; and\n       Whereas, Previous rounds of military base closures combined \n     with the realignment of the Department of the Army force \n     structure have established Fort Bliss as the Army's Air \n     Defense Artillery Center of Excellence, thus making McGregor \n     Range, which is a part of Fort Bliss, the nation's principal \n     training facility for air defense systems; and\n       Whereas, McGregor Range is inextricably linked to the \n     advance missile defense testing network that includes Fort \n     Bliss and the White Sands Missile Range, providing, \n     verifying, and maintaining the highest level of missile \n     defense testing for the Patriot, Avenger, Stinger, and other \n     advanced missile defense systems; and\n       Whereas, The McGregor Range comprises more than half of the \n     Fort Bliss installation land area, and the range and its \n     restricted airspace in conjunction with the White Sands \n     Missile Range, is crucial to the development and testing of \n     the Army Tactical Missile System and the Theater High \n     Altitude Area Defense System; and\n       Whereas, The high quality and unique training capabilities \n     of the McGregor Range allow the verification of our military \n     readiness in air-to-ground combat, including the Army's only \n     opportunity to test the Patriot missile in live fire, \n     tactical scenarios, as well as execute the ``Roving Sands'' \n     joint training exercises held annually at Fort bliss; and\n       Whereas, The Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 requires \n     that the withdrawal from public use of all military land \n     governed by the Army, including McGregor Range, must be \n     terminated on November 6, 2001, unless such withdrawal is \n     renewed by an Act of Congress; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby support the U.S. Congress in ensuring that the \n     critical infrastructure for the U.S. military defense \n     strategy be maintained through the renewal of the withdrawal \n     from public use of the McGregor Range land beyond 2001; and, \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the Congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11066-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11066-S11068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL IDENTIFICATION CARD\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to join with \nSenator Shelby in supporting the repeal of the provisions in Federal \nlaw creating a National ID card. I am pleased that the managers have \ndecided to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. President, the American people strongly oppose the institution of \na national identification card.\n  And, I share their opposition.\n  The establishment of a national system of identification seriously \nthreatens our personal liberties. It would allow Federal bureaucrats to \nmonitor movements and transactions of every citizen.\n  It's Big Brother on an immense scale. It's even possible, perhaps \nmore probable, that Federal officials could even punish innocent \ncitizens for failure to produce the proper papers.\n  The authority was given for a national I.D. card in Section 656 of \nthe Immigration Reform Act of 1996. That section sets the stage for the \nestablishment of Federal standards for drivers' licenses, thus \ntransforming drivers' licenses into a de facto national ID card.\n  Let me go through what Section 656 does.\n  It expands the use and dissemination of the Social Security Account \nnumber.\n  It requires Federal agencies to accept only documents that meet the \nstandards laid out in the section, thus creating a de facto national \nidentification card.\n  It preempts the traditional state function of issuing driver's \nlicenses and places it in the hands of the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration.\n  In a time when we are trying to give control back to the states, the \nestablishment of Federal standards for drivers' licenses usurps the \nstates constitutionally-protected authority to set their own standards \nfor drivers' licenses.\n  Only 7 states require the social security account number to be \ndisplayed on driver's licenses. 9 states have repealed their \nrequirement that drivers license display the number since 1992.\n  The National Conference of State Legislatures is very concerned about \nthe Federalizing of State drivers' licenses and has written letters to \nCongress calling for the repeal of Section 656. They rightly understand \nthat, although the National Highway Transportation Safety \nAdministration is not proceeding with any rulemaking at this time, the \nlaw is still on the books, the potential is still there.\n  Mr. President, in 1998, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, contained a provision that \nprohibits the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration \nfrom issuing a final rule on National identification cards as required \nunder section 656.\n  Today we have an opportunity, with my amendment, to prohibit the \nestablishment of a national identification card by denying funding for \nSection 656.\n\n[[Page S11067]]\n\n  Mr. President, let me read from a letter that was written by 13 \ngroups in opposition to Section 656 and this national ID system.\n  This letter is from: The National Conference of State Legislators, \nthe National Association of Counties, the American Civil Liberties \nUnion, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Concerned Women \nfor America, Eagle Forum, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Free Congress \nFoundation, National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, National \nCouncil of La Raza, National Immigration law Center, Traditional Values \nCoalition, and the U.S. Catholic Conference.\n  It is addressed to Speaker Hastert.\n\n       Dear Speaker Hastert, We represent a broad-based coalition \n     of state legislators, county officials, public policy groups, \n     civil libertarians, privacy experts, and consumer groups from \n     across the political spectrum.\n       We urge Congress to repeal Section 656 of the Immigration \n     Reform and Immigration Responsibilities Act of 1996 that \n     requires states to collect, verify, and display social \n     security numbers on state-issued driver's license and conform \n     with federally-mandated uniform features for drivers license.\n       The law preempts state authority over the issuance of state \n     driver's licenses, violates the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act \n     of 1994, and poses a threat to the privacy of citizens. \n     Opposition to the law and the preliminary regulation issued \n     by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has \n     been overwhelmingly evidenced by the more than 2,000 comments \n     submitted by individuals, groups, state legislators, and \n     state agencies to NHTSA.\n       The law and the proposed regulations run counter to \n     devolution. The law preempts the traditional state function \n     of issuing driver's licenses and places it in the hands of \n     officials at NHTSA while imposing tremendous costs on the \n     states that have been vastly underestimated in the \n     Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation.\n       The actual cost of compliance with the law and the \n     regulation fax exceeds the $100 million threshold established \n     by the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act.\n       In addition, the law and proposed regulation require states \n     to conform their drivers' licenses and other identity \n     documents to a detailed federal standarde.\n       Proposals for a National ID have been consistently rejected \n     in the United States as an infringement of personal liberty.\n       The law raises a number of privacy and civil rights \n     concerns relating to the expanded use and dissemination of \n     the Social Security Number, the creation of a National ID \n     Card, the potential discriminatory use of such a card, and \n     the violation of federal rules on privacy.\n       The law and proposed rule require each license contain \n     either in visual or electronic form the individual's Social \n     Security Number unless the state goes through burdensome and \n     invasive procedures to check each individual's identity with \n     the Social Security Administration.\n       This will greatly expand the dissemination and misuse of \n     the Social Security Number at a time that Congress, the \n     states, and the public are actively working to limit its \n     dissemination over concerns of fraud and privacy.\n       Many states are taking measures to reduce the use of Social \n     Security Numbers as the driver's identity number. Only a few \n     states currently, require the Social Security Number to be \n     used as an identifier on the driver's licenses.\n       While the impact of Section 656 may not have been fully \n     comprehended in 1996, we urge the Congress now act swiftly to \n     repeal this provision of law that has between challenged by \n     many diverse groups.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I also have a letter from \nthe Association of American Physicians and Surgeons:\n\n       I am writing today to express the support of the \n     Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a group of \n     thousands of private physicians in the United States \n     concerned about patient/physician confidentiality for \n     repealing Section 656 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.\n       In our system of government, not everything that people do \n     or think is presumed to be within the government's right to \n     know. By repealing the law establishing a national ID scheme, \n     you help protect the threatened liberty of all Americans from \n     a dangerous precedent, which allows bureaucrats the ability \n     to inappropriately monitor private details.\n       As a doctor, I cannot allow the privacy of my patients to \n     be at risk.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jane Orient, MD.\n\n  Mr. President, the Republican Party Platform, states clearly and \nunequivocally, ``We oppose the creation of any national ID card.''\n  Mr. President, let me read from a paper compiled by a group called \nPrivacy International, entitled, ``ID Cards: Some Personal Views from \naround the world.''\n  I ask that this paper by Privacy International be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  The material follows:\n\n          ID Cards: Some Personal Views From Around the World\n\n       In 1994, in an attempt to discover the problems caused by \n     ID cards, Privacy International compiled a survey containing \n     reports from correspondents in forty countries. Amongst the \n     gravest of problems reported to Privacy International was the \n     overzealous use or misuse of ID cards by police--even where \n     the cards were supposed to be voluntary. One respondent \n     wrote:\n       ``On one occasion I was stopped in Switzerland when walking \n     at night near Lake Geneva. I was living in Switzerland at the \n     time and had a Swiss foreigner's ID card. The police were \n     wondering why I should want to walk at night to look at the \n     Chateau de Chillon. Really suspicious I suppose, to walk at \n     night on the banks of the lake to look at an illuminated \n     chateau (I am white and dress conservatively). I had to wait \n     for 20 minutes whilst they radioed my ID number to their \n     central computer to check on its validity.''\n       Correspondents in most countries reported that police had \n     powers to demand the ID card. A correspondent in Greece \n     reported:\n       ``In my country the Cards are compulsory. If police for \n     example stop you and ask for identification you must present \n     them the ID or you are taken to the police department for \n     identification research.''\n       Police were granted these powers in the late 1980s, despite \n     some public misgivings. Non European countries reported more \n     serious transgressions, In Brazil, for example:\n       They are compulsory, you're in big trouble with the police \n     if they request it and you don't have one or left home \n     without it. The Police can ask for my identity card with or \n     without a valid motive, it's an intimidation act that happens \n     in Brazil very, very often. The problem is not confined to \n     the police. Everybody asks for your ID when you are for \n     example shopping, and this is after you have shown your \n     cheque guarantee card. We also had other similar cards. \n     Nobody trusts anybody basically.\n       Predictably, political hot-spots have seen widescale abuse \n     of the card system:\n       One problem that Afghans encountered carrying these \n     ``tazkiras'' (ID cards) was during the rule of the communist \n     regime in Afghanistan where people were stopped in odd hours \n     and in odd places by the government's Soviet advisors and \n     their KHALQI and PARCHAMI agents and asked for their \n     ``tazkiras''. Showing or not showing the ``tazkira'' to the \n     enquiring person at that time was followed by grave \n     consequences. By showing it, the bearer would have revealed \n     his age upon which, if it fell between 16-45, he would have \n     been immediately taken to the nearest army post and drafted \n     into the communist army, and if he refused to show, he would \n     have been taken to the nearest secret service (KHAD) station \n     and interrogated as a member of the resistance (Mujahideen), \n     imprisoned, drafted in the army or possibly killed.\n       Many countries reported that their ID card had become an \n     internal passport, being required for every dealing with \n     people or institutions. In Argentina, according to this \n     correspondent, the loss of the ID card would result in grave \n     consequences:\n       ``I got my first personal ID when I turned seven. It was \n     the Provincial Identity Card. It looked like the hardcover of \n     a little book with just two pages in it. It had my name, my \n     photograph, the fingerprint of my right thumb, and some other \n     personal data. I never questioned what was the logic about \n     fingerprinting a seven-year old boy. It was suggested that \n     identification was one of the major purposes for the \n     existence of the Police of the Province which issued the \n     card. It was required for enroling in the Provincial \n     School I attended. Attending the primary school is \n     compulsory, hence everybody under twelve is indirectly \n     forced to have the Card. Well, this Book was required for \n     any sort of proceedings that the person wanted to \n     initiate, e.g. enrol at school, buy a car, get his driving \n     license, get married. Nobody could do anything without it. \n     In addition, it became a prerogative of the police to \n     request it at any time and place. Whoever was caught \n     without it was customarily taken to jail and kept there \n     for several hours (or overnight if it happened in the \n     evening) while they ``checked his personal record''. In \n     effect, Argentine citizens have never been much better off \n     than South-African negroes during the Apartheid, the only \n     difference is that we Argentinians did not have to suffer \n     lashings if caught without the pass cared. As for daily \n     life without the ID, it was impossible.\n       Of greater significance is the information that ID cards \n     are commonly used as a means of tracking citizens to ensure \n     compliance with such laws as military service. Again, in \n     Argentina:\n       ``The outrage of the military service was something that \n     many people was not ready to put up with. Nevertheless, \n     something forced the people to present themselves to be \n     drafted. It was nothing more or less than the ID. In fact, if \n     somebody did not show up, the army never bothered to look for \n     them. They just waited for them to fall by themselves, \n     because the ID card showed the boy to be on military age and \n     not having the necessary discharge records by the army. \n     Provided that in the country you could not even go for a walk \n     without risking to be detained by the police, being a no-show \n     for military duty amounted to a civil death.''\n       Another respondent in Singapore noted that many people in \n     his country were aware\n\n[[Page S11068]]\n\n     that the card was used for purposes of tracking their \n     movements, but that most did not see any harm in this:\n       ``If that question is put to Singaporeans, they are \n     unlikely to say that the cards have been abused. However, I \n     find certain aspects of the NRIC (ID card) system \n     disconcerting. When I finish military service (part of \n     National service), I was placed in the army reserve. When I \n     was recalled for reserve service, I found that the army \n     actually knew about my occupation and salary! I interpreted \n     this as an intrusion into my privacy. It might not be obvious \n     but the NRIC system has made it possible to link fragmented \n     information together.''\n       The consequences of losing ones card were frequently \n     mentioned:\n       ``A holiday in Rio was ruined for me when I was robbed on \n     the beach and had to spend the rest of the brief holiday \n     going through the bureaucracy to get a duplicate issued. One \n     way round this (of dubious legality) is to walk around with a \n     notarized xerox copy instead of the original.''\n       The Brazilian experience shows that the card is often \n     misused by police:\n       ``Of course violent police in metropolitan areas of Sao \n     Paulo and Rio de Janeiro love to beat and arrest people \n     (especially black/poor) on the pretext that they don't have \n     their ID card with them.''\n       In some countries, denial of a card means denial of \n     virtually all services:\n       ID cards are very important in Vietnam. They differentiate \n     between citizens and non-citizens. People without an ID card \n     are considered as being denied of citizenship and all the \n     rights that come with it. For example, they cannot get legal \n     employment, they cannot get a business license, they cannot \n     go to school, they cannot join official organizations, and of \n     course they cannot join the communist party. They cannot \n     travel either. (Even though in practice, they bribe their way \n     around within the country, they would face big trouble if got \n     caught without ID card.)\n       The same problem occurs in China:\n       I personally feel that the card has the following \n     drawbacks: It carries too much private info about a person. \n     We have to use it in almost every situation. Such as renting \n     a hotel room, getting legal service from lawyers, contacting \n     government agencies, buying a plane ticket and train ticket, \n     applying for a job, or getting permit to live with your \n     parents, otherwise your residence is illegal. In a lot of \n     cases, we are showing too much irrelevant information to an \n     agency or person who should not know that. The card is \n     subject to police cancellation, and thus without it, one can \n     hardly do anything, including traveling for personal or \n     business purposes, or getting legal help or obtaining a job. \n     The government has been using this scheme too often as a \n     measure against persons who run into troubles with it \n     socially or politically. The identity card is showing your \n     daily or every short-term movement, and can be used to \n     regularize and monitor a person's behavior and activity.\n       One Korean professor reported that the national card was \n     used primarily as a means of tracking peoples activities and \n     movements:\n       ``If you lose this card, you have to report and make \n     another one within a certain period. Since it shows your \n     current address, if you change your address then you must \n     report and make a correction of the new address. If you go to \n     a military service or to a prison, then the government takes \n     away this identity card. You get the card back when you get \n     out. You are supposed to carry this card everywhere you go, \n     since the purpose is to check out the activity of people. \n     There are fines and some jail terms if you do not comply. If \n     you board a ship or an airplane, then you must show this card \n     to make a record. You need to show this card when you vote. \n     Former presidential candidate Kim, Dae Joong could not vote \n     for his own presidential election because his secretary \n     forgot to bring Kim's card. He had to wait for a while until \n     somebody bring his card. Many government employees make lot \n     of money selling information on this card to politicians \n     during election season. Police can ask you to show this card \n     and check whether your identity number is on the wanted list \n     or not. There is a widespread prejudice between the people of \n     some local areas. This card shows the permanent address of \n     you. And it allows other people to successfully guess the \n     hometown of your parents.''\n       One Portuguese man studying in the United States reported \n     an obsession with identity in his country:\n       ``I keep losing my ID. card, and people keep asking for it. \n     It seems like it's needed for just about everything I want to \n     do, and I should really carry it around my neck or have it \n     tattooed on my palm. The information on it is needed for \n     everything. Many buildings, perhaps most, will have a clerk \n     sitting at a ``reception desk'' who will ask you for your id. \n     They will keep it and give it back to you when you leave. Few \n     people seem bothered with this, but then they don't keep \n     loosing they're cards like I do. So I usually threw a little \n     tantrum ``Are we under curfew? Why do I have to carry my id \n     with me anyway?'' Our tolerant culture invariably leads the \n     clerk to take whatever other document I happen to be \n     carrying--usually my bus pass, which I loose less often. \n     After a while I surrender and go get myself a new id. card. \n     It take \\1/2\\ a day or more to do this and--guess what--you \n     need your old id. card. It's more complicated if you've lost \n     it. Then finally I am legal again for a while. It's partly \n     due to the Portuguese obsession with identity. Everyone \n     carries both they're mother's and father's last names.''\n       Others confirmed the traditional problem of counterfeiting:\n       It costs only 300 rupees ($10) to get a counterfeit ID \n     card. The system hardly works. We all know how fake IDs (one \n     guy's photo, another one's name) can be obtained so people \n     can have their friends take GREs and TOEFLs (national tests) \n     for them.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, when my colleagues come \ndown here to vote, I want you to look around at some of the statues and \nportraits in this building.\n  What would some of these great men, Washington, Jefferson, Adams--our \nfounding fathers--what would they think about the government they \ncreated setting up a system requiring every law-abiding citizen to \ncarry a national ID card.\n  Is this what the Constitution intended?\n  Does the Tenth Amendment allow the Federal Government to dictate what \ninformation state governments must put on their drivers' licenses?\n  For the sake of nabbing a few illegal aliens--which a national ID \ncard will not do--is it worth inconveniencing tens of millions of law-\nabiding American citizens and costing Federal, state, and local \ngovernments millions of dollars?\n  Mr. President, I again thank the managers for accepting this \namendment to protect the rights of all Americans by opposing this \nmisguided section in the law creating a National ID Card.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11068-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE INGHAM COUNTY WOMEN'S COMMISSION 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and \ncongratulate the Ingham County Women's Commission, as they celebrate \ntheir 25th Anniversary.\n  The Ingham County Women's Commission has taken great strides to meet \nthe needs of women since it was founded in 1974. The commission, \noriginally established to serve as a study and research center focusing \non the issues concerning women in the county, was restructured in 1976 \nand took on an advisory role to the Board of Commissioners. They now \nfocus on issues that impact the women of the county. They have \ncontinued their efforts in researching better ways to meet the needs of \nwomen through county resources.\n  What is truly remarkable about this select group is their dedication \nto helping enrich the lives of women. They work closely with the Equal \nOpportunity Commission to overcome discrimination against women. The \ncommission also provides many important and beneficial services to \nwomen. Their greatest accomplishments include involvement with the New \nWay In and Rural Emergency Outreach and the provision of acquittance \nrape education for high school students. Additionally, they have \nexperienced vast success in helping raise awareness of women's issues \nby developing a sexual harassment policy for county employees, \nsponsoring the Ingham County Sexual Assault Task Force and the Michigan \nCouncil of Domestic Violence.\n  This important group of women are to be commended for their \naccomplishments over the last 25 years. Their hard work and dedication \nto conveying the importance of women's issues will benefit many women \nfor years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11068-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11068-S11069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WITHDRAWAL OF COSPONSORSHIP\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to withdraw my name as \na co-sponsor of Senate bill S. 1172, the Drug Patent Term Restoration \nReview Procedures Act of 1999. After much research and thought I have \ndecided to do this for the senior citizens of Montana.\n  When I signed on this bill I believed that it was the right thing to \ndo. Helping companies that have invested millions of dollars in \nresearch and development, only to see their property protections eroded \nby administrative delays, concerned me and I felt it was a good bill to \nhelp sponsor.\n  After many meetings, lots of research and careful thought I have now \ncome to a different conclusion. I now believe that there is already an \nestablished patent extension process to compensate brand companies for \nregulatory delays. I feel that by allowing brand companies to seek \nadditional\n\n[[Page S11069]]\n\npatent life for so-called ``pipeline drugs,'' this bill will deprive \nconsumers, and especially the elderly with their limited incomes, the \nopportunity to purchase the more affordable generic drug equivalent. \nGeneric drugs are often priced 25-60% below the brand name product.\n  Mr. President, I feel that this is a good bill, but if I continue to \nsupport S. 3372 I would be blocking patient access to generic medicines \nfor three more years, forcing millions of Americans to pay inflated \nprices for these drugs. I cannot do this to the senior citizens in my \ngreat state. They are having a tough time getting by as is. Higher drug \nprices just add to their problems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11069-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 17 AND TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER, 21, 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I want to make sure I understand what the \nSenator is asking. I have to object, if you want to make that request.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee be discharged from consideration of S. 1568; that \nS. 1568 be taken up; that the amendment being offered by myself, Mr. \nHelms, and Mr. Harkin be adopted, and I ask unanimous consent to pass \nS. 1568, as amended.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I object. I say to the Senator, this came at \nthe last moment. I have not had a chance to check it out. I have \nSenators gone for the day with whom I have to check. I am sure we will \nwork with the Senator on this tomorrow or next week.\n  At this time, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11069-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I sought a few minutes ago to get \nunanimous consent to have the Senate pass the East Timor Self-\nDetermination Act of 1999, and I am extremely pleased with the support \nwe received from both sides of the aisle on it. Apparently, there was \nsome objection to taking this step by unanimous consent today. Time is \nclearly of the essence with regard to this very important legislation, \nin light of the situation in East Timor. We must send a strong \nstatement from the Senate. We have to send a clear message to Jakarta \nthat the Government of Indonesia must live up to its commitment to the \npeople of East Timor. So I will again seek, along with Senator Reed, \nSenator Harkin, Senator Leahy and others, early next week when we come \nback, to have this passed.\n  I especially thank the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, \nfor their longstanding commitment to realize self-determination for \npeople of East Timor. I especially thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the chairman \nand ranking member of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific \nAffairs, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Kerry, for their work to ensure swift \npassage of this important legislation by the Senate.\n  I reiterate, the chairman, Senator Helms, has been enormously helpful \nin getting this bill through the committee, discharged from committee, \nand out to the Senate floor. This legislation is crucial to maintaining \npressure on the Indonesian Government to live up to the obligations it \nhas made to the people of East Timor and to the international \ncommunity, including its commitment to admit and cooperate with an \ninternational peacekeeping force in East Timor. The bill suspends all \nmilitary and most economic assistance to the Government of Indonesia, \nincluding assistance still in the pipeline, until the President \ndetermines the Government of Indonesia is cooperating with the efforts \nby the international community to establish a safe and secure \nenvironment in East Timor and is taking a series of specific, \nsignificant steps to that end.\n  I also take this moment to applaud the U.N. Security Council on its \npassage of a resolution authorizing the deployment of a multinational \nforce to\n\n[[Page S11070]]\n\nEast Timor, and to commend the nation of Australia and other countries \nin the region that have agreed to provide troops for that force.\n  I reiterate what I believe are the next crucial steps that have to be \ntaken so the people of East Timor can finally realize the independence \nthey so clearly on August 30 expressed a desire to have.\n  The international peacekeeping force must be deployed as rapidly as \npossible. We must quickly and concisely define the scope of a limited \nU.S. role in the peacekeeping mission. The international community must \nkeep pressure on Indonesia, pressure that will be brought to bear by \nthis legislation. The peacekeepers, humanitarian workers, and war \ncrimes investigators must be allowed full access to East Timor.\n  Again, it is my hope this will be taken up quickly next week.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the amendment \nwhich Senator Helms and I and Senator Harkin have offered as a \nsubstitute be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``East Timor Self-\n     Determination Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDING; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Congressional Finding.--Congress recognizes that the \n     Government of Indonesia took a positive and constructive step \n     by agreeing on September 12, 1999, to the deployment of an \n     international peacekeeping force to East Timor.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage the \n     Government of Indonesia to take such additional steps as are \n     necessary to create a peaceful environment in which the \n     United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) can \n     fulfill its mandate and implement the results of the August \n     30, 1999, vote on East Timor's political status.\n\n     SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Multilateral Economic Assistance.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (c), the \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States \n     executive directors to the international financial \n     institutions to oppose, and vote against, any extension by \n     those institutions of any financial assistance (including any \n     technical assistance or grant) of any kind to the Government \n     of Indonesia.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the international financial institutions should withhold the \n     balance of any undisbursed approved loans or other assistance \n     to the Government of Indonesia.\n       (3) International financial institutions defined.--In this \n     subsection, the term ``international financial institution'' \n     includes the International Monetary Fund, the International \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International \n     Development Association, the International Finance \n     Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guaranty Agency, and \n     the Asian Development Bank.\n       (b) Restriction on Bilateral Economic Assistance.--Except \n     as provided in subsection (c), none of the funds appropriated \n     or otherwise made available to carry out chapter 1 of part I \n     (relating to development assistance) or chapter 4 of part II \n     (relating to economic support fund assistance) of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 may be available for Indonesia, except \n     subject to the procedures applicable to reprogramming \n     notifications under section 634A of that Act.\n       (c) Exception.--Subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply to \n     the provision of humanitarian assistance (such as food or \n     medical assistance) to Indonesia or East Timor.\n       (d) Conditions for Termination.--The measures described in \n     subsections (a) and (b) shall apply until the President \n     determines and certifies to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that the Government of Indonesia is cooperating \n     with efforts by the international community to establish a \n     safe and secure environment in East Timor and is taking \n     significant steps to--\n       (1) end the violence perpetrated by units of the Indonesian \n     armed forces and by armed militias opposed to the \n     independence of East Timor;\n       (2) enable displaced persons and refugees to return home;\n       (3) ensure freedom of movement within East Timor, including \n     access by humanitarian organizations to all areas of East \n     Timor; and\n       (4) enable UNAMET to resume its mandate, without threat or \n     intimidation to its personnel.\n\n     SEC. 4. SUSPENSION OF SECURITY ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Prohibitions on Cooperation and Support.--\n       (1) Assistance.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available under the following provisions of \n     law (including unexpended balances of prior year \n     appropriations) may be available for Indonesia:\n       (A) The Foreign Military Financing Program under section 23 \n     of the Arms Export Control Act.\n       (B) Chapter 2 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (relating to military assistance).\n       (C) Chapter 5 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (relating to international military education and \n     training assistance).\n       (2) Licensing.--None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available under the following provisions of law \n     (including unexpended balances of prior year appropriations) \n     may be available for licensing exports of defense articles or \n     defense services to Indonesia under section 38 of the Arms \n     Export Control Act.\n       (3) Deliveries.--No defense article or defense service may \n     be exported or delivered to Indonesia or East Timor by any \n     United States person (as defined in section 16 of the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. app. 2415) or any other \n     person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States \n     except as may be necessary to support the operations of an \n     international peacekeeping force in East Timor or in \n     connection with the provision of humanitarian assistance.\n       (b) Conditions for Termination.--The measures described in \n     subsection (a) shall apply with respect to the Government of \n     Indonesia until the President determines and certifies to the \n     appropriate congressional committees that--\n       (1) a generally safe and secure environment exists in East \n     Timor, including--\n       (A) an end to the violence perpetrated by units of the \n     Indonesian armed forces and by armed militias opposed to the \n     independence of East Timor;\n       (B) the ability of displaced persons and refugees to return \n     home;\n       (C) freedom of movement within East Timor, including access \n     by humanitarian organizations to all areas of East Timor; and\n       (D) the ability of UNAMET to resume its mandate, without \n     threat or intimidation to its personnel;\n       (2) the armed forces of Indonesia clearly--\n       (A) have ceased engaging in violence in East Timor;\n       (B) have ceased their support and training of armed \n     militias opposed to the independence of East Timor; and\n       (C) are withdrawing their forces from East Timor in \n     cooperation with a United Nations-supervised process of \n     transferring sovereignty from Indonesia to an independent \n     East Timor; and\n       (3) significant steps have been taken to implement the \n     results of the August 30, 1999, vote on East Timor's \n     political status, which expressed the will of a majority of \n     the Timorese people.\n\n     SEC. 5. MULTILATERAL EFFORTS.\n\n       The President should continue to coordinate with other \n     countries, particularly member states of the Asia-Pacific \n     Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, to develop a \n     comprehensive, multilateral strategy to further the purposes \n     of this Act, including urging other countries to take \n     measures similar to those described in this Act.\n\n     SEC. 6. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional \n     committees'' means the Committee on Foreign Relations and the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee \n     on International Relations and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I received a note that Senator Reed will \nnot be able to join us on this short notice, according to his staff. I \ndo want to take this last moment to say Senator Reed has been an \nextremely devoted Senator with regard to this issue, in fact, taking \nwhat I consider to be the rather courageous and difficult step of going \nto East Timor just prior to the election. Of course, we all know what \nhappened subsequently.\n  I express my admiration and thanks to Senator Reed of Rhode Island \nfor his work on this issue. I am sure he will address this at a future \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/16/senate-section/article/S11070-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
