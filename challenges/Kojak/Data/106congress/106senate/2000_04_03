Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business throughout the day with time under the control of \nSenator Bob Smith, Senator Brownback or his designee, Senator Craig or \nhis designee, and Senator Durbin or his designee. As previously \nannounced, no votes will occur during today's session of the Senate. \nHowever, the Senate will begin consideration of the budget resolution \nat 9:30 a.m. tomorrow, Tuesday morning, and votes can be expected \nduring each day and evening throughout the week.\n  The budget resolution is allowed up to 50 hours of debate, and quite \noften we have a series of votes at the end of that time. I hope we will \nnot get into a long list of amendments that will require votes right at \nthe very end. It is not a very good way to do business. Last year, \nafter a lot of hard work by Senator Reid and others, we were able to \nreduce that list to at least a reasonable number. But Senators should \nbe on notice that we will have to spend a good bit of time in session \non Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, probably going into the night at least \nWednesday and Thursday, and that there is a very good chance we will be \nin on Friday with votes.\n  If we can complete the budget resolution Thursday night, even if it \nmeans going late into the night, we will do that; otherwise, we will go \ninto Friday. But we will complete the budget resolution this week so we \ncan move forward with appropriations bills in the appropriations \nsubcommittees beginning next week.\n  Members should also be aware there are a number of important \ncommittee markups that will be occurring this week. So we are going to \nhave a very busy time.\n\n\n                          THE FIRST TARTAN DAY\n\n  Mr. President, I should note this is also the first week in history \nthat we will recognize those of us with Scottish heritage: Thursday, \nApril 6, will be the first Tartan Day. I understand the head of the \nChurch of Scotland will be here, as well as a number of visiting \nmembers of the Scottish Parliament.\n  I look forward to the opportunity to wear my kilt and wear a bit of \nthe tartan on Tartan Day. I ask all my colleagues to look through their \nScottish ancestry and find their tartan tie or something with which \nthey can mark their appreciation for the impact that Scotland has had \non our history. In fact, about half, maybe a little more than half of \nthe signers of the Declaration of Independence actually had Scottish \nancestry. So I am glad we will have this day to recognize that, and I \nlook forward to joining our Chaplain, Lloyd John Ogilvie, as we \ncelebrate this occasion.\n\n\n                        A NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will spend some time this week \ngiving serious thought to how we should proceed on the development of a \nnational energy policy and what we could do on a short-term basis to \ndeal with the price of gasoline. We are not sure exactly what is going \nto happen. There is some indication there will be an increase of \nproduction by the OPEC countries. It is not clear exactly how much that \nwill be or what impact it will have. If prices stay high or go higher, \nI think the American people are going to expect us to look at some \nalternatives, some short-term relief, and then also have a full debate \nabout what we can do for the future, in terms of more production, \nalternative fuels, conservation--a whole package of things that are \nlong overdue.\n  I think we are being given a second warning. We were given a warning \nin the late 1970s and 1980s when we had high gasoline prices, a \nshortage of supply, and gasoline lines. We knew there was a problem and \nthat we should do something about it. We made some efforts, but it has \nnot produced the results that we need. We are now dependent on foreign \noil for 55 percent of our\n\n[[Page S2030]]\n\noil needs. I think that is totally unacceptable and a threat to our \nnational security. During the week, I hope we can engage in some \ndiscussion and thought about this. We should be prepared to have some \nvotes in this area next week, after the budget resolution is completed.\n\n\n                        THE MARRIAGE PENALTY TAX\n\n  Mr. President, the week of April 10, voting not later than April 14, \nthe Senate will have a chance to indicate whether or not it believes we \nshould eliminate the marriage penalty tax. The House has voted \noverwhelmingly to eliminate that tax. The President has indicated he \nthinks we should phase it out. Now the Senate Finance Committee has \nacted on a package that will be available and will be acted on in the \nSenate that week of April 10. Like the Social Security earnings test, \nare we finally going to do what we have been talking about for years? \nThe Social Security earnings penalty was in place for 30 years but \nfinally, last week, the Congress did something about it.\n  We have been talking about how we were going to eliminate the \nmarriage penalty tax for 10 years. Are we going to do it? Are we \nfinally going to do something about it? Also, this one takes on \nparticular significance to me because our daughter was married last \nMay. She and her husband both work. She is a young professional woman. \nShe has discovered this applies to her and that they are going to pay \nmore taxes this year than they did last year, even though they make \nabout the same amount of money. She says: Dad, you must do something. \nSo we did something in the Finance Committee. Will we do it in the \nSenate? Will we rise to this challenge?\n  Would anybody like to try to explain this tax to the married couples \nin America, particularly newly married couples who are first confronted \nwith this marriage penalty tax? Would anybody like to defend it? Would \nanybody like to explain that it is fair and should be in place? No.\n  I have asked that question in all kinds of groups with all kinds of \nbackgrounds and philosophies, and not a single hand goes up to defend \nit. So the Senate has a chance to act affirmatively in this area the \nweek of April 10. I look forward to that.\n\n\n                          THE GONZALEZ MATTER\n\n  Mr. President, finally, and not least, obviously there is a lot in \nthe news media about the Gonzalez matter. I am not sure this is \nsomething that Congress should step into. I would like it to be handled \nin an appropriate forum, such as a family court, but the Government \nseems to be involved. The Government seems to be determined to send \nthis young boy back to Cuba. I think that is a mistake, without full \nopportunity for appeals and an appropriate court consideration of what \nis best for the young boy.\n  We may have some opportunity to consider this issue in the Senate. We \nwill be careful about how we proceed. But I do not think we can stand \nby as if we did not know what was going on. So I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in giving thought to an appropriate way to proceed on this \nmatter.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. If no Senator is seeking \nrecognition at this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/03/senate-section/article/S2030-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the leader is right, this is a historic \ntime. It is historic because this is the week we are going to begin \ndeliberations on the budget that will guide all of our spending for \nthis year. We have 13 appropriations bills and as soon as the budget is \nadopted, we can start appropriating.\n  I hope my friends on the majority side of the Senate will understand \nthat we really are doing quite well as a country. This all began in \n1993 when we voted on the deficit reduction plan. I am sorry to report \nit was not done in a bipartisan fashion. Every vote for that deficit \nreduction plan was cast by a Democrat. It passed the House of \nRepresentatives by one vote. In the Senate, it resulted in a tie that \nwas broken by the Vice President of the United States, Al Gore. As a \nresult of that action, the United States has seen on an unprecedented \namount of economic expansion.\n  In April, we reached 107 months of consecutive economic growth, the \nlongest period of economic growth in the history of this country. We \nare now 2 months beyond that and still growing. We have created about \n21 million new jobs. The majority of these jobs are high-wage jobs, \nhigh-paying jobs. We have had the lowest unemployment and the lowest \ninflation in 30 years.\n  We talk about the size of Government. Well, we have actually done \nsomething about the size of Government as a result of the program \nPresident Clinton initiated and which was supported in the Senate in \n1993 by a tie-breaking vote of Vice President Gore and in the House by \none vote. We have cut the size of Government. We have talked about the \nGovernment continually getting smaller. Now it is about the same size \nas when President Eisenhower was President. We talked for a year or two \nabout it being the size when President Kennedy was President. We have \ngone even beyond that.\n  Home ownership is the highest in the history of this country. The \ncountry is doing very well. I hope we continue the record economic \nexpansion because it does give us a historic opportunity.\n  We need to save Social Security. We need to make sure it is \nstrengthened. Now that it is going to be OK until about the year 2035, \nthe President wants to move forward and make sure it is OK for another \n20 to 30 years. We should do that as soon as we can.\n  We should do something to expand Medicare so that prescription drugs \nare part of the program. It is no longer adequate that we have \nhospitalization and some doctor care for senior citizens. It is \nimportant we realize they also need help with prescription drugs.\n  People over the age of 65 get an average of 18 prescriptions filled \nevery year. We need to do something about that. Sixty percent of senior \ncitizens have trouble paying for prescription drugs. Some do not get \nthe prescription drugs they need. Some, because they do not have enough \nmoney, take half a pill a day when they should take one pill a day. \nThey split the pills. People are actually going without food for \nmedicine. We need to make sure that we, in this richest country in the \nhistory of the world, the only superpower in the world, have some \nprogram for prescription drugs. I hope we do not squander this \nopportunity.\n  This already is a Presidential campaign issue. I think we should take \na look at what the Republicans are saying about Governor George W. \nBush's budget which there is going to be a tremendous tendency to adopt \non behalf of the majority.\n  Senator John McCain says:\n\n       But, more importantly, there is a fundamental difference \n     here. I believe we must save Social Security. We must pay \n     down the debt. We have to make an investment in Medicare. For \n     us to put all the tax cuts--all of the surplus into tax cuts \n     I think is not a conservative effort--I think it's a mistake.\n\n  Senator McCain is right. This country has a debt of over $5 trillion. \nWe should address that in this budget. We should not be going on \nspeculative tax cuts. It seems the only thing the Governor of Texas \nunderstands as a solution to a problem is a tax cut. We have an energy \ncrisis. What does he recommend? A tax cut, about which I am sure the \noil barons, the oil moguls in the Middle East, are jumping for joy. I \nguess George W. Bush thinks anytime the price of gas goes up, all the \nGovernment has to do is lower the tax and continue producing as much \noil as before, and it makes the Middle Eastern oil producers very \nhappy.\n\n[[Page S2031]]\n\n  He also suggested an income tax cut, even though a week ago it was \nreported in the press all over the country that income tax rates are at \ntheir lowest in the majority of categories. Our taxes are lower than \nthey have been for 40 to 50 years, depending on which category one is \nin. Yet George W. Bush wants an income tax cut. Again, what Senator \nMcCain says about that is:\n\n       Thirty-eight percent of Governor Bush's tax cut goes to the \n     wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.\n\n  We have Members in the House who disagree with the budget of George \nW. Bush. Lindsey Graham says:\n\n       It is a large tax cut that's going to eat up all the \n     surpluses if they come about. It does nothing, in my opinion, \n     fiscally responsible to reduce the national debt. It doesn't \n     address the Social Security issue. Here's what Governor Bush \n     said: ``There's plenty of money to take care of the debt, \n     take care of Social Security and give you a big tax cut. The \n     truth is this money is a projection 10 years in the future \n     and Congress' spending plan is going to destroy the \n     projection. If the economy goes south, he--\n\n  Meaning George W. Bush--\n\n     has dedicated all the surpluses to a tax cut. The $5.8 \n     trillion debt needs to be addressed quickly.\n\n  I could not agree more with Representative Lindsey Graham. We have to \naddress the debt. If we address the debt, we reduce the debt and it is \na tax cut for everybody. We pay hundreds of billions of dollars on \ninterest on the debt. If we did not do that, it would be money in \neveryone's pocket, not just the 38 percent that goes to the wealthiest \n1 percent of people in this country.\n  We are going to debate the budget this week to find out if we are \ngoing to adequately take care of the needs of this country. Can we meet \nthe demands we have? What demands do we have? One can look at all the \nappropriations bills and, at random pick, for example, the Interior \nappropriations bill. Our national parks are the envy of the world, but \nour national parks have a backlog of renovations and repairs of almost \n$10 billion. We are closing national parks. The national parks deserve \nsome attention. In the State of Nevada, we only have one national park \nand it too has a backlog of needed repairs. The people who work for the \nNational Park System live in quarters that are unbelievable. They are \nbad.\n  In Grand Canyon National Park, in the sister State of Arizona, they \nlive in facilities that are difficult to describe. They look like big \ntin cans. People who work to preserve or national parks should not have \nto live in facilities such as that.\n  We need to help our National Park System, not only with the living \nquarters of the people who work in the parks, but also simply to make \nit so that when tourists visit them, they can visit all the parks, and \nthat the roads are OK, the trails are OK, and, in fact, that we do a \nbetter job of preserving our parks.\n  We can look at every appropriations bill we have to consider this \nyear and there are things that need to be dealt with.\n  The point I am trying to make is, the American people recognize that \nthere are things we need to do other than cutting taxes. We need to \nmake sure we take care of Social Security, we address education, and, \nas I have already talked about, we need to do something about Medicare. \nThere are priorities the American people have that are more important \nthan reducing Federal income taxes, which are the lowest they have been \nin 40 to 50 years.\n  I hope, as this debate unfolds this week, we will be able to seize \nupon this opportunity to continue the record economic expansion that \nwas started in the 1993 Budget Deficit Reduction Act. I hope we can \nmeet this historic opportunity, on a bipartisan basis, and vote on \namendments that come before us on this budget bill not on strictly a \npartisan basis but on what is best for this country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/03/senate-section/article/S2031-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2031-S2032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is my understanding our focus this week \nwill be on the budget, as it should be. One of the things, of course, \nthat is very necessary is to address the budget each year, and one of \nthe things we haven't done that we should do, and are doing this year, \nis to address the budget early so we don't find ourselves at the end of \nthe session being sort of at the mercy of the President, who can kind \nof put the leverage on us to do what he wants us to do or else suspend \nGovernment operations and, of course, blame the Congress, which has \nhappened before.\n  In any event, when we are talking about budgets, it is easy to get \noff into the detail. That is what we will have to do. My friend from \nNevada talked about the plans for spending, and that we will have the \nbudget come up, and that we have fortunately, for the third time in 40 \nyears, some extra money--a surplus--in the operating budget. So many, \nparticularly on the other side of the aisle, are searching for ways to \nspend the money, which is fine. But it seems to me that the responsible \napproach we ought to take and the approach I believe most Americans \nwant us to take is to evaluate where we are with respect to Government, \nwhat the role of the Federal Government is in these various policies, \nand to make a determination as to what expenditures ought to be made \nthat are consistent with what we believe to be the legitimate role of \nthe Federal Government.\n  We need to talk about an analysis of that because what happens for \nthe rest of the year is pretty much guided by what you do in terms of \nthe budget--unless, of course, you simply ignore the budget later on. I \nhope that is not the case. So we ought to be talking in the areas that \nwill be under consideration. What is the role of the Federal Government \nwith respect to the private sector? What is the role of the Federal \nGovernment with respect to local and State government? What role should \nbe played there? It seems to me that that is basically where we ought \nto begin having made that decision, of course, which won't be unanimous \nbecause there is a good deal of philosophical difference as to where we \nought to go.\n  There are those who believe the more money you can spend on behalf of \nthe people by the Federal Government, the better off you are. There are \nthose of us who don't agree with that. Some believe the role of the \nFederal Government should be limited, that we ought to do the things \nthat encourage people to do things, give them the ability to do things \nfor themselves, and leave many decisions with the people in local and \nState governments. I agree with that.\n  We ought to be doing something specifically for Social Security. The \nPresident has been talking for several years about ``let's save Social \nSecurity.'' But he doesn't have a program at all to do that. Just to \nsay ``let's save Social Security'' isn't the proper approach. Indeed, \nwe have ideas on this side of the aisle as to what we ought to do. \nClearly, there are three options as to what you do to make sure the \nyoung people now paying in from their first paycheck 12.5 percent will \nbe able to have benefits when the time comes to do that. One is to \nraise taxes. Very few people are for that. Another, of course, is to \nreduce benefits. Very few are for that. The third option is to take \nthat account and make it a personal account for the person who has paid \nin the money, and allow, on their behalf, for this money to be invested \nin the private sector in equities or bonds or stocks so that the return \non that trust fund will be much higher than it is now and the benefits \nwill be there.\n\n  We talk about paying down the debt. It is a great idea. We have done \nvery little of that over time. We have a $5 trillion debt. This \ngeneration and preceding generations have spent it, and we are going to \nleave it up to others to pay for it. We have paid down the debt some \nwith respect to taking Social Security money and putting it over there \nin place of publicly held debt, which is a positive thing to do; the \ncosts are less. Really, to pay it down, we ought to be taking some of \nthe surplus out of the general fund and putting it over there. Frankly, \nwe don't do that unless we have a plan to do it--something like a \nmortgage in which we say over 15\n\n[[Page S2032]]\n\nyears, or whatever, we are going to pay that off. Then we can take so \nmuch every year to do that, and we are dedicated to doing it. That is \nnot the approach taken by the administration.\n  There is great concern about tax reduction. I certainly believe we \nought to take care of adequate spending, protecting Social Security, \npaying down the debt, but then what is wrong with tax reduction? That \nis where the money came from. Just because there is more money coming \nin as a result of a stronger economy doesn't mean we necessarily have \nan obligation to spend it, which is what the other side often says we \nought to do. Much of the tax reduction is just a fairness issue. For \ninstance, the marriage tax. Why is it that two people who are making a \ncertain amount of money as two single persons get married and they have \nto pay more taxes on the same amount of earnings? That is very unfair. \nPart of what we talk about in tax reduction is a matter of fairness. \nPart of it is also incentives to do other things.\n  So we will be talking about the Republican budget that will be coming \nbefore this Congress, in which we safeguard Social Security, shield \nMedicare, pay down the national debt, and at the same time work on the \nfairness issue. We will be protecting that surplus by not spending it, \nwhich is unique, only happening in the last several years. It \nstrengthens Medicare by increasing--as we did last year and again this \nyear--some of the reductions that were made in the balanced budget \namendment. We will reduce the national debt, hopefully, by using \noperational funds to do that, as well as Social Security dollars. We \nwill provide tax fairness for families. We need to do that. We need to \nbalance the budget again, as we have for about the third time in 40 \nyears. So that is a very good thing.\n  This budget, over time, reduces the debt by $177 billion, wipes it \nout over 13 years--if we stay with this budget. That is the kind of \ncommitment we ought to make. We talked about tax reduction. Think about \nwhat it is. This budget would provide about $150 billion in 5 years in \ntax relief to American families--over $13 billion next year alone in \nthe form of marriage penalty relief which, again, is a fairness tax. In \nthe form of educational assistance now, is reducing taxes a bad thing \nif we are going to--increase the health care deductibility? I don't \nbelieve so. We are seeking to provide more coverage for people--without \nmaking a total government program out of it--by giving some kind of tax \nrelief to do that.\n  I think this is going to be a very important debate and an important \ndiscussion. I understand there will be differences of view. That is \nwhat this body is all about, talking about different philosophies. \nThere will be different philosophies, such as saying the more spending \nwe have, the better government is and the better off everyone is. That \nis a point of view. I don't happen to share it. I think there ought to \nbe limitations on the size and role of government. We ought to be \nbuilding opportunity instead of doing those sorts of things.\n  I think we have a great opportunity to do some of the things we have \ntalked about for years; that is, to reduce the debt, to secure Social \nSecurity, and to provide some incentives for people to do things for \nthemselves.\n  We have the opportunity, and we will be doing it this week. I think \nwe ought to take into account not only the dollars that are there, and \nnot only the specific expenditures, but how we envision the role of \ngovernment over time. How does that fit into the idea of freedom and \nopportunity for all? What is the role of a government in that?\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/03/senate-section/article/S2032-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2032-S2034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRESCRIPTION DRUG AFFORDABILITY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a \nvery encouraging development and solution with respect to prescription \ndrugs.\n  I have come to the floor on more than 20 separate occasions over the \nlast several months to talk particularly about how America can no \nlonger afford to deny this critical coverage. Again and again, I cited \nexamples on the floor of this Senate about how our country cannot \nafford to deny seniors the opportunity to get prescription drug \ncoverage. I have talked, for example, about the exciting anticoagulant \ndrugs. These drugs allow a senior citizen, for example, for perhaps \n$1,000 or $1,500, to prevent a stroke which might end up costing more \nthan $100,000.\n  What is so exciting about these prescription medicines is that they \ndon't just help older people when they are very ill, but they are \nabsolutely key to keeping older people healthy by lowering blood \npressure and cholesterol. They will help senior citizens stay in the \ncommunity and will keep them from racking up those much larger health \ncare expenses under what is known as Part A of the Medicare Hospital \nInsurance Trust Fund.\n  Again and again, we have seen examples of how cholesterol-lowering \ndrugs can reduce death and expenses for senior citizens.\n  For example, heart disease is the leading cause of death for persons \n65 and older. Beta blockers can reduce long-term mortality by 25 \npercent, and they cost about $360 a year, or $30 a month.\n  One in five older women has osteoporosis. About 15 percent have \nsuffered fractures as a result this disease. This disease is the \nleading risk factor for hip fractures. Estrogen replacement can reduce \nthe risk of osteoporosis as well as cardiovascular disease. One \ncommonly used drug costs $20 a month. This is an investment that can \nhelp avoid those hip fractures and help avoid the extraordinary medical \nexpenses.\n  I must say that my own mother, who will be 80 years of age very \nshortly, had a hip fracture recently, and this drove home to me how \nthese prescription medicines can help avoid the kinds of health \nproblems that my mother and scores of others seniors have seen, and how \nproviding coverage now is an investment this Senate cannot afford to \npass up.\n  What was exciting about the developments in the budget resolution \nwas, first, that the Budget Committee committed $40 billion would be \ncommitted for this important program. For example, on the other side of \nthe Capitol, the House of Representatives talked about $40 billion, but \nthey could spend it on just about anything in the health care arena. \nThe Senate Budget Committee said we are going to make $40 billion \navailable for prescription drugs because it is high time we set in \nplace this important coverage.\n  Second, we provided a date certain to get this job done. Our \ncolleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, has been correct to say \nrepeatedly that the Senate Finance Committee has now held 14 hearings \non this issue. Clearly there is great interest in that committee in \nmoving forward.\n  The budget resolution says on this point that if the Senate Finance \nCommittee does not come forward with a prescription drug benefit on or \nbefore September 1st of this year, any Member of the Senate can come to \nthe floor of this body and bring this issue before the Senate.\n  The Presiding Officer of the Senate, who serves with me on the Senate \nCommittee on Aging, could come to the floor if he had a plan to deal \nwith prescription drugs. Senator Snowe and I have teamed up on a \nbipartisan basis. We are particularly grateful for the help of Senator \nGordon Smith last week in the Budget Committee. The resolution allows \nany group of Senators to come forward with legislation if the Senate \nFinance Committee does not report a prescription drug measure on or \nbefore September 1st of this year.\n\n  I think it is critical to note that many Senators in the leadership \nof both political parties were involved in this effort.\n  Senator Daschle has talked to me almost daily about the importance of \nthe Senate dealing with this issue, and dealing with it this year. He \nhas worked very hard to try to reconcile the various approaches \nSenators have on this issue. He also has been steadfast in saying how \nimportant it is that the Senate not put this off until after another \nelection.\n  There may be some colleagues on the Republican side and some on the \nDemocratic side who will say: Let's just talk about this in the \npolitical campaign.\n  I believe we can't afford to deny this coverage to the Nation's \nsenior citizens.\n\n[[Page S2033]]\n\n  Senator Daschle has been resolute in saying we ought to go forward \nand deal with this issue, and deal with it in this session of Congress.\n  I also want to commend several of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle: Senator Domenici, for example, in the Budget Committee, when \nthis issue got to a flash point; it would have been very difficult even \nto go forward. Senator Domenici worked with several of us, particularly \nSenator Snowe and Senator Smith, in order to bring the committee \ntogether on this point. We had some bipartisan support last week in the \nBudget Committee for taking tangible action on this issue.\n  What is really important is that every Senator understands that I and \nothers are going to stay at this issue again and again and again so the \nSenate does not miss this historic opportunity.\n  Too often, whether dating back to catastrophic health care \nlegislation or the failed efforts in 1993 and 1994 to pass \ncomprehensive health care reform, we have muffed. The Congress has \nmuffed the opportunity to put in place a historic breakthrough in terms \nof health care in our country. I think we have another such opportunity \nas a result of the work that was done in the Budget Committee last \nweek.\n  Only about one in four of our senior citizens has prescription drug \ncoverage. Many of them take up to 20 medicines a year. Something like \n20 percent of the Nation's senior citizens spend over $1,000 out of \npocket now on their prescription medicines. As a result of these and \nother factors, there is not a single specialist in the health care \nfield and not a Democrat or a Republican who would create a Medicare \nprogram today without including prescription drug coverage.\n  That is why the breakthrough we saw in the Budget Committee last week \nis so important. I think it is absolutely critical that we keep what \nwas done in the Budget Committee throughout this process. It may be \nchallenged on the floor of the Senate this week. My understanding is \nthat there will be Senators opposed to it, but I think we can build on \nthe work that was done last week in the Budget Committee. Again, I \ncommend Chairman Domenici, Senator Snowe, and Senator Gordon Smith, my \ncolleague from Oregon, for working with us on it--we can get this done; \nwe can ensure that action on prescription drugs is tied to reform of \nthe Medicare program.\n  Many of my colleagues have stressed this. I think they are right. I, \ntoo, happen to believe it would be better to have comprehensive \nMedicare reform that includes prescription drug coverage.\n  I think it is also clear--and I stress this because it is so \nimportant to this Senator and many on this side of the aisle--that we \ncannot afford to wait. We want to use competitive purchasing principles \nfor prescription drug benefit. We will use the kind of principles that \nmake sense in private sector health care. We will ensure the benefit is \nvoluntary. No senior would have to choose this particular benefit if \nthey preferred their existing coverage. However, we do want to put in \nplace a universal coverage program. We want to get it done before this \nCongress adjourns.\n  We are going to fight with all our strength to protect what was done \nin the Budget Committee last week on the floor of the Senate this week \nand when it goes to conference and throughout the process so that if \nthe Senate Finance Committee does not act to provide this benefit on or \nbefore September 1 of this year, that any Member of this body will be \nable, without facing points of order, come to the floor of the Senate \nand force the Senate to deal with this critical issue.\n  I am sure when my colleagues go home and talk to constituents they \nwill find what I have found; that is, the question of prescription drug \ncoverage is one of the two or three most pressing issues our \nconstituents care about.\n  We have families and older people all across this country who are \nwalking on an economic tightrope balancing their food bills against \ntheir fuel bills and their fuel bills against their medical costs.\n  I have been bringing to the floor of the Senate cases of older people \nwho are supposed to take three pills and they take only two. They are \nbreaking their lipid-lowering capsules in half--the drugs that help to \ndeal with cholesterol and heart problems--because they cannot afford to \ntake the full pill.\n  I spoke recently about a case from Hillsboro, OR, my home State. A \nphysician actually put an elder person in a hospital for 6 weeks \nbecause that elderly man could not afford the medicine on an outpatient \nbasis. Allowing outpatient coverage of medicine is what we are trying \nto accomplish in the Senate. Seniors could get their medicine without \ngoing into the hospital. That older gentleman in Hillsboro, OR, had to \nbe hospitalized for 6 weeks so he could get his medicine paid for under \nwhat is known as Part A of the Medicare program. That is a classic \nexample of how, under today's health care system, dollars are wasted by \nhaving a person hospitalized rather than getting help in the community \nand, at the same time, facing the predicament of taking longer to get \nhealthy than if these benefits have been available more promptly on an \noutpatient basis for the elderly.\n  Last week's developments in the Budget Committee were encouraging. \nMany predicted the Budget Committee would not adopt binding language \nwith respect to prescription drugs that would allow the Senate to get \nthis program enacted, and get it enacted this year. However, the Budget \nCommittee came together. I commend my colleagues, Senator Snowe and \nSenator Gordon Smith. They have worked with me for 15 months. We now \nhave funding available in the budget resolution. We have a date certain \nwhen it can actually come before the Senate. If the Finance Committee \ndoesn't act on or before September 1, any Senator could bring this \nissue to the floor of the Senate and it would be tied to the question \nof Medicare reform.\n  There is a long way to go. We have to get through the discussion this \nweek. Then we will have a conference committee. Then many Members will \nwork closely with the Finance Committee where there are many interested \nSenators who have devoted time to this prescription drug issue.\n  What was done in the Budget Committee last week was something of a \nbreakthrough. It was a very encouraging development for the millions of \nseniors and families who are watching how Congress deals with this \nissue, watching to make sure we do it this year, do it on a bipartisan \nbasis, and not just send it out to be another topic and cannon fodder \nfor the political campaign this fall.\n  As I have made clear, I intend to keep coming back to the floor again \nand again raising examples of why this Nation cannot afford to deny \nprescription drug coverage for the elderly. More than 4,000 seniors \nfrom Oregon have written me since I have begun this effort. The cases \nillustrate in a dramatic way how important it is that Congress deal \nwith this issue now.\n  I intend, with my colleagues, to come back again and again and again \nuntil we get this coverage for the Nation's older people. This country \ncan no longer afford to have the Congress deny this coverage. With the \nwork done in the Budget Committee, we have an opportunity now to deal \nwith this issue promptly. The seniors who come to our town hall \nmeetings with their prescription drug bills tell how their private \ninsurance doesn't cover their prescriptions. Because they cannot afford \nprescription medicine, very often they get sicker. They are the ones \nwho have a right to expect this Congress to act.\n  The developments last week for the first time give me a tangible \nsense that we are going to be able to get this done. It was concrete \nevidence that the Congress understands how important this issue is. \nMany of my colleagues have said this is one of their top two priorities \nfor this session of Congress. Certainly it is for this Senator. We are \ngoing to keep coming back to this floor, stressing the need for action \non their prescriptions until the Senate moves to do what should have \nbeen done years ago.\n  When Medicare was enacted in 1965, it did not cover prescription \ndrugs. Now the big buyers, the health maintenance organizations and the \nhealth plans, are able to negotiate discounts. That means senior \ncitizens in Alabama, Oregon, and across the country pay more for their \nmedicine because they are not able to get the benefits of the big \nbuyers. Seniors are going to have the power of the big buyers if we can \nact this session. A number of the key\n\n[[Page S2034]]\n\nbills before the Senate give older people bargaining power in the \nmarketplace in order to be able to afford their medicine. That is key--\naffordability--the ability of senior citizens to afford their \nprescription medicine so they don't have to give up food, rent, and \nheat.\n  Making drugs affordable for seniors has been important to all Members \nwho have focused on this issue. Yet there are many seniors who struggle \nto make ends meet because they cannot get medicine in an affordable \nway. The budget resolution provides the opportunity now for those \nseniors to get relief. I will do everything in my power, and there are \nmany of my colleagues who will, as well, to defend what was done in the \nBudget Committee last week on prescription drugs throughout this \nprocess. If we have a floor fight on this measure, those who try to \nknock out what the Budget Committee did ought to understand how strong \nMembers feel who worked to get that prescription drug coverage in the \nbudget resolution. I hope we will not see that kind of fight.\n  I hope the work done by Senator Snowe and Senator Smith, along with \nSenator Daschle, Senator Conrad, and myself, the group of Members who \nworked with the Budget Committee, can be preserved.\n  It ought to be preserved for the Nation's senior citizens. Those are \nthe people who are counting on us to deliver on this critical issue. I \nintend to keep coming back to this floor again and again and again \nuntil we have achieved this major health care reform that the older \npeople of this country richly deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I inquire of the Chair, what is the business on the floor \nat this moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will then proceed for the next few \nmoments in morning business.\n  I believe that when I am done, I will also conclude the Senate for \nthe day and take us out, as others who had been planning morning \nbusiness comments for the day are not going to be with us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/03/senate-section/article/S2034-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2034-S2037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ENERGY PRICES AND GAS TAXES\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thought I would come to the floor today \nto speak again about energy and the current energy cost crisis in which \nthis Nation finds itself.\n  Many of us have been to the floor numerous times over the last \nseveral weeks comparing our current situation and the tremendous runup \nin gas prices with this administration's lack of an energy policy and \nhow they correlate--or if they relate.\n  I have said, most critically, over the last several weeks, the only \npolicy in town is the ``tin cup'' policy: Give our Secretary of Energy \na tin cup, and send him to foreign oil-producing nations to beg for a \nlittle crude.\n  He has been begging. He wanted a lot more. He begged for 2 million \nbarrels a day in additional production. He got considerably less than \nthat. I think it is now a wait-and-see: How does this level out? What \ndo the markets say? What is the consumer going to pay at the gas pump \nin July? My guess is, the consumer is going to be paying near $2 a \ngallon for regular gasoline, depending on where they are in the \ncountry.\n  The reason for this situation is what I would like to talk about this \nafternoon. Congress can respond in some ways. But we cannot increase \noil production in the short term because, largely, we have had a policy \nof reducing oil production in this country for the last two decades, \nand it takes time to bring that production back on line. A great many \npeople out there are opposed to increasing domestic production--all in \nthe name of the environment or all in opposition to using hydrocarbons \nor some other issue that has helped shape the Clinton/Gore energy \npolicy over the last 8 years.\n  When the Clinton-Gore administration came to town in 1993, its \nannounced intention was to drastically alter the way the Nation used \nenergy, especially fossil fuels. The President and the Vice President \ndetermined that a broad-based Btu tax would force us away from coal and \noil and natural gas to renewable energies, such as solar and wind and \nbiomass. That objective has remained the hallmark of this \nadministration's energy policy--until now; that is, until the day \nbefore yesterday, when the President was blaming the Congress, saying \nwe had failed to reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--the salt \ndomes in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have stored about 570 million \nbarrels of crude oil.\n  The President promised his Btu tax would raise nearly $72 billion \nover 5 years, from 1994 to 1998, and marketed it as fair, helpful to \nthe environment, that it would force down our dependence on foreign \noil, and that it would have trivial impacts on consumers.\n  Congress did not pass the Btu tax because we thought it would be \ndamaging to the consumer. And over the years we have become \nincreasingly more dependent upon foreign oil. I doubt the President can \ndeclare a victory because he was unable to suck $72 billion out of the \nback pockets of Americans while at the same time he advanced policies \nthat slowed down crude oil production in our country.\n  In fact, the Btu tax would have unfairly punished energy-intensive \nStates and industries. Estimates by the American Petroleum Institute \nand the National Association of Manufacturers predicted the tax would \nhurt exports, reduce GDP by $38 billion, and destroy 700,000 American \njobs.\n  That is why the Congress finally refused to pass the tax, over the \nPresident's and the Vice President's objection. Vice President Gore and \nPresident Clinton claimed the tax was needed to balance the budget and \nfund large new spending programs to offset the negative impact of the \ntax. They also claimed that use of crude oil imports would be reduced \nby 400,000 barrels a day.\n  At that time, DOE's own projections predicted--this is \nthe President's own Department of Energy--that the tax would shave oil \nimport growth by less than one-tenth in 10 years. DOE also predicted \nthat by the year 2000, Americans would depend on foreign oil for three-\nfifths of their total crude oil requirements.\n\n  So quite the opposite was going on inside the administration. The \nPresident was talking politics, and his own Department of Energy was \nanalyzing the matter and coming up with some very interesting facts.\n  The American Petroleum Institute, in testimony, said:\n\n     . . . even if imports were to fall by the full 400,000 \n     barrels a day claimed by the Administration, the cost of $34 \n     billion in lost GDP is excessive relative to other \n     alternatives for improving energy security. Using the \n     Administration's optimistic predictions, the cost of the Btu \n     tax works out to about $230 per barrel.\n\n  Of course, that would have been devastating to an economy that is \nhighly dependent upon fossil fuels that not only make our cars and \ntrucks go, but feed the whole petrochemical industry which manufactures \ncarpeting, herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, and plastics, all of \nthose things that make up our very large, integrated economy--\ntherefore, the 700,000 estimated jobs lost if we were to raise the \nprice of crude oil to $230 a barrel.\n  In the end, Congress did the right thing; we refused the President's \nand the Vice President's policy and said it would simply create havoc \nin our economy. Congress did agree to raise taxes on transportation \nfuels by 4.3 cents--the first time the Congress has actually put a tax \non fuel--and then put it into the general fund of the Treasury. Of \ncourse, it was argued to be a deficit reduction tax.\n  A couple of years ago, we finally pulled that tax out of the general \nfund and put it back in the surface transportation fund, where all \nhighway fuels taxes have gone historically, to fund the construction of \nroads, highways, and bridges.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration's obsession with fossil fuel use \nreduction has actually put us in the position we find ourselves today. \nThe President, on March 7, 2000, at the White House said:\n\n\n[[Page S2035]]\n\n\n       Americans should not want them [oil prices] to drop to $12 \n     or $10 a barrel again because that. . .takes our mind off our \n     business, which should be alternative fuels, energy \n     conservation, reducing the impact of all this on global \n     warming.\n\n  He is referring again to the cost of fuel. He simply said it would \nmove us away from a desire for alternative fuels if we were to see low \ngasoline and fuel prices. Isn't that terrible? The alternative fuels \nwere synthetics, highly subsidized by as much as $25 to $30 a barrel by \ntax money and, of course, alternative energy and electricity by solar \nvoltaic cells and by wind machines.\n\n  The only problem is, I have not yet seen a car, or a truck for that \nmatter, going down the road with a solar cell on the top of it. I don't \nthink they run very well that way. Somehow the President and the Vice \nPresident, in their hatred of fossil fuels, have forgotten that point.\n  That is kind of an overview of 1993 to the present. What has happened \nduring this administration? Domestic oil production is down 17 percent, \nand our crude oil consumption is up 14 percent. Dependence on foreign \nsources of crude oil has risen to 56 percent of our total crude \nrequirements. In 1973, during the Arab oil embargo, our dependency was \nonly 36 percent. I can remember that time.\n  I am sure some listening this afternoon will remember the gas lines, \nthe frustration and even the violence that occurred when Americans \nfound out for the first time there wasn't an abundance of energy. There \nwas a shortage. They couldn't get what they needed for their commuting \nor the running of their businesses.\n  Since that time, while this country has struggled to put a policy \ntogether, other policies of our Government, largely environmental \npolicies--some for the right reason--have progressively reduced our \noverall ability to produce and use domestic energy sources. That, \ncoupled with the fixation of this administration on eliminating fossil \nfuels, now brings us to that point where we are now over 56-percent \ndependent.\n  We all remember in the early 1990s we were fighting a war in the \nMiddle East. Why? Well, to help some of our allies. Those allies were \nlarge producers of crude oil, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. We were fighting \nIraq because the Iraqis had crossed the border and started the war. In \nthe end, as they retreated and we were victorious, they set fire to \nmany oil wells in Kuwait. We remember that phenomenal picture from the \nMiddle East of black clouds of smoke as those oil wells burned. Many of \nour oil field workers went in and put the fires out for our neighbors.\n  Now, what is the irony of that? Today, the very enemy we fought is \nselling over 700,000 barrels of crude oil each day to the United \nStates. Something is wrong about that. Something is wrong about an \nabsence of foreign policy that has allowed that to happen. That is the \nreality of where we are.\n  Americans grow angry when they understand this administration only \nhas excuses and solar cells and windmills for an energy policy. They \nunderstand that the Clinton/Gore foreign policy, working hand in glove \nwith its non-energy policy, now tolerates that we buy Iraqi oil.\n  Of course, we are not sure where that money goes and what it is used \nfor. Is Saddam Hussein being allowed to build another war machine with \nthe millions of dollars a day that pour out of the pockets of our \nconsumers into the treasury of Iraq? The Clinton-Gore administration, \nwhile making much of increased appliance efficiency, greater use of \nrenewables from biomass and other ideas, ignores a very fundamental \nfact. A large part of our energy use cannot be addressed by these \nmeasures.\n  I am not suggesting we not pursue new technologies and alternatives. \nWhere a solar cell fits, put one up; where wind farms work, we ought to \nhave them. We ought to be striving to build the efficiencies of the new \nwind turbines. At the same time, those will not fuel a nation that \nproduces the kind of growth we produce and builds its efficiencies \nbased on flexible transportation and the ability to send our people and \nour products in an integrated way around the Nation and around the \nworld.\n  The administration's failure to encourage domestic oil production and \nproduction of coal and natural gas has led us to this point of near \ncrisis. This Congress will engage in the very near future in debating \nthe issue to see what we can do in the short term to help solve the \npressure being placed on our consumers, but we also will be looking at \nlong-term policy to see if we can't begin to produce more of our own \nresources again.\n\n  For example, if we have the right tax incentives and if we were able \nand willing to build a floor for the small 15-barrel-or-less producer, \nwe are not talking about the major oil companies. We are talking \nfarmers and ranchers and private property owners spread all across the \nmid to lower south central part of our country and southwest that are \nknown as stripper well producers. Their break even is about $17 a \nbarrel. When gas oil crude prices went to $10 a barrel last year, many \nof those wells were shut in. If we would help encourage that production \nonce again, we could produce well over a million barrels of oil back \ninto our economy that is not producing today.\n  I think that is tremendously good policy, if the tradeoff is putting \nmoney in Saddam Hussein's hand to build a new war machine versus \nhelping subsidize or provide incentives for the small producer across \nthis country to bring back on line a million barrels a day of domestic \ncrude oil.\n  The administration has refused to acknowledge the vast oil reserves \nand gas reserves we have offshore and in ANWR, the Alaska National \nWildlife Refuge. We know we can explore and produce in these areas in \nan environmentally sound way. ANWR is an area about the size of Dulles \nAirport relative to the whole State of Virginia. Those opposed to \nexploring ANWR would have you believe that if we drilled inside Dulles \nAirport that it would pollute the whole State of Virginia.\n  How foolish can some of these people get who make those kinds of \narguments? The President listened. The Vice President listened. They \nhave refused to promote a policy that would allow safe and sound \ndrilling to provide the energy for our country.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration recently announced a ban on future \nexploration for most of the Federal Outer Continental Shelf through the \nyear 2012. That is where the real big oil reserves are left in this \ncountry, offshore. I know we all remember the oil spills of 20 years \nago on the coast of California. What no one is talking about is the \ntremendous new technology that has been applied to the gulf and other \nareas where drilling goes on, where wells don't leak today and blowouts \ndon't happen. If they do occur accidentally, they are immediately shut \ndown. All of those technologies are in existence. I think anyone who \nhas looked at the record of drilling in the Gulf of Mexico recognizes \nthat it is clean and it is sound. It is extracting the resource and is \nhaving almost a zero impact on the environment of the gulf area and its \ncoast lines.\n  In 1996, the administration resorted to the little used 1906 \nAntiquities Act. The President argued it was a major emergency and he \nhad to lock up these millions of acres in Utah. What he was really \nlocking up, for fear that it might be mined, was 23 billion tons of \nlow-sulfur, high-value coal that could have been used to generate \nelectricity in our country today and well into the future.\n  All of these areas that would have been mined--and they were a very \nsmall part of the over 1 million acres that the President locked up in \nthe Grand Starcase/Escalante National Monument--would have been \nreclaimed in a natural way because that is part of the environmental \npolicy of our country today. If you are going to disturb the land, once \nyou have done so, you must put it back in as near a natural way as is \npossible.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration has vetoed legislation that would \nhave opened the Coastal Plain of the remote Alaskan national wildlife \nreserve. It is estimated that there are 15 billion barrels of domestic \ncrude oil up there.\n  The administration also has ignored a report prepared by the National \nPetroleum Council, requested by the Energy Secretary, explaining how \nthe Nation can increase production and use of domestic natural gas \nresources from about 22 trillion cubic feet per year to more than 30 \ntrillion cubic feet per\n\n[[Page S2036]]\n\nyear over the next 10 to 12 years. In other words, we could add nearly \n10 trillion cubic feet of new domestic gas to our energy mix.\n  That would allow the Northeast, which is tremendously dependent upon \noil for space heat, to convert to a much cleaner fuel, a much more \nefficient fuel, a fuel of natural gas, and bring down their dependency \non oil fuel for home heat and space heat.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration has shown little interest in solving \nour domestic energy problems until now, as the foreign oil producers \nhave forced crude up to over $30 a barrel last month. Gasoline prices, \nlast week, were $2 a gallon in San Francisco.\n  Mr. President, I argue that the Clinton-Gore administration has acted \nin other ways designed to force us away from the use of a reliable, \navailable, relatively inexpensive fossil fuel, and the only argument \nthe President had this weekend during his radio address was: Congress, \nyou are to blame.\n  Yet I have listed numerous vetoes or efforts to block our \nadministrative and rulemaking processes that have actually blocked \nproduction in our country. That is why many of us have suggested to \nthis President that he needs to step back and work with Congress to \ndefine a national energy policy that promotes increased domestic crude \noil and natural gas production, while looking at all of the other \nalternatives we have and the new technologies, especially clean coal \ntechnology. Nothing should be done in isolation of the other. It ought \nto well be a total package that we would want to work on.\n  My distinguished friend from West Virginia, Senator Robert Byrd, \nspoke eloquently last week on the subject. I want to add a few thoughts \nto his comments. The U.S. has the world's largest demonstrated coal \nreserve base and more than 90 percent of our total fossil fuel energy \nreserves are in coal. Yet this administration has downplayed new coal-\nburning and clean coal technologies--the very kind of thing we ought to \nwant to bring online as much of our electricity is generated by coal, \nand as we define and refine the science of global warming and attempt \nto understand the cause or causes and how to respond. At present rates \nof consumption our coal will last for up to 270 years. In other words, \nwe blessed with huge coal reserves. Yet this administration's lack of \npolicy has forced us into near crisis. Coal is used to generate 56 \npercent of our electrical supply and about 88 percent of the Midwest's \nelectrical needs. Coal use for electrical power has risen more than 250 \npercent since 1970, while sulfur dioxide emissions has decreased by 21 \npercent due to technology and, in part, due to some of the money we put \ninto research sponsored here that has moved that kind of technology.\n  Now, as my colleagues think about all of this, here is a quote I \nfound by the President over the weekend. Remember, I was talking about \ncoal. I was talking about our tremendous need for production of \nelectricity. Here is what the President was saying over the weekend:\n\n       I think to a much greater degree, then, we have a \n     commitment to the notion that we can improve the environment \n     while we grow the economy--\n\n  None of us disagrees with that. But he goes on,\n\n     . . . that is what the whole global warming issue is about. \n     All over the world, there are people who just don't believe \n     that you can get rich unless you put more stuff in the air \n     that heats up the earth. They think you have got to burn more \n     coal and oil in the digital economy. That is not true.\n\n  Mr. President, what you have said isn't true. What runs the digital \neconomy of our country? What turns on the computer? What fires up the \nInternet? A solar cell? A wind mill? I don't think so, Mr. President. \nIt is the abundance of electrical power.\n  Let me repeat: Coal use for electrical power has risen more than 250 \npercent since 1970, and the sulfur dioxide emissions during that time \nhave actually decreased by 21 percent. Furthermore, the gas the \nClinton/Gore administration blames for global warming, carbon dioxide, \nisn't a poisonous gas and isn't regulated under the Clean Air Act.\n\n  The point I am making is simply this: An abundant economy--the kind \nwe are experiencing today that has us at or near full employment--is a \ndirect result of an abundance of relatively inexpensive energy. The \nhistory of our country has been based on the availability of energy. \nThat is why we are the wealthy Nation we are today. Look at the rest of \nthe countries of the world; as they strive to grow and provide an \neconomy for their people, they develop their energy base.\n  My wife and I and a group of business people from Idaho were in China \nin December. The skies were so dark there in Beijing that you could \nhardly see because they don't have the clean coal technology we have. \nYet they are growing very rapidly and they need an abundant source of \nenergy. They are building dams and nuclear reactors, and they are \nsearching for a cleaner way to burn their coal because they know if \nthey are to grow and provide their country and their citizens with \nopportunity, they are going to have to use coal to generate electric \nenergy. President Clinton, I don't think you really get it. Do you \nthink this new hi-tech, digital economy happens out there on its own? \nIt is, in fact, a product of a nation who has an abundant energy base. \nIn November of 1999, the EPA sued several coal-burning utilities, \nclaiming they had made major modifications in their facilities without \napplying for new resource review permits. Utilities maintained that \nthese were modifications made during routine maintenance. They were \nstill providing high-quality energy with less emissions. Why is EPA out \nthere suing at this moment, at a time when there is a deficiency of \nenergy in this country and we ought to be promoting more? Certainly, we \nought to be promoting it with all of the newest technology. But you \ndon't do that by suing; you do that with policies that encourage people \nto do the right thing.\n  Lastly--and this is the irony of this administration which likes to \nthink it has an energy policy--this morning, Secretary of Interior \nBruce Babbitt is out looking for a dam to tear down. Eight years ago, \nhe said he would like to knock down a really big dam while he is \nSecretary of Interior. Really big dams produce a lot of big power, Mr. \nSecretary, or haven't you figured that out? Big renewable power, \nhydropower. It doesn't have emissions; it is very clean. Yes, our \nfathers and forefathers chose to dam some rivers to generate \nelectricity. Those were efficient ways to do it then, and they are \nfinding out they are environmentally sound ways to do it now. Yet Mr. \nBabbitt wants to tear down one, two, or three dams, or I guess as many \nas he can get his hands on, or find a policies that make it difficult \nto keep these dams running.\n  Why don't we simply work to improve those dams? Why don't we make \nthem more efficient by adding new technology to the dams, putting new \nturbines in them that are friendly and more efficient. It is beginning \nto happen nationwide. Why should we deny our country 20 percent of its \nenergy base, or bad mouth that energy source, or attempt to tear it \ndown? No, what I am trying to say this afternoon in this collection of \nthoughts is, Mr. President, I don't think you get away by just pointing \na finger at a single action of the Congress and saying you didn't give \nme emergency authority over the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, so \ntherefore our energy crisis is your fault, Congress.\n  I think I have named 15 or 20 issues on which this administration has \ntaken a strong anti-energy, anti-production approach toward dealing \nwith energy policy in this country. Mr. President, we can solve our \nenergy problems. We are a marvelously creative Nation. But we don't do \nit by simply saying no. We do it by producing where we can produce, by \ncreating less dependency on foreign sources, while at the same time \nbuilding the kind of science and technology that allows us ever \nincreasing energy efficiency and environmental improvement. I think in \nthe coming years we are going to debate the global climate change \nissue. Getting rid of hydrocarbons isn't the answer. Getting rid of \nfossil fuels isn't the answer. It is finding better and more efficient \nways to use them, and then allowing our technology to be sold and \ntransferred to the world at large. If our clean coal technology were at \nuse in China today, China would be a healthier, more environmentally \nclean place to live.\n\n  Someday they will be able to afford that technology, and they will \nwant it. It is our businesses and our companies that develop it that \nought to be encouraged to sell it to them. That is\n\n[[Page S2037]]\n\ncalled leadership. It simply isn't crawling into a cave and getting a \ncandle to light your way and heat your space. It is building an \nefficient system recognizing that all sources of energy ought to be at \nplay at this moment so that we can truly develop an abundant energy \npackage for ourselves and our Nation's future. Thank you Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/03/senate-section/article/S2037-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL WEBSTER, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nand say farewell to an outstanding Air Force officer and former Marine, \nBrigadier General Ernest R. Webster, upon his retirement from the Air \nForce after more than thirty-two years of commissioned service. \nThroughout his career, Brigadier General Webster has served with \ndistinction, and it is my privilege to recognize his many \naccomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has \nprovided the Air Force and our Nation.\n  General Webster is a native of my home State, having been born in \nAnguilla, Mississippi. He entered the United States Marine Corps \nOfficer Candidate School Quantico, Virginia in 1967. After successfully \nqualifying as a Marine aviator, he served as a pilot and intelligence \nofficer for the Naval Special Landing Forces in the Caribbean region. \nHe served his nation as an aviator in Southeast Asia while stationed \nwith the 1st Marine Air Wing in the Republic of Vietnam. General \nWebster was an aircraft maintenance officer and test pilot at New \nRiver, North Carolina prior to his transfer into the United States Air \nForce in January 1972. After attending Maintenance Officer School at \nChanute Air Force Base, Illinois, he was assigned to Homestead Air \nForce Base, Florida, where he was chief of maintenance, flight \nexaminer, chief of safety, and operations officer for the 301st \nAerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron.\n  As a major, he was assigned to Sheppard and Little Rock Air Force \nBases for flight training where he mastered the C-130 Hercules weapon \nsystem. His next assignment was chief of safety for the 920th Weather \nReconnaissance Group at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. \nHe then moved to March Air Force Base, California, serving as deputy \ncommander for operations at the 303rd Aerospace Rescue and Recovery \nSquadron. He was promoted to colonel in 1985.\n  During that same year, Colonel Webster took command of the 907th \nTactical Airlift Group, Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base, in Ohio. \nHe was promoted to deputy chief of staff for operations, Headquarters \n14th Air Force, Dobbins Air Force Base, Headquarters Air Force Reserve, \nto serve as assistant deputy chief of staff for operations where he \nplayed a critical role in the call-up of thousands of Air Force reserve \nmembers to Southwest Asia during Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. \nHe then moved to Duke Field, Florida, to assume command of the 919th \nSpecial Operations Wing where he directed critical tactical operations. \nIn 1994 he assumed command of the 403rd Wing at Keesler Air Force Base, \nMississippi. Colonel Webster was promoted to Brigadier General in 1995.\n  General Webster's accomplishments are many. Units under his command \nreceived the Outstanding Unit Award in three of the five years he was \nin command. His ``Flying Jennies'' of the 815th Airlift Squadron \naccomplished Denton Amendment humanitarian missions in Honduras, \nArgentina, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Russia, \nand many other areas struck by disaster. His ``Hurricane Hunters'' of \nthe 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron were world-famous for \nproviding critical hurricane information to residents of coastal areas \nin the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n  During his stellar career, General Webster has served the United \nStates Marine Corps, the United States Air Force, and our great Nation \nwith excellence and distinction. He provided exemplary leadership to \nthe best-trained, best-equipped, and best-prepared citizen-airmen force \nin the history of our Nation. General Webster is a model of leadership \nand is a living example of our military's dedication to the core values \nof service before self, integrity first, and excellence in all \nendeavors.\n  General Webster will retire from the United States Air Force on April \n3, 2000 after thirty-two years and six months of dedicated commissioned \nservice. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish \nGeneral Webster blue skies and safe landings. Congratulations on \ncompletion of an outstanding and successful career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/03/senate-section/article/S2037-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ESTUARY PARTNERSHIP RESTORATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to say just a few words about \nthe Estuary Partnership Restoration Act of 1999, which was passed by \nunanimous consent on Thursday March 30th. This bill contains language \nthat reauthorizes the Chesapeake Bay Program. The success of the Bay \nprogram, and the partnerships that have been established as a result of \nthat program, have led to improved water quality in the Bay, enhanced \nthe lives of those of us lucky enough to live in the Chesapeake \nwatershed, and added to the body of scientific knowledge that we have \nabout estuaries, fisheries, and watersheds in general.\n  As Governor of Virginia I negotiated the original Chesapeake Bay \nAgreement. Last week, I had the opportunity to see that the Senate \nrecognizes all the successes that have come from that program. The fact \nthat the Chesapeake Bay program has enough support to be passed by \nunanimous consent is gratifying indeed. I am also excited at the \nprospect of expanding the oyster restoration program, which will \nenhance Bay water quality in a number of ways, and will continue to \nwork for that expansion.\n  My only regret is that John Chafee, the original architect of the \nEstuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act, was not here with us. His \nleadership on these issues was steadfast, his ability to convince us \nall to take right action remarkable. I was thinking of John Chafee, \nlast week, wishing he could have joined in the happy moment that he \nhelped make possible. I was happy to have the opportunity to contribute \nto his legacy, and know that his work will be with us for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/03/senate-section/article/S2037-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2037-S2038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE LATE LIEUTENANT COLONEL, UNITED STATES ARMY RETIRED \n                          MARGARET L. ELLERMAN\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor \nthe late Lieutenant Colonel Margaret L. Ellerman, United States Army \nRetired.\n  A native of Michigan, Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman entered the Army as \na private in 1964, after seven years of teaching in parochial schools. \nFollowing attendance at basic training and advanced individual \ntraining, she was selected for Officer Candidate School, from which she \ngraduated in 1966.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman served as a Finance Officer for most of \nher career in a variety of command and staff positions. In 1968, she \nwas selected for overseas duty in Germany, in an era when military \nwomen were virtually hand-picked for duty outside the United States. \nOther overseas assignments followed in Thailand and Turkey. Lieutenant \nColonel Ellerman received numerous military honors, awards and \ndecorations. Among these were three awards of the Meritorious Service \nMedal, the Army Commendation Medal and the Good Conduct Medal.\n  While on active duty, Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman, received her \nBachelor of Science Degree in 1972 from Eastern Michigan University, \nand her Masters in Business Administration from Northwest Missouri \nState University. In addition, she was a graduate of numerous \nprofessional military finance and resource management courses. In 1977, \nLieutenant Colonel Ellerman was a graduate of the United States Army \nCommand and General Staff College.\n  After retirement from the United States Army in 1986, Lieutenant \nColonel Ellerman entered civilian employment at the Washington \nMetropolitan Area Transit Authority, from which she retired in 1998. \nUpon this retirement, she founded her own corporation, Partners In \nSuccess, which assisted individuals establish their own businesses.\n  From 1991 until her death in March 2000, Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman \ncontinued to serve her country and the women who had, are, and will \nserve in the military forces of the United\n\n[[Page S2038]]\n\nStates. She lent her considerable energy and economic knowledge to the \nWomen In Military Service For America Memorial Foundation on the Board \nof Directors. Joining the cause in 1991, Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman \nworked tirelessly to see that this Memorial, housing and showcasing the \nachievements of all women who serve our nation in military service, was \nfunded, erected and dedicated in October 1997. Through her ``behind the \nscenes'' efforts, this Memorial stands as a monument to our \ncountrywomen who freely choose to dedicate their lives in military \nservice to the United States.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman never stopped sharing the part of her \nthat made her a dedicated teacher, career Army Officer, and \nphilanthropic entrepreneur. Her charismatic character continues to \ninspire the men and women who knew and worked with her. The Department \nof Defense and the American people were well served by this selfless \nand dedicated Army soldier and civilian citizen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/03/senate-section/article/S2038-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2038-S2039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROBERT TAYLOR\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Bob \nTaylor on his accomplishments at the University of Louisville Business \nSchool and in the Louisville business community.\n  From the moment Bob took over the reigns at UofL's business school in \n1984, good things started to happen. Bob is a man of vision and \nincredible instincts about what works in the business world. He brought \nthose talents to UofL to improve the quality of the program and \nstrengthen the students' capabilities in a real-life business \nenvironment. Bob succeeded at both of those goals and brought UofL's \nrankings among U.S. business schools up to an honorable level and \ncontinues to rise in national recognition.\n  Numerous academic achievements mark Bob's tenure at UofL, including \nSuccess magazine's recent naming of UofL as one of the best in the \nnation for training entrepreneurs. Also, the business school has begun \noffering master's level programs overseas and now offers varied \nadvanced degrees.\n  Several personal achievements are evidence of Bob's knowledge of and \ninfluence in the business world. He became the president of the \nAmerican Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business last year, which \nserves as the accrediting body for business schools nationwide. Bob \nalso serves the community on the board of directors for the Rawlings \nCompany, Logan Aluminum Inc., the Louisville Police Administration \nAdvisory Commission, and the Metro United Way.\n  Many of Bob's colleagues and members of the Louisville business \ncommunity have noted his extraordinary leadership skills. Bob took on a \nhuge responsibility when he came to UofL, and he continues to press on \nto reach higher goals for the school. For this, I commend Bob and thank \nhim for his dedication to UofL. His hard work has paid off and students \nfrom across the state and even the nation are reaping the benefits of \nBob's success. His experience in business and success at Louisville is \na sign of more good things to come for the school and the great State \nof Kentucky.\n  Bob, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your \ncommitment to the students and faculty at UofL's College of Business \nand Public Administration. I have every confidence in your ability to \nlead the school to even greater heights with more accomplishments and \nsuccesses in the years to come.\n  Mr. President, I also ask that an article which ran in the Louisville \nCourier-Journal on Sunday, March 19, 2000, appear in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Mar. 19, 2000]\n\nU of L Dean Doubles as Civic Leader--Low-Key Leader Guides a School and \n                              a Community\n\n                           (By David McGinty)\n\n       When he arrived in Louisville in 1984 to become dean of the \n     University of Louisville's business school, Robert Taylor did \n     not expect to hang around.\n       ``I was going to stay here three years and move on,'' he \n     recalled.\n       For perhaps one of the few times in his life, Taylor's \n     expectation for the future was faulty. At the time, he \n     thought his job would be fairly simple: To help a small \n     business school win accreditation.\n       Tayor did not foresee the complications and twists that \n     life would throw in his path, or where they would lead.\n       The business school now has master's-level programs in \n     three overseas locations, offers several advanced degrees and \n     is becoming known in academic circles.\n       In a recent U.S. News and World Report survey its \n     undergraduate programs ranked 93rd among more than 327 \n     programs--not in the top ranks, but a big step up from the \n     bottom levels the program once inhabited.\n       Success magazine has ranked the school's program for \n     training entrepreneurs among the best in the nation. And last \n     year Taylor became president of the American Assembly of \n     Collegiate Schools of Business, the accrediting body for \n     business schools.\n       Apart from his academic accomplishments, Taylor may also be \n     one of the most influential civic figures you never hear of.\n       He serves on a number of boards, charities and advisory \n     bodies, including the boards of directors of the Rawlings Co. \n     and Logan Aluminum Inc. and the Louisville Police \n     Administration Advisory Commission. He is most proud, he \n     said, of his service on the board of Metro United Way--but \n     his greatest influence may be through less visible \n     activities.\n       Although his style is low-key and his name rarely surfaces \n     publicly, behind-the-scenes business and political leaders \n     have learned he is a prescient adviser, and they seek him \n     out. His contacts are widespread and so, although it is \n     subtle and anonymous, is his contribution to Louisville's \n     economic well-being.\n       ``You've got to put him among the top five'' civic leaders \n     whose contributions are not publicly known, said Bill \n     Samuels, president of Maker's Mark distillery.\n       Samuels, a longtime friend, said Taylor ``is as bright as \n     anybody I've ever met. . . . I've never had a dull \n     conversation with him, and I've had several thousand. In a \n     sense he's been a mentor to me.''\n       Former Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson said that while he \n     was in office he often worked with Taylor, particularly in \n     urban workshops on visits to other cities to observe their \n     accomplishments. After a visit Taylor would lead group \n     discussions on what lessons could be learned, and he proved \n     to be an adroit moderator with a gift for shaping a plan of \n     action.\n       ``Whenever we needed someone who could think outside the \n     box and be a visionary and push the envelope a little bit, we \n     always looked to the dean,'' Abramson said.\n       ``There have been times when we worked on issues that I \n     wasn't ready for a public discussion on, that I would take \n     him into my confidence. He's a tremendous listener, and he \n     can frame a consensus out of disparate views.''\n       ``He's probably one of the biggest assets to the \n     community,'' said David Wilkins, chairman of Doe-Anderson \n     Advertising and Public Relations. ``He moves in and out of \n     virtually every circle and level of the community with ease. \n     He's trusted and respected by everybody.''\n       Wilkins' relationship with Taylor is a close one, with an \n     unusual twist. In 1994, in what Taylor said was a pivotal \n     moment for him, he took a six-month sabbatical to work at \n     Wilkins' agency and learn firsthand how the business world \n     works.\n       At the time, Taylor was winding up a decade of busy and \n     often frustrating activity. He took charge of the business \n     school just as it was entering an unforeseen period of \n     problems and change.\n       At Doe-Anderson, Taylor made an abrupt eye-opening \n     transition from academia to the business world. He quickly \n     learned ``that the environment business people were facing \n     was changing daily.''\n       ``Everything was getting much faster,'' Taylor said. ``The \n     turnaround time on work was faster, the demands were faster. \n     In order to be successful, they had to be completely \n     flexible.''\n       Taylor's own background is a mix of academic and military, \n     with no private business experience. A native of Pittsburgh, \n     he graduated from Allegheny College in 1961 with a U.S. Air \n     Force commission through the ROTC. Later he received advanced \n     business degrees from Ohio State University and Indiana \n     University.\n       He had a eight-year stint at the U.S. Air Force Academy in \n     Colorado, rising to head the Department of Economics, \n     Geography and Management. After retiring from the Air Force \n     in 1981 he joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin-\n     Stevens Point, where he headed the division of business and \n     economics. From that job he came to U of L.\n       After his stint at Doe-Anderson, Taylor returned to U of L \n     convinced that the business school was not keeping up with \n     the world outside, so he set up teams of faculty to \n     reorganize the school.\n       ``I said, `Look, gang, we are not adapting quickly enough. \n     We've got to do something different so that we have the same \n     sense of urgency, the same flexibility that our students must \n     have if they're going to be successful in business.' ''\n       The response, Taylor acknowledged, was not overwhelming. \n     One faculty member said he'd left the business world because \n     ``I didn't want that kind of frenzy.''\n       And some of the results weren't successful. But such \n     stumbles are part of progress, Taylor believes, and the \n     school has made progress. When he came back from his \n     sabbatical, he set long-range goals for the school.\n       He wanted it to achieve national recognition for its public \n     administration programs. That recognition is coming, and the \n     school's overseas programs are gaining an international \n     reputation and alumni base.\n\n[[Page S2039]]\n\n       He wanted the schools entrepreneurial program to start new, \n     student-run businesses. That effort is beginning to get off \n     the ground through a venture-capital fund, a \n     telecommunications research center intended to incubate new \n     businesses and the aid of former business executives on the \n     faculty.\n       He wanted the school's endowment to top $25 million. It has \n     topped $21 million and is growing.\n       In Louisville's business community the school's reputation \n     is increasingly solid, in no small part because of Taylor's \n     own credibility. Civic figures who have worked with him say \n     he has been a prescient advocate--sometimes the first--for \n     coming economic trends.\n       He was one of the first voices in the community to preach \n     the importance of new technology and the Internet.\n       Doug Cobb, who was until recently president of Greater \n     Louisville Inc., said Taylor ``is the original champion of \n     the idea that Louisville needs to be more entrepreneurial.''\n       Cobb, himself one of the city's foremost advocates of \n     entrepreneurial activity, said he feels like ``I walk in his \n     steps a little bit.''\n       To Taylor, this kind of trailblazing is part of the job. \n     ``I feel like my responsibility to this community is that we \n     have to be on the leading edge, and somebody has to be \n     telling people what is happening.''\n       It has not always been rewarding work, and by his own \n     account Taylor has not always been successful. In the early \n     1990s, he foresaw a coming shortage of workers in the \n     community and began urging measures to attract immigrants to \n     Louisville.\n       But when he proposed such steps to a committee planning \n     economic-development strategies for the community, the \n     reception was hostile. ``I'll never forget. A couple of \n     aldermen and other people just berated me, saying we've got \n     unemployed in this community we've got to help first.''\n       Without rancor, Taylor characterized that period as his \n     ``biggest failure'' to direct the community's attention to an \n     important issue.\n       Now, of course, employers are straining to find qualified \n     workers. Civic leaders are pondering how to ensure that the \n     community will have enough workers in the future to support \n     economic growth--and one of the strategies is to attract \n     immigrants.\n       ``I think if we had been prepared, we wouldn't have had the \n     pressure on our work force that we have today, and we could \n     be bringing in more people than we bring in now,'' he said.\n       That's an opportunity missed. Taylor now is pushing the \n     community's business leaders not to miss other opportunities \n     that he sees, particularly in rapidly evolving technologies.\n       Traditionally, Taylor said, Louisville has been content to \n     follow economic trends. That's got to stop, he said. ``I'm \n     saying the trends are occurring so quickly we can't afford a \n     time lag. We have to go and grab it.''\n       Taylor is already pushing his faculty to what he sees as \n     emerging possibilities for global education--a degree program \n     that involves courses in two countries, two universities, two \n     languages, two cultures.\n       ``That's my new vision,'' he said, and he admits that when \n     he espouses it ``some people are looking at me like I've gone \n     off the deep end.''\n       To his friends, that's just vintage Bob Taylor.\n       ``He's such an individualist,'' Samuels said. ``He enjoys \n     ideas that are in the unconventional vein. And I've got so \n     much respect for his judgment. I think he'd make a wonderful \n     CEO.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/03/senate-section/article/S2039-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL COUNTY GOVERNMENT WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the work of \nthe 3,072 county governments nationwide, and in particular the work of \nthe 87 counties in my home State of Minnesota. Counties are often an \ninvisible, but extremely important part of our intergovernmental \nsystem. As we enter the new millennium, it is important to review our \npast as we look to the future.\n  County governments began as a response to the needs of the early \nsettlers of our country, tracing their beginnings to the roots of the \nAnglo-Saxon local government 1,000 years ago. Counties first appeared \nin colonial America, making them older than the Republic itself.\n  Traditionally, counties performed state-mandated duties which \nincluded assessment of property, record-keeping, such as property and \nvital statistics, maintenance of rural roads, and administration of \nelection and judicial functions. Today, counties are moving rapidly \ninto other areas, undertaking programs relating to consumer protection, \neconomic development, employment training, planning and zoning, and \nwater quality, to name just a few.\n  During the week of April 9-15, counties across the country are \ncelebrating National County Government Week. This celebration is an \nannual event for counties. First held in 1991, the goal of National \nCounty Government Week is to raise public awareness and understanding \nabout the roles and responsibilities of the Nation's counties.\n  More than 1,000 counties annually participate in National County \nGovernment Week by holding a variety of programs and events at the \nnational, State and local levels. These include tours of county \nfacilities, presentations in schools, meetings with business and \ncommunity leaders, recognition programs for volunteers, briefings on \nenvironmental projects, and the adoption of proclamations.\n  There is a theme each year for National County Government Week. This \nyear, the theme is ``Honoring Volunteers.'' The National Association of \nCounties will recognize the top county volunteer programs in the \ncountry at a ceremony April 13 in Washington, D.C. Counties will \nreceive awards for their ``Acts of Caring'' efforts that they undertook \nusing volunteers to improve their country's quality of life.\n  I know that NACo has encouraged counties to hold a town meeting this \nweek during National County Government Week or launch a series of \ncommunity-wide dialogues to solicit citizen participation in \nidentifying the community's most pressing issues and establishing a \ncomprehensive vision for the future. I hope many Minnesota counties \nwill participate in these activities.\n  NACo has also suggested that, as we enter the new millennium, \ncounties reflect on the past and prepare for the future. As part of \nthat process, counties may want to apply for the designation of \nMillennium Community. This designation, presented by the White House \nMillennium Council, is given to counties and cities that have \nestablished programs that ``Honor the Past--Imagine the Future.''\n  One of NACo's priorities for this year is economic development. The \norganization is encouraging counties to create and expand businesses, \nnoting the fact that businesses not only provide jobs, but also keep \ntaxes in check. Therefore, counties have been encouraged to promote \neconomic development programs.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to support the efforts of \nour county governments not only in Minnesota, but throughout the \ncountry. National County Government Week will again be successful in \nraising pubic awareness of the good work of our nation's county \ngovernments and how they help improve the lives of their \nresidents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/03/senate-section/article/S2039-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2039-S2040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-8297.

CONGRESSIONAL LOCK BOX FOR SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, the Social \n     Security trust funds are off-budget for purposes of the \n     President's budget submission and the concurrent resolution \n     on the budget;\n       (2) the Social Security trust funds have been running \n     surpluses for 18 years;\n       (3) these surpluses have been used to implicitly finance \n     the general operations of the Federal Government;\n       (4) in fiscal year 2001, the Social Security surplus will \n     reach $166,000,000,000;\n       (5) in fiscal year 1999, the Federal budget was balanced \n     without using Social Security;\n       (6) the only way to ensure that Social Security surpluses \n     are not diverted for other purposes is to balance the budget \n     exclusive of such surpluses; and\n       (7) Congress and the President should take such steps as \n     are necessary to ensure that future budgets continue to be \n     balanced excluding the surpluses generated by the Social \n     Security trust funds.\n       (b) Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate to consider any revision to \n     this concurrent resolution, or any other concurrent \n     resolution on the budget, or any amendment thereto or \n     conference report thereon, that sets forth a deficit for any \n     fiscal year.\n       (2) Deficit levels.--For purposes of this subsection, a \n     deficit shall be the level (if any) set forth in the most \n     recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     that fiscal year pursuant to section 301(a)(3) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (c) Budget Committee Determinations.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of new budget authority, outlays, direct \n     spending, new entitlement authority, revenues, deficits, and \n     surpluses for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis \n     of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the House \n     of Representatives or the Senate, as applicable.\n       (d) Exception.--Subsection (b) shall not apply if--\n       (1) the most recent of the Department of Commerce's \n     advance, preliminary, or final reports of actual real \n     economic growth indicate that the rate of real economic \n     growth for each of the most recently reported quarter and the \n     immediately preceding quarter is less than 1 percent; or\n       (2) a declaration of war is in effect.\n       (e) Social Security Look-Back.--If in any fiscal year the \n     social security surplus is used to finance general operations \n     of the Federal Government, an amount equal to the amount used \n     shall be deducted from the available amount of discretionary \n     spending for the following fiscal year for purposes of any \n     concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (f) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsection (b) may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n\n     SEC. 202.

EMERGENCY DESIGNATION POINT OF ORDER IN THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Designations.--\n       (1) Guidance.--In making a designation of a provision of \n     legislation as an emergency requirement under section \n     251(b)(2)(A) or 252(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985, the committee report and any \n     statement of managers accompanying that legislation shall \n     analyze whether a proposed emergency requirement meets all \n     the criteria in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Criteria.--\n       (A) In general.--The criteria to be considered in \n     determining whether a proposed expenditure or tax change is \n     an emergency requirement are--\n       (i) necessary, essential, or vital (not merely useful or \n     beneficial);\n       (ii) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up \n     over time;\n       (iii) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring \n     immediate action;\n       (iv) subject to subparagraph (B), unforeseen, \n     unpredictable, and unanticipated; and\n       (v) not permanent, temporary in nature.\n       (B) Unforeseen.--An emergency that is part of an aggregate \n     level of anticipated emergencies, particularly when normally \n     estimated in advance, is not unforeseen.\n       (3) Justification for failure to meet criteria.--If the \n     proposed emergency requirement does not meet all the criteria \n     set forth in paragraph (2), the committee report or the \n     statement of managers, as the case may be, shall provide a \n     written justification of why the requirement should be \n     accorded emergency status.\n       (b) Point of Order.--When the Senate is considering a bill, \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report, a point \n     of order may be made by a Senator against an emergency \n     designation in that measure and if the Presiding Officer \n     sustains that point of order, that provision making such a \n     designation shall be stricken from the measure and may not be \n     offered as an amendment from the floor.\n       (c) Waiver and Appeal.--This section may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n       (d) Definition of an Emergency Requirement.--A provision \n     shall be considered an emergency designation if it designates \n     any item an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A) or 252(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (e) Form of the Point of Order.--A point of order under \n     this section may be raised by a Senator as provided in \n     section 313(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (f) Conference Reports.--If a point of order is sustained \n     under this section against a conference report the report \n     shall be disposed of as provided in section 313(d) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n     SEC. 209. RESERVE FUND PENDING INCREASE OF FISCAL YEAR 2001 \n                   DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The functional totals with respect to discretionary \n     spending set forth in this concurrent resolution, if \n     implemented, would result in legislation which exceeds the \n     limit on discretionary spending for fiscal year 2001 set out \n     in section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985. Nonetheless, the allocation \n     pursuant to section 302 of the Congressional Budget and \n     Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to the Committee on \n     Appropriations is in compliance with current law spending \n     limits.\n       (2) Consequently unless and until the discretionary \n     spending limit for fiscal year 2001 is increased, aggregate \n     appropriations which exceed the current law limits would \n     still be out of order in the Senate and subject to a \n     supermajority vote.\n\n[[Page S2045]]\n\n       (3) The functional totals contained in this concurrent \n     resolution envision a level of discretionary spending for \n     fiscal year 2001 as follows:\n       (A) For the discretionary category: $596,579,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $590,326,000,000 in outlays.\n       (B) For the highway category: $26,920,000,000 in outlays.\n       (C) For the mass transit category: $4,639,000,000 in \n     outlays.\n       (4) To facilitate the Senate completing its legislative \n     responsibilities for the 106th Congress in a timely fashion, \n     it is imperative that the Senate consider legislation which \n     increases the discretionary spending limit for fiscal year \n     2001 as soon as possible.\n       (b) Adjustment to Allocations.--Whenever a bill or joint \n     resolution becomes law that increases the discretionary \n     spending limit for fiscal year 2001 set out in section 251(c) \n     of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n     1985, the appropriate chairman of the Committee on the Budget \n     shall increase the allocation called for in section 302(a) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to the appropriate \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n       (c) Limitation on Adjustment.--An adjustment made pursuant \n     to subsection (b) shall not result in an allocation under \n     section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 that \n     exceeds the total budget authority and outlays set forth in \n     subsection (a)(3).\n\n     SEC. 210.

An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n\n     SEC. 211.

EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       Congress adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such \n     they shall be\n\n[[Page S2046]]\n\n     considered as part of the rules of each House, or of that \n     House to which they specifically apply, and such rules shall \n     supersede other rules only to the extent that they are \n     inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.\n\n               TITLE III--SENSE OF THE SENATE PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CONTROLLING AND ELIMINATING \n                   THE GROWING INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM OF \n                   TUBERCULOSIS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) According to the World Health Organization--\n       (A) nearly 2,000,000 people worldwide die each year of \n     tuberculosis-related illnesses;\n       (B) one-third of the world's total population is infected \n     with tuberculosis; and\n       (C) tuberculosis is the world's leading killer of women \n     between 15- and 44-years old and is a leading cause of \n     children becoming orphans.\n       (2) Because of the ease of transmission of tuberculosis, \n     its international persistence and growth pose a direct public \n     health threat to those nations that had previously largely \n     controlled the disease. This is complicated in the United \n     States by the growth of the homeless population, the rate of \n     incarceration, international travel, immigration, and HIV/\n     AIDS.\n       (3) With nearly 40 percent of the tuberculosis cases in the \n     United States attributable to foreign-born persons, \n     tuberculosis will never be eliminated in the United States \n     until it is controlled abroad.\n       (4) The means exist to control tuberculosis through \n     screening, diagnosis, treatment, patient compliance, \n     monitoring, and ongoing review of outcomes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assumes that additional \n     resources should be provided to fund international \n     tuberculosis control efforts at $60,000,000 in fiscal year \n     2001, consistent with authorizing legislation approved by the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 302. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE \n                   CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in 1998, 33.2 percent of women in the labor force have \n     children under 14;\n       (2) in 1998, 65.2 percent of women with children younger \n     than age 6, and 78.4 percent of women with children ages 6 \n     through 17 were in the labor force, and 41.6 percent of women \n     with children younger than 3 were employed full-time;\n       (3) 1,920,000 couples both working and with children under \n     18 had family incomes of under $30,000 (10.3 percent);\n       (4)(A) in 1998, 11,700,000 children out of 21,300,000 (55.1 \n     percent) under the age of 5 have employed mothers;\n       (B) 18.4 percent of children under 6 are cared for by their \n     fathers at home;\n       (C) another 5.5 percent (562,000) are looked after by their \n     mother either at home or away from home; and\n       (D) in other words, less than a quarter (23.9 percent) of \n     these children are taken care of by 1 parent;\n       (5) a 1997 General Accounting Office study found that the \n     increased work participation requirement of the welfare \n     reform law will cause the need for child care to exceed the \n     known supply;\n       (6) a 1995 study by the Urban Institute of child care \n     prices in 6 cities found that the average cost of daycare for \n     a 2-year-old in a child care center ranged from $3,100 to \n     $8,100;\n       (7) for an entry-level worker, the family's child care \n     costs at the average price of care for an infant in a child \n     care center would be at least 50 percent of family income in \n     5 of the 6 cities examined;\n       (8) a large number of low- and middle-income families \n     sacrifice a second full-time income so that a parent may be \n     at home with the child;\n       (9) the average income of 2-parent families with a single \n     income (a family with children, wife does not work) is \n     $13,566 less than the average income of 2-parent families \n     with 2 incomes;\n       (10) a recent National Institute for Child Health and \n     Development study found that the greatest factor in the \n     development of a young child is ``what is happening at home \n     and in families''; and\n       (11) increased tax relief directed at making child care \n     more affordable, and increased funding for the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant, would take significant steps toward \n     bringing quality child care within the reach of many parents, \n     and would increase the options available to parents in \n     deciding how best to care for their children.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume--\n       (1) that tax relief should be directed to parents who are \n     struggling to afford quality child care, including those who \n     wish to stay home to care for a child, and should be included \n     in any tax cut package; and\n       (2) a total of $4,567,000,000 in funding for the Child Care \n     and Development Block Grant in fiscal year 2001.\n\n     SEC. 303. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TAX RELIEF FOR COLLEGE \n                   TUITION PAID AND FOR INTEREST PAID ON STUDENT \n                   LOANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in our increasingly competitive global economy, the \n     attainment of a higher education is critical to the economic \n     success of an individual, as evidenced by the fact that, in \n     1975, college graduates earned an average of 57 percent more \n     than those who just finished high school, compared to 76 \n     percent more today;\n       (2) the cost of attaining a higher education has outpaced \n     both inflation and median family incomes;\n       (3) specifically, over the past 20 years, the cost of \n     college tuition has quadrupled (growing faster than any \n     consumer item, including health care and nearly twice as fast \n     as inflation) and 8 times as fast as median household \n     incomes;\n       (4) despite recent increases passed by Congress, the value \n     of the maximum Pell Grant has declined 23 percent since 1975 \n     in inflation-adjusted terms, forcing more students to rely on \n     student loans to finance the cost of a higher education;\n       (5) from 1992 to 1998, the demand for student loans soared \n     82 percent and the average student loan increased 367 \n     percent;\n       (6) according to the Department of Education, there is \n     approximately $150,000,000,000 in outstanding student loan \n     debt, and students borrowed more during the 1990's than \n     during the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's combined; and\n       (7) in Congress, proposals have been made to address the \n     rising cost of tuition and mounting student debt, including a \n     bipartisan proposal to provide a deduction for tuition paid \n     and a credit for interest paid on student loans.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that any tax cut package \n     reported by the Finance Committee and passed by Congress \n     during the fiscal year 2001 budget reconciliation process \n     include tax relief for college tuition paid and for interest \n     paid on student loans.\n\n     SEC. 304. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE \n                   NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the National Institutes of Health is the Nation's \n     foremost research center;\n       (2) the Nation's commitment to and investment in biomedical \n     research has resulted in better health and an improved \n     quality of life for all Americans;\n       (3) continued biomedical research funding must be ensured \n     so that medical doctors and scientists have the security to \n     commit to conducting long-term research studies;\n       (4) funding for the National Institutes of Health should \n     continue to increase in order to prevent the cessation of \n     biomedical research studies and the loss of medical doctors \n     and research scientists to private research organizations; \n     and\n       (5) the National Institutes of Health conducts research \n     protocols without proprietary interests, thereby ensuring \n     that the best health care is researched and made available to \n     the Nation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume increased funding \n     in function 550 (Health) for the National Institutes of \n     Health of $2,700,000,000, reflecting the commitment made in \n     the fiscal year 1998 Senate Budget Resolution to double the \n     National Institute of Health budget by 2003.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING FUNDING LEVELS IN \n                   EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that of the amounts provided for elementary \n     and secondary education within the Budget Function 500 of \n     this resolution for fiscal years 2001 through 2005, such \n     funds shall be appropriated in proportion to and in \n     accordance with the levels authorized in the Educational \n     Opportunities Act, S. 2.\n\n     SEC. 306. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ADDITIONAL BUDGETARY \n                   RESOURCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In its review of government operations, the General \n     Accounting Office noted that it was unable to determine the \n     extent of improper government payments, due to the poor \n     quality of agency accounting practices. In particular, the \n     General Accounting Office cited the Government's inability \n     to--\n       (A) ``properly account for and report billions of dollars \n     of property, equipment, materials, and supplies and certain \n     stewardship assets''; and\n       (B) ``properly prepare the Federal Government's financial \n     statements, including balancing the statements, accounting \n     for billions of dollars of transactions between governmental \n     entities, and properly and consistently compiling the \n     information in the financial statements.''.\n       (2) Private economic forecasters are currently more \n     optimistic than the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Blue \n     Chip expects 2000 real GDP growth of 4.1 percent, whereas the \n     Congressional Budget Office expects 3.3 percent growth. From \n     1999 through 2005, Blue Chip expects real GDP to grow more \n     than 0.3 percentage points faster per year than the \n     Congressional Budget Office does. Using budgetary rules of \n     thumb, this latter difference translates into more than \n     $150,000,000,000 over the 5-year budget window.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels contained in this resolution assume that--\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\n       (1) there are billions of dollars in wasted expenditures in \n     the Federal Government that should be eliminated; and\n       (2) higher projected budget surpluses arising from \n     reductions in government waste and stronger revenue inflows \n     could be used in the future for additional tax relief or debt \n     reduction.\n\n     SEC. 307. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON REGARDING THE INADEQUACY OF \n                   THE PAYMENTS FOR SKILLED NURSING CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Congress confronted and addressed the funding crisis \n     for medicare beneficiaries requiring skilled nursing care \n     through the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999;\n       (2) Congress recognized the need to address the inadequacy \n     of the prospective payment system for certain levels of care, \n     as well as the need to end arbitrary limits on rehabilitative \n     therapies. Congress restored $2,700,000,000 to reduce access \n     threats to skilled care for medicare beneficiaries; and\n       (3) Currently, more than 1,600 skilled nursing facilities \n     caring for more than 175,000 frail and elderly Americans have \n     filed for bankruptcy protection.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Administration should identify areas where they \n     have the authority to make changes to improve quality, \n     including analyzing and fixing the labor component of the \n     skilled nursing facility market basket update factor; and\n       (2) while Congress deliberates funding structural medicare \n     reform and the addition of a prescription drug benefit, it \n     must maintain the continued viability of the current skilled \n     nursing benefit. Therefore, the committees of jurisdiction \n     should ensure that medicare beneficiaries requiring skilled \n     nursing care have access to that care and that those \n     providers have the resources to meet the expectation for high \n     quality care.\n\n     SEC. 308. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CARA PROGRAMS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that, if the Congress and the President so \n     choose, the following programs can be fully funded as \n     discretionary programs in fiscal year 2001, including--\n       (1) the Land and Water Conservation Fund programs;\n       (2) the Federal aid to Wildlife Fund;\n       (3) the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Grants;\n       (4) the National Historic Preservation Fund;\n       (5) the Payment in Lieu of Taxes; and\n       (6) the North American Wetlands Conservation Act.\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON VETERAN'S MEDICAL CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) this budget addresses concerns about Veteran's medical \n     care;\n       (2) we successfully increased the appropriation for \n     Veteran's medical care by $1,700,000,000 last year, although \n     the President had proposed no increase in funding in his \n     budget; and\n       (3) this year's budget proposes to increase the Veteran's \n     medical care appropriation by $1,400,000,000, the level of \n     funding in the President's budget.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume an increase of \n     $1,400,000,000 in Veteran's medical care appropriations in \n     fiscal year 2001.\n\n     SEC. 310. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON IMPACT AID.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Impact Aid, as created by Congress in 1950, \n     fulfills a Federal obligation to local educational agencies \n     impacted by a Federal presence;\n       (2) the Impact Aid provides funds to these local \n     educational agencies to help them meet the basic educational \n     needs of all their children, particularly the needs of \n     transient military dependent students, Native American \n     children, and students from low-income housing projects; and\n       (3) the Impact Aid is funded at a level less than what is \n     required to fully fund ``all'' federally connected local \n     educational agencies.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Impact Aid \n     Program strive to reach the goal that all local educational \n     agencies eligible for Impact Aid receive at a minimum, 40 \n     percent of their maximum payment under sections 8002 and \n     8003.\n\n     SEC. 311. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR INCREASED \n                   ACREAGE UNDER THE CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM \n                   AND THE WETLANDS RESERVE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Wetlands \n     Reserve Program (WRP) have been successful, voluntary, \n     incentive-based endeavors that over the last decade and a \n     half have turned millions of acres of marginal cropland into \n     reserves that protect wildlife in the United States, provide \n     meaningful income to farmers and ranchers (especially in \n     periods of collapsed commodity prices), and combat soil and \n     water erosion. CRP and WRP also provide increased \n     opportunities for hunting, fishing, and other recreational \n     activities.\n       (2) CRP provides landowners with technical and financial \n     assistance, including annual rental payments, in exchange for \n     removing environmentally sensitive farmland from production \n     and implementing conservation practices. Currently, CRP \n     includes around 31,300,000 acres in the United States.\n       (3) Similarly, WRP offers technical and financial \n     assistance to landowners who select to restore wetlands. \n     Currently, WRP includes 785,000 acres nationwide.\n       (4) Furthermore, bipartisan legislation has been introduced \n     in the 106th Congress to increase the acreage permitted under \n     both CRP and WRP. The Administration also supports raising \n     the acreage limitations in both programs.\n       (5) Unfortunately, both CRP and WRP may soon become victims \n     of their own success and their respective statutory acreage \n     limitations unless Congress acts. Given the popularity and \n     demand for these conservation programs, the statutory acreage \n     limitations will likely exhaust resources available to \n     producers who want to participate in CRP or WRP. As currently \n     authorized, CRP has an enrollment cap of 36,400,000 million \n     acres and WRP is limited at 975,000 acres. As of October 1, \n     1999, enrollment in CRP stood at approximately 31,300,000 \n     million acres and enrollment in WRP at just over 785,000 \n     acres.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that Congress and \n     the Administration should take steps to raise the acreage \n     limits of the CRP and WRP in order to make these programs \n     available to aid the preservation and conservation of \n     sensitive natural soil and water resources without negatively \n     effecting rural communities. Further, such actions should \n     help improve farm income for agricultural producers and \n     restore prosperity and growth to rural sectors of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 312. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TAX SIMPLIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the tax code has become increasingly complex, \n     undermining confidence in the system, and often undermining \n     the principles of simplicity, efficiency, and equity;\n       (2) some have estimated that the resources required to keep \n     records and file returns already cost American families an \n     additional 10 percent to 20 percent over what they actually \n     pay in income taxes; and\n       (3) if it is to enact a greatly simplified tax code, \n     Congress should have a thorough understanding of the problem \n     as well as specific proposals to consider.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation shall develop a report and alternative \n     proposals on tax simplification by the end of the year, and \n     the Department of the Treasury is requested to develop a \n     report and alternative proposals on tax simplification by the \n     end of the year.\n\n     SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT BY THE \n                   DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FEDERAL TRADE \n                   COMMISSION REGARDING AGRICULTURE MERGERS AND \n                   ANTICOMPETITIVE ACTIVITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice is \n     charged with the civil and criminal enforcement of the \n     antitrust laws, including the review of corporate mergers \n     likely to reduce competition in particular markets, with a \n     goal of protecting the competitive process;\n       (2) the Bureau of Competition of the Federal Trade \n     Commission is also charged with enforcement of the antitrust \n     laws, including the review of corporate mergers likely to \n     reduce competition;\n       (3) the Antitrust Division and the Bureau of Competition \n     are also responsible for the prosecution of companies and \n     individuals who engage in anti-competitive behavior and \n     unfair trade practices;\n       (4) the number of merger filings under the Hart-Scott-\n     Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which the \n     Department of Justice, in conjunction with the Federal Trade \n     Commission, is required to review, has increased \n     significantly in fiscal years 1998 and 1999;\n       (5) large agri-businesses have constituted part of this \n     trend in mergers and acquisitions;\n       (6) farmers and small agricultural producers are \n     experiencing one of the worst periods of economic downturn in \n     years;\n       (7) farmers currently get less than a quarter of every \n     retail food dollar, down from nearly half of every retail \n     food dollar in 1952;\n       (8) the top 4 beef packers presently control 80 percent of \n     the market, the top 4 pork producers control 57 percent of \n     the market, and the largest sheep processors and poultry \n     processors control 73 percent and 55 percent of the market, \n     respectively;\n       (9) the 4 largest grain processing companies presently \n     account for approximately 62 percent of the Nation's flour \n     milling, and the 4 largest firms control approximately 75 \n     percent of the wet corn milling and soybean crushing \n     industry;\n       (10) farmers and small, independent producers are concerned \n     about the substantial increase in concentration in the \n     agriculture industry and significantly diminished \n     opportunities in the marketplace; and\n       (11) farmers and small, independent producers are also \n     concerned about possible anticompetitive behavior and unfair \n     business practices in the agriculture industry.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Antitrust Division and the Bureau of Competition \n     will have adequate resources to enable them to meet their \n     statutory requirements, including those related to reviewing \n     increasingly numerous and complex\n\n[[Page S2048]]\n\n     mergers and investigating and prosecuting anticompetitive \n     business activity; and\n       (2) these departments will--\n       (A) dedicate considerable resources to matters and \n     transactions dealing with agri-business antitrust and \n     competition; and\n       (B) ensure that all vertical and horizontal mergers \n     implicating agriculture and all complaints regarding possible \n     anticompetitive business practices in the agriculture \n     industry will receive extraordinary scrutiny.\n\n     SEC. 314. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FAIR MARKETS FOR \n                   AMERICAN FARMERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) United States agricultural producers are the most \n     efficient and competitive in the world;\n       (2) United States agricultural producers are at a \n     competitive disadvantage in the world market because the \n     European Union outspends the United States (on a dollar/acre \n     basis) by a ratio of 10:1 on domestic support and by a ratio \n     of 60:1 on export subsidies;\n       (3) the support the European Union gives their producers \n     results in more prosperous rural communities in Europe than \n     in the United States;\n       (4) the European Union blocked consensus at the World Trade \n     Organization ministerial meeting in Seattle because Europe \n     does not want to surrender its current advantage in world \n     markets;\n       (5) despite the competitiveness of American farmers, the \n     European advantage has led to a declining United States share \n     of the world market for agricultural products;\n       (6) the United States Department of Agriculture reports \n     that United States export growth has lagged behind that of \n     our major competitors, resulting in a loss of United States \n     market share, from 24 percent in 1981 to its current level of \n     18 percent;\n       (7) the United States Department of Agriculture also \n     reports that United States market share of global \n     agricultural trade has eroded steadily over the past 2 \n     decades, which could culminate in the United States losing \n     out to the European Union as the world's top agricultural \n     exporter sometime in 2000;\n       (8) prices of agricultural commodities in the United States \n     are at 50-year lows in real terms, creating a serious \n     economic crisis in rural America; and\n       (9) fundamental fairness requires that the playing field be \n     leveled so that United States farmers are no longer at a \n     competitive disadvantage.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the United States should take steps to increase support \n     for American farmers in order to level the playing field for \n     United States agricultural producers and increase the \n     leverage of the United States in World Trade Organization \n     negotiations on agriculture as long as such support is not \n     trade distorting, and does not otherwise exceed or impair \n     existing Uruguay Round obligations; and\n       (2) such actions should improve United States farm income \n     and restore the prosperity of rural communities.\n\n     SEC. 315. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON WOMEN AND SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) without Social Security benefits, the elderly poverty \n     rate among women would have been 52.2 percent, and among \n     widows would have been 60.6 percent;\n       (2) women tend to live longer and tend to have lower \n     lifetime earnings than men do;\n       (3) during their working years, women earn an average of 70 \n     cents for every dollar men earn; and\n       (4) women spend an average of 11.5 years out of their \n     careers to care for their families, and are more likely to \n     work part-time than full-time.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) women face unique obstacles in ensuring retirement \n     security and survivor and disability stability;\n       (2) Social Security plays an essential role in guaranteeing \n     inflation-protected financial stability for women throughout \n     their old age;\n       (3) the Congress and the Administration should act, as part \n     of Social Security reform, to ensure that widows and other \n     poor elderly women receive more adequate benefits that reduce \n     their poverty rates and that women, under whatever approach \n     is taken to reform Social Security, should receive no lesser \n     a share of overall federally funded retirement benefits than \n     they receive today; and\n       (4) the sacrifice that women make to care for their family \n     should be recognized during reform of Social Security and \n     that women should not be penalized by taking an average of \n     11.5 years out of their careers to care for their family.\n\n     SEC. 316. PROTECTION OF BATTERED WOMEN AND CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Each year an estimated 1,000,000 women suffer nonfatal \n     violence by an intimate partner.\n       (2) Nearly 1 out of 3 adult women can expect to experience \n     at least 1 physical assault by a partner during adulthood.\n       (3) Domestic violence is statistically consistent across \n     racial and ethnic lines. It does not discriminate based on \n     race or economic status.\n       (4) The chance of being victimized by an intimate partner \n     is 10 times greater for a woman than a man.\n       (5) Past and current victims of domestic violence are over-\n     represented in the welfare population. It is estimated that \n     at least 60 percent of current welfare beneficiaries have \n     experienced some form of domestic violence.\n       (6) Abused women who do seek employment face barriers as a \n     result of domestic violence. Welfare studies show that 15 to \n     50 percent of abused women report interference from their \n     partner with education, training, or employment.\n       (7) The programs established by the Violence Against Women \n     Act of 1994 have empowered communities to address the threat \n     caused by domestic violence.\n       (8) Since 1995, Congress has appropriated close to \n     $1,800,000,000 to fund programs established by the Violence \n     Against Women Act of 1994, including the STOP program, \n     shelters for battered women and children, the domestic \n     violence hotline, and Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention injury control programs.\n       (9) The programs established by the Violence Against Women \n     Act of 1994 have been and continue to comprise a successful \n     national strategy for addressing the needs of battered women \n     and the public health threat caused by this violence.\n       (10) The Supreme Court could act during this session to \n     overturn a major protection and course of action provided for \n     in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. In United States \n     v. Morrison/Brzonkala, the Supreme Court will address the \n     issue of the constitutionality of the Federal civil rights \n     remedy under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, and may \n     overturn congressional intent to elevate violence against \n     women to a category protected under Federal civil rights law.\n       (11) The actions taken by the courts and the failure to \n     reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 has \n     generated a great deal of concern in communities nationwide.\n       (12) Funding for the programs established by the Violence \n     Against Women Act of 1994 is the only lifeline for battered \n     women and Congress has a moral obligation to continue funding \n     and to strengthen key components of the Violence Against \n     Women Act of 1994.\n       (13) Congress and the Administration should work to ensure \n     the continued funding of programs established by the Violence \n     Against Women Act of 1994.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that, in light of \n     the pending litigation challenging the constitutionality of \n     the Federal civil rights remedy in the Violence Against Women \n     Act of 1994 and the lack of action on legislation \n     reauthorizing and strengthening the provisions of that Act--\n       (1) Congress, through reauthorization of the programs \n     established by the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, should \n     work to eliminate economic barriers that trap women and \n     children in violent homes and relationships; and\n       (2) full funding for the programs established by the \n     Violence Against Women Act of 1994 will be provided from the \n     Violent Crime Reduction Fund.\n\n     SEC. 317. USE OF FALSE CLAIMS ACT IN COMBATTING MEDICARE \n                   FRAUD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the solvency of the medicare trust funds is of vital \n     importance to the well-being of the Nation's seniors and \n     other vulnerable people in need of quality health care;\n       (2) fraud against the medicare trust funds is a major \n     problem resulting in the depletion of the trust funds; and\n       (3) chapter 37 of title 31, United States Code (commonly \n     referred to as the False Claims Act) and the qui tam \n     provisions of that chapter are vital tools in combatting \n     fraud against the medicare program.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that chapter 37 of \n     title 31, United States Code (commonly referred to as the \n     False Claims Act) and the qui tam provisions of that chapter \n     are essential tools in combatting medicare fraud and should \n     not be weakened in any way.\n\n     SEC. 318. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL GUARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Army National Guard relies heavily upon thousands \n     of full-time employees, Military Technicians and Active \n     Guard/Reserves, to ensure unit readiness throughout the Army \n     National Guard;\n       (2) these employees perform vital day-to-day functions, \n     ranging from equipment maintenance to leadership and staff \n     roles, that allow the drill weekends and annual active duty \n     training of the traditional Guardsmen to be dedicated to \n     preparation for the National Guard's warfighting and \n     peacetime missions;\n       (3) when the ability to provide sufficient Active Guard/\n     Reserves and Technicians end strength is reduced, unit \n     readiness, as well as quality of life for soldiers and \n     families is degraded;\n       (4) the Army National Guard, with agreement from the \n     Department of Defense, requires a minimum essential \n     requirement of 23,500 Active Guard/Reserves and 25,500 \n     Technicians; and\n       (5) the fiscal year 2001 budget request for the Army \n     National Guard provides resources sufficient for \n     approximately 22,430 Active Guard/Reserves and 23,957 \n     Technicians, end\n\n[[Page S2049]]\n\n     strength shortfalls of 1,052 and 1,543, respectively.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.-- It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in the resolution assume that the Department \n     of Defense will give priority to funding the Active Guard/\n     Reserves and Military Technicians at levels authorized by \n     Congress in the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense \n     authorization bill.\n\n     SEC. 319. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MILITARY READINESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Secretary of the Air Force stated that the United \n     States Air Force's top unfunded readiness priority for fiscal \n     year 2000 was its aircraft spares and repair parts account \n     and top Air Force officers have said that getting more spares \n     is a top priority to improve readiness rates;\n       (2) the Chief of Naval Operations stated that the aircraft \n     spares and repair parts account for a top readiness priority \n     important to the long-term health of the Navy;\n       (3) the General Accounting Office's study of personnel \n     retention problems in the armed services cited shortages of \n     spares and repair parts as a major reason why people are \n     leaving the services;\n       (4) the fiscal year 2001 budget request decreases the Air \n     Force's spares and repair parts account by 13 percent from \n     fiscal year 2000 expected levels; and\n       (5) the fiscal year 2001 budget request decreases the \n     Navy's spares and repair parts account by 6 percent from the \n     fiscal year 2000 expected levels.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in the budget resolution assume \n     that Congress will protect the Department of Defense's \n     readiness accounts, including spares and repair parts, and \n     operations and maintenance, and use the requested levels as \n     the minimum baseline for fiscal year 2001 authorization and \n     appropriations.\n\n     SEC. 320. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COMPENSATION FOR THE CHINESE \n                   EMBASSY BOMBING IN BELGRADE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume funds designated to compensate the People's \n     Republic of China for the damage inadvertently done to their \n     embassy in Belgrade by NATO forces in May 1999, should not be \n     appropriated from the international affairs budget.\n\n     SEC. 321. SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING FUNDING OF DIGITAL \n                   OPPORTUNITY INITIATIVES.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) computers, the Internet, and information networks are \n     not luxury items but basic tools largely responsible for \n     driving the current economic expansions;\n       (2) information technology utility relies on software \n     applications and online content;\n       (3) access to computers and the Internet and the ability to \n     use this technology effectively is becoming increasingly \n     important for full participation in America's economic, \n     political, and social life; and\n       (4) unequal access to technology and high-tech skills by \n     income, educational level, race, and geography could deepen \n     and reinforce the divisions that exist within American \n     society.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Committees \n     on Appropriations and Finance should support efforts that \n     address the digital divide, including tax incentives and \n     funding to--\n       (1) broaden access to information technologies;\n       (2) provide workers and teachers with information \n     technology training;\n       (3) promote innovative online content and software \n     applications that will improve commerce, education, and \n     quality of life; and\n       (4) help provide information and communications technology \n     to underserved communities.\n\n     SEC. 322. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING IMMUNIZATION FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) vaccines protect children and adults against serious \n     and potentially fatal diseases;\n       (2) society saves up to $24 in medical and societal costs \n     for every dollar spent on vaccines;\n       (3) every day, 11,000 babies are born--4,000,000 each \n     year--and each child needs up to 19 doses of vaccine by age \n     2;\n       (4) approximately 1,000,000 2-year-olds have not received \n     all of the recommended vaccine doses;\n       (5) the immunization program under section 317(j)(1) under \n     the Public Health Service Act, administered by the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention, provides grants to States \n     and localities for critical activities including immunization \n     registries, outbreak control, provider education, outreach \n     efforts, and linkages with other public health and welfare \n     services;\n       (6) Federal grants to States and localities for these \n     activities have declined from $27l,000,000 in 1995 to \n     $139,000,000 in 2000;\n       (7) because of these funding reductions States are \n     struggling to maintain immunization rates and have \n     implemented severe cuts to immunization delivery activities;\n       (8) even with significant gains in national immunization \n     rates, underimmunized children still exist and there are a \n     number of subpopulations where coverage rates remain low and \n     are actually declining;\n       (9) rates in many of the Nation's urban areas, including \n     Chicago and Houston, are unacceptably low; and\n       (10) these pockets of need create pools of susceptible \n     children and increase the risk of dangerous disease \n     outbreaks.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in the resolution assume that Congress should \n     enact legislation that provides $214,000,000 in funding for \n     immunization grants under section 317 of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247b) for infrastructure and delivery \n     activities, including targeted support for immunization \n     project areas with low or declining immunization rates or who \n     have subpopulations with special needs.\n\n     SEC. 323. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX CREDITS FOR SMALL \n                   BUSINESSES PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE TO LOW-\n                   INCOME EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) 25,000,000 workers in the United States were uninsured \n     in 1997 and more than two-thirds of the uninsured workers \n     earn less than $20,000 annually, according to a Henry J. \n     Kaiser Family Foundation report;\n       (2) the percentage of employees of small businesses who \n     have employer-sponsored health insurance coverage decreased \n     from 52 percent in 1996 to 47 percent in 1998; for the \n     smallest employers, those with 3 to 9 workers, the percentage \n     of employees covered by employer-sponsored health insurance \n     fell from 36 percent in 1996 to 31 percent in 1998;\n       (3) between 1996 and 1998, health premiums for small \n     businesses increased 5.2 percent; premiums increased by 8 \n     percent for the smallest employers, the highest increase \n     among all small businesses;\n       (4) monthly family coverage for workers at firms with 3 to \n     9 employees cost $520 in 1998, compared to $462 for family \n     coverage for workers at large firms; and\n       (5) only 39 percent of small businesses with a significant \n     percentage of low-income employees offer employer-provided \n     health insurance and such companies are half as likely to \n     offer health benefits to such employees as are companies that \n     have only a small percentage of low-income employees.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that Congress \n     should enact legislation that allows small businesses to \n     claim a tax credit when they provide health insurance to low-\n     income employees.\n\n     SEC. 324. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR CRIMINAL \n                   JUSTICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) our success in the fight against crime and improvements \n     in the administration of justice are the result of a \n     bipartisan effort; and\n       (2) since 1993 the Congress and the President have \n     increased justice funding by 92 percent, and a strong \n     commitment to law enforcement and the administration of \n     justice remains appropriate.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that funds to \n     improve the justice system will be available as follows:\n       (1) $665,000,000 for the expanded support of direct Federal \n     enforcement, adjudicative, and correctional-detention \n     activities.\n       (2) $50,000,000 in additional funds to combat terrorism, \n     including cyber crime.\n       (3) $41,000,000 in additional funds for construction costs \n     for the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Training Center.\n       (4) $200,000,000 in support of Customs and Immigration and \n     Nationalization Service port of entry officers for the \n     development and implementation of the ACE computer system \n     designed to meet critical trade and border security needs.\n       (5) Funding is available for the continuation of such \n     programs as: the Byrne Grant Program, Violence Against Women, \n     Juvenile Accountability Block Grants, First Responder \n     Training, Local Law Enforcement Block Grants, Weed and Seed, \n     Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth in Sentencing, State \n     Criminal Alien Assistance Program, Drug Courts, Residential \n     Substance Abuse Treatment, Crime Identification Technologies, \n     Bulletproof Vests, Counterterrorism, Interagency Law \n     Enforcement Coordination.\n\n     SEC. 325. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE PELL GRANT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) public investment in higher education yields a return \n     of several dollars for each dollar invested;\n       (2) higher education promotes economic opportunity for \n     individuals; for example recipients of bachelor's degrees \n     earn an average of 75 percent per year more than those with \n     high school diplomas and experience half as much unemployment \n     as high school graduates;\n       (3) access to a college education has become a hallmark of \n     American society, and is vital to upholding our belief in \n     equality of opportunity;\n       (4) for a generation, the Federal Pell Grant has served as \n     an established and effective means of providing access to \n     higher education;\n       (5) over the past decade, Pell Grant has failed to keep up \n     with inflation. Over the past 25 years, the value of the \n     average Pell Grant has decreased by 23 percent--it is now \n     worth only 77 percent of what Pell Grants were worth in 1975;\n       (6) grant aid as a portion of student aid has fallen \n     significantly over the past 5 years. Grant aid used to \n     comprise 55 percent of total aid awarded and loans comprised \n     just over 40 percent. Now that trend has been reversed so \n     that loans comprise nearly 60 percent of total aid awarded \n     and grants only comprise 40 percent of total aid awarded;\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\n       (7) the percentage of freshmen attending public and private \n     4-year institutions from families whose income is below the \n     national median has fallen since 1981.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that within the \n     discretionary allocation provided to the Committee on \n     Appropriations, the funding for the maximum Pell Grant award \n     should be at or above the level requested by the President.\n\n     SEC. 326. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMPREHENSIVE PUBLIC \n                   EDUCATION REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Recent scientific evidence demonstrates that enhancing \n     children's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual \n     development before the age of 6 results in tremendous \n     benefits throughout life.\n       (2) Successful schools are led by well-trained, highly \n     qualified principals, but many principals do not get the \n     training in management skills that the principals need to \n     ensure their school provides an excellent education for every \n     child.\n       (3) Good teachers are a crucial catalyst to quality \n     education, but 1 in 4 new teachers do not meet State \n     certification requirements; each year more than 50,000 \n     underprepared teachers enter the classroom; and 12 percent of \n     new teachers have had no teacher training at all.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Federal \n     Government should support State and local educational \n     agencies engaged in comprehensive reform of their public \n     education system and that any public education reform should \n     include at least the following principles:\n       (1) Every child should begin school ready to learn.\n       (2) Training and development for principals and teachers \n     should be a priority.\n\n     SEC. 327. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROVIDING ADEQUATE FUNDING \n                   FOR UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) United States international leadership is essential to \n     maintaining security and peace for all Americans;\n       (2) such leadership depends on effective diplomacy as well \n     as a strong military;\n       (3) effective diplomacy requires adequate resources both \n     for operations and security of United States embassies and \n     for international programs;\n       (4) in addition to building peace, prosperity, and \n     democracy around the world, programs in the International \n     Affairs (150) budget serve United States interests by \n     ensuring better jobs and a higher standard of living, \n     promoting the health of our citizens and preserving our \n     natural environment, and protecting the rights and safety of \n     those who travel or do business overseas;\n       (5) real spending for International Affairs has declined \n     more than 40 percent since the mid-1980's, at the same time \n     that major new challenges and opportunities have arisen from \n     the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the worldwide \n     trends toward democracy and free markets;\n       (6) current ceilings on discretionary spending will impose \n     severe additional cuts in funding for International Affairs;\n       (7) improved security for United States diplomatic missions \n     and personnel will place further strain on the International \n     Affairs budget absent significant additional resources;\n       (8) the United States cannot reduce efforts to safeguard \n     nuclear materials in the former Soviet States or shortchange \n     initiatives aimed at maintaining stability on the Korean \n     peninsula, where 37,000 United States forces are deployed. We \n     cannot reduce support for peace in the Middle East or in \n     Northern Ireland or in the Balkans. We cannot stop fighting \n     terror or simply surrender to the spread of HIV/AIDS. We must \n     continue to support all of these things, which are difficult \n     to achieve without adequate and realistic funding levels; and\n       (9) the President's request for funds for fiscal year 2001 \n     would adequately finance our International Affairs programs \n     without detracting from our defense and domestic needs. It \n     would help keep America prosperous and secure. It would \n     enable us to leverage the contributions of allies and friends \n     on behalf of democracy and peace. It would allow us to \n     protect the interests of Americans who travel, study, or do \n     business overseas. It would do all these things and more for \n     about 1 penny of every dollar the Federal Government spends.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that additional \n     budgetary resources should be identified for function 150 to \n     enable successful United States international leadership.\n\n     SEC. 328. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE HIV/AIDS CRISIS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) More than 16,000,000 people have been killed by \n     Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) since the epidemic \n     began.\n       (2) 14,000,000 Africans have died as a result of the AIDS \n     epidemic. Eighty-four percent of the worldwide deaths from \n     AIDS have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (3) Each day, AIDS kills 5,500 Africans, and infects 11,000 \n     more.\n       (4) By the end of 2000, 10,400,000 children in sub-Saharan \n     Africa will have lost one or both parents, to AIDS.\n       (5) Over 85 percent of the world's HIV-positive children \n     live in Africa.\n       (6) Fewer than 5 percent of those living with AIDS in \n     Africa have access to even the most basic care.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the functional totals underlying this resolution on the \n     budget assume that Congress has recognized the catastrophic \n     effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, particularly in Sub-Saharan \n     Africa, and seeks to maximize the effectiveness of the United \n     States' efforts to combat the disease through any necessary \n     authorization or appropriations;\n       (2) Congress should strengthen ongoing programs which \n     address education and prevention, testing, the care of AIDS \n     orphans, and improving home and community-based care options \n     for those living with AIDS; and\n       (3) Congress should seek additional or new tools to combat \n     the epidemic, including initiatives to encourage vaccine \n     development and programs aimed at preventing mother-to-child \n     transmission of the disease.\n\n     SEC. 329. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRIBAL COLLEGES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) More than 26,500 students from 250 tribes nationwide \n     attend tribal colleges. The colleges serve students of all \n     ages, many of whom are moving from welfare to work. The vast \n     majority of tribal college students are first-generation \n     college students.\n       (2) While annual appropriations for tribal colleges have \n     increased modestly in recent years, core operation funding \n     levels are still about half of the $6,000 per Indian student \n     level authorized by the Tribally Controlled College or \n     University Act.\n       (3) Although tribal colleges received a $3,000,000 increase \n     in funding in fiscal year 2000, because of rising student \n     populations and other factors, these institutions may face an \n     actual per-student decrease in funding over fiscal year 1999.\n       (4) Per-student funding for tribal colleges is roughly half \n     the amount given to mainstream community colleges.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Senate recognizes the funding difficulties faced by \n     tribal colleges and assumes that priority consideration will \n     be provided to them through funding for the Tribally \n     Controlled College and University Act, the 1994 Land Grant \n     Institutions, and title III of the Higher Education Act; and\n       (2) such priority consideration reflects Congress' intent \n     to continue work toward current statutory Federal funding \n     goals for the tribal colleges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/03/senate-section/article/S2050-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                       special committee on aging\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.
