Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate today on \nthe subject of the violence in Littleton, CO. I note that over the \nweekend a number of funerals took place, and as I speak another funeral \nis occurring as a result of the shootings in Littleton, CO. I think it \nwould be appropriate for us to observe a moment of silence for the \nvictims of the shootings that took place.\n  (Period of silence.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair.\n  Certainly, all of our thoughts and prayers are with the people in \nColorado, across this country and across the world, who have been \ntouched by the terrible tragedies in the shootings.\n  We cannot ignore the shootings that took place in Littleton, CO. I \nthink we really must say that this time we will address these problems \nthat are in our culture. They are here. We have a culture that \nglorifies violence and killing, where perverse things are put on \ntelevision as normal. Ours is a culture that has far too much darkness \nin it.\n\n  Just listen to some of the words of the writers in various newspapers \nacross this country when they have discussed today's culture. This was \nin last Thursday's Washington Post in the Style Section, mind you. Its \nheadline: ``When Death Imitates Art.'' It says:\n\n       Before Teenagers Commit Violence, They Witness It in \n     American Culture.\n\n  Here is how the writer starts:\n\n       In what used to be the dark corners of our culture, there \n     is now a prime time cartoon with a neo-Nazi character, comics \n     that traffic in bestiality, movies that leave teenagers \n     gutted like game, fashion designers who peddle black leather \n     masks and doomsday visions. It's all in the open now, mass \n     produced, widely available. Even celebrated. On countless \n     PCs, killing is a sport. And there's Marilyn Manson, a \n     popular singer who named himself after a mass murderer and \n     proclaims he is the Antichrist.\n       Film, television, music, dress, technology, games: They've \n     become one giant playground filled with accessible evil, \n     darker than ever before.\n\n  Listen to this:\n\n       Consider: Of the last 11 major movies released on video \n     since April 6, seven of them have violent themes. Among them, \n     ``Art Pupil,'' about a high school kid obsessed with Nazism; \n     ``American History X'' about the rise and fall of a skinhead; \n     and ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,'' a teen slasher \n     sequel.\n       ``There is no question in my mind that film and society \n     interrelate,'' said Douglas Brode, a professor of film at \n     Syracuse University and author of 18 books on the movies. \n     ``And not just films but music, video games, all of it. There \n     is a connection. It may be tangential, it may be tight. \n     Nobody knows for sure.''\n\n  And so caution and perspective are urged.\n\n       It is surely one of the great debates of this decade: Does \n     the culture simply reflect the dark, decadent times in which \n     we live or is society this way because the cultural \n     proprietors have run amok.\n\n  Listen to this from the Wall Street Journal, written by Peggy Noonan, \na columnist. This was in last Thursday's Wall Street Journal. She \nwrites this:\n\n       What walked into Columbine High School Tuesday was the \n     culture of death. This time\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\n     it wore black trench coats. Last time it was children's \n     hunting gear. Next time it will be some other costume, but it \n     will still be the culture of death. That is the Pope's \n     phrase; it is how he describes the world we live in.\n       The boys who did the killing, the famous Trench Coat Mafia, \n     inhaled too deep the ocean in which they swam. Think of it \n     this way. Your child is an intelligent little fish. He swims \n     in deep water. Waves of sound and sight, of thought and fact, \n     come invisibly through that water, like radar; they go \n     through him again and again, from this direction and that. \n     The sound from the television is a wave, and the sound from \n     the radio; the headlines on the newsstand, on the magazines, \n     on the ad on the bus as it whizzes by--all are waves. The \n     fish--your child--is bombarded and barely knows it. But the \n     waves contain words like this, which I will limit to only one \n     source, the news.\n\n  Then she goes through and lists:\n\n       . . . was found strangled and is believed to have been \n     sexually molested. . . .\n\n  There are a number of headlines, and they finish this portion by \nsaying:\n\n       This is the ocean in which our children swim. This is the \n     sound of our culture. It comes from all parts of our culture \n     and reaches all parts of our culture, and all the people in \n     it, which is everybody.\n\n  Listen to this from the New York Times today:\n\n       By producing increasingly violent media, the entertainment \n     industry has for decades engaged in a lucrative dance with \n     the devil.\n\n  That was in the New York Times today. It goes on to describe a \nprocess that our young people are going through, that a former Army \nofficer talked about being desensitization, conditioning of people, \nbeing able to do heinous violent acts that they are taking culture \nconditioning through a movie, music, the Internet that just constantly \nbombard them and it desensitizes them to the humanness surrounding \nthem.\n\n       Dave Grossman, a former Army officer and professor at West \n     Point and also the University of Arkansas, says that these \n     are the same techniques that were used to great effect during \n     the Vietnam War to increase the ``firing rate''--that is, the \n     percentage of soldiers who would actually fire a weapon \n     during an encounter from the 15 to 20 percent range in World \n     War II to as much as 95 percent in Vietnam.\n       Grossman has written ``On Killing: The Psychological Cost \n     of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' in which he \n     discusses how conditioning techniques were used to teach \n     Vietnam-bound soldiers.\n\n  And then it goes on and he says many of these same techniques are \ninvolved in our culture today.\n  Mr. President, we have got to address this. It is time to do \nsomething. I think we in the Senate have to say we are not powerless to \naddress this. We can fight back, and we must fight back. We know this \nis going on in the culture today. We know it is out there. We know what \nis happening. We know what happened in Columbine. We also know, most of \nus across the country, it is likely to happen again somewhere else, in \nsome other good high school, in some other place where this never \nshould happen, as it has happened in the past in Paducah, KY; Pearl, \nMS; other places; Jonesboro, AR; across this country. We can and we \nmust fight back, and now is the time to do it.\n\n  I suggest two solutions. No. 1, anybody listening or watching, let's \nall pledge that we will change our culture, our individual culture we \nare involved in right now, what is it that is going on in our family, \nin our community, in our school, wherever we are within our culture \nthat is part of this, and let's change it. We are not helpless to \nchanging this. What is coming into your home right now? Do you have \nthings coming into your home right now that are violent, that are of a \nnature with which you wouldn't agree, or over the Internet, magazines, \nvideo games, movies, television? We are not powerless to stop it coming \ninto our homes. Let us all pledge to stop it.\n  I hope that many people across this country will start societies for \ncultural renewal within their communities where people can come \ntogether and say we are going to change the culture in our community; \nwe are not going to wait on producers out of California; we are not \ngoing to wait on Washington to do this; we are going to change the \nculture here, now; we are going to bind together and we are going to \nsay, what can we do in our community to reduce teen suicide, to reduce \nchild abuse, to reduce out-of-wedlock births, to reduce the violence, \nthe drug use, to reduce those sorts of things in our culture.\n  Let's not wait until it comes to us. Let's start binding together as \npeople and forming societies to do this now. We can do it. If 10 people \nin any community of a limited size, say, of a quarter million, would \ncome together and say, we are going to change the culture in our \ncommunity, they could start this in their community and they could get \nit done. With passion, with prayer, with people of commitment, they \ncould do it. It could happen. They could move forward. They can change \ntheir culture. We can each change our culture. Let us open our eyes and \nsee what is happening.\n  The second thing I think we in the Senate need to do is create a \nspecial commission on cultural renewal. We need to address this topic. \nWe in the Senate should have a high-level commission of people from \nmultiple walks of life searching for the answers to two questions: One, \nwhat made this culture the way it is? How did we get to this point we \nare today? What made us this way? Second, and more important, how do we \nchange it?\n  I will be hosting a hearing on May 4, asking about the marketing of \nviolence, in the Commerce Committee. There we are going to be asking \npeople to address the point about the marketing of violence in our \nsociety and how it is being used to sell various products and what we \ncan do to stop it.\n  I want to be clear, too. We obviously have limits in government, and \ngovernment is part of the culture, but it is not the total culture. \nGovernment is limited. This is much more about all of us joining \ntogether to say we can change these sorts of things. We want to \nhighlight some problems such as what is taking place in the marketing \nof violence. Why are companies doing this? What is their mode of \noperation? How can we dissuade them from doing this? Because it has a \nprofound effect throughout this culture, as the people in Littleton, \nCO, know all too well, as we know all the rest of the way across this \nNation.\n  Cultures change, and we must determinedly change ours, not so much by \nlaws as by changing our thinking about what we consume. We can do it. \nWe must do it. We will do it. It is time we do it.\n  I am afraid people are getting to the point of wondering if we can. \nYes, we can. As the culture moved in this direction, it can assuredly \nmove away from it. But it is going to take a determined effort. It is \ngoing to take an effort not just of saying OK, Washington is going to \nsolve it, or Hollywood is going to solve it, or New York is going to \nsolve it. We each have to dig in and try to solve it in our own \ncommunity, and we need to address it from here, too.\n  I will be pressing this on the leadership of the Senate, that we do \nhave such a high-level special commission so we can get at these \nissues: How did we get to where we are? How do we get away from this? \nHow do we solve it? And we can.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/26/senate-section/article/S4148-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4148-S4149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to just briefly mention a \ncouple of issues this morning.\n  First, I would like to comment on some of the statements made this \nweekend, especially by the Senate majority leader, but by others as \nwell, dealing with the issue of Social Security.\n  This weekend, on a Sunday talk show, our colleague, Senator Lott, \nindicated that he felt that the issue of Social Security reform was \ndead for this Congress.\n  Vice President Gore this morning expressed the fervent hope that this \nis not the case. I would join the Vice President in saying that it is \nnot good public policy for our country to give up on the important task \nof reforming Social Security.\n  The Social Security program has been a critically important program \nfor our country. It has made life so much better for so many older \nAmericans for so long. The problems of our Social Security system are \nborn of success--not failure. The success is that\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\npeople are living longer and better lives in our country. At the start \nof this century, you were expected, on average, to live to be 48 years \nold. Now, at the end of the century, you are expected to live on \naverage to about 78 years of age--a 30-year increase in life \nexpectancy.\n  For a lot of reasons--better nutrition, breathtaking breakthroughs in \nmedical science, better medical facilities--a whole series of things \ncontribute to the success. But the result of the success is that people \nare living longer, and that puts strains on the Social Security system. \nBut we ought not shrink from the challenge of those strains.\n  We can solve this issue. We can make Social Security solvent for at \nleast the next 75 years and beyond. Let's not at this point decide that \nthe 106th Congress cannot deal with the Social Security challenge. Of \ncourse we can.\n  President Clinton and Vice President Gore made a proposal at the \nstart of this Congress. Just as a starting point, they put forward a \nproposal to let us sink our teeth into this issue, and make it a \npriority.\n  I know there is a lot of controversy about how you might reform and \nchange and improve the solvency of the Social Security system for the \nlong term. But I think the best way to approach this--I agree with Vice \nPresident Gore--is for both parties to resolve that this shall be a \npriority; we, together, should decide to save Social Security in this \nCongress.\n  I ask the majority leader here in the Senate and others to agree with \nPresident Clinton and Vice President Gore that this ought to be job No. \n1 for this Congress. Let us together reform the Social Security \nprogram, and make the changes that are necessary to extend its solvency \nfor the long term into the future.\n  Again, while we do it, let me remind those who listen to this debate \nthat the problems confronted by the Social Security system are not \nproblems of a program that doesn't work. It works, and works well. They \nare problems resulting from longer and better lives for many older \nAmericans in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/26/senate-section/article/S4149-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4149-S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE TRAGEDY IN LITTLETON, COLORADO\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to talk just for a moment \nabout the horrible tragedy that occurred in Littleton, CO, last week.\n  I am a North Dakotan. I have been a North Dakotan all of my life. I \ndid, however, leave our State to go to graduate school in Colorado. \nFollowing graduate school, I worked in Colorado, and worked, in fact, \nin Littleton, CO. It is a nice community, a suburb of Denver.\n  Last week, I was, along with all other Americans, horrified to see \nthe pictures on television of the school shooting at Columbine High \nSchool that took the lives of so many innocent young boys and girls, \nand also a teacher. And I asked myself, what is causing this? What is \nat the root of this kind of violence? The Littleton, CO, shooting is \njust the latest in a series of school shootings. Unfortunately, there \nhave been many others in the last several years.\n\n  I can't watch the television set without getting tears in my eyes. \nMoments ago, I was turning on a television set and I saw the funeral \nfor a very brave teacher who died that day in that school in Colorado. \nWe ask ourselves over and over and over again, what has changed? What \nis causing all of this?\n  On Friday, I met with a high school assembly in North Dakota. We \ntalked at great length about these issues. This morning I spent all \nmorning at a youth detention facility called Oak Hill and talked to \nyoung folks at that facility from 12 years old on up, young people who \nhad committed violent crimes and who are now committed to that \ndetention facility not more than an hour from this Capitol Building.\n  I don't have any better answers perhaps than anyone else in America \nabout these issues. I have some thoughts about some of it. Obviously, \nfirst, it all starts at home. There isn't a substitute for good \nparenting.\n  One of the young boys this morning at the Oak Hill Detention Center, \nwho has been involved in drugs and violent crime, said he only had one \nparent. He said his parent checked on him from time to time but he \nsaid, ``Checking in on young folks from time to time isn't enough.''\n  Another part of the problem is drugs and the accessibility of drugs. \nIn addition, a country with 220 to 240 million guns, and with seemingly \neasy accessibility to guns by children, makes parenting more difficult.\n  How about the violence children are exposed to every day? By the time \nchildren graduate from high school they will spend about 12,000 hours \nin a classroom and about 20,000 hours in front of a television set. \nStudy after study after study, year after year after year shows that \nthe steady diet of violence seen by our young people on television \naffects their behavior. Does it turn them into murderers? No. Does it \naffect their behavior? Yes, of course it does.\n  Corporations spend $200 billion a year in this country advertising in \nthe media. Yet when we are suggesting through studies that the steady \ndiet of violence offered to our young children on television is hurting \nthem, the same people will say, ``Gee, the media has no influence on \nour children.'' If that is the case, why is $200 billion a year spent \nadvertising tennis shoes, jerseys, and more? If it doesn't work, why do \nwe see it used so extensively? Of course the media has an enormous \ninfluence.\n  Last week, while these shootings at school were taking place, as \nhorrifying as it was for everyone in America to watch SWAT teams move \ninto the building and young children run from the building in panic, \none of the networks broke for a commercial. The commercial break was to \nencourage us to watch a new program called ``Mr. Murder.'' I thought to \nmyself, I guess that says a lot, doesn't it? We are watching these \nchildren at this high school under siege by young gunmen, and then \nthere is an advertisement for the new program, ``Mr. Murder.''\n  Is a murder program on television causing these murders in the \nschool? That is not my allegation at all. Does it hurt our children? \nThe pop culture of increasingly violent television, increasingly \nviolent movies--or how about increasingly violent lyrics in music? \nThere is a man in Minot, ND, whose young boy put a bullet through his \nbrain. When he found his son, he was lying on his bed with his \nearphones connected to a compact disk that was playing over and over \nand over and over again lyrics to a Marilyn Manson song saying the way \nto end all of this ``is with a bullet in your head.'' For 3 months, he \nobsessed on this kind of music, and then his father found him lying on \nhis bed with a bullet in his head. The teacher of a young boy named \nMitchell, who killed 4 of his classmates and 1 teacher and wounded 10 \nothers, testified before the Senate Commerce Committee last June.\n\n  She talked about 13-year-old Mitchell. She was Mitchell's teacher, \ntaught Mitchell English. He was always respectful, she said, saying \n``Yes, ma'am,'' ``No, ma'am.'' She never saw him exhibit anger. After \nthe killings, she said the classmates had a discussion. They discovered \nMitchell had been obsessing on an entirely new kind of music--Bone \nThugs and TuPac. And she told us the lyrics that Mitchell had been \nlistening to in ``Crept and We Came'' by Bone Thugs:\n\n       Cockin the 9 and ready to aim\n       Pullin the Trigger\n       To blow out your brains\n       Bone got a gang\n       Man we crept and we came.\n\n  This song has about 40 murder images, like ``puttin them in the \nground and pumpin the gun.''\n  That is what Mitchell was listening to.\n  ``Body Rott,'' by Bone Thugs. Or here are the lyrics from ``I Ain't \nMad at Ya'' by TuPac.\n\n       I can see us after school\n       We'd bomb on the first [blank blank]\n       With the wrong [blank] on. And from ``2 of Amerikas Most \n     Wanted:''\n       Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture.\n       Bomb the hoochies with precision . . .\n       Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party.\n\n  These lyrics are from Mitchell's teacher who wanted us to know what \nhe was listening to.\n  Is this part of the culture? Does this hurt our children? Is it easy \nto parent with these kinds of images, these kinds of thoughts coming \nfrom our television set, from compact disks? Should we think through \nall of this--not just at the surface with parenting, drugs, and guns--\nbut also the issue of pop culture?\n  If $200 billion is spent advertising in the media because it \ninfluences behavior, should we as parents and should we\n\n[[Page S4150]]\n\nas legislators start understanding that the media then has a profound \nimpact on children as well. Should we understand when the media pumps \nimages--thousands and thousands and thousands of images--of murder that \ntell our young children the way adults solve their problems is to kill \nsomeone, to stab someone, to murder someone? That is the way adults \nsolve their problems, according to television programs.\n  Yes, it is fiction, but how do children know that? Yes, you can say \nparents should do a better job of seeing what their children are \nwatching, but it is very hard.\n  I have a lot more to say about this but I know colleagues are \nwaiting. I am sure I join all of my colleagues in saying we are \nheartbroken by what is happening in this country and what happened in \nLittleton, CO. My thoughts and prayers go to all of those families and \nfriends who lost loved ones.\n  I watched the images of the funerals today in Littleton, and I want \nto be part of anything any of us can do to try to find reasons and try \nto develop policies to see if we can't steer all of us in a more \nconstructive direction. In the meantime, my thoughts and prayers are \nwith all of those in Colorado and around this country who today grieve \nfor those young children and the teacher who lost their lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, dam removal as a serious option for salmon \nrecovery on the Snake River died last week. It was killed by the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service, the arm of the Clinton \nadministration assigned to save those endangered salmon.\n  Why and how?\n  Three runs of salmon on the upper Snake River were listed as \nendangered in 1991 and 1992. On April 14, NMFS announced its \ndetermination that only 19 percent of salmon smolts barged around the \ndams, die. In fact, we now know that downriver survival rates are at \nleast as high as they were in the 1960's before the Snake River dams \nwere built!\n  As a result, NMFS now believes that the chance of recovery for the \nendangered runs is only 64 percent if all four Snake River dams are \nremoved, as against 53 percent by continuing to transport smolts around \nthe dams. The difference is barely statistically significant.\n  We can assume that NMFS science is the best available. That science \nis a vital component of public policy, but only one component of good \npublic policy and not absolutely determinative to the exclusion of all \nother concerns.\n  So against the modest 11-percent improvement in survival chances for \nthese populations of salmon from dam removal, we must weigh the immense \ncosts of removal. Earlier this month at a Senate Energy Committee field \nhearing, a representative from Bonneville Power testified that BPA \nwould lose approximately $263 million in power revenues in each average \nwater year in perpetuity under medium future economic conditions. BPA \nalso estimates that removal of the four lower Snake River dams is \nlikely to increase its power rates by as much as 30 percent. The cost \nof removal itself, the destruction of navigation, the loss of irrigated \nfarms and the human and community devastation add untold billions to \nthat figure. That cost is vastly out of proportion to the salmon \nrecovery goal, much less to the extremely modest improvement even in \nthe prospects for recovery.\n  So dam removal as a rational option is dead. We in the Pacific \nNorthwest, specifically residents in eastern, rural Washington, have \nbeen waging this war with the environmental community. It gives me \ngreat pleasure today to present my assessment of the recently released \nNational Marine Fisheries Service report on Snake River dams and salmon \nrecovery options.\n  I cannot support the effort to dismantle the world's most productive \nhydroelectric system when the costs are so great in relation to the \nbenefit to a few selected salmon runs. Under the current management of \nthe Columbia/Snake River system, Northwest ratepayers have contributed \n$366 million per year on average since 1995 to salmon recovery. The \nplan requires flow augmentation, dam spill, surface bypass, juvenile \nand adult fish passage improvements, water supply studies, PIT tag \nmonitoring, and additional salmon barges. Although many, myself \nincluded, have been highly critical of Federal salmon recovery efforts, \nthe results are beginning to show signs of progress. Based on new \ntechnology for salmon monitoring using Pit-Tags, NMFS estimates a \nsignificant increase in downriver survival for juvenile salmon. It \nestimates salmon are now surviving at a rate of 50 to 68 percent for \njuvenile salmon that migrate through eight Snake and Columbia River \ndams. Since about 60 percent of juvenile salmon are barged at a \nsurvival rate of 98 percent, the combined salmon survival rate to \nPortland, past eight dams, exceeds 80 percent.\n  Why are some in such a rush to consider dam removal when faced with \nthese statistics? According to NMFS, these statistics may be further \nenhanced during the next three to four years of monitoring the adult \nfish returning to the river. However, the single-interest advocacy \ngroups claim we can't wait any longer--they say we must remove the dams \nnow.\n  Let me reemphasize one glaring fact. The overall survival rate past \nthe four lower Snake dams is at least as high today as it was in the \n1960's before the dams were built, according to NMFS' own biologists. \nMuch of this recent improvement in survival rates can be attributed to \ntechnical and operational improvements at the dams. There is much more \nthat can be done to improve survival rates past the four lower Snake \ndams. Unfortunately, the Army Corps of Engineers has been waiting to \nsee if these dams are going to be removed before spending any more \nmoney on further improvements that could provide immediate benefits.\n  Although the passage survival is much higher now, adult salmon \nreturns continue at a distressed level. A likely theory is that \ndeclines are due to the rise in ocean temperatures. During the Easter \nrecess, my Interior appropriations subcommittee held a field hearing on \nNorthwest salmon recovery in Seattle. One of NMFS' own fisheries \nbiologists expressed optimism that the likelihood of decreasing ocean \ntemperatures off the coast in the Pacific Northwest as indicative of an \nimproving climate for salmon in the Northwest.\n  We are likely to obtain valuable new information about adult salmon \nreturns and likely will witness a dramatic change in the ocean \nenvironment. Even under current circumstances, the difference between \nremoving dams, to save fish or barging them around dams is too close to \ncall. And when all the costs of dam removal are factored into this \nequation, it is hard to imagine why anyone would want to take this \ndubious course of action.\n\n  In the meantime, the debate over dam removal has led to unfortunate \nconsequences. More realistic and cost effective salmon recovery \nmeasures with a proven track record have been delayed. I am committed \nto securing the funds necessary not only for dam improvements but also \nfor local salmon enhancement groups and other conservation \norganizations to continue their efforts to restore salmon habitat \nthroughout the state. Salmon recovery will take place when local people \nwho care passionately about local watersheds have the freedom and the \nresources to take the steps needed on a stream-by-stream and river-by-\nriver basis.\n  At my recent field hearing, I was most impressed with the way people \nin my state are coming together in unprecedented ways. Rather than \nfocusing on past differences, farmers, loggers, fishermen, \nconservationists, locally elected officials, and countless others \nrepresenting a vast array of interests and perspectives are working \ntogether to develop habitat restoration and watershed improvement plans \nthroughout the state that will not only provide immediate benefits to \nour salmon resource but will do so in ways that will take into \nconsideration the economic and social needs of our communities.\n  A good example of how collaborative efforts can achieve positive \nresults for the salmon resource recently took place in the Hanford \nReach area of the Columbia River. Ten years ago, the fall\n\n[[Page S4151]]\n\nchinook stock in the Hanford Reach was in bad shape. Now it is the most \nabundant of the wild Columbia River stocks. This is due largely to the \nefforts of the Grant County Public Utility District which led the \neffort to reach an agreement that protects the fish by regulating river \nflows from the time the adults spawn to the time the juveniles emerge \nfrom the gravel.\n  Last year, biologists discovered juvenile chinook were stranded after \nemerging from the gravel. Grant County PUD again led discussions \ninvolving all review mid-Columbia hydroelectric projects, together with \nfederal, state, and tribal fishery agencies to develop a program to \nreduce the number of young fish stranded because of river flow \nfluctuations. Implementing this agreement requires a substantial loss \nin valuable power generation, but represents an unprecedented example \nof how hydroelectric projects can work proactively and cooperatively \nwith fishery management agencies to protect salmon. This model effort \ndeserves our encouragement and support.\n  Clearly, the approach being taken by communities throughout my state \nis far preferable to the divisive one being advocated by those who want \nto rip out dams in the Northwest. Rather than continuing down this \nmisguided and confrontational course which will cost more and provide \nno assurances of enhanced recovery, I today call on dam removal \nadvocates to abandon their cause, and to recognize the real \nimplications of the NMFS report. If they are truly interested in \nrestoring salmon, they will work with me and others in the mainstream \nwho want to do something now positively to recover our salmon resource.\n  But Mr. President, we must keep in mind one important fact. \nEnvironmental bureaucrats in the Clinton-Gore administration have made \nit their standard operating procedure not to listen to what I, much \nless the region, thinks about dam removal. In fact, the Administration \nmust have an unwritten rule somewhere not to pay attention to local \npeople in the communities that would be destroyed by such action. It's \nalarming that while the region is increasingly united in its effort to \npreserve dams and the Northwest way of life, from the local level to \nthe statehouse to our congressional delegation--the administration and \nthe environmental community refuses to concede.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak in morning business for up to 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/26/senate-section/article/S4151-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4151-S4154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE BALKANS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I returned from Albania just a few hours \nago. This is the third time I have made such a trip. I went over to see \nwhether or not the beliefs I have developed over the last 7 months were \ntrue, and I came back, really, very convinced that they in fact are \ntrue.\n  For one thing--I have been saying for quite some time--even though \nthe President denies it, the President has planned all along to send \nAmerican ground troops into Kosovo. I am prepared to document this.\n  I want to put my remarks into four categories: One is the \nadministration's approach to this war that we are about to get in; \nsecondly, the cost in terms of both national security and dollars; \nthird, refugees; and fourth, what our troops are in right now.\n  Before I do that, I want to go back and review a couple of remarks I \nmade on March 23, just a month ago, to put it in proper perspective.\n  A month ago, I stated that I felt if we did not try to put a stop to \nthis, we would, in fact, be in a protracted, bloody long war. This is a \nwar in which we do not have national security interests.\n  A lot of people say, ``Well, we do have national security \ninterests.'' I know this is a relative term. You can argue it, I \nsuppose, but the people who are really knowledgeable on this are \nconvinced that we do not have national security interests at stake.\n  Henry Kissinger said:\n\n       The proposed deployment in Kosovo does not deal with any \n     threat to American security. . . . Kosovo is no more a threat \n     to America than Haiti was to Europe.\n\n  I further went into the conclusion that if, in fact, we do not have \nnational security interests, it is the humanitarian motivation which is \ngetting us involved in this war. We are concerned about it, and I want \nto get into some detail about that.\n  There are some things I have discovered in the last 3 days. However, \na month ago I mentioned that if this is the case and if we are \nconcerned about humanitarian problems that exist all around the world, \nwhy are we not concerned about the 800,000 who have been killed in \nethnic strife in Rwanda, the thousands who have been killed in \nEthiopia, the 140 civilians killed by paramilitary squads in Colombia, \nincluding 27 worshipers slain during a village church service? Why is \nthere no outcry for United States involvement in these obvious \nhumanitarian situations where far, far more people have been brutally \nmurdered than in the current Kosovo crisis?\n  Let me share with you, as I did back on March 23, a couple of \nparagraphs from an article in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune. \nThis was written on January 31, 1999. This was just a few days after 45 \npeople were killed in Kosovo. Let's keep that in mind when putting this \nin the proper context, Mr. President.\n  I am quoting from the Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune:\n\n       But no one mobilized on behalf of perhaps 500 people who \n     were shot, hacked and burned to death in a village in eastern \n     Congo, in central Africa around the same time. No outrage was \n     expressed on behalf of many other innocents who had the \n     misfortune to be slain just off the world's stage over the \n     last few weeks.\n       Why do 45 white Europeans rate an all-out response [from \n     the administration] while several hundred black Africans are \n     barely worth the notice?\n       While U.S. officials struggled to provide an answer, \n     analysts said the uneven U.S. responses to a spurt of \n     violence in the past month illuminates not just an immoral or \n     perhaps racist foreign policy, but one that fails on \n     pragmatic and strategic grounds as well.\n\n  So now the President wants to send the U.S. military into Kosovo. \nKeep in mind, when we talked about this 1 month ago, he was still \ndenying that he was going to send troops, and yet now we find out in \nthe recent meeting which was held by NATO in Washington that they are \ndoing an update strategy--an update strategy, Mr. President. That means \nperhaps an update of what we have previously said was our position on \nsending in ground troops.\n  I have to say, the whole purpose for me to be on the floor right now \nis to say I know there is no way to stop this. Once American troops are \non the ground in Kosovo, we will all support them and do everything we \ncan for the American troops. It will be the same situation we faced in \nBosnia. We will not be able to turn this around. That is when it \nbecomes protracted and without an end.\n  I will recount a trip I made to Kosovo recently--it was in January of \nthis year--to find out what Kosovo was really like at that time. Keep \nin mind, Kosovo is only 75 miles across and 75 miles long. It is a \nplace that has been in strife and civil war since 1389.\n  As I was going across Kosovo, I had a couple of experiences. One \nexperience I had was seeing two dead bodies. These were obviously \nsoldiers. When we turned them over, we saw that they were not \nAlbanians; they were Serbs. They had been executed at close range by \nthe KLA.\n  We went on a little bit further. I saw on the map something called a \n``no-go zone.'' I said: I would like to go in to see what it is like. \nThey said: You can't do that; it is occupied by the KLA, the Albanian \nmilitary, and they will kill anybody who comes in. They don't care if \nyou are a United States Senator or someone from the press. Nonetheless, \nyou will be dead if you go in there.\n  We did not go in.\n  Then we rounded another corner. There was a rocket-propelled grenade, \nan RPG-7, that was aimed right at our heads. They put it down, and we \nwent over and found out they were Albanians, not Serbs.\n  I am saying this, and I said this back on the 23rd of March, for a \nspecific reason, and that reason is that while Milosevic is a bad guy, \nhe is not the only bad guy in that conflict which is taking place.\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\n  There is one more thing I will mention with Henry Kissinger that I \nmentioned back on the 23rd of March. He said:\n\n       Each incremental deployment into the Balkans is bound to \n     weaken our ability to deal with Saddam Hussein . . . .\n\n  Of course, this is the most critical thing we are dealing with. I \nhappen to chair the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. \nThis committee is in charge of all readiness issues and military \nconstruction, all training. Since this President took office, we have \nwatched what has happened with our military and our ability to defend \nourselves. I am going to elaborate on that a little bit later.\n  The bottom line is, we are one-half the strength we were when he took \noffice. I quantify that by saying one-half of the Army divisions, one-\nhalf of the tactical air wings, one-half of the ships. We have gone \ndown from a 600-ship Navy to a 300-ship Navy. And all these things are \nhappening at a time when we do not have the capacity to fund and to \nlogistically support another ground movement.\n  A month ago, I went by the 21st TACOM. It is located in Germany. Its \nfunction is to logistically support ground operations. At that time, \nthe 21st TACOM said they were at 100 percent capacity and could not \ntake on any more responsibilities because they were devoting all their \nattention to Bosnia. The trucks were going into Bosnia from Hungary, \ntaking everything necessary to keep that exercise going.\n  I looked at the problem we have within the administration in the 21st \nTACOM. This President has cut the number of troops managing from 28,500 \nto 7,300. They are operating with just a fraction of the number they \nhad before, about one-fourth.\n  I asked the question: If we get into something--at that time, we \nthought it was going to be Iraq; we didn't know about Kosovo at that \ntime--if something happens and we need ground troops in Iraq, what are \nyou going to do? That is in your theater, too.\n  They said: We couldn't do anything. We would be 100 percent dependent \nupon Guard and Reserve. As we know, our critical operational \nspecialities, MOSs, are failing in our Reserve and Guard components, \nand the reason is that we have had so many deployments under this \nadministration that they cannot be expected to leave their jobs. A \ndoctor can no longer expect to leave his practice for a period of 270 \ndays and go back and have any practice left. And the same thing is true \nwith the employers around the country. So we have those serious \nproblems. Again, this is from a month ago.\n  And lastly, I mention, in a hearing before us, what the various \ngenerals had said. General Ryan, who is the Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce, said, ``There stands a very good chance that we will lose \naircraft against the Yugoslavian air defense.'' The Navy Chief of Staff \nsaid, ``We must be prepared to take losses.'' The Marine Corps \nCommandant, General Krulak, said it will be ``tremendously dangerous.'' \nAnd George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence of the United \nStates, reminded us that Kosovo is not Bosnia, and if we get on the \nground there, their participants are not tired and worn out, they are \nready and willing and culturally prepared to fight and to kill \nAmericans.\n  I mention that, Mr. President--that was a month ago--to get it in a \ncontext that helps me to understand where we are today. I want to \nmention, I am not saying this as a Republican; I am saying this as a \nMember of the U.S. Senate and as the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Readiness Subcommittee, with a responsibility to tell the \ntruth about what is going on.\n  The American people have not been hearing the truth. They have heard \nthat the President does not want to send in ground troops, and yet we \nknow he does want to send in ground troops. I have to say that the \nPresident of the United States, Bill Clinton, has a propensity to say \nthings that are untrue with great conviction. And for that reason, I am \nafraid there are a lot of people who are afraid of this man, because he \nis so adept at getting the American people behind him.\n  One of the things he has said that is not true is what he told the \nAmerican people as to the reason why we were going to get involved. He \ntalked about the history, and he said that this is exactly what \nprecipitated World War I, and the same thing with World War II. I am \nnot a historian, Mr. President, certainly not the historian that you \nare, but I would say there are some historians around who have voiced \nthemselves on this.\n\n  Again, going back to Henry Kissinger, no one will question his \ncredentials concerning the history of that region and that period of \ntime. He said--and I am quoting now--``The Second World War did not \nstart in the Balkans, much less as a result of its ethnic conflicts,'' \ntotally refuting what the President told the American people. He goes \non--and this is further quoting --``World War I started in the Balkans \nnot as a result of ethnic conflicts but for precisely the opposite \nreason: because outside powers intervened in a local conflict. The \nassassination of the Crown Prince of Austria--an imperial power--by a \nSerbian nationalist led to a world war because Russia backed''--listen \nto this, Mr. President--``Russia backed Serbia and France backed Russia \nwhile Germany supported Austria.''\n  That is exactly the same thing right now. If a person wanted to start \nWorld War III, based on the model that took place for World War I, they \nwould do exactly what we are doing; that is, go in there and say to \nRussia and to China, who is with Russia, ``All right. We don't care \nwhat you say, we're going to get involved in a war here,'' and rub \ntheir nose in it.\n  Let's keep in mind that China and Russia have missiles that will \nreach the United States of America, and they have every different kind \nof weapon of mass destruction put on those missiles. So it is just \nexactly the opposite of what the President said. That war started \nbecause the superpowers of the time took each side in a civil war that \nwas taking place in what was then Yugoslavia.\n  I have said several times that the President has not been telling the \nAmerican people the truth in terms of ground troops and the number of \nground troops that are going to be going in. I would like to quote now \nto try to validate what I have said. General Wesley Clark, who is the \nSupreme Allied Commander for NATO and our troops in Europe, said--this \nis way back in the beginning, 7 months ago--``We never thought air \npower alone could stop the paramilitary tragedy . . . everyone \nunderstood it. . . .''\n  And just a week ago, Thursday, the Presiding Officer will remember, \nbecause he was sitting there, Secretary Bill Cohen, in whom I have the \nmost respect, said, ``We would try diplomacy, and that's what \nRambouillet was all about . . . we would try deterrence . . . but \nfailing that, we understood that [Milosevic] could take action very \nquickly and that an air campaign could do little if anything to stop \nhim.''\n  So we have not just the experts in the field, the commanding general, \nbut also the Secretary of Defense who said they have known all along we \nare going to have to send troops in. Obviously, they both work for \nPresident Clinton. And President Clinton knew it.\n  I was a little disturbed last week when Joe Lockhart, in one of his \npress conferences, brushed off some questions, and then he volunteered \nwithout a question being asked--he said, ``Senator Inhofe is wrong in \nthat we are in great shape. Our state of readiness is just as good as \nit was back in 1991,'' or words to that effect. And I have to say \neither he is intentionally lying or just incredibly misinformed, \nbecause, as I said before, we, right now, are one-half the troop \nstrength that we were in 1991. I think it is a terrible disservice for \nJoe Lockhart and the President to try to convince the American people \nthat we are more prepared than we really are.\n\n  I would like to also mention that the President is breaking the law \ntoday. I was over there in just the last 3 days, and I went in there on \na C-17. That C-17 had multiple launch rockets right there, all of them \nhot and ready to be fired--two of those, along with some two pallets of \nadditional ammunition, a humvee, and additional troops.\n  Troops are there right now within the sight of the border of Kosovo. \nAnd one of our most brilliant Senators, Senator Pat Roberts, had passed \nan amendment to the 1999 defense appropriations bill where he said that \nthe President cannot deploy troops to--and\n\n[[Page S4153]]\n\nhe named different places, which would include this area--unless eight \ndifferent conditions were met. One was that we have national security \ninterests; No. 2, why they are national security interests; No. 3, what \nis the mission; No. 4, what is the exit strategy; No. 5, what is the \ncost; No. 6, identify the cost; No. 7, how it will affect readiness; \nand there is an eighth one. He has not complied with any of these \neight. I say just by sending them into Albania, he has already broken \nthat law.\n  The second area I want to get into is cost. In ``cost,'' I am not \ntalking about just dollars but also national security.\n  Because the President has decimated our defense budget, we no longer \ncan defend America on two simultaneous, what they call MTWs--major \ntheater wars. Ninety percent of the American people think we can \nbecause they have been told we can, but we cannot. We are not able to \ndo that. We are one-half the force strength we were.\n  In addition to that, we are handling all of these deployments. We \nhave had more deployments in the last 6 years than we had in the 20 \nyears prior to that. In almost every case, they are being deployed in \nareas where we have no national security interests. So we are paying \nwithout any national security interest.\n  I think it is very interesting to note that, of the great effort we \nhave put forth in the air, which has been very successful in terms of \nour deployment and our ability and our equipment, a total of 480 \naircraft were used. Well, guess what, Mr. President. Three hundred \nsixty-five of those 480 were us, the United States of America.\n  So we have Tony Blair standing up and making these great profound \nstatements: ``We have to escalate the war.'' That is easy for him to \nsay. We have 365 airplanes over there. He has 20. I will tell you, that \nis a pretty good deal. ``Let's go ahead and escalate,'' if you are Tony \nBlair.\n  I have a problem with all these multinationalist things, obligations \nor obsessions, that this President has. In the case of NATO, we have 80 \npercent of the effort right now we are paying for and yet we only have \n5 percent of the vote.\n  General Hendrix is the commander in chief of the 5th Corps over \nthere. The 5th Corps, Mr. President, has 50,000 troops. To give you an \nidea of the significance of what is going on right now with the \ndeployment to Tirana, just south of the Kosovo border, where I just \ncame back from--where you have already been--he is there now full time. \nAnd what do we have? As of today, we have 5,000 troops--wait a minute--\nwe have 5,000 out of his 50,000, and he is spending all of his time \nthere. Why is he doing that? I can tell you--and I am sure the others \nwho have been over there are fully aware--the big problem is that the \ndecisions on targets for our military aircraft are being made by \ncommittees. You have NATO. You have all these other countries that have \nto pass on targets. It is my understanding that even the President \npersonally wants to pass on those targets.\n\n  This is a big difference from the war in Kuwait in 1991. George Bush \nand the administration got together and said, we have a serious problem \nover there. We are going to have to take care of it. This is our \nmission. Colin Powell and General Schwarzkopf, you go out and do it. \nThese people are experts. They are professionals. So is General \nHendrix, but he is not able to do it on his own because these are \ncommittee decisions as to where they are supposed to be able to fire at \ntheir targets.\n  I will just update for a minute. This is as of 2 or 3 days ago. We \nare just now approaching 400 sorties coming out of Ramstein Air Force \nBase. These are C-17s carrying our equipment. You go over there and you \nget on the ground where all of our troops are in tent cities. You see \neverything over there is American.\n  I will also mention the cost of this and the three scenarios. One \nscenario is you just send the troops in as far as Kosovo, and that \nwould be about 60,000 troops, according to what I found out over there, \n30,000 of which would be Americans. Or the next step, if we went all \nthe way and took Belgrade, that would take 200,000 troops, of which \nhalf would be U.S. troops. Or if we wanted to destroy Yugoslavia \naltogether, it would take a half million troops, a quarter million of \nthose would be Americans.\n  I thought this was interesting because I found this out when I was \nover there. And I thought I had heard these figures before. The \nHeritage Foundation came out on April 21 and put down the cost of the \nthree options, and I found that to be exactly what I found out over \nthere. The only thing is, they went one step further. They included \nU.S. casualties and the cost. The cheap way, going into Kosovo, would \ncost from $5 billion to $10 billion--this is the United States cost--\nand would take from 500 to 2,000 American casualties. The second, going \ninto Belgrade, would be $10 billion to $20 billion. It would take a \ntoll of 5,000 to 10,000 American casualties. The third, $50 billion to \n$60 billion, and that would result in 15,000 to 20,000 casualties.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a chart printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              GROUND TROOP SCENARIOS FOR U.S. MILITARY ACTION IN YUGOSLAVIA\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        Number of ground troops     Time needed to field   Time needed to execute\n                                                required                    force                  mission                U.S. casualties ad cost\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDestroy All of Yugoslavia's Military  500,000 NATO troops,         6-8 months............

So we have that very serious problem.\n  I will briefly, in the remaining time, talk about the refugee \nsituation. The toll we have heard about in terms of deaths over there \nhas been somewhere between 2,000 and 3,500. NATO is now saying 3,500; \nsome are saying 2,000. Let's say 3,000. That means that 1 out of 600 of \nthe Kosovar Albanians has lost his life, 1 out of 600. If you compare \nthat--I have a ministry in West Africa. Three weeks ago, I came back \nfrom there. In the two countries of Angola and Sierra Leone, for every \n1 person who has lost his life in Kosovo, 80 have lost their lives in \njust those two countries alone.\n  We knew this was coming. I am reading now from the Washington Post of \nMarch 31:\n\n       For weeks before the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, \n     CIA Director George Tenet had been forecasting that Serb-led \n     Yugoslavian forces might respond by accelerating ethnic \n     cleansing.\n\n  Then when we asked Secretary Cohen about this, he said:\n\n       With respect to George Tenet's testifying that the bombing \n     could, in fact, accelerate Milosevic's plans, we also knew \n     that.\n\n  So they knew it. The President knew it, and the administration knew \nit. I have to say this--and this has not been observed by anyone so \nfar--I interviewed these refugees just 2 days ago. When I interviewed \nthe refugees, I found some very interesting things. They all said the \nsame thing. They said that, in fact, they didn't have any problems \nuntil the bombing started. I was interviewed by a Tirana TV station, I \nthink it was Tirana. It was Albanian, anyway. And they said, What is \nthe United States going to do about all these refugees? I said, What do \nyou mean, what are we going to do? He said, You are the reason we are \nhere. You are the ones that bombed, and that is what has caused the \nethnic cleansing and the forced exodus.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have to say one other thing about the \nrefugees. The refugees, in spite of the fact it is a\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n\nhorrible thing that some 3,000 of them have lost their lives, still \nwhen you look at the refugees, I was shocked to find out, as perhaps \nyou were, that they are very well off, considering they are refugees. \nKids are all wearing Nikes and were very well dressed. They have the \nfood that they need to eat. They seem to be in much better shape, \ncertainly much better shape than the refugees in some other areas.\n  Lastly, I want to mention the troops. Our troops are doing a great \njob. I just couldn't feel better about that. But I really want to get \ninto this, because the New York Times said, on April 13, we are going \ninto Kosovo, the middle of nowhere, with no infrastructure. They will \nbe naked, an official told the New York Times.\n  I went in there and I found that is exactly right. Our troops have \njust arrived there, and they are up to their knees, literally, in mud \nin a tent city. You have to keep in mind that Albania has some things \nthat are very unique. First of all, it is the poorest country in \nEurope. Secondly, it is always listed as one of the three most \ndangerous countries in the world. And third, a guy named Hoxha came \nalong right after the Second World War, and he actually declared, and \nit is still official policy, it is the only nation that has a declared \npolicy of atheism. So we are dealing with that kind of people there, \ntoo.\n\n  Then something happened in 1997. It is called a pyramid scheme. In \n1997, these poor Albanians, from this country in poverty, as poor as \nHaiti, revolted and they took over the military. When they did that, \nthey took over all the weapons they had. What kind of weapons did they \nhave? They had rocket-propelled grenades, RPG-7s. They had AKA-47s. \nThey had SA-7s, a shoulder-launched, surface-to-air missile that can \nknock down one of our Apaches very easily, and they had mortars. So \nhere we have our troops who are there in the mud without any \ninfrastructure protecting them and with all of this hostility around \nthem. I might also add, I was sorry--I hate to even say this--that one \nof the units that came in there when I was there was the mortician \nunit, so the body bags have arrived.\n  Mr. President, if there is ever a scene that is set for gradual \nescalation and for mission creep, this is it. I can see our Troops \ngoing in right now. When the President, who has already decided he is \ngoing to send in American troops, takes these troops and puts them \nacross the border--and we were standing there watching these high \nmountains where the border is--if they go in that way, or they go \naround through Macedonia or some other way, and they have to take over \nKosovo and get the Serbs out of Kosovo, that mission is going to creep \ninto the Belgrade scenario, and then that will creep into the \nYugoslavia scenario, and let's remember what the Heritage Foundation \nsaid in terms of American casualties.\n  I will say this, and I am not enjoying doing this. There is only \ngoing to be one possible way to keep us out of a war, in my opinion, \nbecause the President is going to send in troops. Once our American \ntroops get into Kosovo, it is irreversible. One way to keep that from \nhappening is if the American people wake up and realize that we are \ngetting involved in a war where we do not have any national security \ninterests. We are getting involved in a war that is keeping us from \nadequately defending America in areas where we do have a national \nsecurity interest such as Iraq or North Korea. Let us keep in mind that \nin Korea we still have about 367,000 troops and their families. This \nwould greatly impair them. I hope we can have a concerted effort and a \nwake-up call to the American people to stop this President from \nstarting this war that we will all live to regret.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, now that NATO has celebrated its 50th \nanniversary with unity, I believe it is important that the Congress of \nthe United States should now carefully assess what action is next to be \ntaken by NATO involving the United States against the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia.\n  It is critical that Congress discharge its constitutional \nresponsibility where the Constitution specifies that only the Congress \nof the United States has the authority to declare war and to involve \nthe United States in war. The black-letter pronouncement of the \nConstitution is sufficient reason in and of itself for meticulous \nobservance, but the public policy reasons behind that constitutional \nprovision are very sound. Unless there is public support for war, shown \nfirst through the action of the Congress of the United States, it is \nnot realistic or possible to successfully prosecute the war. We learned \nthat from the bitter experience of Vietnam.\n  When the Congress of the United States makes a declaration, either \nformally or through a resolution, it happens after deliberation, after \nanalysis, after an interchange of ideas and after a debate. In so many \ninstances now, we have seen erosion of the congressional authority to \ndeclare war. Korea was a war without a declaration by Congress. Vietnam \nwas a war without a declaration by Congress. Only the Gulf of Tonkin \nresolution has been held up by some as a thinly veiled authorization \nfor the military action taken by the United States in Vietnam.\n  I believe that we must be very, very cautious not to repeat the \nmistake of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution and not to endorse hastily a \nresolution proposed by some of our colleagues in the United States \nSenate to authorize the President to use whatever force the President \nmay determine to be necessary in the military action against the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n  I am not prepared to give the President a blank check. I believe that \nthe constitutional responsibility of a Senator and the entire Senate, \nboth Houses of Congress of the United States, involves a deliberate \njudgment as to what ought to be undertaken before we involve the United \nStates in war and before we, in effect, have a declaration of war. And \nthere are many, many very important questions which have to be answered \nbefore this Senator is prepared to authorize the executive branch--the \nPresident--to use whatever force the President deems necessary.\n  First of all, we need to know what the U.S. commitment will be. We \nneed to know what the plan is. We need to know the strength of the \nSerbian Army, the military forces of the Republic of Yugoslavia. We \nneed to know to what extent the airstrikes so far have degraded or \nweakened the military forces of the Serbs or the Republic of \nYugoslavia. We need to know what the other commitments will be from the \nother NATO nations. We need to know how long our commitment will be, or \nat least some reasonable estimate as to how long we may be expected to \nbe in Kosovo.\n  We know that the initial deployment in Bosnia was accompanied by a \nPresidential promise to be out within a year. That was extended by a \nperiod of time. That extension was re-extended, and now we don't even \nhave an outer limit as to how long we are to be in Bosnia.\n  We know that the President has come forward with a request for $5.9 \nbillion in additional funding. I believe the Congress of the United \nStates will support our fighting men and women. But that is a large \nbill; about $5.5 billion is for military machinery, operations and \nequipment. It was a surprise to many that in the course of that \nmilitary operation, we were on the verge of running out of missiles; \nthat our munitions supply was questionable; that our supply of spare \nparts was questionable. Many of us on this floor, including this \nSenator, have argued that our military has been reduced too\n\n[[Page S4155]]\n\nmuch. And now there is a debate underway as to whether the President's \nrequest for $5.9 billion ought to be supplemented to take care of many \nitems that have been overlooked in the past--issues of military pay, \nissues of munitions, the overall readiness of the United States.\n  When the distinguished Prime Minister Tony Blair was in the United \nStates last week, I had occasion to talk to him personally and get his \nviews as to what ought to be done in our military action, the NATO \nmilitary action, against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Prime \nMinister Blair talks about ground forces. I asked the obvious questions \nas to how many the United Kingdom is prepared to commit, how many the \nU.S. will be called upon to undertake, and what we have done by way of \ndegrading the Yugoslav forces by air attacks. To his credit, Prime \nMinister Blair responded that those were all unanswered questions.\n\n  Well, before I am prepared to vote for the use of force, I think \nthere ought to be some very concrete answers to those questions. The \nPresident of the United States was quoted as saying that he was \nprepared to reevaluate the question of the use of ground troops because \nthat request had been made by the Secretary General of NATO. Frankly, I \nam just a little bit surprised that the Commander in Chief of the U.S. \nmilitary forces is looking to the leadership of the Secretary General \nof NATO when the United States is playing the dominant role and \nsupplying the overwhelming majority of air power and materiel in our \nmilitary action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n  It seems to me the leadership ought to be coming from the President. \nThe leadership ought to be coming from the United States. We certainly \nare footing the bill, and we certainly are the major actor. So if, in \nfact, there is a justification for a greater authorization by the \nCongress, that word ought to come from the President, through the \nleadership of the President, telling us in a very concrete way the \nanswers to the important questions that I have enumerated.\n  This Senator understands there are no absolute answers to the \nquestions, but we ought to have best estimates, and we ought to have a \nvery candid assessment from the United States military, who, so far, \nhave been less than unequivocal in their responses as to whether the \nairstrikes alone can bring President Milosevic to his knees. The answer \nthat is given by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nShelton, is that the military will be degraded. But there is a more \nfundamental question which needs to be answered--whether the airstrikes \nwill be successful, or whether the airstrikes will sufficiently weaken \nthe Republic of Yugoslavia so that we at least have an idea, if there \nare to be ground forces, what the results will be.\n  But I believe very strongly that we should not pass a resolution \nanalogous to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, authorizing the President \nto use whatever force the President deems necessary. I believe there \nshould be no blank check for this President, or for any President. But \nI am prepared to listen to a concrete, specific plan that evaluates the \nrisks, that evaluates the costs in terms of potential U.S. lives. I am \nnot prepared to commit ground forces without having a specific idea as \nto what the realistic prognosis will be.\n  The Senate of the United States passed a resolution on March 23 \nauthorizing airstrikes, but strictly guarding against ground forces. \nThe airstrikes constitute a clear-cut act of war, and the resolution of \nthe Senate of the United States is not sufficient under the \nConstitution. There has to be a joinder with the House of \nRepresentatives. So it is my thought that before any further action is \ntaken, before there is any suggestion of a commitment of ground forces, \nthat matter ought to come before the Congress and ought to receive \nprior congressional authorization before any such force is used, and \nthat the entire Congress of the United States ought to review the \nmilitary action that is undertaken at the present time, and that it is \nin fact beyond the prerogative of the President under his \nconstitutional authority as Commander in Chief, but it is realistically \na matter that is decided by the Congress.\n\n  Make no mistake. There are very vital interests involved in the \naction now being undertaken against the Republic of Yugoslavia. NATO's \ncredibility is squarely on the line. The credibility of the United \nStates is squarely on the line. The activities of the Serbs, the \nRepublic of Yugoslavia, in what is called ethnic cleansing, which is a \npolite name for ``barbaric massacres,'' is unparalleled since World War \nII. And there are very major humanitarian interests which are currently \nbeing served.\n  This body has never come to grips, in my opinion, with the square \ndetermination as to whether vital U.S. national security interests are \ninvolved, and that is the traditional test of the use of force. But we \nare on the line; our country is on the line. NATO, a very important \ninternational organization, has its credibility on the line. And we \nmust act in a very thoughtful, very careful way after important \ninformation is presented to the Congress by the President, because only \nthe President is in a position to answer the critical questions. Then \nthe deliberation of the Congress ought to take shape, and we ought to \nmake a determination in accordance with the Constitution whether the \nCongress will authorize the executive branch to use force, to send in \nground troops, or what the parameters of that declaration would be.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I urge the Palestinian Authority not to \ntake unilateral action on May 4 to declare a Palestinian state. That \ndate, May 4, 1999, marks a period where significant speculation has \nbeen undertaken as to whether the Palestinian Authority would make such \na unilateral declaration of statehood because of their dissatisfaction \nwith the progress of the negotiations under the Oslo accords. I urge \nthe Palestinian Authority not to take any such action on the grounds \nthat is a matter for negotiation under the Oslo accords, and that it is \nsomething that ought to be decided between the parties to those \naccords--the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\n  I had occasion to discuss this matter personally with Chairman Yasser \nArafat when he was in the United States a little over a month ago when \nI was scheduled to visit him in his hotel in Virginia, but I had the \nopportunity to confer with Chairman Arafat in my hideaway.\n  For those who don't know what a hideaway is, it is a small room in \nthe Capitol downstairs 2 minutes away from the Senate floor; small, but \naccommodating.\n  On that occasion, Chairman Arafat and I discussed a variety of \ntopics, including the question of whether the Palestinian Authority \nwould undertake a unilateral declaration of statehood.\n  I might say to the Chair in passing just a small personal note that \nwhen I accompanied President Clinton to Bethlehem in December of last \nyear, I was struck by a large poster which had the overtones of a \npolitical poster. It had a picture of the President on one side with \nhis thumb up, and it had a picture of Chairman Arafat on the other \nside. It was a political poster. The picture had not been taken with \nPresident Clinton and Chairman Arafat together, but it had that \nsymbolism for the occasion of the President's visit to Bethlehem.\n  I took one as a souvenir. As we Senators sometimes do, I had it \nframed and it is hanging in my hideaway so that when Chairman Arafat \ncame into the hideaway and saw the picture of himself and President \nClinton, he was very pleased to see it on display and insisted on \nhaving a picture of himself taken in front of the picture of himself, \nwhich is not an unusual occurrence, whether you are a Palestinian with \nthe Palestinian Authority, or from even the State of Kansas, or the \nState of Pennsylvania.\n\n  In the course of our discussions, I urged Chairman Arafat not to make \nthe unilateral declaration of statehood.\n\n[[Page S4156]]\n\n He said to me that it was not up to himself alone, but it was up to \nthe council.\n  Then he made a comment that he questioned whether the Palestinian \nAuthority had received sufficient credit for the change of its Charter \neliminating the provisions in the PLO Charter calling for the \ndestruction of Israel.\n  In 1995, Senator Shelby and I proposed legislation, which was \nenacted, that conditioned U.S. payments to the Palestinian Authority on \nchanging the Charter and on making the maximum effort against \nterrorists, so that when Chairman Arafat raised the question about \nwhether there had been sufficient recognition given to the Palestinian \nAuthority for changing the Charter, I told him that I thought he was \nprobably right and that there had not been sufficient recognition given \nto the Palestinian Authority for that change.\n  He then asked me if there would be recognition given to the \nPalestinian Authority if it resisted a unilateral declaration of \nstatehood.\n  I said to Chairman Arafat that I personally would go to the Senate \nfloor on May 5 if a unilateral declaration of statehood was not made on \nMay 4.\n  Being a good negotiator, which we know Chairman Arafat is, he asked \nif I would put that in writing. I said that I would. On March 31 of \nthis year, I wrote to the chairman as follows:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you very much for coming to my \n     Senate hideaway and for our very productive discussion on \n     March 23rd.\n       Following up on that discussion, I urge that the \n     Palestinian Authority not make a unilateral declaration of \n     statehood on May 4th or on any subsequent date. The issue of \n     the Palestinian state is a matter for negotiation under the \n     terms of the Oslo Accords.\n       I understand your position that this issue will not be \n     decided by you alone but will be submitted to the Palestinian \n     Authority Council.\n       When I was asked at our meeting whether you and the \n     Palestinian Authority would receive credit for refraining \n     from the unilateral declaration of statehood, I replied that \n     I would go to the Senate floor on May 5th or as soon \n     thereafter as possible and compliment your action in not \n     unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state.\n       I look forward to continuing discussions with you on the \n     important issues in the Mid-East peace process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. President, I decided to make this public comment to emphasize my \nview, and I believe the view shared by many, if not most, in the \nCongress of the United States that, in fact, the Palestinian Authority \nshould not unilaterally declare statehood, but should leave it to \nnegotiations under the Oslo accords.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, clearly the discussions on Kosovo are \ndominating the day and should. But I hope that we don't forget that we \ndo have an agenda that we need to go forward with as well. So I want to \ntalk a few minutes today about Social Security.\n  Specifically, I would like to talk a little bit about our efforts to \nprotect and strengthen the Social Security system. We have talked about \nit for a very long time.\n  It is not a surprise that without some changes, the Social Security \nprogram will not be able to accomplish what it is designed to \naccomplish. Nearly everyone recognizes that we have to do something \ndifferent than we have been doing. I will, in fact, say that there is \nnot a consensus as to what that ``something different'' ought to be.\n  But the goal surely can be shared by most everyone. The goal is to be \nable to know that we can continue to provide benefits for the \nbeneficiaries and those that are close to being beneficiaries, and at \nthe same time be able to provide benefits in the long run for young \npeople who are now just beginning to have deducted from their salary \nSocial Security payments. I suspect all of us want to do that.\n  I have a mother who I am concerned about who has Social Security. I \nhave 5-year-old twin grandchildren and I am anxious about their \nsecurity. That is the kind of issue we have.\n\n  I notice today's newspaper expresses relief that we will go forward \nwith Social Security. There was some discussion last week that it would \nnot move.\n  I will talk a little bit about the lockbox legislation. We are \nseeking to push through a Social Security lockbox. What does that mean? \nIt means we take that amount of money which comes in as Social Security \nnow and set it aside so that it will be used for Social Security.\n  Over the years, we have had what is called a unified budget, and all \nthe money that comes in--whether from Social Security, income tax, \nhighway funds, or whatever--goes into the unified budget.\n  This year, for the first time in 25 years, we have had a balanced \nbudget, but it is a unified budget. If you took Social Security out of \nthat balanced budget, it would not be balanced. Indeed, it would be \nsomewhat in deficit.\n  We need to understand what that is. Now that we are close to having a \nunified budget in balance and close to having it without Social \nSecurity, now we have an opportunity to do the things with Social \nSecurity dollars that I believe we need to do.\n  The lockbox is designed to guarantee that all Social Security surplus \nfunds will be reserved for Social Security alone. This, of course, has \nnot been the case. It is difficult to do, frankly. We have never had a \nplace to put it. When we have a life insurance program or an annuity \nprogram, there has to be somewhere to put those funds so they draw \ninterest. Of course, under the law, the only place they can be invested \nis in government securities.\n  They are set aside here, but they are spent. Of course the President \nis suggesting he would raid the Social Security to the tune of about \n$158 billion, after having talked for 2 years about saving Social \nSecurity.\n  I am concerned that the current debate is going to become very \ndifficult: How do we pay for Kosovo? How do we pay for increasing the \nsupport of the military? How do we pay for the emergency funds that are \nin the process of being provided for Central America?\n  We have budget spending limits which I think are key to keeping a \nsmaller Government, to keeping a responsible Government. When we go \noutside of those spending limits with emergency spending, it goes from \nSocial Security. Last year, for example, the President insisted, with \nthe threat of closing down Government, that we had to spend $20 billion \nin emergency funding. I suppose no one would argue if emergency funds \nare a genuine emergency, such as weather disasters or taking care of \nour troops in Kosovo, we are going to do that, by all means. When we \nstart talking about how we build up the Armed Forces, I think we ought \nto take a look at whether that comes as an emergency or, in fact, comes \nout of our budget.\n  We are trying to move to some kind of financially sound lockbox. In \n2014, Social Security begins to run in a deficit. Social Security \nstarted about 60 years ago, I think--in the 1930s. People paid 1 \npercent of $3,000--$30--into Social Security. There were 31 people \nworking for every beneficiary. Of course, now that has changed. Now we \nall pay 12.5 percent of our earnings up to $70,000 or more, moving up. \nThere are, I think, fewer than three people working for each one \ndrawing benefits. In the near future, it will be fewer than two. That \nis the sort of dilemma with which we are faced.\n\n  I suppose there are many considerations to look at, but there are \nthree that are obvious.\n  One, you could reduce benefits. Not many are prepared to do that; \neven though Social Security, of course, is not a retirement program, it \nis a supplementary program. For a high percentage of people, that is, \nindeed, their largest income requirement.\n  Two, you could increase taxes. I don't think there is a great deal of \nexcitement about that. I do not think it is a great idea. Social \nSecurity taxes are the largest tax that most Americans pay.\n  Three, increase the rate of return on the money that is in the trust \nfund.\n\n[[Page S4157]]\n\nThat is one of the things we are talking about doing, trying to put \ntogether a personal account--not to take all of the 12 percent but to \ntake, say, 3 or 4 percent out of the 12, about a third of the money. \nLet it be your account, your personal account. If, unfortunately, you \nwere not able to live long enough to get all of your money out of it, \nit would go to your estate.\n  How is it invested? By private investors, similar to the Federal \nsavings program. Once a year, members get a sheet of paper asking how \nthey would like this invested. The choice would be in equities, bonds, \nor in a combination of the two. So members would choose one of those \noptions. It is invested for you--not invested, as the President has \nsuggested, where he takes trillions of dollars and has the Government \ninvest it. Then the Government would basically control the marketplace. \nNone of us want that.\n  Personal ownership, it seems to me, ensures that the Federal \nGovernment can't come back later and reduce your benefits. That is a \nway to secure those dollars. They are not then in the Government ready \nto be spent for some other reason.\n  Depending on your view about the size of government--and there is a \nlegitimate difference between those who are more conservative and those \nwho are more liberal. There are always ways to spend more money. To \ncontrol the size of government, as has been our goal over the last \nnumber of years, you can't have a lot of surplus money lying around or \nelse it is simply spent and government grows. We have to do something \nto secure Social Security. Then, hopefully, when there is excess money, \nwe can look for some kind of tax relief.\n  It has been a long time since we started on this. Quite frankly, I \nthink the sooner we make a change, the less abrupt that change will \nhave to be. I am hopeful we do get back. We started out this year \nwanting to do this. Now the President is reluctant to take any \nleadership. Some of the leaders in the Congress were saying we ought to \nset it aside. I don't agree.\n  Certainly, we need to focus on Kosovo, but it doesn't mean we don't \ndo the other things that are before the Senate. It is time to design a \nfirst-class system that fulfills the needs of everyone--our older \ncitizens, our younger citizens. We need a permanent fix, not just \ntinkering around the edges. People have thought for years that Social \nSecurity was the holy grail of politics--touch it and you are dead. I \nthink it has changed, because people understand if it is not changed, \nSocial Security will be dead.\n  I hope we move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/26/senate-section/article/S4157-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4157-S4158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR ROMAN L. HRUSKA\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to recall a towering \npublic servant, Senator Roman L. Hruska, who spent 22 years of his life \nin this body and who died yesterday at Omaha, NE, at the age of 94. \nSenator Hruska served with my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  In a day when some might question the morality of public service, the \ncivility of public service, the genuineness of public service, and the \ngoodness of public service, they did not know Senator Roman Hruska. \nSenator Hruska was one of 11 children, born in David City, NE, 94 years \nago. His father had emigrated from Czechoslovakia, and moved his family \nto Omaha where he felt they would have a better opportunity to get an \neducation and a better opportunity for a better life.\n  Senator Hruska's father was a teacher. Senator Hruska went on through \npublic schools in Nebraska, attended a number of graduate schools, the \nUniversity of Chicago, and obtained his law degree in Nebraska. He \nstarted a law practice in south Omaha.\n  When there became a vacancy on the Douglas County board of \ncommissioners in Omaha, NE, his fellow citizens came to him and said, \n``Will you serve for one term?'' That one term began in 1944.\n  A year later, he became chairman of the Douglas County board of \ncommissioners, and until 1952 he served the Greater Omaha area and the \nState of Nebraska with great distinction.\n  In 1952, a House seat opened up. It was the seat of Howard Buffett. \nMr. President, that name ``Buffett'' may ring a bell. Howard Buffett \nwas the father of Warren Buffett. Howard Buffett decided not to run for \nreelection.\n  Again, Roman Hruska's friends and colleagues said, ``Will you run for \nCongress?'' Roman Hruska said, ``Well, I will do that for a short \nperiod of time.'' Roman Hruska was overwhelmingly elected to the \nCongress in 1952. Two years later, the Senate seat opened and, again, \nthe same people asked Roman Hruska to serve. He ran for the Senate in \n1954 and never looked back. He retired from the Senate in 1976.\n  I recall my first exposure to Senator Hruska as a young chief of \nstaff to Congressman John Y. McCollister in the early 1970s. I would \ncome to the Senate once or twice a week to get a delegation letter \nsigned by Senator Hruska and then Senator Curtis. Senator Hruska would \nsee me occasionally standing outside a hearing room and would never \nfail to accord me not only some recognition, which as we know around \nhere does not always happen with junior staffers, but he was beyond \ngracious. He always had time for young people, always had time to talk \na little bit about what we thought and what was on our minds.\n\n  I really came to cherish those times when I had an opportunity to \ncome over and see Senator Hruska. Senator Hruska was often in meetings, \nI say to Senator Hollings, with some of Senator Hollings' favorite \ncolleagues, such as Senator Goldwater, Senator Eastland, Senator Long.\n  As a young staffer, I would be invited in to the outer ring of those \ndistinguished United States Senators and would stand and watch and \nlisten. Senator Hruska would never fail to introduce me to his \ncolleagues and make me feel not only welcome but a part of Government, \na part of what he was doing.\n  The dignity that Senator Hruska brought to his service is something \nwell remembered by not just those of us who were privileged to have \nsome relationship but all who served with Senator Hruska. He made this \nbody a better body. He made America stronger. He believed in things.\n  Senator Hruska did not believe in governance by way of calibration of \nthe polls. You knew where Senator Hruska was and why. He was always a \ngentleman--always a gentleman. He would debate the issues straight up. \nHe won most of the time; he lost his share. But the relationships that \nSenator Hruska developed and the respect that underpinned his service \nis rather uncommon. We are all better for it. America is stronger for \nit. Nebraska loses a very wise counselor. America loses a great public \nservant.\n  When I ran for the Senate in 1996, one of the first people I went to \nsee was Senator Hruska. The advice he gave me was consistent with his \nservice and his life. He said, ``Chuck, I would not feel competent to \njudge or give you counsel on the issues of our day, but I will tell you \nthis: Play it straight, say it straight, respect your colleagues and \nrespect yourself, but most important, respect the institution of the \nU.S. Congress and always understand the high privilege it is to be part \nof that great body.''\n  He was much too modest to go beyond what he gave me as good, solid \nadvice on issues, but I can tell you that on the big issues over the \nlast 3 years, not only I, but many of my colleagues, have constantly \ngone back to Roman Hruska and asked for his judgment and his thoughts.\n  He will be greatly missed. I say to Senator Hollings, I will leave \nthese remarks on behalf of your former colleague and friend and my \nfriend, Senator Roman Hruska, by referring to Senator Hruska the way \nyour former colleague, Everett Dirksen, once referred to Roman Hruska, \nand that is: A salute to the noblest Roman of them all--Roman Hruska.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, \nMr. Hagel, reminds me of a happier day. I say a happier day most \nsincerely in the sense that we had not become subject to all the \nconsultants, all the pollsters to the point whereby today, in large \nmeasure, we more or less are marionettes to the consultants' hot-button \nitems and issues and not the needs of the people.\n  There was a tremendous respect on both sides of the aisle. I was \nelected in 1966. At that time, Senator Hruska was the ranking member of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee and Senator Jim\n\n[[Page S4158]]\n\nEastland of Mississippi served as chairman. I remember the various \nmeasures that went before the Judiciary Committee for debate and action \nwere those bills that were agreed upon by Senator Hruska and Senator \nEastland.\n  Senator Hruska was a profound lawyer, and I say that advisedly in the \nsense of a little quibble. Everybody will remember or the media friends \nwill remember when we were trying to nominate a Supreme Court Justice, \nthat maybe he was not a graduate of Harvard and, therefore, sort of \nwhat they would call ``mediocre talent.'' That nettled the Senator from \nNebraska and he said, ``Well, there are a lot of people in the land and \na lot of lawyers of mediocre talent and maybe they need representation \non the Court.''\n  I remember him as a very erudite counsel who worked on these measures \nseriously and with purpose and was most respected. He has been a loss, \nI say to Senator Hagel. He has been missed over the many years because \nhe held the line. We deliberated in a bipartisan fashion, and he \ncontributed to that bipartisan leadership which is so lacking today.\n  We ought to be working together. It would be a happier day. But, \nunfortunately, here we go again. The downtown crowd thinks they can \nembellish a computer glitch problem into a reform of the State tort \nlaws with respect to joint and several liability, punitive damages, and \neverything else. As a result, it is a nonstarter.\n  Like last week, the folks thought it would be good, since the \nPresident said, ``I'm going to save 62 percent for Social Security,'' \nthey one-upmanshipped and said, ``We'll save 100 percent,'' knowing all \nalong the 100 percent going to pay down the debt was coming from Social \nSecurity, increasing the debt on Social Security, thereby savaging, not \nsaving, the fund. But so it goes.\n  We do miss Senator Hruska. Mostly we miss his habits and his \nleadership and his balance in service. I think more than the balanced \nbudget, what we need is balanced Senators.\n  With that, I yield the floor for a balanced Senator, the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the comments \nof the Senator from Nebraska about the late Senator Roman Hruska. There \nis something unique about Nebraska. There has been a long line of \noutstanding Senators to represent that State on both sides of the \naisle. I know my colleagues and I appreciate very much both of our \nSenators from Nebraska, and they have carried on the tradition of \nSenator Curtis and Senator Hruska for honesty and integrity and a \nforthright addressing of the issues.\n  I know Senator Hruska is proud of Senator Hagel, as Senator Hagel and \nthe rest of us who had the privilege of knowing Senator Hruska \nappreciate him and his service for 22 years in the Senate --a very long \ntime.\n  I agree with the comments of my old, dear friend from South Carolina \nthat we do need more balance in the Senate. He and I occasionally find \nourselves on different sides of an issue, as we do on this one. But our \ndisagreements have been characterized with mutual respect and \nappreciation. And frankly, I enjoy the debates I have had over the \nyears with the Senator from South Carolina because he marshals his \naudience, and not only that, he from time to time injects a degree of \nhumor that illuminates as well as elevates the debate.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to former \nU.S. Senator Roman Hruska, who served Nebraska and our Nation with \nhonor, dignity and ability for 22 years in the U.S. Senate, from 1954 \nto 1976.\n  I join my colleagues in mourning the passing of Roman Hruska. Roman \nwas a man who embodied all the positive traits of a good public \nservant. He was selfless, a man of integrity and character, and someone \nwho was committed to helping others.\n  I had the pleasure of serving with Roman during his entire service in \nthe U.S. Senate. He and I were both Members of the class of 1954.\n  It is my hope that others will be inspired by Roman's commitment to \npublic service and helping others. He was a good man who will be missed \nby a large circle of friends in and out of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/26/senate-section/article/S4158-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nintroduced by Senator Roth that would permanently protect the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. The fate of the Arctic Refuge has been one of \nthe highest profile natural resources issues of the past 20 years and \nwill continue to be a key issue in the environmental debate. The Refuge \nis one of the last unspoiled wilderness areas in the United States, and \nis most often referred to as the ``biological heart'' of Alaska and \n``America's Serengeti.''\n  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the only place in the United \nStates where a full range of sub-arctic and arctic ecosystems are \nprotected in one unbroken stretch of land. This 1.5 million acre \ncoastal plain is home to a vast number of species including arctic \nfoxes, musk oxen, wolves, polar and grizzly bears, wolverines, and more \nthan 135 varieties of birds. The area is also the main calving ground \nfor the 120,000 head porcupine caribou herd, which migrates each spring \nto feed on the vegetation found there.\n  In the summer of 1997, I traveled to the refuge and was able to see \nfirst hand how beautiful and important this land is to both Alaska and \nthe Nation. As part of a Senate delegation, I visited the port of \nValdez, where oil is loaded onto tankers, and I traveled along the \npipeline that brings oil from the north. I also flew over the refuge \nitself, including the Mollie Beattie Wilderness. I was astounded by the \nnatural beauty of this area that is home to such variety of plants and \nanimals that rely on the delicate balance that exists in this pristine \nwilderness. I also visited a number of native communities along the \nNorth Slope and spoke to the inhabitants about their life in this \nunique environment that they depend on for both their cultural identity \nand their survival. As a nation we must continue to protect this vital \necosystem and work to bring good jobs, education, and health care to \nthese native communities.\n  I continue to believe that the United States dependence on oil and \nits byproducts cannot overshadow the importance of keeping ANWR free \nfrom the traditional impacts of oil drilling and exploration. The \ntechnological improvements within the oil industry make it possible for \nthe oil companies to use a slant drilling technique to harvest the oil \nin a manner that may not impact the ecosystem to the degree traditional \ntechniques would. But drilling and exploration in this gentle Arctic \nwilderness at this time could have a lasting impact that would forever \ndamage the environment of this region.\n  I applaud the Senator from Delaware's commitment to permanent \nprotection for this unique linkage of ecosystems upon which the local \ncommunities depend, and the American community as a whole should value \nas a national and natural treasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/26/senate-section/article/S4158-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4158-S4159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n U.S. COMMERCE DEPARTMENT'S NEW INTERNET PATENT AND TRADEMARKS DATABASE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to commend Commerce Secretary \nWilliam Daley, acting Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks Q. Todd \nDickinson, and the U.S. Department of Commerce for their hard work and \ndedication in establishing the new Patent and Trademark Office Internet \ndatabase. This online database truly reinvents how the government does \nbusiness and how business innovation can flourish with government's \nhelp. This database will help erode some of the traditional barriers \nthat have hindered business innovation in small, rural states like \nVermont.\n  As an avid Internet user, I have long advocated a transition to an \nonline database for trademarks and patents. The prior painstaking \nprocess of searching existing patents and trademarks was a time-\nconsuming frustration for inventors. Last Congress I co-authored an \namendment to the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, which would have required \nthe creation of computer networks to provide electronic access to \npatent information. I am proud that the database unveiled today \nachieves the goal of universal electronic access to trademarks and \npatents.\n\n[[Page S4159]]\n\n  This new system of instant on-line access to the entire patent \napplication--including the drawings--will greatly promote innovation \nand technology by showing researchers what the current science is. With \nthis new database, there are now more than two million complete patents \non-line dating back to 1976 and 1 million trademarks dating back to \n1870.\n  This patent and trademark database could not have come at a better \ntime. In the last 2 years, patent applications have increased by 25 \npercent and trademark applications have increased by 16 percent. In \n1998, the Patent and Trademark Office received over a quarter of a \nmillion applications for patents alone, and they issued more than \n150,000 patents.\n  Advancements in medicine, information technology, pharmaceuticals, \ntransportation, environmental protection, manufacturing, agriculture, \nentertainment and countless other areas of science depend on patents. \nNew investions build on exisitng science, and existing science will now \nbe available to anyone with Internet access--whether they live in the \nNortheast Kingdom of Vermont or Nome, Alaska or Silicon Valley, \nCalifornia.\n  This free Internet access changes the dynamic for American \nindependent inventors and for corporate giants. Citizens who simply \nwant to learn more by browsing the Web, students doing school projects, \nindependent inventors and corporate research departments now can search \nthis vast database. I have supported this development for several years \nand am delighted that it is fully up and running.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/26/senate-section/article/S4159-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO STATE DIRECTOR BILL LAMB UPON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Bill Lamb upon \nhis retirement for his thirty-six years of dedicated service with the \nBureau of Land Management. Mr. Lamb retired on April 2, 1999 after four \nsuccessful years as BLM's State Director in Utah.\n  As native Utahn, Bill Lamb began to work for the BLM in 1963 at the \nage of 22. A graduate of Utah State University, he served in a number \nof positions varying from a range conservationist, Director of the \nArizona Strip to a budget official here in Washington. For the last \nfour years Bill has served as the Utah State BLM Director. I know that \nI speak for all of the members of the Utah delegation when I say that \nit has been a privilege to work with him.\n  I have watched Bill perform with grace under pressure, always dealing \nwith the contentious land management issues in Utah with an even-hand \nand a listening ear. His well-deserved reputation for always being \nhonest and candid helped sooth over the hard feelings and frayed nerves \nbrought on by the creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National \nMonument. He was instrumental in the successful completion of the \nhistoric Utah Schools and Lands Exchange Act of 1998 which traded State \nTrust lands locked up in the Grand Staircase for other federal lands in \nUtah.\n  Bill worked to preserve important wildlife habitat and at the same \ntime, increased public participation through the creation of the \nWashington County Desert Tortoise Habitat Conservation Plan and the \nreestablishment of the citizens' advisory board. He always strived to \nmaintain a balance between conservation and utilization and in the \nprocess earned a reputation for being one of the most able and affable \nleaders within BLM. I will miss his valuable advice and perspective \ntremendously.\n  Secretary Babbitt said: ``Bill Lamb has done a remarkable job in one \nof the most demanding positions in the BLM.'' I could not agree more. I \nthank Bill for his service that was at many times thankless. He will be \nsorely missed. I wish him great success in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/26/senate-section/article/S4159-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JAMES B. MCMILLAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to day to pay tribute to James B. \nMcMillan, pioneer and leader of the civil rights movement in Nevada. \nJames McMillan was a longtime Las Vegas dentist whose name was often \nassociated with the local civil rights movement as well as the \ndesegregation of Las Vegas casinos.\n  Dr. McMillan has been widely praised for his role in bringing down \nthe color barriers in Las Vegas. He began his exemplary career in \nDetroit and then moved to Las Vegas where he became the first \npracticing black dentist. His pioneering initiatives were displayed \nthrough such efforts as helping to form the Human Rights Commission and \nhis 1964 Senate run as the first black from Nevada to run for the U.S. \nSenate. Additionally, in 1971, McMillan became the first black to be \nappointed to the Nevada Board of Dental Examiners.\n  When McMillan first arrived in Las Vegas the town was dubbed the \n``Mississippi of the West'' and blacks were generally not allowed in \nhotel-casinos. While serving in the Korean war, McMillan opened his \nhome to house black entertainers. At the time, black entertainers were \nrapidly escorted in and out of hotels and were not allowed to \nfraternize with hotel guests but only to perform in the show rooms. \nHowever, desegregation began shortly before McMillan first came to Las \nVegas in 1955 with the opening of the Moulin Rouge, the first \nintegrated hotel-casino. Throughout his career McMillan worked to \nfurther the accessibility to hotel-casinos for blacks.\n  McMillan first felt the call to participate in the civil rights \nmovement amid a turbulent atmosphere in 1959 at a NAACP Freedom Front \nDinner. The speaker was NAACP Field Secretary Tarea Hall Pittman whose \nsubject was ``Las Vegas, now is the time.'' Despite death threats, \nMcMillan began organizing for a local peace march on the Strip which \nturned the tide in the struggle for integration. From this point on, \nMcMillan devoted his life to provide and expand opportunities for \nblacks. He began to register black voters and recruit black teachers \nfor local schools. At age 74 he was elected to the Clark County School \nBoard. Eventually a school in northwest Las Vegas, The James B. \nMcMillan Elementary School, was named in his honor.\n  Last year, McMillan published his autobiography, ``Fighting Back--A \nLife in the Struggle for Civil Rights.'' James B. McMillan's life truly \nwas a reflection of a valiant, idealistic, and nonviolent struggle for \nequality. His lifeworks have opened doors for many blacks in the United \nStates and will continue to be an inspiration for all who are engaged \nin the race for equality.\n  This U.S. Senator is a better person because of the efforts of Dr. \nMcMillan. Nevada is a better state because of Dr. McMillan's refusal to \naccept the status quo and his lifelong dedication in the struggle for \nequality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/26/senate-section/article/S4159-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4159-S4160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, last Wednesday, I came to the floor of \nthe Senate to thank my colleagues who offered their sympathies for the \nvictims and their families involved in the tragic shooting at Columbine \nHigh School in Littleton, Colorado. I also wanted the people in \nColorado to know that our hearts in the United States Senate were with \nall of the families through this terrible and tragic time.\n  Since then, the victims have been identified. Today, it is with deep \nsadness that I include for the Record the names of the innocent victims \nat Columbine High School.

Mr. President, I had tried numerous times without success \nduring the weekend to reach by telephone a remarkable young mother whom \nI had never met. I learned about her while reading a newspaper back \nhome in North Carolina that published on April 23 what is most often \nreferred to these days as an ``op-ed'' piece headed, ``Parents \nAbdicate; Faith Is Abandoned''.\n  (An op-ed piece, of course, is the short-form identification of an \narticle published on the page opposite a newspaper's editorial page.)\n  The op-ed piece which so impressed me was authored by Mrs. Ashley \nEthridge of Mebane, N.C., a former school teacher who decided to spend \nher time raising her two little girls. (She and her husband are \nexpecting a third child later this year).\n  I mentioned at the outset my having tried for much of the weekend to \nreach Mrs. Ethridge by telephone. Sunday afternoon those efforts were \nsuccessful--and I must say, Mr. President, that my conversation with \nMrs. Ethridge could not have been more meaningful.\n  Senators who read her ``op-ed'' piece will agree, I think, that this \nlady is a gifted writer. She is a graduate of N.C. State University and \nshe has completed graduate work. She is excitingly profound in her \nanalysis of what ails America in our time.\n  I must confess that I myself have long been alarmed by America's \ndrift away from the moral and spiritual principles and priorities upon \nwhich our nation was founded more than two centuries ago. Many of my \ngeneration often lament the trend. But Mrs. Ethridge has diagnosed the \nmoral malady better than I, and she offers the prescription to turn the \nnation's direction around more precisely, more specifically than I ever \nhave.\n  Mr. President, I don't often do this but in the case of my remarks \ntoday, and Mrs. Ethridge's clarity and counsel, I shall urge my fellow \nSenators to read what this young mother in Mebane, North Carolina, \nfeels that all of us ought to consider.\n  So I am glad that I tried, one more time, Sunday afternoon to reach \nMrs. Ethridge. It was a blessing to hear her voice and to sense her \nunderstanding of the course America simply must take --now.\n  So, Mr. President, I say to Ashley Ethridge: God bless you for the \nclarity of your wake-up call to the most fortunate people on earth--we \ncitizens of the United States of America. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of Ashley Ethridge's observations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Parents Abdicate; Faith is Abandoned\n\n                          (By Ashley Ethridge)\n\n       Is it just me, or has the entire country gone completely \n     mad?\n       In recent editions of the newspaper I have learned that it \n     is good fun when sexually explicit and violent Marilyn Manson \n     shock-rock concerts attract swarms of young adolescent boys--\n     presumably sans parents--cheering Satan; that magazines for \n     teenage girls are emblazoned with headlines such as ``How To \n     Totally Turn Him On''; and that parents are paying $800 a \n     month to put infants in institutionalized day care while the \n     mommies and daddies keep tabs on baby's milestones via \n     surveillance camera. People frown upon giving a 3-year-old a \n     doughnut, but don't even flinch at giving birth control pills \n     to a young teen suspected of having sex.\n       Nickelodeon (remember, the network just for kids--no adults \n     allowed?) is now changing the entire slant of its programming \n     because its executives have discovered that children now, \n     more than anything else, wish for time with their parents.\n       In the wake of the Littleton, Colo., massacre, Wake \n     County's school superintendent, Jim Surratt, asked what kind \n     of sick society would produce people who would want to do \n     that kind of thing. I find the answers to Surratt's question \n     in my newspaper almost every morning.\n       In his response to the tragedy, President Clinton said that \n     perhaps now America will wake up to the dimensions of the \n     challenge of juvenile violence. I can only assume that he is \n     implying a need for more programs, courtesy of the government \n     and thus the taxpayers. More counseling, more day care, more \n     before-school care, more after-school care, more gun control \n     and of course more counselors and mediators in the schools.\n       I too hope America will wake up--wake up to the fact that \n     children need more parental love and guidance.\n       The parents who blame the media and other outside \n     influences for teen violence should be diligent in shielding \n     their children from the offending sources. Where are these \n     parents when their under-17-year-olds are filling the \n     theaters of the many R-rated teen flicks now playing? Where \n     are these parents when their children are wading through the \n     murky waters of the Internet? Where are these parents when \n     their children are buying music bearing Parental Advisory \n     warning labels? Where are these parents when their \n     children are watching questionable--at best--prime time \n     television shows?\n       How can parents remove themselves almost completely from \n     their children's lives and then blame ``Dawson's Creek'' when \n     their daughters become pregnant or Leo DiCaprio when their \n     sons become violent?\n       Clinton also says that the nation must search for answers. \n     This is absurd, and yet is also precisely the problem. The \n     answer is obvious for anyone who will see it. Unfortunately, \n     we are so ensconced in our spiritually empty, materialistic, \n     self-centered lives that we do not seem to care that we are \n     sacrificing our children. We applaud Clinton's initiative to \n     fund more studies so that experts can search for answers \n     because it lifts the burden from our pathetic shoulders.\n       Why is it that so few people seem to believe that parents \n     have a responsibility to raise their own children, to spend \n     time with them, to help them, teach them and nurture them \n     toward a happy, productive adulthood? Parenting has now \n     simply become a process of buying children anything they \n     want, including guardians and homework-helpers, for as long \n     as they want--often well into what should be adulthood.\n       Stop searching the psychology journals and parenting \n     magazines and federally funded studies for answers. Search \n     your hearts and make your children, your families, your first \n     priority.\n       Clinton says that more must be done to help children deal \n     with anger. This sounds like hiring more school counselors. \n     Why not look to the cause of so much anger among our young \n     people? Could it possibly have something to do with the fact \n     that they know that their parents really don't want to be \n     bothered with the task of raising them?\n       Frankly, I don't think the schools are equipped to handle \n     situations such as these, lamentable as they are, nor do I \n     think they ought to. And I think some parents are just \n     looking at school as a place to stick their kids to get them \n     out of their hair.\n       Over 400 years ago, Martin Luther warned that if God were \n     removed from education, schools would prove to be the gates \n     of hell. What happens when we remove God from our families \n     and homes, forsaking our children as well? What happens when \n     we remove Him from society as a whole, and worship instead \n     the Almighty Dollar?\n       Is it hot in here, or is it just me?\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 96, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 96, a bill to \n     regulate commerce between and among the several States by \n     providing for the orderly resolution of disputes arising out \n     of computer-based problems related to processing data that \n     includes a 2-digit expression of the year's date.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I yield myself so much time as may be \npermitted under the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Pending the discussion with respect to the Y2K problem, let me say at \nthe outset that if there were a Y2K problem, we on this side of the \nopposition, let's say, to the particular bill and the amendment \nforthcoming with respect\n\n[[Page S4161]]\n\nto Senator McCain and Senator Wyden, anything within reason obviously \ncould have been worked out; namely, anyone who has a computer knows \nglitches. So no one can deny there cannot be a glitch on January 1 of \nthe year 2000. However, there is not really a problem that would cause \nus to try to change tort law. That is what is in the offing here.\n  I have talked to the best of the best in the computer industry with \nthe idea that we could compromise and give the 90-day grace period.\n  People do not want to go to court when they find out their computer \nis not working. If there is one thing that takes time--the Securities \nand Exchange Commission and so-called tort reform--they are still in \ndiscovery, they are still in appeals, and they are still in court, \nwithout trying the case, some 2 years later, because they have yet to \ndetermine what was intended. The same would be the case here trying to \nreally venture into the State responsibility and jurisdiction with tort \nwith so-called overall reform law.\n  So I thought, fine, let's get together on what could be called a \nglitch. Nobody wants to go to court. Give them some time to fix the \nglitch, and then move on in the business world. However, we have some \nfriends down at the National Chamber of Commerce who are really bent on \nactually trying to pass product liability and do away with trial by \njury and all the other State tort systems.\n  I could spot this in my particular position because I have been \nengaged in it for at least 20 years on the Commerce Committee from \nwhich it has been reported each time. We have prevailed over the 20 \nyears. The reason we have prevailed is that the professionals in this \nparticular field, whether it be the American Bar Association, the \nAssociation of State Legislatures, the Association of State Supreme \nCourt Judges, the Association of Governors, until it was changed in \neffect, all opposed, and we were able to withstand the onslaught of \nthis particular political move.\n  I can tell you, Madam President, we are going to withstand it again \non Y2K, unless they come around, of course. But I don't see a \ncompromise in the offing.\n\n  So I think immediately of what should be discussed; namely, \ntelevision violence. We started on that with hearings at the beginning \nof the 1990s. This is 1999. And this Senator introduced a TV violence \nbill. We reported it out at that time 19 to 1 from the Congress before \nthe last.\n  I remember going up to Senator Dole, then majority leader, who was \nrunning for President, and saying, ``Look, we have got this bill out. \nThe Attorney General has already attested to the fact that it would \nwithstand constitutional muster on the freedom of speech provisions, \nand I will step aside if you want to make it. I am just interested in \ngetting the bill, not the credit. So why don't you take the bill?''\n  The point is that the distinguished Senator had just come in from the \nwest coast, where he, if everyone will remember, had cussed out the \nmovie industry for its gratuitous violence in all of its film making. \nSo I thought it was a natural that he would want to follow through. He \ndidn't. In the last Congress we then had it reported out by a vote of \n20 to 0--TV violence.\n  This has nothing to do, of course, with the Nintendo games or the \nother little games they play on these machines. But it does have to do \nwith the basic tendency towards violence without cost, without any \nharm, or injury, or feeling.\n  We understand, of course, when you document the civil rights, when \nyou document the matter of the Civil War, or any of these other things, \nyou have to show the violence associated therewith in order to make an \nhonest depiction; that is going to be included. But we are talking \nabout gratuitous, excessive violence not incidental to the plot.\n  The bill has been found to stand, as I say, constitutional muster.\n  So we wanted to control that.\n  I have that bill in again. I would rather think that really bowing to \nthe Chamber of Commerce on particulars there with respect to State tort \nand State responsibilities--mind you me, my Republican friends in the \nleadership caterwaul that the best governed--or the less governed--that \nthe best governed is at the local level.\n  Why not let these local school boards control, rather than mandate \nfrom Washington this, that, or the next thing? Now they come with a \nmandate that the States have not asked for and the States would \ncertainly oppose.\n  I just talked to one of the great leaders in computerization who \nsaid, ``Senator, please don't pass this measure. The fact that \ncompanies don't get ready, they don't comply, is a competitive edge. My \ncustomers are checking them out. If they don't comply, I'm using that \nas a competitive advantage.''\n  Let the market forces operate I say to those who always caterwaul \nabout market forces and deregulation and wanting to regulate.\n  Back to the main point. We really ought to whip through a bill on \ntelevision violence and control that. We have quite a case to present \nto the Congress itself. In the initial stage of broadcasting, \nprogrammers said in the booklets, ``Get a murder early on to hold the \naudience.'' They love violence, they love murders, so get in a murder \nscene. I can show you that word for word in the CBS program in the \nearlier stages of television.\n  We can also go to the Colorado case. About 4 years ago a solution was \nused that is working at this particular time. I went down to Columbia, \nSC, which is Richland County. The county sheriff, Leon Lott, said, \n``Senator, I want to show you a school that was the most violent we had \nin the county--more drugs and trouble. We put a uniformed officer in \nthe classroom.''\n  Let me attest to this. I am not talking about some uniformed officer \nout in the parking lot looking for theft of the automobiles. I am \ntalking about a law enforcement officer in contact with the students. \nThis officer has not only taught the course, but associated himself in \nthe afternoon with the athletic programs and in the evenings with the \ncivic programs. If I had to pick a law enforcement officer, I would \npick some all-American like our friend Bill Bradley--someone they look \nup to immediately, and put them in uniform.\n  It is not too much to teach respect and have him associated on the \ncampus. He walks, talks and teaches with the students, listens to the \nteachers and the principals. The students know who brings a weapon to \nthe school grounds. The students know who brings drugs on the school \nproperties. All they do is just nod their head, make a little motion. \nThat security officer gets the hint immediately and goes in way ahead \nof time--preventing violence, preventing drugs--and if need be, gets \nthem counseling or whatever.\n  Senator Gregg and I provided just this kind of provision in the \nState-Justice-Commerce bill for the cops on the beat to be used. That \nis what Sheriff Lott was using in the Richland County schools. It is \nworking in the other schools all over South Carolina.\n  My reaction at the time of the Columbine High School in Littleton, \nCO, was, Did they have an officer? I heard some reports which said yes. \nIf they did, that officer ought to be fired. Anybody that can offload \nthat much weaponry--that security officer doesn't know what is going \non. He is not even taking care of security.\n\n  The main thing is to become, as they have in this particular \napproach, a role model for the students themselves. You can't put \nsensitive devices in every school in America. And we are not going to \ndo that. Praying and counseling are well and good, but let's go ahead \nwith a tried and true provision and get some leadership now that we can \nsee, again, more than ever the need. We can be discussing those things \nrather than some political fix that you find in the polls.\n  What about the lawyers? Every pollster and consultant says kill all \nthe lawyers. That is popular. Reform, reform, reform; tort reform, get \nrid of the lawyers. Control their fees, control their verdicts, control \nthe seventh amendment and the right of trial by jury. That is the whole \nscenario. We who understand and appreciate it and have been in the \ntrenches now for 20 years are going to do our dead level best so that \nshall not go on.\n  I think this afternoon at 5:30 we can vote cloture. I needed the time \nbecause we were not given notice about this particular measure coming \nup, but we are going to have to do some more head counting. We will \nhave to prepare some amendments and debate the real issues facing the \nAmerican people--not those being taken care of by the Governors\n\n[[Page S4162]]\n\nand the States. All of the Senators running around trying to play \ncatchup ball with the Governors from the elections last November, all \nthose that got elected and preached ``education, education, \neducation.''\n  There is a primary responsibility of the Federal Government for \nnational defense. A primary responsibility of the State government is \neducation: 93 cents out of every education dollar is at the State or \nlocal level. We only have 6 or 7 cents that we can toy with. We cannot \nhave all of that influence. We can come across with some good ideas in \none particular State and try to make it possible on a pilot basis for \nother States and take the leadership that we gain locally and spread \nit. We support the Department of Education on that basis.\n  It is so ludicrous that those who came from the 1994 elections \nwanting to abolish the Department of Education are now running around \nthrowing money at the Department of Education. It is all politics.\n  If we can stop using the government to get ourselves reelected with \nthese silly consultants and what shows up in the poll, but what shows \nup on the front page. We know the need nationally to pay our bills. We \nhad a debate about that--it was totally disregarded--all last week: \n``Save Social Security 100 percent.'' That was the majority leader's \namendment.\n  Madam President, I turned on the TV and he said the $6 billion for \nKosovo was not enough; we will have to add another $6 billion. When \nasked where they will get the money, he said, ``From Social Security.''\n  That is not the only surplus. That is the only way to hide it. But \nyou can get $12 billion surplus from the civil service retirement fund, \nwhich they have been doing, and from the military retirement fund, \nwhich they have been using, but the mindset is immediately to go and \nspend Social Security to savage the fund. There again was another \npolitical charade. Today we are engaged in another political charade.\n\n  At this particular time, with respect to the motion to proceed, I do \nnot see much interest in actually debating. When the proponents come to \nthe floor, I would like an opportunity to make a few points relative to \nthe demerits of this particular measure, why it should not be enacted, \nand get their response. Thereby, Madam President, I reserve the \nremainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the time for \nthe call of the quorum here be allocated equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I will be offering, with my friend and \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, a substitute amendment to S. 96, \nthe Y2K Act, at the appropriate time. The substitute amendment we will \nbe offering is a bipartisan effort. We worked diligently with our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to address concerns, narrow some \nprovisions, and assure this bill will sunset when it is no longer \npertinent and necessary.\n  Senator Wyden, who said at our committee markup that he wanted to get \nto ``yes,'' worked tirelessly with me to get there. He and others--but \nhe especially--have offered excellent suggestions and comments. I think \nthe substitute we bring today is a better piece of legislation for his \nefforts.\n  Specifically, the substitute would provide time for plaintiffs and \ndefendants to resolve Y2K problems without litigation. It reiterates \nthe plaintiff's duty to mitigate damages and highlights the defendant's \nopportunity to assist plaintiffs in doing that by providing information \nand resources.\n  That provides for proportional liability in most cases, with \nexceptions for fraudulent or intentional conduct, or where the \nplaintiff has limited assets. It protects governmental entities, \nincluding municipalities, schools, fire, water, and sanitation \ndistricts, from punitive damages. It eliminates punitive damage limits \nfor egregious conduct, while providing some protection against runaway \npunitive damage awards. And it provides protection for those not \ndirectly involved in a Y2K failure.\n  The bill, as amended, does not cover personal injury and wrongful \ndeath cases. It is important to keep in mind the broad support that \nthis bill has from virtually every segment of our economy. This bill is \nimportant not only to the high-tech industry, or only to big business, \nbut it carries the strong support of small businesses, retailers, and \nwholesalers.\n  Many of those supporting the bill will find themselves as both \nplaintiffs and defendants. They have weighed the benefits and drawbacks \nof the provisions of this bill and have overwhelmingly concluded that \ntheir chief priority is to prevent and fix Y2K problems and make our \ntechnology work, not divert the resources into time-consuming and \ncostly litigation.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of the looming Y2K problem is the \nnew industry being created by opportunistic lawyers. Many companies \nfeel they are ``damned if they do, dammed if they don't'' when it comes \nto acknowledging potential Y2K failures. If they do not say anything \nand later have a problem, they will certainly be sued. But if they say \nsomething now, they may still be sued, and before anything even has \ngone wrong. Over 80 lawsuits, mostly class actions, have already been \nfiled and we are still many months away from the year 2000.\n  The SEC reported in February that many companies are not complying \nwith the SEC disclosure requirements either as to what actions they are \ntaking to prepare, how much the effort is costing, or what contingency \nplans are being put into place. The Senate Special Committee on the \nYear 2000 Problem reported February 24--and I quote--``Fear of \nlitigation and loss of competitive advantage are the most commonly \ncited reasons for barebones disclosure.''\n  It is my hope that S. 96 will be the catalyst for technology \nproducers to work with technology users to ensure a seamless transition \nfrom the 1990s to the year 2000. The goal is to make January 1 a \nnonevent.\n  The purposes of this legislation is to ensure that we solve the Y2K \ntechnology glitch rather than clog our courts with years of costly \nlitigation. The purpose is to ensure a continued, stable economy, which \nobviously is beneficial to everyone in our country.\n  The bill encourages efficient resolution of failures by requiring \nplaintiffs to afford their potential defendants an opportunity to \nremedy the failure and make things right before facing a lawsuit. We \nshould encourage people to talk to each other, to try to address and \nremedy problems in a timely and professional manner.\n  The potential for litigation to overwhelm the Nation's judicial \nsystem is very real. We must reserve the judicial system for the most \negregious cases involving Y2K problems. Litigation costs have been \nestimated as high as $1 trillion. Certainly the burden of paying for \nlitigation will be distributed to the public in the form of increased \ncosts for technological goods and services.\n\n  The potential drain on the Nation's economy, and the world's economy, \nfrom both fixing the computer systems and responding to litigation, is \nstaggering. While the estimates being circulated are speculative, the \ncost of making the corrections in all the computer systems in the \ncountry is astronomical. Chase Manhattan Bank has been quoted as \nspending $250 million to fix problems with its 200 million lines of \naffected computer code. The estimated cost of fixing the problem in the \nUnited States ranges from $200 billion to $1 trillion. The resources \nwhich would be directed to litigation are resources that would not be \navailable for continued improvements in technology, producing new \nproducts, and maintaining the economy that supports the position of the \nUnited States as a world leader.\n\n[[Page S4163]]\n\n  As I said last week, time is of the essence. If this bill is going to \nhave the intended effect of encouraging proactive prevention and \nremediation of Y2K problems, it has to be passed quickly. This bill \nwill have limited value if it is passed later this fall.\n  Senator Hollings, my friend, has expressed in committee his concerns. \nI want to state up front that while we disagree, we have never been \ndisagreeable. I respect his views; we just disagree on this matter. And \nI know, as I said earlier, we will have a lively debate on this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give careful \nconsideration to the substitute amendment and join with me, Senator \nWyden, and our other cosponsors, Senators Gorton, Abraham, Lott, Frist, \nBurns, Smith of Oregon, and Santorum, in bringing this substitute to \nfruition. It makes sense, it is practical, and we need it now.\n  There are several letters, Madam President, from various \norganizations throughout the country that I would like to quote from. I \nask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the first letter I would like to quote \nbriefly from is from the National Federation of Independent Business, \nthe Voice of Small Business.\n\n       On behalf of the 600,000 members of the National Federation \n     of Independent Business (NFIB), I would like to thank you for \n     helping the nation's small business community prepare for the \n     millennium.\n       NFIB strongly supports S. 96 . . . specifically the \n     provisions that limit punitive damages and urge quick \n     resolution of legal disputes. We believe that S. 96 creates a \n     fair and level playing field for the settlement of year 2000 \n     (Y2K) disputes.\n       Because small business owners operate on such a slim profit \n     margin, every second and every dollar counts. Therefore, \n     legislation addressing Y2K litigation must provide a speedy \n     and effective solution to disputes. Small businesses do not \n     have the luxury of waiting months or years for courts to \n     replace lost revenues or failed products. S. 96 encourages \n     the use of alternate dispute resolution (ADR) and provides a \n     ``cooling off\" period during which disputes can be resolved \n     outside of court. NFIB's goal is to keep small businesses out \n     of court, and we believe S. 96 will do that in most cases.\n       We do realize that some businesses will--and should--\n     resolve their disputes in court. Regardless of whether they \n     would be plaintiffs or defendants, 93% of NFIB members \n     support limiting punitive damages. Caps help eliminate \n     frivolous lawsuits and the unnecessary expenditure of legal \n     fees by small businesses.\n\n  That is from the National Federation of Independent Business.\n  There are those who have argued in the media that this legislation is \nsimply there to support the ``high-tech community'' and large \ncorporations. I don't think that would make it possible for the NFIB, \nwhich represents 600,000 members, to support this legislation.\n  Next I would like to briefly quote from the American Insurance \nAssociation, which represents nearly 300 property casualty/insurers \nwith millions of policyholders and thousands of employees across the \nNation. Member companies insure families, small businesses and large \nbusinesses in every State.\n\n       Even with this commitment and dedication to minimizing Y2K \n     disruption, we can expect problems to occur. And \n     unfortunately in our litigious society, lawsuits or the fear \n     of lawsuits will inhibit solutions and multiply the \n     disruptive impact of system failures.\n       [Again,] on behalf of the member companies of the American \n     Insurance Association, I urge you to support the year 2000 \n     reforms on final passage and cloture.\n\n  The Intel Corporation, Tosco, the leading technology corporations, \nmany of the leading technology industry companies in America, including \nthe CEO of American Electronics Association, President and CEO of \nAlexander Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide, CEO of Marimba, Managing \nDirector of Merrill Lynch, chairman and CEO of Novell, Chairman and CEO \nof FileNet, and the list goes on of leading presidents and CEOs of the \nhigh-tech industries in America, MicroAge, Alcatel, and the \nInternational Mass Retail Association--all these organizations and more \nsupport this legislation. I don't think they necessarily do so for \nselfish reasons, although certainly they are motivated to a large \ndegree by their ability to provide the necessary profits to their \nshareholders.\n\n  But I think also they are more committed to making sure that this \nincredible economy that we are experiencing would continue to provide \nso many jobs and opportunities for so many Americans, without draining \nhundreds of billions of dollars from the economy.\n  My friend, Senator Hollings, has asserted that S. 96 is the camel's \nnose under the tent for product liability and tort reform. I clearly do \nnot believe that is the case. I am a strong supporter of product \nliability tort reform, but I believe that this legislation clearly is \nnot the case. It contains a sunset provision to assure that this is \nconsidered, as it should be, a temporary measure to deal with a unique \nsituation.\n  The sunset language in section 4(a) of the bill provides that the act \napplies to a Y2K failure occurring before January 1 of the year 2003, \nhardly a victory for widespread tort or product liability reform. The \npotential for massive litigation involving virtually every industrial \nsegment of our country, both small businesses and large, compels a \nrational and practical solution to prevent litigation from destroying \nthe economic well-being of the country.\n  There is a need for this bill, Madam President. I will just point out \none example of opportunistic legislation. I am told that Mr. Tom \nJohnson, acting as a private attorney general under California consumer \nprotection laws, has brought an action against a group of retailers, \nincluding Circuit City, Office Depot, Office Max, CompUSA, Staples, \nFryes, and the Good Guys, Incorporated for failing to warn consumers \nabout products that are not Y2K compliant. He has not alleged any \ninjury or economic damage to himself, but pursuant to State statute, \nhas requested relief in the amount of all of the defendants' profits \nfrom 1995 to date from selling these products and restitution to ``all \nmembers of the California general public.''\n  Although he claims that numerous products are involved, he has not \nspecified which products are covered by his allegations, but has \ngenerally named products by Toshiba, IBM, Compaq, Intuit, Hewlett \nPackard and Microsoft.\n  This is precisely, Madam President, the type of frivolous and \nopportunistic lawsuit which would be avoided by S. 96. Rather than have \nall of these named companies wasting time and resources preparing a \ndefense for this case, S. 96 would direct the focus to fixing real \nproblems. In this instance, it does not appear that Mr. Johnson has an \nactual problem. But if he does, he would need to articulate what is not \nworking due to a Y2K failure. The company or companies responsible \nwould then have an opportunity to address and fix the specific problem. \nIf the problem isn't fixed, then Mr. Johnson would be free to bring his \nsuit.\n  It is crystal clear that the real reason for this lawsuit is not to \nfix a problem that Mr. Johnson has with any of his computer hardware or \nsoftware, but to see whether he can convince the companies involved \nthat it is cheaper to buy him off in a settlement than to litigate, \neven if the case is eventually dismissed or decided in their favor. \nThis case is the tip of the iceberg.\n  If thousands of similar suits are brought after January 1, the \njudicial system will be overrun and the Nation's economy will be thrown \ninto turmoil. This is a senseless and needless abuse that we can avoid \nby passing S. 96.\n  Madam President, there are numerous provisions in this bill, but I \njust want to repeat one of the most crucial aspects of this \nlegislation. If a problem is identified, then whoever it is that is the \nmanufacturer has 90 days in order to fix the problem. If they do not \nfix the problem, then go to court. But it is hard for me to understand \nwhy a company or corporation who manufactured this particular product \nshould not be allowed to have an opportunity to fix the problem for the \nuser. It makes perfect sense--how could anyone object to such a thing--\nbecause these companies and corporations, if they are not committed to \nfix the problem, then they should be sued. That is what our court \nsystem is all about. But it makes perfect sense to me to give them an \nopportunity to fix a problem that they may not have knowledge of before \nthey find themselves all day hauled into court.\n\n[[Page S4164]]\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Senate Commerce Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman McCain: On behalf of the 600,000 members \n     of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I \n     would like to thank you for your leadership in helping the \n     nation's small business community prepare for the millennium.\n       NFIB strongly supports S. 96, the McCain-Wyden ``Y2K Act,'' \n     specifically the provisions that limit punitive damages and \n     urge quick resolution of legal disputes. We believe that S. \n     96 creates a fair and level playing field for the settlement \n     of Year 2000 (Y2K) disputes.\n       Every day, more small businesses prepare themselves for \n     potential Y2K problems within their own operations. No amount \n     of preparation, however, can keep them from being affected by \n     problems afflicting others: their suppliers, customers or \n     financial institutions. For this reason, businesses of all \n     sizes and types must be encouraged to address their Y2K \n     problems now. S. 96 encourages mitigation now to avoid \n     litigation later.\n       Because small business owners operate on such a slim profit \n     margin, every second and every dollar counts. Therefore, \n     legislation addressing Y2K litigation must provide a speedy \n     and effective solution to disputes. Small businesses do not \n     have the luxury of waiting months or years for courts to \n     replace lost revenue or failed products. S. 96 encourages the \n     use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and provides a \n     ``cooling off'' period during which disputes can be resolved \n     outside of court.

I appreciate your consideration of the concerns \n     of the small business community on this issue and look \n     forward to working with you in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Insurance Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The American Insurance Association \n     represents nearly 300 property/casualty insurers, with \n     millions of policyholders and thousands of employees across \n     the nation. Our member companies insure families, small \n     businesses, and large businesses in every state. A key issue \n     of concern to AIA members and their employees is providing a \n     predictable and fair framework within which the courts will \n     consider Year 2000 disputes. On behalf of our member \n     companies and their employees, I urge you to support both the \n     cloture vote and final passage of the pending Year 2000 \n     reforms (the revised S. 96, the Y2K Act).\n       American Insurance Association members are leaders in \n     advocating loss prevention measures for our individual and \n     business policyholders, and we're proud to say that AIA \n     companies have worked diligently, some for as long as a \n     decade, to ensure our systems are Y2K compliant. Across the \n     nation, American businesses are preparing for the Year 2000 \n     in the same way.\n       Even with this commitment and dedication to minimizing Y2K \n     disruption, we can expect problems to occur. And \n     unfortunately in our litigious society, lawsuits, or the fear \n     of lawsuits, can inhibit solutions and multiply the \n     disruptive impact of systems failures.\n       The American Insurance Association supports Congress' \n     efforts to minimize the economic costs arising from this \n     once-in-a-millennium event. The bipartisan bill under \n     consideration, the revised S. 96 provides a balanced, \n     measured, and modest response to the uncertainty posed by the \n     Year 2000. Our members strongly support this legislation.\n       Our priority is legislation that encourages a legal \n     environment where problem-solvers compete for business, not \n     fear frivolous lawsuits, legitimate claims are resolved \n     promptly, and where legal profiteering cannot take advantage \n     of a once-in-a-millennium problem. The bipartisan bills \n     accomplish these goals.\n       Again, on behalf of the member companies of the American \n     Insurance Association, I urge you to support the Year 2000 \n     reforms on final passage and cloture. With best wishes I \n     remain,\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Robert E. Vagley,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Intel Corporation,\n\n                                  Santa Clara, CA, April 19, 1999.\n     RE: Y2000 Legislation.\n\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I write to ask for your help in \n     enacting legislation designed to provide guidance to our \n     state and federal courts in managing litigation that may \n     arise out of the transition to Year 2000-compliant computer \n     hardware and software systems. This week, the Senate is \n     expected to vote upon a bipartisan substitute text for S. 96, \n     the ``Y2K Act'', which we strongly support.\n       Parties who are economically damaged by a Year 2000 failure \n     must have the ability to seek redress where traditional legal \n     principles would provide a remedy for such injury. At the \n     same time, it is vital that limited resources be devoted as \n     much as possible to fixing the problems, not litigating. Our \n     legal system must encourage parties to engage in cooperative \n     remediation efforts before taking complaints to the courts, \n     which could be overwhelmed by Year 2000 lawsuits.\n       The consensus text that has evolved from continuing \n     bipartisan discussions would substantially encourage \n     cooperative action and discourage frivolous lawsuits. \n     Included in its provisions are several key measures that are \n     essential to ensure fair treatment of all parties under the \n     law:\n       Procedural incentives--such as a requirement of notice and \n     an opportunity to cure defects before suit is filed, and \n     encouraged for engaging in alternative dispute resolution--\n     that will lead parties to identify solutions before pursuing \n     grievances in court;\n       A requirement that courts respect the provisions of \n     contracts--particularly important in preserving agreements of \n     the parties on such matters as warranty obligations and \n     definition of recoverable damages;\n       Threshold pleading provisions requiring particularity as to \n     the nature, amount, and factual basis for damages and \n     materiality of defects, that will help constrain class action \n     suits brought on behalf of parties that have suffered no \n     significant injury;\n       Appointment of liability according to fault, on principles \n     approved by the Senate in two previous measures enacted in \n     the area of securities reform.\n       This legislation--which will apply only to Y2K suits, and \n     only for a limited period of time--will allow plaintiffs with \n     real grievances to obtain relief under the law, while \n     protecting the judicial system from a flood of suits that \n     have no objective other than the obtainment of high-dollar \n     settlements for speculative or de minimus injuries. \n     Importantly, it does not apply to cases that arise out of \n     personal injury.\n       At Intel, we are devoting considerable resources to Y2K \n     remediation. Our efforts are focused not only on our internal \n     systems, but also those of our suppliers, both domestic and \n     foreign. Moreover, we have taken advantage of the important \n     protections for disclosure of product information that \n     Congress enacted last year to ensure that our customers are \n     fully informed as to issues that may be present with legacy \n     products. What is true for Intel is true for all companies: \n     time and resources must be devoted as much as possible to \n     fixing the Year 2000 problem and not pointing fingers of \n     blame.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to vote in favor of \n     responsible legislation that will protect legitimately \n     aggrieved parties while providing a stable, uniform legal \n     playing field within which these matters can be handled by \n     state and federal courts with fairness and eficiency.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Craig R. Barrett,\n     CEO, Intel Corporation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                        Tosco,\n\n                                     Stamford, CT, April 14, 1999.\n     Re: Y2K Act (S. 96)--SUPPORT.\n\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of Tosco Corporation \n     (``Tosco''), I commend you for sponsoring the Y2K Act (S. \n     96), which will facilitate computer preparations for the \n     transition to the Year 2000. Tosco is one of nation's largest \n     independent refiners and marketers of gasoline and petroleum \n     products. We market gasoline in Arizona through more than 700 \n     retail outlets in the state under our Circle K, Union 76, and \n     Exxon brands. Our marketing headquarters is located at Tempe, \n     Arizona, and we have 6,500 employees in the state.\n       Your Y2K Act will focus resources on the actual solution of \n     Y2K problems and will reduce the risk of costly and \n     unnecessary litigation. The opportunity for pre-litigation \n     resolution will benefit both potential plaintiffs and \n     potential defendants. The protection against liability for \n     harm caused by other parties and the limits on punitive \n     damages will reduce the incentive for widespread speculative \n     lawsuits targeted on large companies such as Tosco.\n       We also urge you to oppose the alternative Y2K bills which \n     do not provide for proportionate liability and do not limit \n     punitive damages. These bills will not protect against \n     ``bounty hunting'' lawsuits which could aggravate Y2K \n     transition problems by hamstringing the business community \n     with complicated litigation and potentially unlimited \n     exposure.\n       Tosco is undertaking a comprehensive effort to have its \n     computer systems ready for the transition to the Year 2000, \n     and we are working closely with our customers and vendors. \n     While we expect a smooth transition, we believe S. 96 will \n     provide a useful framework for resolving any problems which \n     may arise.\n       All members of the business community share the \n     responsibility to be prepared for the computer transition to \n     the Year 2000.\n\n[[Page S4165]]\n\n     Your well-conceived Y2K Act will help protect companies which \n     prepare for the transition in a timely manner while retaining \n     appropriate legal remedies in the event other companies do \n     not meet their responsibilities.\n       Tosco strongly supports S. 96. We also oppose the \n     alternative Y2K legislation which does not place reasonable \n     limits on litigation exposure. Please call me if you would \n     like any further information.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                            Ann Farner Miller,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Technology Network,\n\n                                                    March 5, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: We are writing on behalf of some of \n     the nation's leading technology industry companies to voice \n     support for the ``Y2K Act'' (S. 96 as amended), and to thank \n     you for introducing this bipartisan legislation to address \n     the important issue of Year 2000 readiness.\n       Technology companies are working aggressively to achieve \n     Y2K readiness as soon as possible. In close partnership with \n     their suppliers and customers, our companies are working to \n     identify potential problems, fix systems and conduct tests to \n     ensure that they are ready for Y2K. The technology industries \n     have committed extraordinary resources to ensure a smooth \n     transition to the Year 2000. Unfortunately, industry efforts \n     to address Y2K readiness are threatened by concern about \n     potential litigation.\n       Lawsuits designed to exploit the Year 2000 issue will turn \n     industry attention and resources away from the critical task \n     of ensuring that computer systems are Y2K compliant. We fully \n     support comprehensive legislation to ensure that companies \n     that act in good faith to solve Y2K disruptions are protected \n     from opportunistic litigation that slows the important work \n     of remediation. Legislation is essential to ensure that \n     companies concentrate their full attention and resources on \n     Year 2000 readiness, and not on wasteful or abusive lawsuits.\n       The technology industry appreciates your leadership in \n     championing a solution to this critical national issue. This \n     legislation is an essential part of a comprehensive solution \n     to the Y2K challenge and builds upon the ``Good Samaritan'' \n     bill that Congress enacted last year.\n       Immediate action is necessary to protect our nation's \n     economic vitality and security. We must address this pressing \n     issue as early as possible in 1999. It is clearly in the \n     interest of all Americans that we spend resources on \n     remediation, and not on litigation. We commend you for your \n     leadership and attention to this important issue and urge the \n     Congress to enact Y2K legislation as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Chambers, President & CEO, Cisco Systems; Les \n           Vadasz, Senior Vice President, Intel; Pam Alexander, \n           President & CEO, Alexander Ogilvy Public Relations \n           Worldwide; William Archey, CEO, American Electronics \n           Association; Kathy Behrens, President, NVCA; Brook \n           Byers, Partner, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers; Steve \n           Case, Chairman & CEO, America OnLine; Wilfred Corrigan, \n           CEO & Chairman, LSI Logic; William Davidow, Partner, \n           Mohr Davidow Ventures; Bob Herbold, Executive Vice \n           President & COO, Microsoft Corporation; George Klaus, \n           CEO, Platinum Software; Kim Polese, CEO, Marimba, Inc.; \n           Colleen Poulliot, Senior VP, General Counsel & \n           Secretary, Adobe Systems; Willem Roelandts, President & \n           CEO, Xilinx; Michael Rowan, CEO, Kestrel Solutions; \n           Scott Ryles, Managing Director, Merrill Lynch; Eric \n           Schmidt, Chairman & CEO, Novell; Ted Smith, Chairman & \n           CEO, FileNet.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                International Mass\n\n\n                                           Retail Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the International Mass \n     Retail Association (IMRA), I would like to thank you for \n     sponsoring the Y2K Act (S. 96). This legislation is crucial \n     to preventing frivolous Y2K lawsuits from imposing needless \n     costs on businesses and congesting the court system.\n       Companies should focus their time and effort on assuring \n     that their computer systems, and those of their suppliers, \n     will be Y2K-compliant--not in preparing for lawsuits, that \n     could harm a prospering U.S. economy and even cost some \n     workers their jobs. Without adequate safeguards against \n     frivolous lawsuits, American consumers may suffer more from \n     Y2K lawsuits than from Y2K failures.\n       IMRA supports the Y2K Act (S. 96). S. 96 gives companies an \n     incentive to work to prevent Y2K failures. The bill provides \n     a chance to fix potential Y2K problems before lawsuits are \n     filed. With an orderly process like this, which favors \n     remediation over litigation, courts may soon become \n     backlogged with Y2K lawsuits that could, and should, be \n     resolved through faster, more cooperative methods.\n       The International Mass Retail Association represents the \n     mass retail industry--consumers' first choice for price, \n     value and convenience. Its membership includes the fastest \n     growing retailers in the world--discount department stores, \n     home centers, category dominant specialty discounters, \n     catalogue showrooms, dollar stores, warehouse clubs, deep \n     discount drugstores and off-price stores--and the \n     manufacturers who supply them. IMRA retail members operate \n     more than 106,000 American stores and employ millions of \n     workers.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The purpose of this letter is to \n     express my personal appreciation and support for the \n     legislation you recently introduced in the United States \n     Senate to limit runaway liability awards in the event of Y2K \n     problems.\n       As a major telecommunications equipment company and an \n     employer of over 11,000 people in the United States, Alcatel \n     USA has a vested interest in this important issue. We have \n     spent tens of millions of dollars on Y2K remediation and are \n     making a continuing, company-wide effort to protect our \n     valued customers from Y2K-related failures. We wholeheartedly \n     endorse your emphasis on ``remediation not litigation'' and \n     have put our money, technical expertise and manpower behind \n     this concept.\n       I realize that aspects of your legislation are \n     controversial and that some compromises may be necessary in \n     the weeks ahead. During the negotiating process I would ask \n     you to keep in mind what Alcatel considers to be the minimum \n     essential elements of any legislation limiting the liability \n     of responsible corporations.\n       They are:\n       Preeminence of existing contracts and agreements\n       Pretrial notice and cure periods\n       Proportional liability instead of joint and several \n     liability\n       Damages limited to direct or consequential\n       If there is anything that Alcatel USA can do in support of \n     your legislation, please feel free to contact me or David \n     Owen, the head of our Washington Government Relations Office \n     (703-724-2930). Our Washington office has instructions to \n     work closely with the National Association of Manufacturers, \n     the Telecommunications Industry Association, and the US \n     Chamber of Commerce in order to guarantee that our advocacy \n     activities for Y2K liability limitations are focused and well \n     coordinated.\n       In closing, I would like to thank you once again for \n     spearheading this important legislative initiative to protect \n     our vibrant economy from a ``feeding frenzy'' of destructive \n     and ultimately unproductive litigation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     Krish Prabhu,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                      MicroAge\n\n                                          Tempe, AZ March 3, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate,\n     Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation, Washington \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I support passage of Y2K Act, S. 96. I \n     also represent the Computing Technology Industry Association \n     (CompTIA) with 7800 company members representing IT Industry \n     manufacturers, distributors and resellers. CompTIA support \n     passage of Y2K Act, S. 96.\n       Small and large businesses are eager to solve the Y2K \n     problem, yet many are not doing so, primarily because of the \n     fear of liability and lawsuits. The potential for excessive \n     litigation and the negative impact on targeted industries are \n     already diverting precious resources that could otherwise be \n     used to help fix the Y2K problem.\n       As I understand the bill, the purpose of this proposed \n     legislation is to encourage Y2K remediation, not litigation. \n     American industry already is making massive investments\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\n     to prepare for the millennium computer problem. A deluge of \n     lawsuits would inhibit these efforts--particularly in the \n     growth sector of the economy. This legislation creates \n     incentives to fix Y2K problems before they develop by \n     encouraging parties to resolve disputes without litigation, \n     but it also preserves the rights of those who suffer real \n     injuries to file suits if necessary.\n       The Business Community Coalition, of which CompTIA is an \n     active member, is also supporting Y2K reform, representing \n     all industry sectors and business sizes, is supporting Y2K \n     reform legislation designed to encourage a fair, fast and \n     predictable mechanism for resolving Y2K-related disputes.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                     Alan P. Hald,\n     Co-Founder, MicroAge, Inc.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         NPES,\n\n                                       Reston, VA, April 20, 1999.\n\n\n       OPEN LETTER TO THE SENATE IN SUPPORT OF S. 96--THE Y2K ACT\n\n       On behalf of the over 400 member companies of NPES the \n     Association for Suppliers of Printing, Publishing and \n     Converting Technologies I urge you to support S. 96, the Y2K \n     Act, when it comes to the Senate floor this week.\n       S. 96 is a remediation bill that will encourage businesses \n     to fix Y2K problems without undue concern for unlimited and \n     unwarranted liability that could arise from Y2K failures. S. \n     96 does not insulate negligent companies from being held \n     responsible for their actions, and it does not leave victims \n     of Y2K-related problems without recourse within the legal \n     system. S. 96 will discourage frivolous litigation, but it \n     will not preclude legitimate claims.\n       Most importantly, S. 96 encourages resolution of disputes \n     before the contentiousness and expense of litigation. If a \n     business suffers a Year 2000 failure, the most important next \n     step should be solving the problem and getting back to \n     business, not engaging in counterproductive lawsuits that \n     contribute little towards getting a company back serving its \n     customers.\n       NPES' members, as equipment manufacturers and sellers, \n     could well find themselves as both plaintiffs and defendants \n     in potential Y2K-related lawsuits. With this perspective, we \n     believe S. 96 strikes the proper balance encouraging \n     appropriate remedial action and protecting legitimate \n     interests of injured parties. Therefore, we urge you to \n     support S. 96 so that the American business community can \n     focus on addressing Y2K-related problems in the last months \n     of the year, rather than diverting resources to responding to \n     a potential calamity of counterproductive litigation \n     following New Year's Day 2000.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Regis J. Delmontague,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I note the presence of the Senator from \nWashington on the floor, and I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Is time controlled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled. Does the chairman wish \nto yield time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Washington \nsuch time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I support legislation designed to avert \nand control what could be a litigation bonanza stemming from the Y2K \nproblem. We can't be sure what computer-based system, if any, may go \nawry at midnight, December 31, 1999, but we should not sit by idly and \nwait to find out. The Y2K Act attempts proactively to provide \nincentives for everyone, potential plaintiffs and defendants alike, to \ncure Y2K compliance problems before they occur and to impose reasonable \nlimits on liability and rules for the prosecution of lawsuits arising \nfrom Y2K failures.\n  On today's editorial page, the New York Times criticizes Senator \nMcCain's Y2K legislation and opines that:\n\n       Congress can also clarify the liability of companies once \n     it becomes clear how widespread the problem really is. But \n     before the new year, the government should not use the \n     millennium bug to overturn longstanding liability practices. \n     I strongly disagree. We know that our current liability \n     system, longstanding as it may be, is flawed in that it \n     increasingly lends itself to lawsuits of limited merit, but \n     huge downside risks, excessive delays, and creative and often \n     unfair theories of liability. Just as it is irresponsible for \n     people not to take remedial action to avoid the Y2K problem, \n     it would be irresponsible for Congress not to fix our \n     litigation system with respect to its handling of this \n     specific issue, to deal with the flood of potential cases and \n     the enormous, possibly destructive, burden that litigation \n     can impose on potential defendants. Of particular concern to \n     me are the smaller high-technology companies that have been \n     thriving in Washington State and across the Nation. I have \n     met with and heard from numerous representatives from these \n     companies. To them, the threat of abusive litigation is not \n     speculative or illusory; it is real and potentially fatal.\n\n  Senator McCain's substitute to S. 96, of which I am a cosponsor, is \nan improvement in some respects to the bill that we passed out of the \nCommerce Committee, not in the least because this substitute enjoys \nbipartisan support. Notably, the substitute modifies the provisions in \nS. 96 on punitive damages and joint liability. While S. 96 established \nstrict caps on punitive damages, the substitute permits these caps to \nbe pierced if the plaintiff establishes by clear and convincing \nevidence that the defendant acted with specific intent to injure the \nplaintiff. The absolute prohibition on joint liability originally \ncontained in S. 96 has also been modified.\n  The substitute roughly tracks the exceptions to joint liability \nlimits contained in the 1995 securities litigation reform legislation. \nRather than to prohibit joint liability in all cases, the substitute \npermits joint liability, subject to State limits, in situations in \nwhich plaintiffs' assets are limited and damages exceed 10 percent of \nthose assets; in situations in which damages cannot be recovered \nagainst another defendant; and against defendants who acted with \nspecific intent to injure the plaintiff or who knowingly committed \nfraud.\n\n  Madam President, these changes have been made by Senator McCain in a \ngenuine effort to see to it that the broad appeal of this bill becomes \neven broader.\n  In addition to modifying the limitations on punitive damages and \njoint liability, the substitute, among other changes, strikes the \nprovision in S. 96 that created the defense for those using reasonable \nefforts to prevent Y2K problems; modifies the circumstances under which \nthe terms of a written contract will be enforced by recognizing State \nstatutes that limit enforcement of certain terms, and expands the \nexceptions to the economic loss rule.\n  Madam President, these are not simple legal concepts. While I think \nS. 96 has benefitted from more deliberative review by interested \nparties representing potential plaintiffs and defendants alike, I am \nstill not convinced that the substitute has achieved the precisely \ncorrect balance of promoting remedial action, effectively curtailing \nabusive lawsuits, and not simply changing the way in which plaintiffs \nplead their cases, and ensuring that plaintiffs have adequate recourse \nfor damages. I nevertheless wholeheartedly support Y2K liability \nlegislation because I believe it is our responsibility to prevent \nforeseeable litigation that could clog our State and Federal courts and \ndivert enormous resources away from production and toward litigation. \nThe Senate should pass Y2K liability legislation and should do so as \nsoon as possible. I expect that the bill can be further refined and \nimproved during floor debate and again in conference.\n  I want to add to my formal written remarks my admiration for the \ntremendous amount of effort that the chairman of the Commerce Committee \nhas put into attempting to see to it that we here end up with a bill \nthat becomes law, even though it requires a number of compromises, \nrather than simply to become another item of debate and division.\n  Tort reform, product liability legislation, and medical malpractice \nlegislation are all important national issues, but they are all \nextremely divisive. In this case, for this particular form of \nlitigation, which has no precedent in the United States, reform is \ngenuinely needed. The Senator from Arizona, the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, has brought us a long way along the right road, and \nI have every confidence that we will finish with success.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nhis kind remarks, but most importantly for his deep involvement in this \nissue. As a former attorney general of his State, he understands these \nissues better than I do, and his assistance in this effort is extremely \nvaluable and important.\n  Madam President, I don't have any speakers at this time. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, our chairman, talked about frivolous lawsuits and deep pockets \nand glitches. It strikes this Senator that what we have ongoing at the \nmoment are computer glitches. Every now and again, we all run into it--\non my computer and others' around. Certainly it is an industry that has \ndeep pockets, is worth billions of dollars, and some never have made a \nprofit. But the market is valuable, with investments in the billions of \ndollars. So with glitches and deep pockets, you would think, by the \ndescription about frivolous lawsuits, that there would be lawyers all \nrunning around with frivolous lawsuits, saying, ``they got deep \npockets,'' and there are glitches, and everybody would be suing \neverybody.\n  Of course, that just proves the contention of the need for this bill. \nYou go from the different styles. I was here when they went after the \noil money. I was here when the oil went after the milk money. Now, in \n2000, they are going after Silicon Valley and everybody is running out \nthere to get their money and their blessing, and they never had any \nlawyers before, or any representatives. Now they have them all marching \ninto Washington. But other than the politics, the business community is \ntaking care of it.\n  I refer, if the distinguished Presiding Officer pleases, to the March \n1 issue of Business Week. On page 30, it says:\n\n       Lloyd Davis is feeling squeezed. In 1998, his $2 million, \n     25-employee fertilizer-equipment business was buffeted by the \n     harsh winds that swept the farm community. This year, his \n     Golden Plains Agricultural Technologies, Inc. in Colby, \n     Kansas, is getting slammed by Y2K. Davis needs $71,000 to \n     make his computer systems bug-free by January 1. But he has \n     been able to rustle up only the $39,000. His bank has denied \n     him a loan because--ironically--he's not Y2K-ready. But Davis \n     knows he must make the fixes or lose business. ``Our big \n     customers aren't going to wait much longer,'' he frets.\n       Golden Plains and thousands of other small businesses are \n     getting a dire ultimatum from the big corporations they sell \n     to: Get ready for Y2K, or get lost. Multinationals such as \n     General Motors, McDonald's, Nike, and Deere are making the \n     first quarter--or the second at the latest--the deadline for \n     partners and vendors to prove they're bug-free. A recent \n     survey by consultants at Gemini America says 69 percent of \n     the 2,000 largest companies will stop doing business with \n     companies that can't pass muster. The National Federation of \n     Independent Business figures more than 1 million companies \n     with 100 workers or fewer won't make the cut, and as many \n     as half will lose big chunks of business or even fail.\n       I am glad the market is taking care of them so we will not \n     have to sue them. So the products we get will be sound.\n\n  Reading further:\n\n       Cutting thousands of companies out of the supply chain \n     might strain supply lines and could even crimp output. But \n     most CEOs figure it'll be cheaper in the long run to avoid \n     bugs in the first place.\n       But most CEOs figure it'll be cheaper in the long run to \n     avoid bugs in the first place.\n\n  Here they have 7\\1/2\\ months to get rid of the bugs. Here, with this \nparticular article, they had 10 months to get rid of all the bugs. The \ntechnology has been on course for over 30 years. Everyone has been \ntalking about it. We passed special legislation in the debate last year \nto set aside the antitrust provisions so they could work together. And, \nyet, some still are going to lag and not do business.\n  This is why one of the leading computerization experts in the world \njust an hour ago in my office said, ``Senator, don't pass this bill.'' \nHe said, ``I will use it for competition.'' Those who do not compete, \nwho won't comply, and who won't get Y2K ready, ought to fall by the \nwayside, as this article and my friend were pointing out.\n  I quote again from the article:\n\n       Some small outfits are already losing key customers. In the \n     past year, Prudential Insurance Co. has cut nine suppliers \n     from its ``critical'' list of more than 3,000 core vendors, \n     and it continues to look for weak links, says the Vice \n     President for Information Systems at the company. At Citibank \n     . . . cuts have already been made.\n\n  Reading again:\n\n       Big U.S. companies are not sugarcoating the problem.\n       . . . ``if a vendor is not up to speed by April or May,'' \n     Rabat says, ``it's serious crunch time.''\n\n  Here it is 6 months away. We are going to pass emergency legislation \nfor glitches and deep pockets. We have had glitches and deep pockets \nall during the 1990s, and there is no trillion dollars' worth of \nlawsuits and frivolous lawsuits.\n  That gets me to the point where I can tell you that the real lawyers \nwho bring any cases don't have any time to bring frivolous lawsuits. \nThey are not worth it. They can't get anything for it. And they don't \nget paid unless they win. And if they win, they have to prove to a 12-\nman jury and withstand all of the legal motions, delays, and everything \nelse. So the real attorneys just do not bring frivolous lawsuits.\n  Later, when we get into the full debate on the measure, I will have \nthe documents to prove that from the Rand Corporation.\n  Quoting further from the article:\n\n       Through the Automotive Industry Action Group, GM and other \n     car makers have set March 31 deadlines for vendors to become \n     Y2K compliant.\n\n  Madam President, that is just 5 days from now.\n\n       In March, members of the Grocery Manufacturers of America \n     will meet with their counterparts from the Food Marketing \n     Institute to launch similar efforts. Other companies are \n     sending a warning to laggards--and shifting business to the \n     tech-savvy. ``Y2K can be a great opportunity to clean up and \n     modernize the supply chain,'' says Roland S. Boreham, Jr., \n     chairman of the board of Baldor Electric Co. in Fort Smith, \n     ARK.\n\n  There is a statement. This particular so-called ``problem'' is \ncleaning out the inept, the inadequate, the incompetent, the \nuncompliant. But what they want to do is pass laws and change around \nall the States' tort systems for manufactured product downtown at the \nChamber of Commerce, and that you will find in the political polls, so \nwe can write out to Silicon Valley and say, ``Look what I have done for \nyou. I am looking out for you. Just contribute to my campaign.''\n  That is all this is--another political exercise this week.\n  Quoting further:\n\n       The World Bank has shelled out $72 million in loans and \n     grants to Y2K-stressed nations, including Argentina and Sri \n     Lanka. AT alone has spent $900 million fixing its systems.\n\n  It goes on and on in the article.\n  Madam President, the point here is, we are trying to solve a \npolitical problem, not a business problem. It is one to get the \ncontributions from Silicon Valley. It is one that has put up a straw \nman about a trillion dollars' worth of verdicts and all of that. That \nis outrageous nonsense. We haven't had over $12 billion in product \nliability cumulatively in this Nation since the incidents of product \nliability, but every week we see some automobile company recalling \n100,000. The week before last, it was a 1-million-car callback for \nretrofitting and everything else. Why? Because some good trial lawyer \nbrought some good case and on the safety basis has saved many, many \nfrom injury and death.\n  No. I take the position of the lawyers in reality who really try the \ncases. They have deep pockets, and they are all there now, and they are \nall prospering and making more money. They haven't come to Washington \nto say, ``Look, you know the changes that we have in computers.'' They \nchange every other year--now almost yearly. So there is another new \nmodel. So there is a glitch. But people do not run around suing \neverybody on some kind of glitch. It is a business contract in the \npurchase under the Uniform Commercial Code to be controlled, and only \nwhen there is a fraudulent breach do we get into law, and tort law, \nwhich is State tort law.\n  I don't think we are going to change under this stampede here about \nwhat a grand thing we have--bipartisanship. Oh, no. It is as partisan \nas it can be for those trying to get their money, be they Republican or \nDemocrat, out there in the Silicon Valley campaign.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum to be divided by unanimous consent \nbetween both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to \na close debate on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 34, S. 96, the \nY2K legislation:\n         Trent Lott, John McCain, Rick Santorum, Spencer Abraham, \n           Judd Gregg, Pat Roberts, Wayne Allard, Rod Grams, Jon \n           Kyl, Larry Craig, Bob Smith, Craig Thomas, Paul \n           Coverdell, Pete Domenici, Don Nickles, and Phil Gramm.\n\n\n                                  Vote\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate \nthat debate on the motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 96, the \nY2K Act, shall be brought to a close?

DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO FOSTER THE \n                   EMPLOYMENT AND INDEPENDENCE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH \n                   DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, revenue and spending \n     aggregates and other appropriate budgetary levels and limits \n     may be adjusted and allocations may be revised for \n     legislation that finances disability programs designed to \n     allow individuals with disabilities to become employed and \n     remain independent: Provided, That, to the extent that this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget does not include the \n     costs of that legislation, the enactment of that legislation \n     will not increase (by virtue of either contemporaneous or \n     previously-passed deficit reduction) the deficit in this \n     resolution for--\n       (1) fiscal year 2000;\n       (2) the period of fiscal years 2000 through 2004; or\n       (3) the period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009.\n       (b) Revised Allocations.--\n       (1) Adjustments for legislation.--Upon the consideration of \n     legislation pursuant to subsection (a), the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate may file with the \n     Senate appropriately-revised allocations under section 302(a) \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and revised \n     functional levels and aggregates to carry out this section. \n     These revised allocations, functional levels, and aggregates \n     shall be considered for the purposes of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 as allocations, functional levels, and \n     aggregates contained in this resolution.\n       (2) Adjustments for amendments.--If the chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate submits an adjustment \n     under this section for legislation in furtherance of the \n     purpose described in subsection (a), upon the offering of an \n     amendment to that legislation that would necessitate such \n     submission, the Chairman shall submit to the Senate \n     appropriately-revised allocations under section 302(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and revised functional \n     levels and aggregates to carry out this section. These \n     revised allocations, functional levels, and aggregates shall \n     be considered for the purposes of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 as allocations, functional levels, and aggregates \n     contained in this resolution.\n       (c) Reporting Revised Allocations.--The appropriate \n     committees shall report appropriately-revised allocations \n     pursuant to section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 to carry out this section.\n\n            TITLE III--SENSE OF THE CONGRESS AND THE SENATE\n\n     SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MARRIAGE PENALTY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) differences in income tax liabilities caused by marital \n     status are embodied in a number of tax code provisions \n     including separate rate schedules and standard deductions for \n     married couples and single individuals;\n       (2) according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 42 \n     percent of married couples incurred ``marriage penalties'' \n     under the tax code in 1996, averaging nearly $1,400;\n       (3) measured as a percent of income, marriage penalties are \n     largest for low-income families, as couples with incomes \n     below $20,000 who incurred a marriage penalty in 1996 were \n     forced to pay nearly 8 percent more of their income in taxes \n     than if they had been able to file individual returns;\n       (4) empirical evidence indicates that the marriage penalty \n     may affect work patterns, particularly for a couple's second \n     earner, because higher rates reduce after-tax wages and may \n     cause second earners to work fewer hours or not at all, \n     which, in turn, reduces economic efficiency; and\n       (5) the tax code should not improperly influence the choice \n     of couples with regard to marital status by having the \n     combined Federal income tax liability of a couple be higher \n     if they are married than if they are single.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that significantly \n     reducing or eliminating the marriage penalty should be a \n     component of any tax cut package reported by the Finance \n     Committee and passed by Congress during\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\n     the fiscal year 2000 budget reconciliation process.\n\n     SEC. 302. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON IMPROVING SECURITY FOR \n                   UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that there is an urgent and ongoing \n     requirement to improve security for United States diplomatic \n     missions and personnel abroad, which should be met without \n     compromising existing budgets for International Affairs \n     (function 150).\n\n     SEC. 303. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ACCESS TO MEDICARE HOME \n                   HEALTH SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) medicare home health services provide a vitally \n     important option enabling homebound individuals to stay in \n     their own homes and communities rather than go into \n     institutionalized care; and\n       (2) implementation of the Interim Payment System and other \n     changes to the medicare home health benefit have exacerbated \n     inequalities in payments for home health services between \n     regions, limiting access to these services in many areas and \n     penalizing efficient, low-cost providers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate the \n     levels in this resolution assume that the Senate should act \n     to ensure fair and equitable access to high quality home \n     health services.\n\n     SEC. 304. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF \n                   HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS OF THE SELF-EMPLOYED.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) under current law, the self-employed do not enjoy \n     parity with their corporate competitors with respect to the \n     tax deductibility of their health insurance premiums;\n       (2) this April, the self-employed will only be able to \n     deduct only 45 percent of their health insurance premiums for \n     the tax year 1998;\n       (3) the following April, the self-employed will be able to \n     take a 60-percent deduction for their health insurance \n     premiums for the tax year 1999;\n       (4) it will not be until 2004 that the self-employed will \n     be able to take a full 100-percent deduction for their health \n     insurance premiums for the tax year 2003;\n       (5) the self-employed's health insurance premiums are \n     generally over 30 percent higher than the health insurance \n     premiums of group health plans;\n       (6) the increased cost coupled with the less favorable tax \n     treatment makes health insurance less affordable for the \n     self-employed;\n       (7) these disadvantages are reflected in the higher rate of \n     uninsured among the self-employed which stands at 24.1 \n     percent compared with 18.2 percent for all wage and salaried \n     workers, for self-employed living at or below the poverty \n     level the rate of uninsured is 53.1 percent, for self-\n     employed living at 100 through 199 percent of poverty the \n     rate of uninsured is 47 percent, and for self-employed living \n     at 200 percent of poverty and above the rate of uninsured is \n     17.8 percent;\n       (8) for some self-employed, such as farmers who face \n     significant occupational safety hazards, this lack of health \n     insurance affordability has even greater ramifications; and\n       (9) this lack of full deductibility is also adversely \n     affecting the growing number of women who own small \n     businesses.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that tax relief \n     legislation should include parity between the self-employed \n     and corporations with respect to the tax treatment of health \n     insurance premiums.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT TAX REDUCTIONS SHOULD GO \n                   TO WORKING FAMILIES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that this concurrent \n     resolution on the budget assumes any reductions in taxes \n     should be structured to benefit working families by providing \n     family tax relief and incentives to stimulate savings, \n     investment, job creation, and economic growth.\n\n     SEC. 306. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE NATIONAL GUARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Army National Guard relies heavily upon thousands \n     of full-time employees, Military Technicians and Active \n     Guard/Reserves, to ensure unit readiness throughout the Army \n     National Guard;\n       (2) these employees perform vital day-to-day functions, \n     ranging from equipment maintenance to leadership and staff \n     roles, that allow the drill weekends and annual active duty \n     training of the traditional Guardsmen to be dedicated to \n     preparation for the National Guard's warfighting and \n     peacetime missions;\n       (3) when the ability to provide sufficient Active Guard/\n     Reserves and Technicians end strength is reduced, unit \n     readiness, as well as quality of life for soldiers and \n     families is degraded;\n       (4) the Army National Guard, with agreement from the \n     Department of Defense, requires a minimum essential \n     requirement of 23,500 Active Guard/Reserves and 25,500 \n     Technicians; and\n       (5) the fiscal year 2000 budget request for the Army \n     National Guard provides resources sufficient for \n     approximately 21,807 Active Guard/Reserves and 22,500 \n     Technicians, end strength shortfalls of 3,000 and 1,693, \n     respectively.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in the budget resolution assume \n     that the Department of Defense will give priority to \n     providing adequate resources to sufficiently fund the Active \n     Guard/Reserves and Military Technicians at minimum required \n     levels.\n\n     SEC. 307. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON EFFECTS OF SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   REFORM ON WOMEN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Social Security benefit structure is of particular \n     importance to low-earning wives and widows, with 63 percent \n     of women beneficiaries aged 62 or older receiving wife's or \n     widow's benefits;\n       (2) three-quarters of unmarried and widowed elderly women \n     rely on Social Security for more than half of their income;\n       (3) without Social Security benefits, the elderly poverty \n     rate among women would have been 52.2 percent, and among \n     widows would have been 60.6 percent;\n       (4) women tend to live longer and tend to have lower \n     lifetime earnings than men do;\n       (5) women spend an average of 11.5 years out of their \n     careers to care for their families, and are more likely to \n     work part-time than full-time; and\n       (6) during these years in the workforce, women earn an \n     average of 70 cents for every dollar men earn.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) women face unique obstacles in ensuring retirement \n     security and survivor and disability stability;\n       (2) Social Security plays an essential role in guaranteeing \n     inflation-protected financial stability for women throughout \n     their entire old age; and\n       (3) the Congress and the President should take these \n     factors into account when considering proposals to reform the \n     Social Security system.\n\n     SEC. 308. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE \n                   NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the National Institutes of Health is the Nation's \n     foremost research center;\n       (2) the Nation's commitment to and investment in biomedical \n     research has resulted in better health and an improved \n     quality of life for all Americans;\n       (3) continued biomedical research funding must be ensured \n     so that medical doctors and scientists have the security to \n     commit to conducting long-term research studies;\n       (4) funding for the National Institutes of Health should \n     continue to increase in order to prevent the cessation of \n     biomedical research studies and the loss of medical doctors \n     and research scientists to private research organizations; \n     and\n       (5) the National Institutes of Health conducts research \n     protocols without proprietary interests, thereby ensuring \n     that the best health care is researched and made available to \n     the Nation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that there shall be a \n     continuation of the pattern of budgetary increases for \n     biomedical research.\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FUNDING FOR KYOTO PROTOCOL \n                   IMPLEMENTATION PRIOR TO SENATE RATIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The agreement signed by the Administration on November \n     12, 1998, regarding legally binding commitments on greenhouse \n     gas reductions is inconsistent with the provisions of S. Res. \n     98, the Byrd-Hagel Resolution, which passed the Senate \n     unanimously.\n       (2) The Administration has agreed to allowing at least 2 \n     additional years for negotiations on the Buenos Aires Action \n     Plan to determine the provisions of several vital aspects of \n     the Treaty for the United States, including emissions trading \n     schemes, carbon sinks, a clean development mechanism, and \n     developing Nation participation.\n       (3) The Administration has not submitted the Kyoto Protocol \n     to the Senate for ratification and has indicated it has no \n     intention to do so in the foreseeable future.\n       (4) The Administration has pledged to Congress that it \n     would not implement any portion of the Kyoto Protocol prior \n     to its ratification in the Senate.\n       (5) Congress agrees that Federal expenditures are required \n     and appropriate for activities which both improve the \n     environment and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Those \n     activities include programs to promote energy efficient \n     technologies, encourage technology development that reduces \n     or sequesters greenhouse gases, encourage the development and \n     use of alternative and renewable fuel technologies, and other \n     programs justifiable independent of the goals of the Kyoto \n     Protocol.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that funds should not be \n     provided to put into effect the Kyoto Protocol prior to its \n     Senate ratification in compliance with the requirements of \n     the Byrd-Hagel Resolution and consistent with previous \n     Administration assurances to Congress.\n\n     SEC. 310. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FEDERAL RESEARCH AND \n                   DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) A dozen internationally, prestigious economic studies \n     have shown that technological progress has historically been \n     the single most important factor in economic growth, having \n     more than twice the impact of labor or capital.\n       (2) The link between economic growth and technology is \n     evident: our dominant high technology industries are \n     currently responsible for 80 percent of the value of today's \n     stock market, \\1/3\\ of our economic output, and half of our \n     economic growth. Furthermore, the link between Federal \n     funding of research and development (R) and market products \n     is conclusive: 70 percent of all patent applications cite \n     nonprofit or federally-funded research as a core component to \n     the innovation being patented.\n       (3) The revolutionary high technology applications of today \n     were spawned from scientific\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\n     advances that occurred in the 1960's, when the Government \n     intensively funded R In the 3 decades since then, our \n     investment in R as a fraction of Gross Domestic Product \n     (GDP) has dropped to half its former value. As a fraction of \n     the Federal budget, the investment in civilian R has \n     dropped to only \\1/3\\ its value in 1965.\n       (4) Compared to other foreign nation's investment in \n     science and technology, American competitiveness is slipping: \n     an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development \n     report notes that 14 countries now invest more in basic and \n     fundamental research as a fraction of GDP than the United \n     States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Federal \n     investment in R should be preserved and increased in order \n     to ensure long-term United States economic strength. Funding \n     for Federal agencies performing basic scientific, medical, \n     and precompetitive engineering research pursuant to the \n     Balanced Budget Agreement Act of 1997 should be a priority \n     for the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committees this \n     year, within the Budget as established by this Committee, in \n     order to achieve a goal of doubling the Federal investment in \n     R over an 11 year period.\n\n     SEC. 311. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COUNTER-NARCOTICS FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the drug crisis facing the United States is a top \n     national security threat;\n       (2) the spread of illicit drugs through United States \n     borders cannot be halted without an effective drug \n     interdiction strategy;\n       (3) effective drug interdiction efforts have been shown to \n     limit the availability of illicit narcotics, drive up the \n     street price, support demand reduction efforts, and decrease \n     overall drug trafficking and use; and\n       (4) the percentage change in drug use since 1992, among \n     graduating high school students who used drugs in the past 12 \n     months, has substantially increased--marijuana use is up 80 \n     percent, cocaine use is up 80 percent, and heroin use is up \n     100 percent.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals \n     included in this resolution assume the following:\n       (1) All counter-narcotics agencies will be given a high \n     priority for fully funding their counter-narcotics mission.\n       (2) Front line drug fighting agencies are dedicating more \n     resources for intentional efforts to continue restoring a \n     balanced drug control strategy. Congress should carefully \n     examine the reauthorization of the United States Customs \n     service and ensure they have adequate resources and authority \n     not only to facilitate the movement of internationally traded \n     goods but to ensure they can aggressively pursue their law \n     enforcement activities.\n       (3) By pursuing a balanced effort which requires investment \n     in 3 key areas: demand reduction (such as education and \n     treatment); domestic law enforcement; and international \n     supply reduction, Congress believes we can reduce the number \n     of children who are exposed to and addicted to illegal drugs.\n\n     SEC. 312. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRIBAL COLLEGES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) more than 26,500 students from 250 tribes nationwide \n     attend tribal colleges. The colleges serve students of all \n     ages, many of whom are moving from welfare to work. The vast \n     majority of tribal college students are first-generation \n     college students;\n       (2) while annual appropriations for tribal colleges have \n     increased modestly in recent years, core operation funding \n     levels are still about \\1/2\\ of the $6,000 per Indian student \n     level authorized by the Tribally Controlled College or \n     University Act;\n       (3) although tribal colleges received a $1,400,000 increase \n     in funding in fiscal year 1999, because of rising student \n     populations, these institutions faced an actual per-student \n     decrease in funding over fiscal year 1998; and\n       (4) per student funding for tribal colleges is only about \n     63 percent of the amount given to mainstream community \n     colleges ($2,964 per student at tribal colleges versus $4,743 \n     per student at mainstream community colleges).\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) this resolution recognizes the funding difficulties \n     faced by tribal colleges and assumes that priority \n     consideration will be provided to them through funding for \n     the Tribally Controlled College and University Act, the 1994 \n     Land Grant Institutions, and title III of the Higher \n     Education Act; and\n       (2) the levels in this resolution assume that such priority \n     consideration reflects Congress' intent to continue work \n     toward current statutory Federal funding goals for the tribal \n     colleges.\n\n     SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     January 1999 ``Economic and Budget Outlook,'' the Social \n     Security Trust Fund is projected to incur annual surpluses of \n     $126,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1999, $137,000,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2000, $144,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2001, \n     $153,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2002, $161,000,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2003, and $171,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2004;\n       (2) the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution crafted by \n     Chairman Domenici assumes that Trust Fund surpluses will be \n     used to reduce publicly-held debt and for no other purposes, \n     and calls for the enactment of statutory legislation that \n     would enforce this assumption;\n       (3) the President's fiscal year 2000 budget proposal not \n     only fails to call for legislation that will ensure annual \n     Social Security surpluses are used strictly to reduce \n     publicly-held debt, but actually spends a portion of these \n     surpluses on non-Social Security programs;\n       (4) using CBO's re-estimate of his budget proposal, the \n     President would spend approximately $40,000,000,000 of the \n     Social Security surplus in fiscal year 2000 on non-Social \n     Security programs; $41,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2001; \n     $24,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2002; $34,000,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2003; and $20,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2004; \n     and\n       (5) spending any portion of an annual Social Security \n     surplus on non-Social Security programs is wholly-\n     inconsistent with efforts to preserve and protect Social \n     Security for future generations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that Congress shall reject \n     any budget that would spend any portion of the Social \n     Security surpluses generated in any fiscal year for any \n     Federal program other than Social Security.\n\n     SEC. 314. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON NEED-BASED STUDENT FINANCIAL \n                   AID PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) public investment in higher education yields a return \n     of several dollars for each dollar invested;\n       (2) higher education promotes economic opportunity for \n     individuals, as recipients of bachelor's degrees earn an \n     average of 75 percent per year more than those with high \n     school diplomas and experience half as much unemployment as \n     high school graduates;\n       (3) higher education promotes social opportunity, as \n     increased education is correlated with reduced criminal \n     activity, lessened reliance on public assistance, and \n     increased civic participation;\n       (4) a more educated workforce will be essential for \n     continued economic competitiveness in an age where the amount \n     of information available to society will double in a matter \n     of days rather than months or years;\n       (5) access to a college education has become a hallmark of \n     American society, and is vital to upholding our belief in \n     equality of opportunity;\n       (6) for a generation, the Federal Pell Grant has served as \n     an established and effective means of providing access to \n     higher education for students with financial need;\n       (7) over the past decade, Pell Grant awards have failed to \n     keep pace with inflation, eroding their value and threatening \n     access to higher education for the Nation's neediest \n     students;\n       (8) grant aid as a portion of all students financial aid \n     has fallen significantly over the past 5 years;\n       (9) the Nation's neediest students are now borrowing \n     approximately as much as its wealthiest students to finance \n     higher education; and\n       (10) the percentage of freshmen attending public and \n     private 4-year institutions from families below national \n     median income has fallen since 1981.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that within the discretionary allocation provided to the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate for function 500--\n       (1) the maximum amount of Federal Pell Grants should be \n     increased by $400;\n       (2) funding for the Federal Supplemental Educational \n     Opportunity Grants Program should be increased by \n     $65,000,000;\n       (3) funding for the Federal capital contributions under the \n     Federal Perkins Loan Program should be increased by \n     $35,000,000;\n       (4) funding for the Leveraging Educational Assistance \n     Partnership Program should be increased by $50,000,000;\n       (5) funding for the Federal Work-Study Program should be \n     increased by $64,000,000;\n       (6) funding for the Federal TRIO Programs should be \n     increased by $100,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 315. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PROTECTION OF \n                   THE SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should balance the budget \n     excluding the surpluses generated by the Social Security \n     Trust Funds;\n       (2) reducing the Federal debt held by the public is a top \n     national priority, strongly supported on a bipartisan basis, \n     as evidenced by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's \n     comment that debt reduction ``is a very important element in \n     sustaining economic growth'', as well as President Clinton's \n     comments that it ``is very, very important that we get the \n     Government debt down'' when referencing his own plans to use \n     the budget surplus to reduce Federal debt held by the public;\n       (3) according to the Congressional Budget Office, balancing \n     the budget excluding the surpluses generated by the Social \n     Security Trust Funds will reduce debt held by the public by a \n     total of $1,723,000,000,000 by the end of fiscal year 2009, \n     $417,000,000,000, or 32 percent, more than it would be \n     reduced under the President's fiscal year 2000 budget \n     submission;\n       (4) further, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \n     that the President's budget would actually spend \n     $40,000,000,000 of the Social Security surpluses in fiscal \n     year 2000 on new spending programs, and spend \n     $158,000,000,000 of the Social Security surpluses on new \n     spending programs from fiscal year 2000 through 2004; and\n       (5) Social Security surpluses should be used for Social \n     Security reform or to reduce the debt held by the public and \n     should not be used for other purposes.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the functional totals \n     in this concurrent resolution on the budget assume that \n     Congress shall pass legislation which--\n       (1) reaffirms the provisions of section 13301 of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that provides that \n     the receipts and disbursements of the Social Security Trust \n     Funds shall not be counted for the purposes of the budget \n     submitted by the President, the congressional\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\n     budget, or the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act of 1985, and provides for a point of order within the \n     Senate against any concurrent resolution on the budget, an \n     amendment thereto, or a conference report thereon that \n     violates that section;\n       (2) mandates that the Social Security surpluses are used \n     only for the payment of Social Security benefits, Social \n     Security reform or to reduce the Federal debt held by the \n     public, and not spent on non-Social Security programs or used \n     to offset tax cuts;\n       (3) provides for a Senate super-majority point of order \n     against any bill, resolution, amendment, motion or conference \n     report that would use Social Security surpluses on anything \n     other than the payment of Social Security benefits, Social \n     Security reform or the reduction of the Federal debt held by \n     the public;\n       (4) ensures that all Social Security benefits are paid on \n     time; and\n       (5) accommodates Social Security reform legislation.\n\n     SEC. 316. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROVIDING ADEQUATE FUNDING \n                   FOR UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) United States international leadership is essential to \n     maintaining security and peace for all Americans;\n       (2) such leadership depends on effective diplomacy as well \n     as a strong military;\n       (3) effective diplomacy requires adequate resources both \n     for embassy security and for international programs;\n       (4) in addition to building peace, prosperity and democracy \n     around the world, programs in the International Affairs (150) \n     account serve United States interests by ensuring better jobs \n     and a higher standard of living, promoting the health of our \n     citizens and preserving our natural environment, and \n     protecting the rights and safety of those who travel or do \n     business overseas;\n       (5) real spending for International Affairs has declined \n     more than 50 percent since the mid-1980s, at the same time \n     that major new challenges and opportunities have arisen from \n     the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the worldwide \n     trends toward democracy and free markets;\n       (6) current ceilings on discretionary spending will impose \n     severe additional cuts in funding for International Affairs; \n     and\n       (7) improved security for United States diplomatic missions \n     and personnel will place further strain on the International \n     Affairs budget absent significant additional resources.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that additional \n     budgetary resources should be identified for function 150 to \n     enable successful United States international leadership.\n\n     SEC. 317. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT \n                   SHOULD NOT INVEST THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST \n                   FUNDS IN PRIVATE FINANCIAL MARKETS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume \n     that the Federal Government should not directly invest \n     contributions made to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund established under section 201 of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401) in private financial markets.\n\n     SEC. 318. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING ON-BUDGET SURPLUS.\n\n       (a) It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions in \n     this resolution assume that if the Congressional Budget \n     Office determines there is an on-budget surplus for fiscal \n     year 2000, $2,000,000,000 of that surplus will be restored to \n     the programs cut in function 920.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying this budget resolution assume that none of these \n     offsets will come from defense or veterans, and to the extent \n     possible should come from administrative functions.\n\n     SEC. 319. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TEA-21 FUNDING AND THE \n                   STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on May 22, 1998, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the \n     conference committee report on H.R. 2400, the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century, in a 88-5 roll call vote;\n       (2) also on May 22, 1998, the House of Representatives \n     approved the conference committee report on this bill in a \n     297-86 recorded vote;\n       (3) on June 9, 1998, President Clinton signed this bill \n     into law, thereby making it Public Law 105-178;\n       (4) the TEA-21 legislation was a comprehensive \n     reauthorization of Federal highway and mass transit programs, \n     which authorized approximately $216,000,000,000 in Federal \n     transportation spending over the next 6 fiscal years;\n       (5) section 1105 of this legislation called for any excess \n     Federal gasoline tax revenues to be provided to the States \n     under the formulas established by the final version of TEA-\n     21; and\n       (6) the President's fiscal year 2000 budget request \n     contained a proposal to distribute approximately \n     $1,000,000,000 in excess Federal gasoline tax revenues that \n     was not consistent with the provisions of section 1105 of \n     TEA-21 and would deprive States of needed revenues.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and any legislation \n     enacted pursuant to this resolution assume that the \n     President's fiscal year 2000 budget proposal to change the \n     manner in which any excess Federal gasoline tax revenues are \n     distributed to the States will not be implemented, but rather \n     any of these funds will be distributed to the States pursuant \n     to section 1105 of TEA-21.\n\n     SEC. 320. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT AGRICULTURAL RISK \n                   MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS SHOULD BENEFIT LIVESTOCK \n                   PRODUCERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) extremes in weather-related and natural conditions have \n     a profound impact on the economic viability of producers;\n       (2) these extremes, such as drought, excessive rain and \n     snow, flood, wind, insect infestation are certainly beyond \n     the control of livestock producers;\n       (3) these extremes do not impact livestock producers within \n     a State, region or the Nation in the same manner or during \n     the same time frame or for the same duration of time;\n       (4) the livestock producers have few effective risk \n     management tools at their disposal to adequately manage the \n     short and long term impacts of weather-related or natural \n     disaster situations; and\n       (5) ad hoc natural disaster assistance programs, while \n     providing some relief, are not sufficient to meet livestock \n     producers' needs for rational risk management planning.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     any consideration of reform of Federal crop insurance and \n     risk management programs should include the needs of \n     livestock producers.\n\n     SEC. 321. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE MODERNIZATION AND \n                   IMPROVEMENT OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The health insurance coverage provided under the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) is an integral part of the financial \n     security for retired and disabled individuals, as such \n     coverage protects those individuals against the financially \n     ruinous costs of a major illness.\n       (2) Expenditures under the medicare program for hospital, \n     physician, and other essential health care services that are \n     provided to nearly 39,000,000 retired and disabled \n     individuals will be $232,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2000.\n       (3) During the nearly 35 years since the medicare program \n     was established, the Nation's health care delivery and \n     financing system has undergone major transformations. \n     However, the medicare program has not kept pace with such \n     transformations.\n       (4) Former Congressional Budget Office Director Robert \n     Reischauer has described the medicare program as it exists \n     today as failing on the following 4 key dimensions (known as \n     the ``Four I's''):\n       (A) The program is inefficient.\n       (B) The program is inequitable.\n       (C) The program is inadequate.\n       (D) The program is insolvent.\n       (5) The President's budget framework does not devote 15 \n     percent of the budget surpluses to the medicare program. The \n     Federal budget process does not provide a mechanism for \n     setting aside current surpluses for future obligations. As a \n     result, the notion of saving 15 percent of the surplus for \n     the medicare program cannot practically be carried out.\n       (6) The President's budget framework would transfer to the \n     Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund more than \n     $900,000,000,000 over 15 years in new IOUs that must be \n     redeemed later by raising taxes on American workers, cutting \n     benefits, or borrowing more from the public, and these new \n     IOUs would increase the gross debt of the Federal Government \n     by the amounts transferred.\n       (7) The Congressional Budget Office has stated that the \n     transfers described in paragraph (6), which are strictly \n     intragovernmental, have no effect on the unified budget \n     surpluses or the on-budget surpluses and therefore have no \n     effect on the debt held by the public.\n       (8) The President's budget framework does not provide \n     access to, or financing for, prescription drugs.\n       (9) The Comptroller General of the United States has stated \n     that the President's medicare proposal does not constitute \n     reform of the program and ``is likely to create a public \n     misperception that something meaningful is being done to \n     reform the medicare program''.\n       (10) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 enacted changes to the \n     medicare program which strengthen and extend the solvency of \n     that program.\n       (11) The Congressional Budget Office has stated that \n     without the changes made to the medicare program by the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the depletion of the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would now be imminent.\n       (12) The President's budget proposes to cut medicare \n     program spending by $19,400,000,000 over 10 years, primarily \n     through reductions in payments to providers under that \n     program.\n       (13) The recommendations by Senator John Breaux and \n     Representative William Thomas received the bipartisan support \n     of a majority of members on the National Bipartisan \n     Commission on the Future of Medicare.\n       (14) The Breaux-Thomas recommendations provide for new \n     prescription drug coverage for the neediest beneficiaries \n     within a plan that substantially improves the solvency of the \n     medicare program without transferring new IOUs to the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund that must be redeemed later by \n     raising taxes, cutting benefits, or borrowing more from the \n     public.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions contained in this budget resolution \n     assume the following:\n       (1) This resolution does not adopt the President's \n     proposals to reduce medicare program spending by \n     $19,400,000,000 over 10 years, nor does this resolution adopt \n     the President's proposal to spend $10,000,000,000 of medicare \n     program funds on unrelated programs.\n       (2) Congress will not transfer to the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund new IOUs that must be redeemed later by \n     raising taxes on American workers, cutting benefits, or \n     borrowing more from the public.\n       (3) Congress should work in a bipartisan fashion to extend \n     the solvency of the medicare program and to ensure that \n     benefits under that\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\n     program will be available to beneficiaries in the future.\n       (4) The American public will be well and fairly served in \n     this undertaking if the medicare program reform proposals are \n     considered within a framework that is based on the following \n     5 key principles offered in testimony to the Senate Committee \n     on Finance by the Comptroller General of the United States:\n       (A) Affordability.\n       (B) Equity.\n       (C) Adequacy.\n       (D) Feasibility.\n       (E) Public acceptance.\n       (5) The recommendations by Senator Breaux and Congressman \n     Thomas provide for new prescription drug coverage for the \n     neediest beneficiaries within a plan that substantially \n     improves the solvency of the medicare program without \n     transferring to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund new \n     IOUs that must be redeemed later by raising taxes, cutting \n     benefits, or borrowing more from the public.\n       (6) Congress should move expeditiously to consider the \n     bipartisan recommendations of the Chairmen of the National \n     Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.\n       (7) Congress should continue to work with the President as \n     he develops and presents his plan to fix the problems of the \n     medicare program.\n\n     SEC. 322. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROVIDING TAX RELIEF TO ALL \n                   AMERICANS BY RETURNING NON-SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   SURPLUS TO TAXPAYERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Every cent of Social Security surplus should be \n     reserved to pay Social Security benefits, for Social Security \n     reform, or to pay down the debt held by the public and not be \n     used for other purposes.\n       (2) Medicare should be fully funded.\n       (3) Even after safeguarding Social Security and medicare, a \n     recent Congressional Research Service study found that an \n     average American family will pay $5,307 more in taxes over \n     the next 10 years than the Government needs to operate.\n       (4) The Administration's budget returns none of the excess \n     surplus back to the taxpayers and instead increases net taxes \n     and fees by $96,000,000,000 over 10 years.\n       (5) The burden of the Administration's tax increases falls \n     disproportionately on low- and middle-income taxpayers. A \n     recent Tax Foundation study found that individuals with \n     incomes of less than $25,000 would bear 38.5 percent of the \n     increased tax burden, while taxpayers with incomes between \n     $25,000 and $50,000 would pay 22.4 percent of the new taxes.\n       (6) The budget resolution returns most of the non-Social \n     Security surplus to those who worked so hard to produce it by \n     providing $142,000,000,000 in real tax relief over 5 years \n     and almost $800,000,000,000 in tax relief over 10 years.\n       (7) The budget resolution builds on the following tax \n     relief since 1995:\n       (A) In 1996, Congress provided, and the President signed, \n     tax relief for small business and health care-related tax \n     relief.\n       (B) In 1997, Congress once again pushed for tax relief in \n     the context of a balanced budget, and President Clinton \n     signed into law a $500 per child tax credit, expanded \n     individual retirement accounts and the new Roth IRA, a cut in \n     the capital gains tax rate, education tax relief, and estate \n     tax relief.\n       (C) In 1998, Congress pushed for reform of the Internal \n     Revenue Service, and provided tax relief for America's \n     farmers.\n       (8) Americans deserve further tax relief because they are \n     still overpaying. They deserve a refund. Federal taxes \n     currently consume nearly 21 percent of national income, the \n     highest percentage since World War II. Families are paying \n     more in Federal, State, and local taxes than for food, \n     clothing, and shelter combined.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the levels in this resolution assume that the Senate \n     not only puts a priority on protecting Social Security and \n     medicare and reducing the Federal debt, but also on middle-\n     class tax relief by returning some of the non-Social Security \n     surplus to those from whom it was taken; and\n       (2) such middle-class tax relief could include broad-based \n     tax relief, marriage penalty relief, retirement savings \n     incentives, estate tax relief, savings and investment \n     incentives, health care-related tax relief, education-related \n     tax relief, and tax simplification proposals.\n\n     SEC. 323. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX INCENTIVES FOR \n                   EDUCATION SAVINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) families in the United States have accrued more college \n     debt in the 1990s than during the previous 3 decades \n     combined; and\n       (2) families should have every resource available to them \n     to meet the rising cost of higher education.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that additional tax \n     incentives should be provided for education savings, \n     including--\n       (1) excluding from gross income distributions from \n     qualified State tuition plans; and\n       (2) providing a tax deferral for private prepaid tuition \n     plans in years 2000 through 2003 and excluding from gross \n     income distributions from such plans in years 2004 and after.\n\n     SEC. 324. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTH \n                   CONGRESS, FIRST SESSION SHOULD REAUTHORIZE \n                   FUNDS FOR THE FARMLAND PROTECTION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings--\n       (1) nineteen States and dozens of localities have spent \n     nearly $1,000,000,000 to protect over 600,000 acres of \n     important farmland;\n       (2) the Farmland Protection Program has provided cost-\n     sharing for 19 States and dozens of localities to protect \n     over 123,000 acres on 432 farms since 1996;\n       (3) the Farmland Protection Program has generated new \n     interest in saving farmland in communities around the \n     country;\n       (4) the Farmland Protection Program represents an \n     innovative and voluntary partnership, rewards local \n     ingenuity, and supports local priorities;\n       (5) the Farmland Protection Program is a matching grant \n     program that is completely voluntary in which the Federal \n     Government does not acquire the land or easement;\n       (6) funds authorized for the Farmland Protection Program \n     were expended at the end of fiscal year 1998, and no funds \n     were appropriated in fiscal year 1999;\n       (7) the United States is losing two acres of our best \n     farmland to development every minute of every day;\n       (8) these lands produce three quarters of the fruits and \n     vegetables and over one half of the dairy in the United \n     States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals contained in this resolution \n     assume that the One Hundred Sixth Congress, First Session \n     will reauthorize funds for the Farmland Protection Program.\n\n     SEC. 325. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TAX CUTS FOR LOWER AND \n                   MIDDLE INCOME TAXPAYERS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that Congress will not approve an across-\n     the-board cut in income tax rates, or any other tax \n     legislation, that would provide substantially more benefits \n     to the top 10 percent of taxpayers than to the remaining 90 \n     percent.\n\n     SEC. 326. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REFORM OF THE \n                   INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (referred to in this \n     section as the ``tax code'') is unnecessarily complex and \n     burdensome, consisting of 2,000 pages of tax code, and \n     resulting in 12,000 pages of regulations and 200,000 pages of \n     court proceedings;\n       (2) the complexity of the tax code results in taxpayers \n     spending approximately 5,400,000,000 hours and \n     $200,000,000,000 on tax compliance each year;\n       (3) the impact of the complexity of the tax code is \n     inherently inequitable, rewarding taxpayers which hire \n     professional tax preparers and penalizing taxpayers which \n     seek to comply with the tax code without professional \n     assistance;\n       (4) the percentage of the income of an average family of \n     four that is paid for taxes has grown significantly, \n     comprising nearly 40 percent of the family's earnings, a \n     percentage which represents more than a family spends in the \n     aggregate on food, clothing, and housing;\n       (5) the total amount of Federal, State, and local tax \n     collections in 1998 increased approximately 5.7 percent over \n     such collections in 1997;\n       (6) the tax code penalizes saving and investment by \n     imposing tax on these important activities twice while \n     promoting consumption by only taxing income used for \n     consumption once;\n       (7) the tax code stifles economic growth by discouraging \n     work and capital formation through high tax rates;\n       (8) Congress and the President have found it necessary on \n     several occasions to enact laws to protect taxpayers from \n     abusive actions and procedures of the Internal Revenue \n     Service in enforcement of the tax code; and\n       (9) the complexity of the tax code is largely responsible \n     for the growth in size of the Internal Revenue Service.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that --\n       (1) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 needs comprehensive \n     reform; and\n       (2) Congress should move expeditiously to consider \n     comprehensive proposals to reform the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986.\n\n     SEC. 327. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DAVIS-BACON.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that in carrying out the \n     assumptions in this budget resolution, the Senate will \n     consider reform of the Davis-Bacon Act as an alternative to \n     repeal.\n\n     SEC. 328. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ACCESS TO ITEMS AND \n                   SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Total hospital operating margins with respect to items \n     and services provided to medicare beneficiaries are expected \n     to decline from 4.3 percent in fiscal year 1997 to 0.1 \n     percent in fiscal year 1999.\n       (2) Total operating margins for small rural hospitals are \n     expected to decline from 4.2 percent in fiscal year 1998 to \n     negative 5.6 percent in fiscal year 2002, a 233 percent \n     decline.\n       (3) The Congressional Budget Office recently has estimated \n     that the amount of savings to the medicare program in fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2002 by reason of the amendments to that \n     program contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is \n     $88,500,000 more than the amount of savings to the program by \n     reason of those amendments that the Congressional Budget \n     Office estimated for those fiscal years immediately prior to \n     the enactment of that Act.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the provisions contained in this budget resolution assume \n     that the Senate should--\n       (1) consider whether the amendments to the medicare program \n     contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have had an \n     adverse impact on access to items and services under that \n     program; and\n       (2) if it is determined that additional resources are \n     available, additional budget authority and outlays shall be \n     allocated to address the unintended consequences of change in \n     medicare program policy made by the Balanced Budget Act,\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\n     including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, to \n     ensure fair and equitable access to all items and services \n     under the program.\n\n     SEC. 329. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING AUTISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders are \n     biologically-based neurodevelopmental diseases that cause \n     severe impairments in language and communication and \n     generally manifest in young children sometime during the \n     first two years of life.\n       (2) Best estimates indicate that 1 in 500 children born \n     today will be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and \n     that 400,000 Americans have autism or an autism spectrum \n     disorder.\n       (3) There is little information on the prevalence of autism \n     and other pervasive developmental disabilities in the United \n     States. There have never been any national prevalence studies \n     in the United States, and the two studies that were conducted \n     in the 1980s examined only selected areas of the country. \n     Recent studies in Canada, Europe, and Japan suggest that the \n     prevalence of classic autism alone may be 300 percent to 400 \n     percent higher than previously estimated.\n       (4) Three quarters of those with infantile autism spend \n     their adult lives in institutions or group homes, and usually \n     enter institutions by the age of 13.\n       (5) The cost of caring for individuals with autism and \n     autism spectrum disorder is great, and is estimated to be \n     $13,300,000,000 per year solely for direct costs.\n       (6) The rapid advancements in biomedical science suggest \n     that effective treatments and a cure for autism are \n     attainable if--\n       (A) there is appropriate coordination of the efforts of the \n     various agencies of the Federal Government involved in \n     biomedical research on autism and autism spectrum disorders;\n       (B) there is an increased understanding of autism and \n     autism spectrum disorders by the scientific and medical \n     communities involved in autism research and treatment; and\n       (C) sufficient funds are allocated to research.\n       (7) The discovery of effective treatments and a cure for \n     autism will be greatly enhanced when scientists and \n     epidemiologists have an accurate understanding of the \n     prevalence and incidence of autism.\n       (8) Recent research suggests that environmental factors may \n     contribute to autism. As a result, contributing causes of \n     autism, if identified, may be preventable.\n       (9) Finding the answers to the causes of autism and related \n     developmental disabilities may help researchers to understand \n     other disorders, ranging from learning problems, to \n     hyperactivity, to communications deficits that affect \n     millions of Americans.\n       (10) Specifically, more knowledge is needed concerning--\n       (A) the underlying causes of autism and autism spectrum \n     disorders, how to treat the underlying abnormality or \n     abnormalities causing the severe symptoms of autism, and how \n     to prevent these abnormalities from occurring in the future;\n       (B) the epidemiology of, and the identification of risk \n     factors for, infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders;\n       (C) the development of methods for early medical diagnosis \n     and functional assessment of individuals with autism and \n     autism spectrum disorders, including identification and \n     assessment of the subtypes within the autism spectrum \n     disorders, for the purpose of monitoring the course of the \n     disease and developing medically sound strategies for \n     improving the outcomes of such individuals;\n       (D) existing biomedical and diagnostic data that are \n     relevant to autism and autism spectrum disorders for \n     dissemination to medical personnel, particularly \n     pediatricians, to aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of \n     this disease; and\n       (E) the costs incurred in educating and caring for \n     individuals with autism and autism spectrum disorders.\n       (11) In 1998, the National Institutes of Health announced a \n     program of research on autism and autism spectrum disorders. \n     A sufficient level of funding should be made available for \n     carrying out the program.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying this resolution assume that \n     additional resources will be targeted towards autism research \n     through the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n     SEC. 330. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON WOMEN'S ACCESS TO OBSTETRIC \n                   AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) In the One Hundred Fifth Congress, the House of \n     Representatives acted favorably on The Patient Protection Act \n     (H.R. 4250), which included provisions which required health \n     plans to allow women direct access to a participating \n     physician who specializes in obstetrics and gynecological \n     services.\n       (2) Women's health historically has received little \n     attention.\n       (3) Access to an obstetrician-gynecologist improves the \n     health care of a woman by providing routine and preventive \n     health care throughout the women's lifetime, encompassing \n     care of the whole patient, while also focusing on the female \n     reproductive system.\n       (4) 60 percent of all office visits to obstetrician-\n     gynecologists are for preventive care.\n       (5) Obstetrician-gynecologists are uniquely qualified on \n     the basis of education and experience to provide basic \n     women's health care services.\n       (6) While more than 36 States have acted to promote \n     residents' access to obstetrician-gynecologists, patients in \n     other States or in federally-governed health plans are not \n     protected from access restrictions or limitations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions in this concurrent resolution on the \n     budget assume that the Congress shall enact legislation that \n     requires health plans to provide women with direct access to \n     a participating provider who specializes in obstetrics and \n     gynecological services.\n\n     SEC. 331. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LIHEAP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) home energy assistance for working and low-income \n     families with children, the elderly on fixed incomes, the \n     disabled, and others who need such aid is a critical part of \n     the social safety net in cold-weather areas during the \n     winter, and a source of necessary cooling aid during the \n     summer;\n       (2) the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) \n     is a highly targeted, cost-effective way to help millions of \n     low-income Americans pay their home energy bills. More than \n     two-thirds of LIHEAP-eligible households have annual incomes \n     of less than $8,000, approximately one-half have annual \n     incomes below $6,000; and\n       (3) LIHEAP funding has been substantially reduced in recent \n     years, and cannot sustain further spending cuts if the \n     program is to remain a viable means of meeting the home \n     heating and other energy-related needs of low-income \n     families, especially those in cold-weather States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The assumptions underlying this \n     budget resolution assume that it is the sense of the Senate \n     that the funds made available for LIHEAP for fiscal year 2000 \n     will not be less than the current services for LIHEAP in \n     fiscal year 1999.\n\n     SEC. 332. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TRANSPORTATION FIREWALLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) domestic firewalls greatly limit funding flexibility as \n     Congress manages budget priorities in a fiscally constrained \n     budget;\n       (2) domestic firewalls inhibit congressional oversight of \n     programs and organizations under such protections;\n       (3) domestic firewalls mask mandatory spending under the \n     guise of discretionary spending, thereby presenting a \n     distorted picture of overall discretionary spending;\n       (4) domestic firewalls impede the ability of Congress to \n     react to changing circumstances or to fund other equally \n     important programs;\n       (5) the Congress implemented ``domestic discretionary \n     budget firewalls'' for approximately 70 percent of function \n     400 spending in the One Hundred Fifth Congress;\n       (6) if the aviation firewall proposal circulating in the \n     House of Representatives were to be enacted, firewalled \n     spending would exceed 100 percent of total function 400 \n     spending called for under this resolution; and\n       (7) if the aviation firewall proposal circulating in the \n     House of Representatives were to be enacted, drug \n     interdiction activities by the Coast Guard, National Highway \n     Traffic Safety Administration activities, rail safety \n     inspections, Federal support for Amtrak, all National \n     Transportation Safety Board activities, Pipeline and \n     Hazardous materials safety programs, and Coast Guard search \n     and rescue activities would be drastically cut or eliminated.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that no additional \n     firewalls should be enacted for function 400 transportation \n     activities.\n\n     SEC. 333. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING EXISTING, EFFECTIVE \n                   PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS BEFORE CREATING NEW \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the establishment of new categorical funding programs \n     has led to proposed cuts in the Preventive Health and Health \n     Services Block Grant to States for broad, public health \n     missions;\n       (2) Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant \n     dollars fill gaps in the otherwise-categorical funding States \n     and localities receive, funding such major public health \n     threats as cardiovascular disease, injuries, emergency \n     medical services and poor diet, for which there is often no \n     other source of funding;\n       (3) in 1981, Congress consolidated a number of programs, \n     including certain public health programs, into block grants \n     for the purpose of best advancing the health, economics and \n     well-being of communities across the country;\n       (4) the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant \n     can be used for programs for screening, outreach, health \n     education and laboratory services;\n       (5) the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant \n     gives States the flexibility to determine how funding \n     available for this purpose can be used to meet each State's \n     preventive health priorities;\n       (6) the establishment of new public health programs that \n     compete for funding with the Preventive Health and Health \n     Services Block Grant could result in the elimination of \n     effective, localized public health programs in every State.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that there shall be a \n     continuation of the level of funding support for existing \n     public health programs, specifically the Prevention Block \n     Grant, prior to the funding of new public health programs.\n\n     SEC. 334. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR SPECIAL \n                   EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) (referred to in this resolution as the \n     ``Act''), Congress found that improving educational results \n     for children with disabilities is an essential element of our \n     national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full \n     participation, independent living, and economic self-\n     sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.\n       (2) In the Act, the Secretary of Education is instructed to \n     make grants to States to assist\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\n     them in providing special education and related services to \n     children with disabilities.\n       (3) The Act represents a commitment by the Federal \n     Government to fund 40 percent of the average per-pupil \n     expenditure in public elementary and secondary schools in the \n     United States.\n       (4) The budget submitted by the President for fiscal year \n     2000 ignores the commitment by the Federal Government under \n     the Act to fund special education and instead proposes the \n     creation of new programs that limit the manner in which \n     States may spend the limited Federal education dollars \n     received.\n       (5) The budget submitted by the President for fiscal year \n     2000 fails to increase funding for special education, and \n     leaves States and localities with an enormous unfunded \n     mandate to pay for growing special education costs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that part \n     B of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et \n     seq.) should be fully funded at the originally promised level \n     before any funds are appropriated for new education programs.\n\n     SEC. 335. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO BECOME DISABLED.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in addition to providing retirement income, Social \n     Security also protects individuals from the loss of income \n     due to disability;\n       (2) according to the most recent report from the Social \n     Security Board of Trustees nearly 1 in 7 Social Security \n     beneficiaries, 6,000,000 individuals in total, were receiving \n     benefits as a result of disability;\n       (3) more than 60 percent of workers have no long-term \n     disability insurance protection other than that provided by \n     Social Security;\n       (4) according to statistics from the Society of Actuaries, \n     the odds of a long-term disability versus death are 2.7 to 1 \n     at age 27, 3.5 to 1 at age 42, and 2.2 to 1 at age 52; and\n       (5) in 1998, the average monthly benefit for a disabled \n     worker was $722.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that levels in the resolution assume that--\n       (1) Social Security plays a vital role in providing \n     adequate income for individuals who become disabled;\n       (2) individuals who become disabled face circumstances much \n     different than those who rely on Social Security for \n     retirement income;\n       (3) Social Security reform proposals that focus too heavily \n     on retirement income may adversely affect the income \n     protection provided to individuals with disabilities; and\n       (4) Congress and the President should take these factors \n     into account when considering proposals to reform the Social \n     Security program.\n\n     SEC. 336. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR INTENSIVE \n                   FIREARMS PROSECUTION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) gun violence in America, while declining somewhat in \n     recent years, is still unacceptably high;\n       (2) keeping firearms out of the hands of criminals can \n     dramatically reduce gun violence in America;\n       (3) States and localities often do not have the \n     investigative or prosecutorial resources to locate and \n     convict individuals who violate their firearms laws. Even \n     when they do win convictions, States and localities often \n     lack the jail space to hold such convicts for their full \n     prison terms;\n       (4) there are a number of Federal laws on the books which \n     are designed to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. \n     These laws impose mandatory minimum sentences upon \n     individuals who use firearms to commit crimes of violence and \n     convicted felons caught in possession of a firearm;\n       (5) the Federal Government does have the resources to \n     investigate and prosecute violations of these Federal \n     firearms laws. The Federal Government also has enough jail \n     space to hold individuals for the length of their mandatory \n     minimum sentences;\n       (6) an effort to aggressively and consistently apply these \n     Federal firearms laws in Richmond, Virginia, has cut violent \n     crime in that city. This program, called Project Exile, has \n     produced 288 indictments during its first two years of \n     operation and has been credited with contributing to a 15 \n     percent decrease in violent crimes in Richmond during the \n     same period. In the first three-quarters of 1998, homicides \n     with a firearm in Richmond were down 55 percent compared to \n     1997;\n       (7) the fiscal year 1999 Commerce-State-Justice \n     Appropriations Act provided $1,500,000 to hire additional \n     Federal prosecutors and investigators to enforce Federal \n     firearms laws in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia project--\n     called Operation Cease Fire--started on January 1, 1999. \n     Since it began, the project has resulted in 31 indictments of \n     52 defendants on firearms violations. The project has \n     benefited from help from the Philadelphia Police Department \n     and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms which was not \n     paid for out of the $1,500,000 grant;\n       (8) in 1993, the office of the United States Attorney for \n     the Western District of New York teamed up with the Monroe \n     County District Attorney's Office, the Monroe County \n     Sheriff's Department, the Rochester Police Department, and \n     others to form a Violent Crimes Task Force. In 1997, the Task \n     Force created an Illegal Firearms Suppression Unit, whose \n     mission is to use prosecutorial discretion to bring firearms \n     cases in the judicial forum where penalties for gun \n     violations would be the strictest. The Suppression Unit has \n     been involved in three major prosecutions of interstate gun-\n     purchasing activities and currently has 30 to 40 open single-\n     defendant felony gun cases;\n       (9) Senator Hatch has introduced legislation to authorize \n     Project CUFF, a Federal firearms prosecution program;\n       (10) the Administration has requested $5,000,000 to conduct \n     intensive firearms prosecution projects on a national level;\n       (11) given that at least $1,500,000 is needed to run an \n     effective program in one American city--Philadelphia--\n     $5,000,000 is far from enough funding to conduct such \n     programs nationally.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that function 750 in the budget resolution assumes that \n     $50,000,000 will be provided in fiscal year 2000 to conduct \n     intensive firearms prosecution projects to combat violence in \n     the 25 American cities with the highest crime rates.\n\n     SEC. 337. HONEST REPORTING OF THE DEFICIT.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume the following:\n       (1) In general.--Effective for fiscal year 2001, the \n     President's budget and the budget report of CBO required \n     under section 202(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     and the concurrent resolution on the budget should include--\n       (A) the receipts and disbursements totals of the on-budget \n     trust funds, including the projected levels for at least the \n     next 5 fiscal years; and\n       (B) the deficit or surplus excluding the on-budget trust \n     funds, including the projected levels for at least the next 5 \n     fiscal years.\n       (2) Itemization.--Effective for fiscal year 2001, the \n     President's budget and the budget report of CBO required \n     under section 202(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     should include an itemization of the on-budget trust funds \n     for the budget year, including receipts, outlays, and \n     balances.\n\n     SEC. 338. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FOSTERING THE \n                   EMPLOYMENT AND INDEPENDENCE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH \n                   DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care is important to all Americans.\n       (2) Health care is particularly important to individuals \n     with disabilities and special health care needs who often \n     cannot afford the insurance available to them through the \n     private market, are uninsurable by the plans available in the \n     private sector, or are at great risk of incurring very high \n     and economically devastating health care costs.\n       (3) Americans with significant disabilities often are \n     unable to obtain health care insurance that provides coverage \n     of the services and supports that enable them to live \n     independently and enter or rejoin the workforce. Coverage for \n     personal assistance services, prescription drugs, durable \n     medical equipment, and basic health care are powerful and \n     proven tools for individuals with significant disabilities to \n     obtain and retain employment.\n       (4) For individuals with disabilities, the fear of losing \n     health care and related services is one of the greatest \n     barriers keeping the individuals from maximizing their \n     employment, earning potential, and independence.\n       (5) Individuals with disabilities who are beneficiaries \n     under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     401 et seq., 1381 et seq.) risk losing medicare or medicaid \n     coverage that is linked to their cash benefits, a risk that \n     is an equal, or greater, work disincentive than the loss of \n     cash benefits associated with working.\n       (6) Currently, less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of Social \n     Security disability insurance (SSDI) and supplemental \n     security income (SSI) beneficiaries cease to receive benefits \n     as a result of employment.\n       (7) Beneficiaries have cited the lack of adequate \n     employment training and placement services as an additional \n     barrier to employment.\n       (8) If an additional \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the current \n     Social Security disability insurance (SSDI) and supplemental \n     security income (SSI) recipients were to cease receiving \n     benefits as a result of employment, the savings to the Social \n     Security Trust Funds in cash assistance would total \n     $3,500,000,000 over the worklife of the individuals.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that the Work \n     Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (S. 331, 106th Congress) \n     will be passed by the Senate and enacted early this year, and \n     thereby provide individuals with disabilities with the health \n     care and employment preparation and placement services that \n     will enable those individuals to reduce their dependency on \n     cash benefit programs.\n\n     SEC. 339. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ASSET-BUILDING FOR \n                   THE WORKING POOR.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) 33 percent of all American households and 60 percent of \n     African American households have no or negative financial \n     assets.\n       (2) 46.9 percent of all children in America live in \n     households with no financial assets, including 40 percent of \n     Caucasian children and 75 percent of African American \n     children.\n       (3) In order to provide low-income families with more tools \n     for empowerment, incentives which encourage asset-building \n     should be established.\n       (4) Across the Nation, numerous small public, private, and \n     public-private asset-building incentives, including \n     individual development accounts, are demonstrating success at \n     empowering low-income workers.\n       (5) Middle and upper income Americans currently benefit \n     from tax incentives for building assets.\n       (6) The Federal Government should utilize the Federal tax \n     code to provide low-income Americans with incentives to work \n     and build assets in order to escape poverty permanently.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the provisions of this resolution assume that Congress should \n     modify the Federal tax law to include provisions which \n     encourage low-income workers and their families to save for \n     buying a first home, starting a business, obtaining an \n     education, or taking other measures to prepare for the \n     future.\n\n[[Page S4180]]\n\n     SEC. 340. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS \n                   RESOLUTION ASSUME THAT IT IS THE POLICY OF THE \n                   UNITED STATES TO PROVIDE AS SOON AS IS \n                   TECHNOLOGICALLY POSSIBLE AN EDUCATION FOR EVERY \n                   AMERICAN CHILD THAT WILL ENABLE EACH CHILD TO \n                   EFFECTIVELY MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE TWENTY-\n                   FIRST CENTURY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Pell Grants require an increase of $5,000,000,000 per \n     year to fund the maximum award established in the Higher \n     Education Act Amendments of 1998;\n       (2) the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act needs \n     at least $13,000,000,000 more per year to fund the Federal \n     commitment to fund 40 percent of the excess costs for special \n     education services;\n       (3) title I needs at least $4,000,000,000 more per year to \n     serve all eligible children;\n       (4) over $11,000,000,000 over the next six years will be \n     required to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class size to an \n     average of 18 in grades 1-3;\n       (5) according to the General Accounting Office, it will \n     cost $112,000,000,000 just to bring existing school buildings \n     up to good overall condition. According to GAO, one-third of \n     schools serving 14,000,000 children require extensive repair \n     or replacement of one or more of their buildings. GAO also \n     found that almost half of all schools lack even the basic \n     electrical wiring needed to support full-scale use of \n     computers;\n       (6) the Federal share of education spending has declined \n     from 11.9 percent in 1980 to 7.6 percent in 1998;\n       (7) Federal spending for education has declined from 2.5 \n     percent of all Federal spending in fiscal year 1980 to 2.0 \n     percent in fiscal year 1999.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that it is the \n     policy of the United States to provide as soon as is \n     technologically possible an education for every American \n     child that will enable each child to effectively meet the \n     challenges of the twenty-first century.\n\n     SEC. 341. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING EXEMPTION OF \n                   AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES AND PRODUCTS, \n                   MEDICINES, AND MEDICAL PRODUCTS FROM UNILATERAL \n                   ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) prohibiting or otherwise restricting the donation or \n     sale of agricultural commodities or products, medicines, or \n     medical products in order to unilaterally sanction a foreign \n     government for actions or policies that the United States \n     finds objectionable unnecessarily harms innocent populations \n     in the targeted country and rarely causes the sanctioned \n     government to alter its actions or policies;\n       (2) for the United States as a matter of policy to deny \n     access to agricultural commodities or products, medicines, or \n     medical products by innocent men, women, and children in \n     other countries weakens the international leadership and \n     moral authority of the United States; and\n       (3) unilateral sanctions on the sale or donation of \n     agricultural commodities or products, medicines, or medical \n     products needlessly harm agricultural producers and workers \n     employed in the agricultural or medical sectors in the United \n     States by foreclosing markets for the commodities, products, \n     or medicines.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that the President \n     should--\n       (1) subject to paragraph (2), exempt agricultural \n     commodities and products, medicines, and medical products \n     from any unilateral economic sanction imposed on a foreign \n     government; and\n       (2) apply the sanction to the commodities, products, or \n     medicines if the application is necessary--\n       (A) for health or safety reasons; or\n       (B) due to a domestic shortage of the commodities, \n     products, or medicines.\n\n     SEC. 342. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CAPITAL GAINS TAX \n                   FAIRNESS FOR FAMILY FARMERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) one of the most popular provisions included in the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 permits many families to exclude \n     from Federal income taxes up to $500,000 of gain from the \n     sale of their principal residences;\n       (2) under current law, family farmers are not able to take \n     full advantage of this $500,000 capital gains exclusion that \n     families living in urban or suburban areas enjoy on the sale \n     of their homes;\n       (3) for most urban and suburban residents, their homes are \n     their major financial asset and as a result such families, \n     who have owned their homes through many years of \n     appreciation, can often benefit from a large portion of this \n     new $500,000 capital gains exclusion;\n       (4) most family farmers plow any profits they make back \n     into the whole farm rather than into the house which holds \n     little or no value;\n       (5) unfortunately, farm families receive little benefit \n     from this capital gains exclusion because the Internal \n     Revenue Service separates the value of their homes from the \n     value of the land the homes sit on;\n       (6) we should recognize in our tax laws the unique \n     character and role of our farm families and their important \n     contributions to our economy, and allow them to benefit more \n     fully from the capital gains tax exclusion that urban and \n     suburban homeowners already enjoy; and\n       (7) we should expand the $500,000 capital gains tax \n     exclusion to cover sales of the farmhouse and the surrounding \n     farmland over their lifetimes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that if we pass tax \n     relief measures in accordance with the assumptions in the \n     budget resolution, we should ensure that such legislation \n     removes the disparity between farm families and their urban \n     and suburban counterparts with respect to the new $500,000 \n     capital gains tax exclusion for principal residence sales by \n     expanding it to cover gains from the sale of farmland along \n     with the sale of the farmhouse.\n\n     SEC. 343. BUDGETING FOR THE DEFENSE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the budgetary levels for \n     National Defense (function 050) for fiscal years 2000 through \n     2008 assume funding for the Defense Science and Technology \n     Program that is consistent with section 214 of the Strom \n     Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     1999, which expresses a sense of the Congress that for each \n     of those fiscal years it should be an objective of the \n     Secretary of Defense to increase the budget request for the \n     Defense Science and Technology Program by at least 2 percent \n     over inflation.\n\n     SEC. 344. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR THE \n                   URBAN PARKS AND RECREATION RECOVERY (UPARR) \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) every analysis of national recreation issues in the \n     last 3 decades has identified the importance of close-to-home \n     recreation opportunities, particularly for residents in \n     densely-populated urban areas;\n       (2) the Land and Water Conservation Fund grants program \n     under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 \n     U.S.C. 460l-4 et seq.) was established partly to address the \n     pressing needs of urban areas;\n       (3) the National Urban Recreation Study of 1978 and the \n     President's Commission on Americans Outdoors of 1987 revealed \n     that critical urban recreation resources were not being \n     addressed;\n       (4) older city park structures and infrastructures worth \n     billions of dollars are at risk because government incentives \n     favored the development of new areas over the revitalization \n     of existing resources, ranging from downtown parks \n     established in the 19th century to neighborhood playgrounds \n     and sports centers built from the 1920's to the 1950's;\n       (5) the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery (UPARR) \n     program, established under the Urban Park and Recreation \n     Recovery Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.), authorized \n     $725,000,000 to provide matching grants and technical \n     assistance to economically distressed urban communities;\n       (6) the purposes of the UPARR program is to provide direct \n     Federal assistance to urban localities for rehabilitation of \n     critically needed recreation facilities, and to encourage \n     local planning and a commitment to continuing operation and \n     maintenance of recreation programs, sites, and facilities; \n     and\n       (7) funding for UPARR is supported by a wide range of \n     organizations, including the National Association of Police \n     Athletic Leagues, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers \n     Association, the Conference of Mayors, and Major League \n     Baseball.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that Congress considers \n     the UPARR program to be a high priority, and should \n     appropriate such amounts as are necessary to carry out the \n     Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery (UPARR) program \n     established under the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act \n     of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 345. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOCIAL PROMOTION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume \n     that funds will be provided for legislation--\n       (1) to provide remedial educational and other instructional \n     interventions to assist public elementary and secondary \n     school students in meeting achievement levels; and\n       (2) to terminate practices which advance students from one \n     grade to the next who do not meet State achievement standards \n     in the core academic curriculum.\n\n     SEC. 346. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON WOMEN AND SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) without Social Security benefits, the elderly poverty \n     rate among women would have been 52.2 percent, and among \n     widows would have been 60.6 percent;\n       (2) women tend to live longer and tend to have lower \n     lifetime earnings than men do;\n       (3) during their working years, women earn an average of 70 \n     cents for every dollar men earn; and\n       (4) women spend an average of 11.5 years out of their \n     careers to care for their families, and are more likely to \n     work part-time than full-time.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) women face unique obstacles in ensuring retirement \n     security and survivor and disability stability;\n       (2) Social Security plays an essential role in guaranteeing \n     inflation-protected financial stability for women throughout \n     their old age;\n       (3) the Congress and the Administration should act, as part \n     of Social Security reform, to ensure that widows and other \n     poor elderly women receive more adequate benefits that reduce \n     their poverty rates and that women, under whatever approach \n     is taken to reform Social Security, should receive no lesser \n     a share of overall federally-funded retirement benefits than \n     they receive today; and\n       (4) the sacrifice that women make to care for their family \n     should be recognized during reform of Social Security and \n     that women should not be penalized by taking an average of \n     11.5 years out of their careers to care for their family.\n\n[[Page S4181]]\n\n     SEC. 347. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING SOUTH KOREA'S \n                   INTERNATIONAL TRADE PRACTICES ON PORK AND BEEF.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Asia is the largest regional export market for \n     America's farmers and ranchers, traditionally purchasing \n     approximately 40 percent of all United States agricultural \n     exports;\n       (2) the Department of Agriculture forecasts that over the \n     next year American agricultural exports to Asian countries \n     will decline by several billion dollars due to the Asian \n     financial crisis;\n       (3) the United States is the producer of the safest \n     agricultural products from farm to table, customizing goods \n     to meet the needs of customers worldwide, and has established \n     the image and reputation as the world's best provider of \n     agricultural products;\n       (4) American farmers and ranchers, and more specifically, \n     American pork and beef producers, are dependent on secure, \n     open, and competitive Asian export markets for their product;\n       (5) United States pork and beef producers not only have \n     faced the adverse effects of depreciated and unstable \n     currencies and lowered demand due to the Asian financial \n     crisis, but also have been confronted with South Korea's pork \n     subsidies and its failure to keep commitments on market \n     access for beef;\n       (6) it is the policy of the United States to prohibit South \n     Korea from using United States and International Monetary \n     Fund assistance to subsidize targeted industries and compete \n     unfairly for market share against United States products;\n       (7) the South Korean Government has been subsidizing its \n     pork exports to Japan, resulting in a 973 percent increase in \n     its exports to Japan since 1992, and a 71 percent increase in \n     the last year;\n       (8) pork already comprises 70 percent of South Korea's \n     agriculture exports to Japan, yet the South Korean Government \n     has announced plans to invest 100,000,000,000 won in its \n     agricultural sector in order to flood the Japanese market \n     with even more South Korean pork;\n       (9) the South Korean Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries \n     reportedly has earmarked 25,000,000,000 won for loans to \n     Korea's pork processors in order for them to purchase more \n     Korean pork and to increase exports to Japan;\n       (10) any export subsidies on pork, including those on \n     exports from South Korea to Japan, would violate South \n     Korea's international trade agreements and may be actionable \n     under the World Trade Organization;\n       (11) South Korea's subsidies are hindering United States \n     pork and beef producers from capturing their full potential \n     in the Japanese market, which is the largest export market \n     for United States pork and beef, importing nearly \n     $700,000,000 of United States pork and over $1,500,000,000 of \n     United States beef last year alone;\n       (12) under the United States-Korea 1993 Record of \n     Understanding on Market Access for Beef, which was negotiated \n     pursuant to a 1989 GATT Panel decision against Korea, South \n     Korea was allowed to delay full liberalization of its beef \n     market (in an exception to WTO rules) if it would agree to \n     import increasing minimum quantities of beef each year until \n     the year 2001;\n       (13) South Korea fell woefully short of its beef market \n     access commitment for 1998; and\n       (14) United States pork and beef producers are not able to \n     compete fairly with Korean livestock producers, who have a \n     high cost of production, because South Korea has violated \n     trade agreements and implemented protectionist policies.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Congress--\n       (1) believes strongly that while a stable global \n     marketplace is in the best interest of America's farmers and \n     ranchers, the United States should seek a mutually beneficial \n     relationship without hindering the competitiveness of \n     American agriculture;\n       (2) calls on South Korea to abide by its trade commitments;\n       (3) calls on the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the \n     United States Executive Director of the International \n     Monetary Fund to promote vigorously policies that encourage \n     the opening of markets for beef and pork products by \n     requiring South Korea to abide by its existing international \n     trade commitments and to reduce trade barriers, tariffs, and \n     export subsidies;\n       (4) calls on the President and the Secretaries of Treasury \n     and Agriculture to monitor and report to Congress that \n     resources will not be used to stabilize the South Korean \n     market at the expense of United States agricultural goods or \n     services; and\n       (5) requests the United States Trade Representative and the \n     United States Department of Agriculture to pursue the \n     settlement of disputes with the Government of South Korea on \n     its failure to abide by its international trade commitments \n     on beef market access, to consider whether Korea's reported \n     plans for subsidizing its pork industry would violate any of \n     its international trade commitments, and to determine what \n     impact Korea's subsidy plans would have on United States \n     agricultural interests, especially in Japan.\n\n     SEC. 348. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SUPPORT FOR STATE AND \n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) as national crime rates are beginning to fall as a \n     result of State and local efforts, with Federal support, it \n     is important for the Federal Government to continue its \n     support for State and local law enforcement;\n       (2) Federal support is crucial to the provision of critical \n     crime fighting programs;\n       (3) Federal support is also essential to the provision of \n     critical crime fighting services and the effective \n     administration of justice in the States, such as State and \n     local crime laboratories and medical examiners' offices;\n       (4) current needs exceed the capacity of State and local \n     crime laboratories to process their forensic examinations, \n     resulting in tremendous backlogs that prevent the swift \n     administration of justice and impede fundamental individual \n     rights, such as the right to a speedy trial and to \n     exculpatory evidence;\n       (5) last year, Congress passed the Crime Identification \n     Technology Act of 1998, which authorizes $250,000,000 each \n     year for 5 years to assist State and local law enforcement \n     agencies in developing and integrating their anticrime \n     technology systems, and in upgrading their forensic \n     laboratories and information and communications \n     infrastructures upon which these crime fighting systems rely; \n     and\n       (6) the Federal Government must continue efforts to \n     significantly reduce crime by maintaining Federal funding for \n     State and local law enforcement, and wisely targeting these \n     resources.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the amounts made available for fiscal year 2000 to \n     assist State and local law enforcement efforts should be \n     comparable to or greater than amounts made available for that \n     purpose for fiscal year 1999;\n       (2) the amounts made available for fiscal year 2000 for \n     crime technology programs should be used to further the \n     purposes of the program under section 102 of the Crime \n     Identification Technology Act of 1998 (42 U.S.C. 14601); and\n       (3) Congress should consider legislation that specifically \n     addresses the backlogs in State and local crime laboratories \n     and medical examiners' offices.\n\n     SEC. 349. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MERGER ENFORCEMENT BY \n                   DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice is \n     charged with the civil and criminal enforcement of the \n     antitrust laws, including review of corporate mergers likely \n     to reduce competition in particular markets, with a goal to \n     promote and protect the competitive process;\n       (2) the Antitrust Division requests a 16 percent increase \n     in funding for fiscal year 2000;\n       (3) justification for such an increase is based, in part, \n     on increasingly numerous and complex merger filings pursuant \n     to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976;\n       (4) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of \n     1976 sets value thresholds which trigger the requirement for \n     filing premerger notification;\n       (5) the number of merger filings under the Hart-Scott-\n     Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which the \n     Department, in conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission, \n     is required to review, increased by 38 percent in fiscal year \n     1998;\n       (6) the Department expects the number of merger filings to \n     increase in fiscal years 1999 and 2000;\n       (7) the value thresholds, which relate to both the size of \n     the companies involved and the size of the transaction, under \n     the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 have \n     not been adjusted since passage of that Act.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Antitrust Division needs adequate resources and that \n     the levels in this resolution assume the Division will have \n     such adequate resources, including necessary increases in \n     funding, notwithstanding any report language to the contrary, \n     to enable it to meet its statutory requirements, including \n     those related to reviewing and investigating increasingly \n     numerous and complex mergers, but that Congress should pursue \n     consideration of modest, budget neutral, adjustments to the \n     Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 to \n     account for inflation in the value thresholds of the Act, and \n     in so doing, ensure that the Antitrust Division's resources \n     are focused on matters and transactions most deserving of the \n     Division's attention.\n\n     SEC. 350. SENSE OF THE SENATE TO CREATE A TASK FORCE TO \n                   PURSUE THE CREATION OF A NATURAL DISASTER \n                   RESERVE FUND.\n\n       (a) It is the sense of the Senate that a task force be \n     created for the purpose of studying the possibility of \n     creating a reserve fund for natural disasters. The task force \n     should be composed of three Senators appointed by the \n     Majority Leader, and two Senators appointed by the Minority \n     Leader. The task force should also be composed of three \n     members appointed by the Speaker of the House, and two \n     members appointed by the Minority Leader in the House.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the task force make \n     a report to the appropriate committees in Congress within 90 \n     days of being convened. The report should be available for \n     the purposes of consideration during comprehensive overhaul \n     of budget procedures.\n\n     SEC. 351. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FEDERAL TAX RELIEF.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Congressional Budget Office has reported that \n     payroll taxes will exceed income taxes for 74 percent of all \n     taxpayers in 1999.\n       (2) The Federal Government will collect nearly \n     $50,000,000,000 in income taxes this year through its \n     practice of taxing the income Americans sacrifice to the \n     Government in the form of Social Security payroll taxes.\n       (3) American taxpayers are currently shouldering the \n     heaviest tax burden since 1944.\n       (4) According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the median \n     dual-income family sacrificed a record 37.6 percent of its \n     income to the Government in 1997.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that a significant portion of the tax \n     relief will be devoted to working families who are double-\n     taxed by--\n\n[[Page S4182]]\n\n       (1) providing taxpayers with an above-the-line income tax \n     deduction for the Social Security payroll taxes they pay so \n     that they no longer pay income taxes on such payroll taxes, \n     and/or\n       (2) gradually reducing the lowest marginal income tax rate \n     from 15 percent to 10 percent, and/or\n       (3) other tax reductions that do not reduce the tax revenue \n     devoted to the Social Security Trust Fund.\n\n     SEC. 352. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ELIMINATING THE MARRIAGE \n                   PENALTY AND ACROSS-THE-BOARD INCOME TAX RATE \n                   CUTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the institution of marriage is the cornerstone of the \n     family and civil society;\n       (2) strengthening of the marriage commitment and the family \n     is an indispensable step in the renewal of America's culture;\n       (3) the Federal income tax punishes marriage by imposing a \n     greater tax burden on married couples then on their single \n     counterparts;\n       (4) America's tax code should give each married couple the \n     choice to be treated as one economic unit, regardless of \n     which spouse earns the income; and\n       (5) all American taxpayers are responsible for any budget \n     surplus and deserve broad-based tax relief after the Social \n     Security Trust Fund has been protected.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that Congress \n     should eliminate the marriage penalty in a manner that treats \n     all married couples equally, regardless of which spouse earns \n     the income.\n\n     SEC. 353. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON IMPORTANCE OF FUNDING FOR \n                   EMBASSY SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Enhancing security at United States diplomatic missions \n     overseas is essential to protect United States Government \n     personnel serving on the front lines of our national defense;\n       (2) 80 percent of United States diplomatic missions do not \n     meet current security standards;\n       (3) the Accountability Review Boards on the Embassy \n     Bombings in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam recommended that the \n     Department of State spend $1,400,000,000 annually on embassy \n     security over each of the next 10 years;\n       (4) the amount of spending recommended for embassy security \n     by the Accountability Review Boards is approximately 36 \n     percent of the operating budget requested for the Department \n     of State in fiscal year 2000; and\n       (5) the funding requirements necessary to improve security \n     for United States diplomatic missions and personnel abroad \n     cannot be borne within the current budgetary resources of the \n     Department of State.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this budget resolution assume \n     that as the Congress contemplates changes in the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to reflect projected on-\n     budget surpluses, provisions similar to those set forth in \n     section 314(b) of that Act should be considered to ensure \n     adequate funding for enhancements to the security of United \n     States diplomatic missions.\n\n     SEC. 354. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR AFTER SCHOOL \n                   EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The demand for after school education is very high. In \n     fiscal year 1998 the Department of Education's after school \n     grant program was the most competitive in the Department's \n     history. Nearly 2,000 school districts applied for over \n     $540,000,000.\n       (2) After school programs help to fight juvenile crime. Law \n     enforcement statistics show that youth who are ages 12 \n     through 17 are most at risk of committing violent acts and \n     being victims of violent acts between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. \n     After school programs have been shown to reduce juvenile \n     crime, sometimes by up to 75 percent according to the \n     National Association of Police Athletic and Activity Leagues.\n       (3) After school programs can improve educational \n     achievement. They ensure children have safe and positive \n     learning environments in the after school hours. In the \n     Sacramento START after school program 75 percent of the \n     students showed an increase in their grades.\n       (4) After school programs have widespread support. Over 90 \n     percent of the American people support such programs. Over \n     450 of the Nation's leading police chiefs, sheriffs, and \n     prosecutors, along with presidents of the Fraternal Order of \n     Police, and the International Union of Police Associations \n     support government funding of after school programs. And many \n     of our Nation's governors endorse increasing the number of \n     after school programs through a Federal of State partnership.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that Congress will \n     provide $600,000,000 for the President's after school \n     initiative in fiscal year 2000.\n\n     SEC. 355. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING RECOVERY OF FUNDS BY \n                   THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TOBACCO-RELATED \n                   LITIGATION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Federal Tobacco Recovery and Medicare Prescription Drug \n     Benefit Resolution of 1999''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The President, in his January 19, 1999 State of the \n     Union address--\n       (A) announced that the Department of Justice would develop \n     a litigation plan for the Federal Government against the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (B) indicated that any funds recovered through such \n     litigation would be used to strengthen the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 \n     et seq.); and\n       (C) urged Congress to pass legislation to include a \n     prescription drug benefit in the medicare program.\n       (2) The traditional medicare program does not include most \n     outpatient prescription drugs as part of its benefit package.\n       (3) Prescription drugs are a central element in improving \n     quality of life and in routine health maintenance.\n       (4) Prescription drugs are a key component to early health \n     care intervention strategies for the elderly.\n       (5) Eighty percent of retired individuals take at least 1 \n     prescription drug every day.\n       (6) Individuals 65 years of age or older represent 12 \n     percent of the population of the United States but consume \n     more than \\1/3\\ of all prescription drugs consumed in the \n     United States.\n       (7) Exclusive of health care-related premiums, prescription \n     drugs account for almost \\1/3\\ of the health care costs and \n     expenditures of elderly individuals.\n       (8) Approximately 10 percent of all medicare beneficiaries \n     account for nearly 50 percent of all prescription drug \n     spending by the elderly.\n       (9) Research and development on new generations of \n     pharmaceuticals represent new opportunities for healthier, \n     longer lives for our Nation's elderly.\n       (10) Prescription drugs are among the key tools in every \n     health care professional's medical arsenal to help combat and \n     prevent the onset, recurrence, or debilitating effects of \n     illness and disease.\n       (11) While possible Federal litigation against tobacco \n     companies will take time to develop, Congress should continue \n     to work to address the immediate need among the elderly for \n     access to affordable prescription drugs.\n       (12) Treatment of tobacco-related illness is estimated to \n     cost the medicare program approximately $10,000,000,000 every \n     year.\n       (13) In 1998, 50 States reached a settlement with the \n     tobacco industry for tobacco-related illness in the amount of \n     $206,000,000,000.\n       (14) Recoveries from possible Federal tobacco-related \n     litigation, if successful, will likely be comparable to or \n     exceed the dollar amount recovered by the States under the \n     1998 settlement.\n       (15) In the event Federal tobacco-related litigation is \n     valid, undertaken and is successful, funds recovered under \n     such litigation should first be used for the purpose of \n     strengthening the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and \n     second to finance a medicare prescription drug benefit.\n       (16) The scope of any medicare prescription drug benefit \n     should be as comprehensive as possible, with drugs used in \n     fighting tobacco-related illnesses given a first priority.\n       (17) Most Americans want the medicare program to cover the \n     costs of prescription drugs.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that funds recovered under any tobacco-\n     related litigation commenced by the Federal Government should \n     be used first for the purpose of strengthening the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and second to fund a medicare \n     prescription drug benefit.\n\n     SEC. 356. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON OFFSETTING INAPPROPRIATE \n                   EMERGENCY SPENDING.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that--\n       (1) some emergency expenditures made at the end of the One \n     Hundred Fifth Congress for fiscal year 1999 were \n     inappropriately deemed as emergencies;\n       (2) Congress and the President should identify these \n     inappropriate expenditures and fully pay for these \n     expenditures during the fiscal year in which they will be \n     incurred; and\n       (3) Congress should only apply the emergency designation \n     for occurrences that meet the criteria set forth in the \n     Congressional Budget Act.\n\n     SEC. 357. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PRESIDENT'S \n                   FISCAL YEAR 2000 BUDGET PROPOSAL TO TAX \n                   ASSOCIATION INVESTMENT INCOME.\n\n       (a) The Congress finds that:\n       (1) The President's fiscal year 2000 Federal budget \n     proposal to impose a tax on the interest, dividends, capital \n     gains, rents, and royalties in excess of $10,000 of trade \n     associations and professional societies exempt under section \n     501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 represents an \n     unjust and unnecessary penalty on legitimate association \n     activities.\n       (2) At a time when the Government is projecting on-budget \n     surpluses of more than $800,000,000,000 over the next 10 \n     years, the President proposes to increase the tax burden on \n     trade and professional associations by $1,440,000,000 over \n     the next 5 years.\n       (3) The President's association tax increase proposal will \n     impose a tremendous burden on thousands of small and mid-\n     sized trade associations and professional societies.\n       (4) Under the President's association tax increase \n     proposal, most associations with annual operating budgets of \n     as low as $200,000 or more will be taxed on investment income \n     and as many as 70,000 associations nationwide could be \n     affected by this proposal.\n       (5) Associations rely on this targeted investment income to \n     carry out tax-exempt status related activities, such as \n     training individuals to adapt to the changing workplace, \n     improving industry safety, providing statistical data, and \n     providing community services.\n       (6) Keeping investment income free from tax encourages \n     associations to maintain modest surplus funds that cushion \n     against economic and fiscal downturns.\n       (7) Corporations can increase prices to cover increased \n     costs, while small and medium sized local, regional, and \n     State-based associations do not have such an option, and thus \n     increased costs imposed by the President's association tax \n     increase would reduce resources available for the important \n     standard setting, educational\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\n     training, and professionalism training performed by \n     associations.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the functional totals \n     in this concurrent resolution on the budget assume that \n     Congress shall reject the President's proposed tax increase \n     on investment income of associations as defined under section \n     501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n     SEC. 358. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR COUNTER-\n                   NARCOTICS INITIATIVES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) from 1985-1992, the Federal Government's drug control \n     budget was balanced among education, treatment, law \n     enforcement, and international supply reduction activities \n     and this resulted in a 13-percent reduction in total drug use \n     from 1988 to 1991;\n       (2) since 1992, overall drug use among teens aged 12 to 17 \n     rose by 70 percent, cocaine and marijuana use by high school \n     seniors rose 80 percent, and heroin use by high school \n     seniors rose 100 percent;\n       (3) during this same period, the Federal investment in \n     reducing the flow of drugs outside our borders declined both \n     in real dollars and as a proportion of the Federal drug \n     control budget;\n       (4) while the Federal Government works with State and local \n     governments and numerous private organizations to reduce the \n     demand for illegal drugs, seize drugs, and break down drug \n     trafficking organizations within our borders, only the \n     Federal Government can seize and destroy drugs outside of our \n     borders;\n       (5) in an effort to restore Federal international \n     eradication and interdiction efforts, in 1998, Congress \n     passed the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act which \n     authorized an additional $2,600,000,000 over 3 years for \n     international interdiction, eradication, and alternative \n     development activities;\n       (6) Congress appropriated over $800,000,000 in fiscal year \n     1999 for anti-drug activities authorized in the Western \n     Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act; and\n       (7) the proposed Drug Free Century Act would build upon \n     many of the initiatives authorized in the Western Hemisphere \n     Drug Elimination Act, including additional funding for the \n     Department of Defense for counter-drug intelligence and \n     related activities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) funding for Federal drug control activities should be \n     at a level higher than that proposed in the President's \n     budget request for fiscal year 2000; and\n       (2) funding for Federal drug control activities should \n     allow for investments in programs authorized in the Western \n     Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and in the proposed Drug Free \n     Century Act.\n\n     SEC. 359. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MODERNIZING AMERICA'S \n                   SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The General Accounting Office has performed a \n     comprehensive survey of the Nation's public elementary and \n     secondary school facilities and has found severe levels of \n     disrepair in all areas of the United States.\n       (2) The General Accounting Office has concluded that more \n     than 14,000,000 children attend schools in need of extensive \n     repair or replacement; 7,000,000 children attend schools with \n     life safety code violations; and 12,000,000 children attend \n     schools with leaky roofs.\n       (3) The General Accounting Office has found that the \n     problem of crumbling schools transcends demographic and \n     geographic boundaries. At 38 percent of urban schools, 30 \n     percent of rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools, \n     at least 1 building is in need of extensive repair or should \n     be completely replaced.\n       (4) The condition of school facilities has a direct effect \n     on the safety of students and teachers and on the ability of \n     students to learn. Academic research has provided a direct \n     correlation between the condition of school facilities and \n     student achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers \n     have found the test scores of students assigned to schools in \n     poor condition can be expected to fall 10.9 percentage points \n     below the test scores of students in buildings in excellent \n     condition. Similar studies have demonstrated up to a 20 \n     percent improvement in test scores when students were moved \n     from a poor facility to a new facility.\n       (5) The General Accounting Office has found most schools \n     are not prepared to incorporate modern technology in the \n     classroom. 46 percent of schools lack adequate electrical \n     wiring to support the full-scale use of technology. More than \n     a third of schools lack the requisite electrical power. 56 \n     percent of schools have insufficient phone lines for modems.\n       (6) The Department of Education has reported that \n     elementary and secondary school enrollment, already at a \n     record high level, will continue to grow over the next 10 \n     years, and that in order to accommodate this growth, the \n     United States will need to build an additional 6,000 schools.\n       (7) The General Accounting Office has determined that the \n     cost of bringing schools up to good, overall condition to be \n     $112,000,000,000, not including the cost of modernizing \n     schools to accommodate technology, or the cost of building \n     additional facilities needed to meet record enrollment \n     levels.\n       (8) Schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for \n     Native American children are also in dire need of repair and \n     renovation. The General Accounting Office has reported that \n     the cost of total inventory repairs needed for BIA facilities \n     is $754,000,000. The December 1997 report by the Comptroller \n     General of the United States states that, ``Compared with \n     other schools nationally, BIA schools are generally in poorer \n     physical condition, have more unsatisfactory environmental \n     factors, more often lack key facilities requirements for \n     education reform, and are less able to support computer and \n     communications technology.\n       (9) State and local financing mechanisms have proven \n     inadequate to meet the challenges facing today's aging school \n     facilities. Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n     difficulties securing financing for school facility \n     improvement.\n       (10) The Federal Government has provided resources for \n     school construction in the past. For example, between 1933 \n     and 1939, the Federal Government assisted in 70 percent of \n     all new school construction.\n       (11) The Federal Government can support elementary and \n     secondary school facilities without interfering in issues of \n     local control, and should help communities leverage \n     additional funds for the improvement of elementary and \n     secondary school facilities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this budget resolution assume \n     that Congress will enact measures to assist school districts \n     in modernizing their facilities, including--\n       (1) legislation to allow States and school districts to \n     issue at least $24,800,000,000 worth of zero-interest bonds \n     to rebuild and modernize our Nation's schools, and to provide \n     Federal income tax credits to the purchasers of those bonds \n     in lieu of interest payments; and\n       (2) appropriate funding for the Education Infrastructure \n     Act of 1994 during the period 2000 through 2004, which would \n     provide grants to local school districts for the repair, \n     renovation and construction of public school facilities.\n\n     SEC. 360. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR THE LAND \n                   AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) amounts in the land and water conservation fund finance \n     the primary Federal program for acquiring land for \n     conservation and recreation and for supporting State and \n     local efforts for conservation and recreation;\n       (2) Congress has appropriated only $10,000,000,000 out of \n     the more than $21,000,000,000 covered into the fund from \n     revenues payable to the United States under the Outer \n     Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.); and\n       (3) 38 Senators cosigned 2 letters to the Chairman and \n     Ranking Member of the Committee on the Budget urging that the \n     land and water conservation fund be fully funded.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that Congress should \n     appropriate $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 to provide \n     financial assistance to the States under section 6 of the \n     Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C 460l-\n     8), in addition to such amounts as are made available for \n     Federal land acquisition under that Act for fiscal year 2000.\n\n     SEC. 361. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SUPPORT FOR FEDERAL, \n                   STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FOR THE \n                   VIOLENT CRIME REDUCTION TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) our Federal, State and local law enforcement officers \n     provide essential services that preserve and protect our \n     freedom and safety, and with the support of Federal \n     assistance such as the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant \n     Program, the Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant \n     Program, the COPS Program, and the Byrne Grant Program, State \n     and local law enforcement officers have succeeded in reducing \n     the national scourge of violent crime, illustrated by a \n     violent crime rate that has dropped in each of the past four \n     years;\n       (2) assistance, such as the Violent Offender Incarceration/\n     Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants, provided to State \n     corrections systems to encourage truth in sentencing laws for \n     violent offenders has resulted in longer time served by \n     violent criminals and safer streets for law abiding people \n     across the Nation;\n       (3) through a comprehensive effort by State and local law \n     enforcement to attack violence against women, in concert with \n     the efforts of dedicated volunteers and professionals who \n     provide victim services, shelter, counseling and advocacy to \n     battered women and their children, important strides have \n     been made against the national scourge of violence against \n     women;\n       (4) despite recent gains, the violent crime rate remains \n     high by historical standards;\n       (5) Federal efforts to investigate and prosecute \n     international terrorism and complex interstate and \n     international crime are vital aspects of a national anticrime \n     strategy, and should be maintained;\n       (6) the recent gains by Federal, State and local law \n     enforcement in the fight against violent crime and violence \n     against women are fragile, and continued financial commitment \n     from the Federal Government for funding and financial \n     assistance is required to sustain and build upon these gains; \n     and\n       (7) the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund, enacted as a \n     part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of \n     1994, funds the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \n     of 1994, the Violence against Women Act of 1994, and the \n     Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, \n     without adding to the Federal budget deficit.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions and the functional totals underlying this \n     resolution assume that the Federal Government's commitment to \n     fund Federal law enforcement programs and programs to assist \n     State and local efforts to combat violent crime shall be \n     maintained, and that funding for the Violent Crime Reduction \n     Trust Fund shall continue to at least fiscal year 2005.\n\n     SEC. 362.

A bill to repeal the reduction in the deductible portion of \nexpenses for business meals and entertainment; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n REPEAL THE REDUCTION IN BUSINESS MEALS AND ENTERTAINMENT TAX DEDUCTION\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to repeal \nthe current fifty percent tax deduction for business meals and \nentertainment expenses, and to gradually restore the tax deduction to \n80 percent over a five-year period. Restoration of this deduction is \nessential to the livelihood of the food service, travel, tourism, and \nentertainment industries throughout the United States. These industries \nare being economically harmed as a result of the 50 percent tax \ndeduction.\n  The deduction for business meals and entertainment was reduced from \n80 percent to 50 percent under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1993, and went into effect on January 1, 1994. Many companies, small \nand large, have changed their policies and guidelines on travel and \nentertainment expenses as a result of this reduction. Additionally, \nbusinesses have been forced to curtail company reimbursement policies \nbecause of the reduction in business meals and entertainment expenses. \nIn some cases, businesses have even eliminated their expense accounts. \nConsequently, restaurants which previously relied heavily on business \nlunches and dinners are being adversely affected by the reduction in \nbusiness meals. For example:\n  Currently, there are 23.3 million business meal spenders in the U.S. \ndown from 25.3 million in 1989.\n  The total economic impact on small businesses of restoring the \nbusiness meal deductibility from 50 percent to 80 percent ranges from \n$8 to $690 million, depending on the state.\n  In Hawaii, the restaurant industry alone employs 47,400 people and \ngenerates $2 billion into the state's economy. An increase in the \nbusiness meal tax deduction from 50 percent to 80 percent would result \nin a 13 percent increase in business meal spending in the State of \nHawaii.\n  One issue of great importance to business travelers is the \ndeductibility of expenses, particularly the business meal expense.\n  Restauranteurs have reported lower business meal sales forcing some \nrestaurants to close during luncheon hours and lay off employees which \nin turn adversely affects those employed in agriculture, food \nprocessing, and any businesses related to the restaurant sector.\n  With sales equaling more than 4 percent of the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct, and more than 10.2 million persons employed in the industry, \nthe restaurant business is obviously very important to the economic \nfoundation of America. The 50 percent deduction has adversely affected \nthe restaurant and entertainment industry and resulted in detrimental \nfactors for the U.S. economy as a whole. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill text be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 874\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that will expand and improve Subchapter S of the Internal \nRevenue Code. I am joined in this effort by Senators Gramm, Bennett, \nShelby, Abraham, Hagel, Enzi, Mack, and Grams.\n  The Subchapter S provisions of the Internal Revenue Code reflect the \ndesire of Congress to eliminate the double tax burden on small business \ncorporations. Pursuant to that desire, Subchapter S has been \nliberalized a number of times, most recently in 1996. This legislation \ncontains several provisions that will make the Subchapter S election \nmore widely available to small businesses in all sectors. It also \ncontains several provisions of particular benefit to community banks \nthat may be contemplating a conversion to Subchapter S. Financial \ninstitutions were first made eligible for the Subchapter S election in \n1996. This legislation builds on and clarifies the Subchapter S \nprovisions applicable to financial institutions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nthe attached explanation of the provisions of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 875\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

By contrast, Subchapter C corporations pay \n     corporate income taxes on earnings, and shareholders pay \n     income taxes again on those same earnings when they pass \n     through as dividends. Subchapter S of the IRS Code was \n     enacted in 1958 to reduce the tax burden on small business. \n     The Subchapter S provisions have been liberalized a number of \n     times over the last two decades, significantly in 1982, and \n     again in 1996. This reflects a desire on the part of Congress \n     to reduce taxes on small business.\n       This S corporation legislation would benefit many small \n     businesses, but its provisions are particularly applicable to \n     banks. Congress made S corporation status available to small \n     banks for the first time in the 1996 ``Small Business Job \n     Protection Act'' but many banks are having trouble qualifying \n     under the current rules. The proposed legislation:\n       Permits S corporation shares to be held as Individual \n     Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and permits IRA shareholders to \n     purchase their shares from the IRA in order to facilitate a \n     Subchapter S election.\n       Clarifies that interest and dividends on investments \n     maintained by a bank for liquidity and safety and soundness \n     purposes shall not be ``passive'' income. This is necessary \n     because S corporations are restricted in the amount of \n     passive investment income they may generate.\n       Increases the number of S corporation eligible shareholders \n     from 75 to 150.\n       Provides that any stock that bank directors must hold under \n     banking regulations shall not be a disqualifying second class \n     of stock. This is necessary because S corporations are \n     permitted only one class of stock.\n       Permits banks to treat bad debt charge offs as items of \n     built in loss over the same number of years that the \n     accumulated bad debt reserve must be recaptured (four years) \n     for built in gains tax purposes. This provision is necessary \n     to properly match built in gains and losses relating to \n     accounting for bad debts. Banks that are converting to S \n     corporations must convert from the reserve method of \n     accounting to the specific charge off method and the \n     recapture of the accumulated bad debt reserve is built in \n     gain. Presently the presumption that a bad debt charge off is \n     a built in loss applies only to the first S corporation year.\n       Clarifies that the general 3 Year S corporation rule for \n     certain ``preference'' items applies to interest deductions \n     by S corporation banks, thereby providing equitable treatment \n     for S corporation banks. S corporations that convert from C \n     corporations are denied certain interest deductions \n     (preference items) for up to 3 years after the conversion, at \n     the end of three years the deductions are allowed.\n       Provides that non-health care related fringe benefits such \n     as group-term life insurance will be excludable from wages \n     for ``more-than-two-percent'' shareholders. Current law taxes \n     the fringe benefits of these shareholders. Health care \n     related benefits are not included because their deductibility \n     would increase the revenue impact of the legislation.\n       Permits Family Limited Partnerships to be shareholders in \n     Subchapter S corporations. Many family owned small businesses \n     are organized as Family Limited Partnerships or controlled by \n     Family Limited Partnerships for a variety of reasons. A \n     number of small banks have Family Limited Partnership \n     shareholders, and this legislation would for the first time \n     permit those partnerships to be S corporation shareholders.\n       Permits S corporations to issue preferred stock in addition \n     to common. Prohibited under current law which permits S \n     corporations to have only one class of stock. Because of \n     limitations on the number of common shareholders, banks need \n     to be able to issue preferred stock in order to have adequate \n     access to equity.\n       Reduces the required level of shareholder consent to \n     convert to an S corporation from unanimous to 90 percent of \n     shares. Non-consenting shareholders retain their stock, with \n     such stock treated as C corporation stock. The procedures for \n     consent are clarified in order to streamline the process.\n       Clarifies that Qualified Subchapter S Subsidiaries (QSSS) \n     provide information returns under their own tax id number. \n     This can help avoid confusion by depositors and other parties \n     over the insurance of deposits and the payer of salaries and \n     interest.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 876. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require \nthat the broadcast of violent video programming be limited to hours \nwhen children are not reasonably likely to comprise a substantial \nportion of the audience; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n           children's protection from violent programming act\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to offer legislation to help \nparents limit the amount of television violence coming into their \nhomes. We have reviewed this issue for decades and the analysis has not \nchanged. All of the assurances and promises have been insufficient to \nprotect our children from the dangerous influence of television \nviolence.\n\n[[Page S4188]]\n\n  The bill that I introduce today requires a safeharbor time period \nduring which broadcasters and basic cable programmers would not be \npermitted to transmit violent programming. The legislation directs the \nFederal Communications Commission to develop an appropriate safeharbor \ntime period to protect television audiences that are likely to be \ncomprised of a substantial number of children.\n  We can argue all day long about which study reaches what conclusion \nabout the impacts of television violence. But it defies common sense to \nbelieve that television violence does not impact our kids in some \nadverse way. Even the National Cable Television Association's own study \non television violence states that the ``evidence of the harmful \neffects associated with televised violence'' is ``firmly established.''\n  The recent events in Littleton, Colorado serve to highlight the sad \nand unfortunate fact that violence in our culture is begetting violence \nby our youths. violence is everywhere, it is readily accessible, and, \nto make matters worse, it is a source of corporate profits. A recent \nWashington Post article entitled, ``When Death Imitates Art,'' made \nthis very point. It states:\n\n       For young people, the culture at large is bathed in blood \n     and violence . . . where the more extreme the message, the \n     more over the top gruesomeness, the better. . . . Film, \n     television, music, dress, technology, games: They've become \n     one giant playground filled with accessible evil, darker than \n     ever before.\n\n  While we know we can't regulate every market and every technology, \nand don't want to, we also know that the purveyors of violence must be \nheld accountable in those instances when we can do so, consistent with \nour values and our Constitution. One way to do this is through \ntelevision programming.\n  This approach has already been successfully applied to television \nwith respect to indecent programming, for which a safeharbor has been \non the books since 1992--an approach that the D.C. Circuit has \nvalidated. I am confident that a similar result would be obtained if \nthe video programming industry or First Amendment advocates were to \nattack this legislation that I introduce today. Indeed, prior \nlegislative history also substantiates the constitutionality of my \napproach. In 1993, when I introduced my safeharbor legislation for the \nfirst time, the Commerce Committee held a hearing at which Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno and FCC Commissioner Reed Hundt both testified that \nthe bill was constitutional.\n  Now, I know that there will be opponents of this legislation who will \nstate that the ratings system is working, that the V-chip is being \ndeployed, and that our parents are being armed with the tools to \nprotect their children from television violence. I also know that some \nSenators wrote a letter in July 1997, suggesting that the government \nforbear from regulation TV violence. But I'm not convinced. We should \nnot forbear from protecting our children.\n  Besides, the ratings system is incomplete. For example, one major \nbroadcast network refuses to this day to use content ratings, and one \nmajor cable channel refuses to use any ratings at all. We all know what \nis going on here--money talks and violence sells. A recent article in \nUSA Today illustrates this point. Entitled ``TV Violence for Profit,'' \nthe article reports that some TV networks and basic cable channels \nincrease the amount of violent programming during ``sweeps--the key \nmonths when Nielson measures audience size in every market.''\n  Regardless, even if the industry is right that the V-Chip will \neventually be the magic solution, we all know that thousands, and \nperhaps millions of families, will be without a V-chip for years. The \nV-chip is not required by the FCC to be manufactured in all television \nuntil January 1, 2000. Will every parent go to Circuit City on New \nYear's day and buy a new TV with a V-chip? Of course not. The V-Chip is \nnot a complete solution. The only complete solution is a safeharbor.\n  To conclude, I want to stress that this is an issue about \naccountability and responsibility. Those responsible for supplying \nvideo programming have been granted a public trust through the \navailability of broadcast spectrum and FCC licenses to deliver their \nprogramming to America's children. They should be responsible in their \nprogramming choices. We know, however, that market forces may encourage \nthem to be irresponsible and transmit excessive violent programming. We \nin the Congress therefore have a responsibility to hold them \naccountable. This legislation does just that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 876\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United states of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Protection from \n     Violent Programming Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television influences the perception children have of \n     the values and behavior that are common and acceptable in \n     society.\n       (2) Broadcast television, cable television, and video \n     programming are--\n       (A) pervasive presences in the lives of all American \n     children; and\n       (B) readily accessible to all American children.\n       (3) Violent video programming influences children, as does \n     indecent programming.\n       (4) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming at a young age have a higher \n     tendency to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later \n     in life than those children not so exposed.\n       (5) Children exposed to violent video programming are prone \n     to assume that acts of violence are acceptable behavior and \n     therefore to imitate such behavior.\n       (6) Children exposed to violent video programming have an \n     increased fear of becoming a victim of violence, resulting in \n     increased self-protective behaviors, resulting in increased \n     self-protective behaviors and increased mistrust of others.\n       (7) There is a compelling governmental interest in limiting \n     the negative influences of violent video programming on \n     children.\n       (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n     channeling programming with violent content to periods of the \n     day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial \n     portion of the television audience.\n       (9) Because some programming that is readily accessible to \n     minors remains unrated and therefore cannot be blocked solely \n     on the basis of its violent content, restricting the hours \n     when violent video programming is shown is the least \n     restrictive and most narrowly tailored means to achieve a \n     compelling governmental interest.\n       (10) Warning labels about the violent content of video \n     programming will not in themselves prevent children from \n     watching violent video programming.\n       (11) Although many programs are now subject to both age-\n     based and content-based ratings, some broadcast and non-\n     premium cable programs remain unrated with respect to the \n     content of their programming.\n       (12) Technology-based solutions may be helpful in \n     protecting some children, but may not be effective in \n     achieving the compelling governmental interest in protecting \n     all children from violent programming when parents are only \n     able to block programming that has in fact been rated for \n     violence.\n       (13) Technology-based solutions will not be installed in \n     all newly manufactured televisions until January 1, 2000.\n       (14) Even though technology-based solutions will be readily \n     available, many consumers of video programming will not \n     actually own such technology for several years and therefore \n     will be unable to take advantage of content based ratings to \n     prevent their children from watching violent programming.\n       (15) In light of the fact that some programming remains \n     unrated for content, and given that many consumers will not \n     have blocking technology in the near future, the channeling \n     of violent programming is the least restrictive means to \n     limit the exposure of children to the harmful influences of \n     violent programming.\n       (16) Restricting the hours when violent programming can be \n     shown protects the interests of children whose parents are \n     unavailable, are unable to supervise their children's viewing \n     behavior, do not have the benefit of technology-based \n     solutions, are unable to afford the costs of technology-based \n     solution, or are unable to determine the content of those \n     shows that are only subject to age-based ratings.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNLAWFUL DISTRIBUTION OF VIOLENT VIDEO PROGRAMMING.\n\n       Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 701 \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 715.

A bill to encourage the provision of advanced service, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n            BROADBAND INTERNET REGULATORY RELIEF ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Broadband \nInternet Regulatory Relief Act of 1999 on behalf of myself, Senator \nNickles, and Senator Craig. This bill is intended to speed up the \ndeployment of broadband networks throughout the United States and to \nmake residential high-speed Internet access a widely-available service.\n  Mr. President, the Internet has revolutionized the way we \ncommunicate, conduct business, shop, and learn. The Internet presents \nus with the opportunity to remove distance as an obstacle to employment \nand education. But while tens of millions of Americans now log onto the \nInternet every day, narrowband connections to the Internet make using \nthe Net a slow and cumbersome process.\n  Broadband connections, on the other hand, provide ultra-fast access \nto the Internet. With a broadband connection, users may download and \nupload data from and to the Internet at substantially greater speeds \nthan with a narrowband connection. From downloading full-motion video \nto uploading an architect's plans, broadband permits consumers to \nutilize many more applications that will increase the value of the \nInternet as a communications medium.\n  The technology to provide broadband connections to the Internet is a \nreality. Cable companies are deploying hybrid fiber-coax (HFC) networks \nthat will enable cable modems to provide high-speed Internet access. In \naddition, telephone companies have discovered a way to provide high-\nspeed Internet access over their copper-based telephone loops. With the \naddition of a digital switch in a telephone company's central office, a \ndigital modem at a customer's premises, and the conditioning of a \ncopper loop, consumers may obtain access to the Internet at more than \nten time the speed of narrowband connections.\n  The most promising technology employed by telephone companies for \nresidential high-speed Internet access is digital subscriber line (DSL) \ntechnology. The family of DSL services, especially asymmetric digital \nsubscriber line (ADSL) service, have the greatest potential to ensure \nthat all consumers throughout the United States obtain high-speed \nInternet access. Cable service has penetration rates approaching \ntelephone service in urban and densely-populated suburban areas. \nHowever, cable penetration is much lower in rural areas whereas the \nubiquity of the telephone network makes telephone penetration rates \nclose to one hundred percent even in rural areas. Thus, for many rural \nconsumers, including those in Kansas, high-speed Internet access may \nonly be available in the next several years through the telephone \nnetwork.\n  As a result, Congress needs to ensure that high-speed Internet access \nis being made available over the public telephone network as rapidly as \npossible. While ADSL service is being rolled out in may urban and \ndensely-populated suburban areas, most rural consumers do not have \naccess to it.\n  I am introducing the Broadband Internet Regulatory Relief Act to \nensure that high-speed Internet access is available to my rural \nconstituents as soon as possible. To accomplish this goal, I am \nproposing to provide regulatory relief to telephone companies willing \nto deliver broadband connections to rural areas. My proposal has \nseveral components.\n  First, incumbent local exchange carriers that make seventy percent of \ntheir loops ready to support high-speed Internet access will not have \nto resell their advanced services to competitors and will not have to \nmake the network elements used exclusively for the provision of \nadvanced services available to competitors. Second, the prices for \nadvanced services offered by incumbent local exchange carriers that \nface competition in the provision of such services will be deregulated. \nThird, where incumbent local exchange carriers are offering advanced \nservices but do not face competition, the companies will receive \npricing flexibility. Fourth, competitive local exchange carriers will \nnot be required to resell their advanced services.\n  Mr. President, the ubiquity of our nation's telephone network \npresents us with a tremendous opportunity to deliver high-speed \nInternet access to our rural constituents at a pace comparable with the \nrate at which urban and suburban consumers will be offered such \nservice. But to realize this goal, we must remove unnecessary \nregulation that has impeded the rapid deployment of broadband networks. \nAdvanced services should not be regulated in the same manner as basic \ntelephone service. Broadband services are an entirely new market, one \nin which no company can exercise market power.\n  In the absence of market power, the incumbents should not have to \nresell their advanced services or provide competitors with access to \nunbundled advanced service elements. And pricing regulations applied to \ntelephone service should not be applied to advanced services. In \naddition, a competitive local exchange carrier willing to deploy the \nfacilities necessary to provide broadband services should not be forced \nto resell its service.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that we can ensure the rapid deployment \nof broadband networks to rural areas. But to do so, we must be willing \nto provide companies with an incentive to build out their broadband \nnetworks in rural areas. The Broadband Internet Regulatory Relief Act \nwould provide companies with such incentives, and I hope that my \ncolleagues will support this crucial legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Graham, \n        Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Feinstein, \n        and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 878. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \npermit grants for the national estuary program to be used for the \ndevelopment and implementation of a comprehensive conservation and \nmanagement plan, to reauthorize appropriations to carry out the \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n               national estuary conservation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senators Mack, Gregg, Graham, \nMoynihan, Kerry, Boxer, Reed, Feinstein, Murray, and I are introducing \nthe National Estuary Conservation Act of 1999. I rise to draw this \ncountry's attention to our nationally significant estuaries that are \nthreatened by pollution, development, or\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\noveruse. With forty five percent of the nation's population residing in \nestuarine areas, there is a compelling need for us to promote \ncomprehensive planning and management efforts to restore and protect \nthem.\n  Estuaries are significant habitat for fish, birds, and other wildlife \nbecause they provide safe spawning grounds and nurseries. Seventy five \npercent of the U.S. commercial fish catch depends on estuaries during \nsome stage of their life. Commercial and recreational fisheries \ncontribute $111 billion to the nation's economy and support 1.5 million \njobs. Estuaries are also important to our nation's tourist economy for \nboating and outdoor recreation. Coastal tourism in just four states--\nNew Jersey, Florida, Texas, and California--totals $75 billion.\n  Due to their popularity, the overall capacity of our nation's \nestuaries to function as healthy productive ecosystems is declining. \nThis is a result of the cumulative effects of increasing development \nand fast growing year round populations which increase dramatically in \nthe summer. Land development, and associated activities that come with \npeople's desire to live and play near these beautiful resources, cause \nrunoff and storm water discharges that contribute to siltation, \nincreased nutrients, and other contamination. Bacterial contamination \ncloses many popular beaches and shellfish harvesting areas in \nestuaries. Also, several estuaries are afflicted by problems that still \nrequire significant research. Examples include the outbreaks of the \ntoxic microbe, Pfiesteria piscicida, in rivers draining to estuaries in \nMaryland and Virginia.\n  Congress recognized the importance of preserving and enhancing \ncoastal environments with the establishment of the National Estuary \nProgram in the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1987. The Program's \npurpose is of facilitate state and local governments preparation of \ncomprehensive conservation and management plans for threatened \nestuaries of national significance. In support of this effort, section \n320 of the Clean Water Act authorized the EPA to make grants to states \nto develop environmental management plans. To date, 28 estuaries across \nthe country have been designated into the Program. However, the law \nfails to provide assistance once plans are complete and ready for \nimplementation. Already, 18 of the 28 plans are finished.\n  As the majority of plans are now in the implementation stage, it is \nincumbent upon us to maintain the partnership the Federal Government \ninitiated ten years ago to insure that our nationally significant \nestuaries are protected. The legislation we are introducing will take \nthe next step by giving EPA authority to make grants for plan \nimplementation and authorize annual appropriations in the amount of $50 \nmillion. To insure the program is a true partnership and leverage \nscarce resources, there is a direct match requirement for grant \nrecipients so funds will be available to upgrade sewage treatment \nplants, fix combined sewer overflows, control urban stormwater \ndischarges, and reduce polluted runoff into estuarine areas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Robb, and \n        Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 879. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na shorter recovery period for the depreciation of certain leasehold \nimprovements; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              ten-year leasehold improvement depreciation\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleagues Mr. \nNickles, Mr. Mack, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Baucus, to introduce important \nlegislation to provide for a 10-year depreciation life for leasehold \nimprovements. Leasehold improvements are the alterations to leased \nspace made by a building owner as part of the lease agreement with a \ntenant.\n  These improvements can include interior walls, partitions, flooring, \nlighting, wiring and plumbing--essentially any fixture that an owner \nprovides in space leased to a tenant. They keep a building modern, \nupgraded, and energy efficient. In actual commercial use, leasehold \nimprovements typically last as long as the lease--an average of 5 to 10 \nyears. However, the Internal Revenue Code requires leasehold \nimprovements to be depreciated over 39 years--the life of the building.\n  Economically, this makes no sense. The owner receives taxable income \nover the life of the lease (i.e., 10 years), yet can only recover the \ncosts of the improvements associated with the lease over 39 years--a \nrate nearly four times slower. This wild mismatch of income and \nexpenses causes the owner to incur an artificially high tax cost on \nthese improvements.\n  The bill we introduce today will correct this irrational and \nuneconomic tax treatment by shortening the cost recovery period for \ncertain leasehold improvements from 39 years to a more realistic 10 \nyears. If enacted, this legislation would more closely align the \nexpenses incurred to construct these improvements with the income they \ngenerate during the lease term.\n  For example, a building owner who makes a $100,000 leasehold \nimprovement for a 10-year, $1 million lease would be able to recover \nthis entire investment by the end of that lease at a rate of $10,000 \nper year. Under current law, this $100,000 improvement is recovered at \na rate of $2,564 per year over 39 years.\n  By reducing this cost recovery period, the expense of making these \nimprovements would fall more into line with the economics of a \ncommercial lease transaction, and more property owners would be able to \nadapt their buildings to fit the demanding needs of today's modern \nbusiness tenant. Small business should find this bill particularly \nhelpful, because small businesses turn over their rental space more \nfrequently than larger businesses. And we cannot forget that over 80 \npercent of building owners who provide space to small businesses are \nthemselves small businesses.\n  We have an interest in keeping existing buildings commercially \nviable. When older buildings can serve tenants who need modern, \nefficient commercial space, there is less pressure for developing \ngreenfields in outlying areas. Americans are concerned about preserving \nopen space, natural resources and a sense of neighborhood. The current \nlaw 39-year cost recovery for leasehold improvements is an impediment \nto reinvesting in existing properties and communities.\n  This legislation has the strong backing of six major real estate \norganizations, including the National Realty Committee, the national \nAssociation of Realtors, the International Council of Shopping Centers, \nthe national Association of Industrial and Office Properties, the \nnational Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, and the Building \nand Office Managers Association, International.\n  I urge all Senators to join us in supporting this legislation to \nprovide rational depreciation treatment for leasehold improvements.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 879\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 84\n\n       Whereas alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD) is \n     the most common lethal single gene defect in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas A1AD, having been identified only since 1963, is as \n     common as cystic fibrosis, but is neither well known, nor \n     well understood by many physicians and is virtually unknown \n     by the general public;\n       Whereas A1AD is seen as a liver disease in infants and \n     young children, as a lung or liver disease in young adults, \n     and may be misdiagnosed as asthma, chronic bronchitis or \n     smoker's emphysema due to lack of knowledge or understanding \n     about this disease;\n       Whereas A1AD is particularly devastating to families since \n     it strikes during the peak earning and child rearing years;\n       Whereas 80,000 to 100,000 persons in the United States are \n     affected by the disease while only 5 percent have been \n     identified; and\n       Whereas liver and lung transplants are sought by many \n     individuals suffering from A1AD, detection screenings, \n     educational conferences and other scheduled events will help \n     raise awareness for early identification and organ donation: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of May 1999 as ``National \n     Alpha1 Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     month with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President I rise today to submit a resolution to raise \nnational awareness of Alpha 1-antitrypsin definiency. I am so pleased \nto be joined by 15 of my colleagues. Our resolution officially declares \nMay 1999 as ``National Alpha 1 Awareness Month.''\n  Alpha-1 is a genetic condition that can cause severe early onset \nemphysema, liver disease in both children and adults, or more rarely, a \nskin condition called panniculitis. In infants, Alpha-1 causes neonatal \ncirrhosis of the liver, which is sometimes fatal. In adults, Alpha-1 \ncan lead to pulmonary emphysema and or cirrhosis of the liver. This \ndisease normally strikes young adults in their 30s and 40s.\n  Alpha-1 was first identified in 1963 and is the most common lethal \nsingle gene defect in the United States. It is as common as cystic \nfibrosis but it is neither well known, nor well understood by many \nphysicians, and is virtually unknown to the American public.\n  An estimated 5,000 people have been diagnosed with Alpha 1-\nantitrypsin deficiency in the United States and statistical estimates \nindicate that there should be 80,000 to 100,000 people total in this \ncountry. In fact, one in 37 people are Alpha-1 carriers of this genetic \ndefect. A simple blood test can detect Alpha-1 antitrypsin levels and \nlet people know if they are carriers or have this genetic defect. In \nfact, in 1998, the Maine chapter of the Alpha-1 National Association \nSupport Group screened 105 people for the genetic defect and found 15 \ncarriers.\n  Alpha-one antitrypsin deficiency can be a devastating disease. \nSymptoms of Alpha-1 are similar to those of other respiratory diseases, \nand often Alpha-1 emphysema is accompanied by asthma, bronchitis, and \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most common indicators of \nAlpha-1 include worsening shortness of breath, a chronic cough and \nabnormal liver test results.\n  The good news is that many Alphas can stay healthy into old age, \nespecially if they never smoke, avoid pollution, lung irritants, and do \nnot suffer from frequent lung infections. The bad news is that there \nare many Alphas who are misdiagnosed for years, and this misdiagnosis \ncan cause additional irreversible lung damage.\n  By declaring May, 1999 as ``National Alpha 1 Awareness Month'' we \nhope bring the problem of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency to the \nattention to the Senate. I urge my colleagues who have not yet joined \nus on this important issue to add their name to the public call for \nincreased national awareness of this genetic condition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/26/senate-section/article/S4192-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4192-S4193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 85--SUPPORTING THE EFFORTS OF THE PEOPLE OF INDONESIA \n             IN ACHIEVING A TRANSITION TO GENUINE DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Reed, Mr. Helms, Mr. \nWellstone, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 85\n\n       Whereas Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous \n     country, has the world's largest Muslim population, and has \n     developed friendly relations with the United States;\n       Whereas a stable and democratic Indonesia is important to \n     overall security in Southeast Asia;\n       Whereas President Suharto resigned on May 21, 1998, in \n     accordance with Indonesia's constitutional processes;\n       Whereas incidents of ethnic and religious violence have \n     become more prevalent in the months following President \n     Suharto's resignation and threaten to undermine Indonesia's \n     delicate political balance;\n       Whereas President Habibie has indicated his willingness to \n     consider granting independence to East Timor, if the people \n     of East Timor reject a plan for greater autonomy within \n     Indonesia;\n       Whereas Indonesia is pursuing a transition to genuine \n     democracy, establishing a new governmental structure, and \n     developing a new political order;\n       Whereas President Habibie signed several bills governing \n     elections, political parties, and the structure of \n     legislative bodies into law on February 1, 1999; and\n       Whereas free, fair, and transparent elections to the House \n     of Representatives of Indonesia (DPR), now scheduled for June \n     7, 1999, will help the people of Indonesia continue their \n     democratic transition: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the Indonesian people in their efforts to \n     carry out the provisions of the new election laws and hold \n     democratic elections as scheduled;\n       (2) calls upon the Government of Indonesia to take all \n     steps necessary to ensure that the elections scheduled for \n     June 7, 1999, are free, fair, and transparent;\n       (3) urges all political, military, and ethnic leaders to \n     refrain from all violence and work toward a peaceful \n     political campaign period;\n       (4) calls upon all Indonesian leaders, political party \n     members, military personnel, and the general public to \n     respect and uphold the results of all elections held in a \n     free and fair manner;\n       (5) urges all candidates for political office to address \n     the ethnic and religious tensions in Indonesia that have \n     surfaced since President Suharto's resignation and \n     incorporate possible solutions into their election platforms; \n     and\n       (6) calls upon the Government of Indonesia and all \n     prospective officeholders to work with the people of East \n     Timor to achieve an equitable and realistic solution to the \n     question of East Timor's future political status.\n\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today together with Senators \nThomas, Reed, Helms, Wellstone, Coverdell, and Kerry, to submit a \nresolution on Indonesia's upcoming Parliamentary elections. These are \nboth exciting and troubling times in Indonesia. The elections scheduled \nfor June 7th could be the beginning of a new, democratic Indonesia. At \nthe same time, though, we receive almost daily reports of increased \nsocial unrest and a bleak economic future.\n  While inflation and interest rates have fallen, the Indonesian \neconomy remains unstable. Recent clashes between Muslims and Christians \nin Ambon remind us that Indonesia's ethnic tensions could overwhelm the \ncountry at any minute. The status of East Timor is an ongoing issue for \nthe people of Indonesia, although President Habibie has vowed to come \nto resolution by the end of the year. Depending upon the outcome of the \nvote on autonomy, the Parliament elected in June could have a direct \ninfluence on East Timor's future.\n  The upcoming June elections are a critical benchmark for Indonesia's \nefforts to pursue democratic reform. A freely elected Parliament will \nfurther distance Indonesia from its past and help instill a democratic \nculture. If these elections are proven to be free, fair and \ntransparent, Indonesia will be well on its way to having a government \nwith popular legitimacy.\n  I applaud the Administration's efforts to ensure that the elections \non June 7th are open and transparent. U.S. support for a fair election \nprocess will send a strong message to the participants. The pledge of \n$30 million to help Indonesia realize its goal of free and fair \nelections demonstrates an understanding of how important June 7th is, \nnot only in Indonesia, but in Southeast Asia as a whole. While \nIndonesia's new election laws provide for monitors at the national, \nprovincial and district levels, we must ensure that monitors are \nproperly trained and educated. We must move quickly to maximize the \ninterim period before the elections and encourage other nations to \nactively support our efforts to promote a free and fair process.\n  Producing transparent and legitimate election results is a \nresponsibility that cannot be overlooked. However, we must look forward \nat the same time. The economic and social problems Indonesia is \ncurrently facing will be with the country past the election, and they \nneed continued attention from this Congress and the Administration. The \ncountry's future will be uncertain if the pressing issues of today are \nignored.\n  For this reason, I have introduced a resolution that supports \nIndonesia's efforts to hold free and fair elections.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Protection from \n     Violent Programming Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television influences the perception children have of \n     the values and behavior that are common and acceptable in \n     society.\n       (2) Broadcast television, cable television, and video \n     programming are--\n       (A) pervasive presences in the lives of all American \n     children; and\n       (B) readily accessible to all American children.\n       (3) Violent video programming influences children, as does \n     indecent programming.\n       (4) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming at a young age have a higher \n     tendency to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later \n     in life than those children not so exposed.\n       (5) Children exposed to violent video programming are prone \n     to assume that acts of violence are acceptable behavior and \n     therefore to imitate such behavior.\n       (6) Children exposed to violent video programming have an \n     increased fear of becoming a victim of violence, resulting in \n     increased self-protective behaviors and increased mistrust of \n     others.\n       (7) There is a compelling governmental interest in limiting \n     the negative influences of violent video programming on \n     children.\n       (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n     channeling programming with violent content to periods of the \n     day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial \n     portion of the television audience.\n       (9) Because some programming that is readily accessible to \n     minors remains unrated and therefore cannot be blocked solely \n     on the basis of its violent contents restricting the hours \n     when violent video programming is shown is the least \n     restrictive and most narrowly tailored means to achieve a \n     compelling governmental interest.\n       (10) Warning labels about the violent content of video \n     programming will not in themselves prevent children from \n     watching violent video programming.\n       (11) Although many programs are now subject to both age-\n     based and content-based ratings, some broadcast and non-\n     premium cable programs remain unrated with respect to the \n     content of their programming.\n       (12) Technology-based solutions may be helpful in \n     protecting some children, but may not be effective in \n     achieving the compelling governmental interest in protecting \n     all children from violent programming when parents are only \n     able to block programming that has in fact been rated for \n     violence.\n       (13) Technology-based solutions will not be installed in \n     all newly manufactured televisions until January 1, 2000.\n       (14) Even though technology-based solutions will be readily \n     available, many consumers of video programming will not \n     actually own such technology for several years and therefore \n     will be unable to take advantage of content based ratings to \n     prevent their children from watching violent programming.\n       (15) In light of the fact that some programming remains \n     unrated for content, and given that many consumers will not \n     have blocking technology in the near future, the channeling \n     of violent programming is the least restrictive means to \n     limit the exposure of children to the harmful influences of \n     violent programming.\n       (16) Restricting the hours when violent programming can be \n     shown protects the interests of children whose parents are \n     unavailable, are unable to supervise their children's viewing \n     behavior, do not have the benefit of technology-based \n     solutions, are unable to afford the costs of technology-based \n     solution, or are unable to determine the content of those \n     shows that are only subject to age-based ratings.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Greater \nPontiac Community Coalition for its ten year anniversary of their Youth \nIn Government and Business program.\n  The Greater Pontiac Community Coalition was founded by Reverend \nDouglas P. Jones, Pastor of the Welcome Missionary Baptist Church in \nPontiac, Michigan, who serves as President of the Greater Pontiac \nCommunity Coalition.\n  The program has promoted educational excellence among middle and high \nschool students, with over 3,500 youth participating in this fine \nprogram.\n  This year students were taught about government, law enforcement, \neducation and business through hands-on visits with state and local \nofficials representing each of those segments of the community. \nValuable experiences are garnered through the Youth in Government and \nBusiness, inspiring many to carry the torch of community leadership \ninto the future.\n  Building on his past successes, Reverend Jones now plans to engage \nthe program at the elementary school level, and his program is also \nbeing duplicated in other communities in Metropolitan Detroit. This is \na testament to the success faith-based and community-based efforts can \nhave in making a difference for our youth.\n  I want to express my congratulations to Pastor Jones and wish him and \nall graduates continued success. Most importantly, I would like to \nthank him for his commitment to the youth in our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/26/senate-section/article/S4210-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PRIVATE BRYAN J.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nmy dear friend Gil Clark. I have admired and respected Gil as a friend \nand coach for many, many years. My thoughts and prayers go out to him \nand his family today, as Gil continues a brave fight against liver \ncancer.\n  Gil and I go way back. I met Gil in the 1950's, when he was my little \nleague baseball coach in Louisville. Gil began coaching with the \nBeechmont Youth Program at its inception in 1955, and served faithfully \nas president of the program for more than 35 years.\n  Gil always taught our little league team that the most important \nthing about sports was that you practice hard and play your best, not \nnecessarily that you win. He loved baseball without qualification, and \nall of us on the team could tell. His enthusiasm for the game was \ninfectious, and his desire to teach us lessons about life through \nsports was inspiring. Gil wanted our team of aspiring players to \nunderstand that in life, you're not always going to win--but you should \nalways perform to the very best of your ability. Gil certainly made a \nlasting impression on my life, and I'm sure that in his many years as a \ncoach he has positively influenced the lives of numerous other young \npeople as well.\n  Gil committed himself to teaching and coaching young people at \nBeechmont, and worked on the administration of the Louisville/Jefferson \nCounty Metro Parks service for many years. Gil practiced what he \npreached to those around him, and showed runners year after year that \nperseverance and spirit could get the job done.\n  In 1974, Gil was asked by Louisville's mayor to take on the challenge \nof directing the ``Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon.'' Gil \norganized many races during his tenure with Metro Parks, but he \nespecially enjoyed putting on the miniMarathon each year. Gil took the \nmayor's challenge seriously, built the race to its present glory, and \nis now known in Kentucky as the ``father of the miniMarathon.''\n  Gil, thank you for working with me and coaching me as a young little \nleaguer at Beechmont, and thank you for your dedication to so many \nother young people throughout the years. I am certain that your service \nto the Louisville/Jefferson County community is appreciated by all, and \nI am amazed at your continued commitment to others even in your time of \nillness. May God continue to bless you, and give you strength in your \nvaliant fight.\n  Mr. President, please include a copy of a Louisville Courier-Journal \narticle from Sunday, April 25, 1999 recognizing Gil Clark's \naccomplishments.\n\n[[Page S4211]]\n\n               [From the Courier-Journal, Apr. 25, 1999]\n\n                     There's Always Been Gil Clark\n\n                             (By Jim Adams)\n\n       Gil Clark stood on a slope beside Iroquois Park at 7:59:50 \n     a.m. yesterday (runners never round off their minutes) and \n     beheld what he had built: A wide river of 6,500 runners was \n     standing in place, looking up at him.\n       ``Ten,'' he said into the microphone.\n       ``Nine,'' he said, firm of voice.\n       ``Eight,'' he said. He waived a starting pistol above the \n     pith helmet he was wearing, the trademark headpiece some \n     might think is stitched to his scalp.\n       This moment could last no more than 10 seconds, of course, \n     but it was a sight that caused the hearts of some of \n     Louisville's serious road runners to soar yesterday at the \n     start of the 26th Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon.\n       That's because the 78-year-old Clark--director of the 13.1-\n     mile race since its inauguration on a Monday morning in \n     1974--was diagnosed with liver cancer last fall. Just a month \n     ago, he lay unconscious in a hospital for five days; at \n     death's door.\n       A stream of runners appeared at his bedside last month to \n     say their personal farewells to the man who almost everyone \n     acknowledges has done more than anyone else for road racing \n     in Louisville.\n       He didn't invent the pre-Derby race--a politician did \n     that--but Clark took it, built it, shaped it and nurtured it, \n     and so a lot of people call him the father of the \n     miniMarathon. The way the runners talk about him, he actually \n     seems more like its favorite uncle.\n       ``He's the one that made running in Louisville,'' said Jack \n     La Plante, who has run in more than 20 miniMarathons and who \n     stopped to grin for a picture with Clark yesterday morning. \n     ``He put the city on the map, as far as runners go,'' La \n     Plante said right before running the race gain.\n       ``He's it,'' said Stan Clark, long one of the leading \n     runners in the miniMarathon, who is not related to Gil Clark. \n     At last month's City Run, Gil Clark's absence was a huge \n     hole, Stan Clark said. ``He's always present; he's always \n     there. There's always been Gil Clark.\n       Mary Anne Lyons, the leading female runner in the \n     miniMarathon in recent years, tells this story: An \n     acquaintance told her that years ago, she had set the \n     miniMarathon as a personal goal and had trained long for it, \n     but then ran into an unyielding schedule conflict on race \n     day--a sister's wedding, Lyons thought it was.\n       Grasping at straws, the woman--unsure why--called Clark to \n     explain her dilemma. Ever sympathetic, Clark listened, then \n     told the woman to go out and run the route on her own and \n     record her time, Lyons said--and that woman told her that her \n     name appeared on a listing of race finishers that year.\n       The story captures the essence of what runners clearly feel \n     about Clark. ``He's for the middle and the back of the \n     pack,'' said Kathy Priddy, Clark's assistant for 18 years \n     when he was Metro Parks' manager for recreation services. \n     He's been an advocate of what's fair and decent.\n       His view is at the very core of the miniMarathon itself, a \n     race open to everyone, where neighbors run against neighbors, \n     co-workers against co-workers.\n       The miniMarathon has always known it could be flashier and \n     draw a different type of runner if it wanted to, but Clark \n     has never thought much of those impulses. ``I don't want to \n     be director of a race that gives away money,'' he said in a \n     telephone interview Friday. ``If we can't do it for the fun \n     of it, for the fitness of it, and for the camaraderie, then I \n     would want it to die.\n       Clark was an unlikely road-race god on Feb. 4. 1974, when \n     he was hired for the park job at age 53 after a career in \n     sales. No one in his family has ever raced. Clark himself has \n     always been a baseball man; he played in high school in \n     Alton, Ill., and spent decades running the youth baseball \n     league in Louisville's Beechmont neighborhood.\n       But within two days, he was transformed from baseball man \n     to running man. ``On the sixth day of February, the mayor \n     (Harvey Sloane) came to see me and told me we were going to \n     have a mini. I think he called it a half-marathon,'' Clark \n     said. ``I'll give them an audience,'' Clark said Sloane \n     declared--and indeed the finish, then at the Riverfront Plaza \n     and Belvedere, was generously attended by City Hall workers \n     liberated for the occasion.\n       It was, Clark said, the first road race of its kind in \n     Kentucky.\n       Businesses soon griped about work-day traffic tie-ups when \n     the first miniMarathons were run on Mondays; the religious \n     community wasn't happy when Sunday was considered as an \n     alternative. So Saturday got the miniMarathon by default.\n       Today, Clark said, he believes Louisville has the only park \n     department in the nation that oversees 20 or more races in a \n     year--``for the good of the public,'' he added. ``We have \n     developed a lot of fine races in Louisville, Kentucky, and \n     I'm proud of that,'' he said.\n       Priddy, Clark's assistant, said he actually retired and \n     moved to Florida in 1997 with his wife Lorene, Whom he always \n     called ``Mom.'' But she died in March of that same year, just \n     days after the move, and Clark canceled his retirement and \n     came back to the city where he'd lived since 1948. \n     ``Louisville was his life,'' Priddy said. ``He would have had \n     nothing in Florida.''\n       Back in Louisville, he also continued to be involved with \n     the mini, although the Derby Festival had by then taken over \n     official management of the race.\n       And he also had the unending appreciation of the running \n     community--a community that seems to doubt it would even \n     exist were it not for him. Runner Lyons, for example, who is \n     30, believes that if Metro Park's running program had not \n     been built, she might not be running today. Running in that \n     case would have required travel, she said, and she very well \n     might not have done it.\n       Clark worked with the program he loved until late last \n     year. He said he did well after surgery for his liver cancer, \n     but early this year, ``for some reason I can't explain, it \n     all went berserk.''\n       One of his two sons, Marvin Clark, said yesterday that in \n     late March, it truly appeared that his father would die. \n     Doctors held out little hope, then no hope, and prayers were \n     said for a peaceful exit.\n       Then, Gil Clark began moving--first a leg, then he opened \n     an eye, and soon he spoke. Marvin and his father both said a \n     doctor wrote on his chart these two words: ``Devine \n     intervention.''\n       ``God's got something else for me to do, I guess,'' Clark \n     said Friday. ``I might see another Vencor (the road race that \n     precedes the miniMarathon), but if He lets me live to \n     tomorrow night, I will be most grateful.''\n       Aside from whatever God has in mind for Clark, the Derby \n     Festival had some ideas, too. Yesterday, it wanted him to \n     fire the starting pistol for he mini-Marathon.\n       Friends Tandy Patrick and Jim Woosley, a Louisville police \n     officer, picked Clark up at his son's home in eastern \n     Jefferson County in Patrick's Camaro convertible--with the \n     top down and the heater on.\n       Clark wore a white-and-purple jogging suite and his \n     multicolored pith helmet--he doesn't remember who gave the \n     helmet to him, and by now it's been through so many races it \n     appears entirely held together by duct tape and paint. He was \n     bundled in a blanket and scarf in the front seat of the \n     Camaro. But this was the way he wanted it, so he could wave \n     at the runners.\n       To travel the 25 feet from the Camaro to the starter's \n     stage, Clark used a wheelchair, but stood strong when Mayor \n     Dave Armstrong gave him a glass plaque, the Derby Festival's \n     Lifetime Achievement Award.\n       And then the countdown to another race began.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/26/senate-section/article/S4211-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 27, 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
