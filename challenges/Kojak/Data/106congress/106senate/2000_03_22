Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes of debate equally divided for closing remarks.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it has been agreed that I will begin \nthese brief remarks in order that our chairman might conclude the \ndebate and proceed to the vote which I think has every prospect of \nbeing prodigious in its majority.\n  We have heard the compelling arguments to eliminate the so-called \nearnings penalty for persons 65 years and older. There is a short-term \ncost that is followed by a long-term payback, if you like, such that in \na 20- to 30-year period the Social Security trust funds will not in any \nway be affected. The present practice is to decrease benefits to \npersons who continue working after their technical retirement age is \nreached, and then to compensate them after they reach age 70 or stop \nworking. It is a complicated calculation. It is a cause of much \ndistress, if you like, within the Social Security Administration--about \n$100 million a year just in sorting out the claims. It is not \nunderstood. There is the elemental fact that, although at 65 if you \ncontinue to work you know you will get back your benefits, that is in \nactuarial terms. For the cohort of several million persons, it will all \nbe evened out. You may not be. So why not get rid of this archaic \ncomplexity? It is a remnant of Depression legislation of the 1930s.\n  In that regard, however, we do have the question attending the long-\nterm deficit of the Social Security system. Yesterday our friend from \nArizona, Senator McCain, spoke eloquently\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\nabout that matter, having raised it during his primary campaign on his \nside of the aisle. Senator Kerrey spoke with equal eloquence. Senator \nMcCain was kind enough to note legislation that Senator Kerrey and I \nhave introduced in this matter.\n  In very short order, I would simply like to recapitulate the four \nsimple steps which put Social Security on an actuarially sound basis \nfor the next 75 years. They are:\n  No. 1, provide for an accurate cost-of-living adjustment. In 1996, \nthe Boskin Commission originally estimated that the CPI overstates \nchanges in the cost-of-living by 1.1 percentage points; now they say it \nis 0.8 of a percentage point.\n  No. 2, normal taxation of benefits.\n  No. 3, extend coverage to all newly hired State and local workers.\n  I might interject, if ever there was a holdover from the 1930s, it \nwas this. It was not clear at that time whether the Federal Government \ncould tax a State entity, so they were left untaxed. A great many \nworkers in civil service positions pay no taxes on their principal \njobs, but qualify for benefits from ``side'' jobs, and it is just not \nfair. We are not taking away anything, but just covering newly hired \nworkers like everyone else.\n  No. 4, increase the length of the computation period from 35 to 38 \nyears.\n  We now have a 75-year, long-term actuarial deficit of 2.07 percent. \nThis would bring that down by 2.05 percent, leaving an inconsequential \n.02 percent over the 75-year period.\n  These are data based on actuarial calculations and they are clearly \nwithin our capacity. Let us hope one day we do it before it becomes too \nlate. That time will come sooner than you may think.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the table be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            ELIMINATING SOCIAL SECURITY'S LONG-TERM DEFICIT\n\n            [Numbers expressed as a percent of payroll] \\1\\\n\nLong-term (75 year) actuarial deficit..............................2.07\n                                                               ========\n\nReduction in deficit due to:\n  0.8 percentage point cost of living correction..................-1.16\n  Normal taxation of benefits..................................\\2\\-0.43\n  Extend coverage to all newly hired State and local workers...\\3\\-0.21\n  Increase length of computation period from 35 to 38 years.......-0.25\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n      Total reduction in deficit..................................-2.05\n\n\\1\\ Estimates are based on the intermediate assumptions of the 1999 \nTrustees Report and ignore interactions among the provisions.\n\\2\\ Social Security benefits would be treated like income from a \nprivate pension so that benefits that are attributed to employer \ncontributions and interest earnings would be subject taxed, while \nbenefits attributed to employee contributions would not be taxed. \nCurrently, benefits are taxed only if income exceeds certain thresholds \nand, depending on some complex formula, only up to 50 or up to 85 \npercent of the benefit is subject to taxation.\n\\3\\ This is the rule that applied to newly hired Federal workers in \n1984 and thereafter.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I look forward to the statement of our \nrevered chairman, who is going to have a historic triumph this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first let me thank and congratulate my \ndistinguished colleague, the senior Senator from New York, for his \nleadership throughout the years on this most important domestic \nprogram, Social Security. There is no program of greater importance and \ninterest to the American people than Social Security. The distinguished \nSenator, Mr. Moynihan, as I said, throughout his career has played a \ncritical role in the development, the preserving, and the strengthening \nof this important program. I thank him and congratulate him.\n  As Senator Moynihan pointed out, the Senate is now turning to the \nvote to repeal the Social Security earnings limit, an important step in \npreparing Social Security for the 21st century. This repeal is good for \nseniors, it is good for America, and it is good government. As we have \nheard, the Social Security earnings limit was enacted 65 years ago to \nencourage older persons to retire during the Great Depression. But \ntoday, with Americans living longer, and the tightest labor market in \n30 years, this rule is not only outdated, but it harms both our senior \ncitizens and the economy.\n  Repealing the earnings limit will help improve the retirement \nsecurity of seniors by giving them the choice to work longer and to \nsave more. Abolishing the earnings limit will allow us to protect the \nNation's economic gains of the past 17 years by encouraging our \nNation's most experienced workers to continue working, not only for \ntoday but into the future.\n  Finally, repealing the earnings limit is just plain good government. \nIt will save the Social Security Administration money and reduce very \ncommon, frustrating mistakes in calculating benefits. So let me say, I \nurge each Senator to support this bill.\n  I am happy to yield the remaining time to the distinguished assistant \nleader of the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues, Senator Roth \nand Senator Moynihan because they work so well together.\n  Today, we are going to pass something that will have a positive \nimpact on millions of Americans. I say millions--some people say there \nare only 800,000 people who are currently paying the Social Security \nearnings penalty. There are millions of people who want to work, maybe \nhave to work, but basically their taxes are so punitive that they \ncannot work; it does not make sense to work. Their taxes are so high \nthey have to work more for government than they work for themselves.\n  These are senior citizens, not particularly wealthy people. You can \nbe a senior citizen and have, as an individual, an earned income of \n$30,000. You are in the 28-percent tax bracket. Because of the earnings \npenalty on Social Security, that is an additional 33-percent tax \nbracket. Add those two together and you are at 61 percent. You have to \npay Social Security tax. If you are self-employed, you add 15 percent \nto that. That is 76 percent, and you have not even paid taxes to the \nState. For most States, that is 6 or 7 percent.\n\n  You can have a marginal tax rate of 80 percent; you work four times \nmore for the Government than you do for yourself. That is way too high. \nThis 33-percent penalty for seniors between the ages of 65 and 70 who \nwant to have earned income--maybe need to have earned income--is long \npast overdue for repeal.\n  I am delighted that today we are going to fulfill what the House has \ndone. I compliment Chairman Archer in the House. I compliment Chairman \nRoth and Senator Moynihan. I remember Senator McCain speaking on this \nissue for years. I remember Senator Ashcroft making tireless speeches, \nsaying we need to repeal the earnings penalty.\n  Over the years, we have raised the amount people can save before the \npenalty takes effect, but the penalty still takes effect for any income \nabove $17,000. The real solution is to repeal it. That is what we are \ngoing to do today. We are going to open up economic opportunity for \nmillions of Americans who are at age 65 and maybe do not want to \nretire. They might be a Strom Thurmond; they who may have another 50 \nyears of very energetic hard work ahead of them and they don't want to \nsay they want to retire. We should not force them to retire.\n  The earnings penalty forces many of these people to retire--some of \nour most productive citizens in America. I think it is wrong. This tax \npenalty is wrong. We are going to repeal it today. We are repealing it \nwith bipartisan support. It is going to become the law of the land.\n  Again, I compliment our leader for proving we can get some good \nthings done that will have a positive impact on millions--frankly, on \nall of us, because a lot of us want to work beyond the age of 65. Now \nwe are telling seniors they can do so.\n  Again, my congratulations to the leaders for making this happen. I \nthink this will make Social Security policy better and, frankly, it \nwill make economic policy better for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and urge my colleagues to vote yes \non this bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the \nSenior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. The passage of this legislation \nis long overdue. The Social Security earnings test is bad for our \neconomy and bad for individual senior Americans who wish to\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\ncontinue in the workforce. I am extremely pleased that the Senate is \nmoving to eliminate the earnings test.\n  I am hopeful, however, that passage of this bill will not mark the \nend of thoughtful policy regarding the role of seniors in the American \nworkforce. Senior workers are an invaluable resource for our nation. As \nthe number of Americans of retirement age increases, the economy's need \nfor senior workers will inevitably increase as well. We should \nencourage those seniors who wish to continue working by making certain \nthat they are treated fairly by tax and retirement laws.\n  Too often, government policy toward retirees has assumed that all \nseniors have the same needs, goals, and desires. Mr. President, each \nindividual is different. Many seniors look forward to a leisurely \nretirement that allows them to pursue activities for which they did not \nhave time when they were working. American seniors have earned this \noption, and trends over the last several decades that demonstrate the \naverage senior is enjoying a healthier and more prosperous retirement \nare extremely encouraging.\n  But other senior Americans wish to delay retirement for as long as \npossible. Many seniors who have communicated with me about this subject \nsimply enjoy the stimulation that a workplace provides on a daily \nbasis. Others are not ready to leave businesses or farms that they have \nspent their entire lives building. Still others wish to continue to \ncontribute to the income of their families, children, or grandchildren. \nRegardless of their reasons for wanting to stay in the workplace, no \nsenior should find that government policy is a disincentive or barrier \nto work.\n  In addition to ensuring basic fairness to individuals, providing \nfurther incentives to senior workers makes good sense for our economy. \nSeniors who stay in the workforce continue to pay taxes on their \nearnings and continue to provide much-needed experience to the American \neconomy. As our economy grows and the baby-boom generation approaches \nretirement age, we may experience more frequent labor shortages. \nUltimately, a declining number of qualified workers could be \ndetrimental to the economy. Adding incentives that reward older \nAmericans for staying in the workforce could help alleviate such \nshortages while continuing to improve our economy and standard of \nliving.\n  Last month, with the support of Senators Breaux and Gregg, I \nintroduced two pieces of legislation that would encourage American \nseniors to stay in the workforce. These bills, entitled the Retired \nAmericans Right of Employment Acts (RARE I and RARE II), are based on \nthe premise that many seniors want to work and their labor is \ninvaluable to our economy and society. Both bills would repeal the \nearnings test, as we are seeking to do today. But they would go further \nby implementing specific tax and benefit changes that would reward \nseniors who choose to work.\n\n  Among other provisions, both bills would phase in a formula allowing \nincome earned after the retirement age to be counted in the calculation \nof an individual's Social Security benefits. Currently, Social Security \nbenefits for most people are based on the average of the top 35 earning \nyears prior to age 62. Allowing income earned after age 62 to be \nincluded in benefit calculations would increase the benefits of those \nseniors who choose to continue working.\n  The two bills offer alternative methods to reduce the taxes of \nworking seniors. RARE I would cut the FICA tax of seniors by 10 percent \nwhen they reach full retirement age. As a result, retirees would see \ntheir FICA tax reduced from 7.65 percent of their paycheck to 6.885 \npercent. Because taxes are levied on the first dollar of wages earned, \nthis tax reduction would benefit all income levels of retirees, \nincluding those who choose to work part-time.\n  RARE II would provide individuals who have reached the full \nretirement age with a tax credit equal to 10 percent of the lesser of \nthe amount of income tax owed or the earned income of the individual. \nThis provision would effectively reward older Americans who continue to \nearn and to pay taxes after reaching retirement age.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to reiterate my strong support for \nthe underlying bill being discussed today. The elimination of the \nSocial Security earnings test would be a huge step toward ending the \ndisincentives for seniors to work if they choose. But I hope this is \nonly a first step in adjusting policy governing seniors in the \nworkplace. Other changes contained in the RARE bills, which I have \ndescribed, as well as the repeal of the Clinton Administration's 1993 \ntax on Social Security benefits, would reaffirm the importance of \nseniors in our society. The health of our economy and even our national \nstrength will increasingly depend on retaining the services of \nproductive seniors. We should begin constructing these policies now.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the time is right to repeal the Social \nSecurity earnings test. I ask my colleagues to join with me today in \nsupport of the passage of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work \nAct of 1999.\n  We all know that reaching retirement age does not necessarily mean a \nperson is ready to retire. It is good news that Americans are now \nliving longer and healthier lives, and I believe that the Social \nSecurity system should not penalize those who want to work longer. I \nunderstand that many older workers choose to remain in the workforce \nbecause they need additional income or have no desire to stop working. \nI fully support this choice, and I believe that no one should face \nfinancial penalties for that personal decision.\n  In South Dakota this year, 2000 people have seen their Social \nSecurity benefits reduced because they chose to continue working when \nthey reached the age of 65. All told, Social Security withheld about $8 \nmillion in Social Security payments last year from those South \nDakotans. That works out to a loss of about $4000 in Social Security \nbenefits for each of those 2000 South Dakotans. That is not right. \nLet's not penalize them for staying in the work force to achieve a \nbetter standard of living. I know many Americans over 65 in my state \nwho could use that money to pay for health insurance, prescription \ndrugs, and electric bills.\n  H.R. 5 will not only help these 2000 workers who are not receiving \ntheir Social Security benefits, but also encourage those who want to \nwork, but are not doing so now because they fear the earnings limit \nwould consume most or all of their earned benefits. As baby boomers \nbegin to retire, it is especially important that these older Americans \nwho want to work be encouraged to do so. Our nation is celebrating \nrecord low unemployment. Let us seize this opportunity to recognize the \nskills, knowledge, and experience that people over 65 have to offer. I \nam pleased that Congress is on the verge of removing the earnings limit \nto encourage citizens in my state and across the country to continue \nmaking an important contribution to the American economy.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to build on the momentum created \nby this bipartisan bill to work toward Social Security reform. We can \npass legislation this year that will extend the solvency of Social \nSecurity for 50 years by using the interest savings earned by paying \ndown the debt. We should take that simple step this year on a \nbipartisan basis, just as we are passing this bill today.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support HR 5, the Senior \nCitizens' Freedom to Work Act. This very important legislation would \nhelp millions of American seniors who choose to, or must work after \nretirement.\n  Under current law, the Social Security benefits of those seniors ages \n65 though 69 who continue to work will be reduced by $1 for each $3 of \nearnings over $17,000. In other words, they will be taxed at 33.3 \npercent of their earnings above the threshold.\n  However, the onerous tax burden on our seniors does not stop there. \nThese seniors are also subject to a 15.3 percent payroll tax, and a 15 \npercent income tax. Combined with the earnings test, these seniors are \npaying taxes of over 60 percent on their earnings from working. If \ntheir earnings bump up their income, their Social Security benefits are \nthen taxed. The tax bite could take 68 to 91 percent of their \nadditional earnings.\n  Mr. President, this is absurd. We must correct this unfair tax burden \non our seniors.\n  When Social Security was set up 65 years ago during the Great \nDepression,\n\n[[Page S1536]]\n\njobs were scarce, workers were younger and many could not find work to \nsupport their families. One of the intentions of the Social Security \nprogram was to encourage older workers to retire, so that younger \nworkers could find a job.\n  Today, our situation is dramatically different. The economic and \ndemographic conditions in the U.S. are not what they were when Social \nSecurity was established. Our strong economy has created a tight labor \nmarket. After filling over 20 million new jobs during this economic \nexpansion, we still have a job shortage, particularly skilled workers. \nIt is projected that this shortage will continue for the next 5 to 10 \nyears.\n  Lower birth rates and a longer life expectancy mean that the number \nand relative size of the older population is growing rapidly. The \nnumber of Americans over age 65 has grown from 8 percent in 1950 to 14 \npercent in 1990 and is projected to reach 22 percent in 2030.\n  This demographic change has triggered a serious Social Security \ncrisis. In 1940 there were 100 workers to support 1 retiree. Today that \nratio has dropped to 3 workers supporting 1 retiree. In less than 20 \nyears, that ratio will decrease to 2 to 1. As a result, we have a $20 \ntrillion unfunded Social Security liability.\n  The earnings test penalty has worsened this situation. It discourages \nseniors from working, even though their skills are much needed in the \nlabor market. If allowed to work without penalty, they will continue to \npay payroll taxes into the Social Security system which will help us \nwork toward solvency of the system.\n  Another important reason we must get rid of the earnings test is that \nSocial Security is a very poor investment for Americans. Americans pay \na significant amount of payroll taxes through their working life but \nface low and declining returns from Social Security, and some receive \nless in benefits than they have paid in payroll taxes. Their Social \nSecurity benefits cannot even begin to meet their pre-retirement \nstandard of living. Many seniors have no choice but to continue to \nwork--and others want to work for the joy of it.\n  Over the past 15 years, goods purchased mainly by seniors increased 6 \npercentage points more than goods purchased by the general public. \nTheir medical costs skyrocketed 156 percent.\n  As inflation on medical and pharmaceutical goods continues to rise, \nolder Americans' hard-earned Social Security benefits are worth less \nand less. Their purchasing power will continue to diminish.\n  I believe the earnings test on Social Security benefits is wrong and \nunfair because Social Security benefits are earned benefits for many \nsenior citizens. The Social Security benefits which working seniors are \nlosing due to the earnings test penalty are benefits they have \nrightfully earned by contributing to the system throughout their \nworking years before retiring. These are benefits they should not be \nlosing just because they are trying to survive by supplementing their \nSocial Security income. Reducing Social Security benefits upon \nadditional earnings is just double taxation.\n\n  As health care and other costs continue to grow, the incomes of more \nand more senior citizens are falling along with their standard of \nliving. This earnings test hurts seniors who choose, or must work after \nretirement to maintain their standard of living or to pay for costly \nhealth insurance premiums, medical care, prescriptions and many other \nexpenses which increase in retirement years. This is particularly true \nfor seniors with lower-incomes who must work and depend on their earned \nincome for survival.\n  Mr. President, we cannot let this practice continue.\n  Eliminating the earnings test on Social Security benefits would \nreverse this trend, and help responsible senior citizens. The federal \ngovernment has entered into a sacred covenant with the American people \nto provide retirement benefits once contribution commitments are made. \nIt is the government's contractual duty to honor that commitment. The \ngovernment cannot and should not take money from seniors that is \nrightfully theirs.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to briefly discuss the health of our Social \nSecurity system. Social Security benefits will exceed payroll taxes by \n2014 or soon.\n  President Clinton claims he is saving Social Security by using the \ninterest savings that will result from paying down the government debt \nheld by the public. However, his proposal does not push back the date \nthat Social Security will run a deficit by a single year, and the \ntransfer from the general fund to Social Security does not cover a \nfraction of the shortfall.\n  Mr. President, without reform, the unfunded liability of Social \nSecurity will crowd out all of our discretionary spending. It will \ncreate financial hardship for millions of baby boomers and impose a \nheavy burden on future generations. We must address this vitally \nimportant issue as quickly as we can.\n  I believe the best way to fix Social Security is to move it from the \ncurrent pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded one, and the immediate \nstep we should take is to lock in every penny of the Social Security \nsurplus safe from government spending, and put it toward Americans' \nretirement. My lockbox would sequester spending if re-estimates result \nin spending any of our Social Security surplus.\n  In addition, we need to tell Americans the whole truth about Social \nSecurity since payroll taxes are the largest tax that many families \nwill ever pay, accounting for up to one-eighth of the total lifetime \nincome they will make.\n  That's why I also support the Gregg amendment which would require the \ngovernment to provide information on the financial status of the \nprogram. This amendment is along the same line of my legislation, S. \n1104, the Social Security Information Act. Reliable information on \nSocial Security is crucial to enable Americans to better understand the \nvalue of their Social Security investment and to help them determine \nexactly how much they should supplement their expected Social Security \nbenefits with other savings in order to have a certain level of \nretirement security.\n  Mr. President, let me close by saying it is critical that we repeal \nthe earnings test penalty. We owe our seniors nothing less than to \nremove this senseless provision and give them the opportunity to \nsustain and hopefully improve their standard of living by allowing them \nto work without additional tax penalties. It is equally important that, \nby continuing to pay into the Social Security system, our seniors will \nactually give us more time to reform it--which ultimately benefits \neveryone.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is taking action \non the H.R. 5, the Senior Citizen's Freedom to Work Act of 2000. This \nlegislation eliminates the earnings test for Social Security recipients \nbetween the full retirement age (currently 65) and age 69. The measure \nwill be retroactive to January 1, 2000.\n  I have long supported changing the Social Security earnings test, \nwhich the amount of income recipients may earn before their benefits \nare reduced. Under current law, recipients aged 65 through 69 can earn \nup to $17,000 per year without penalty. But beyond that, benefits are \nreduced by $1 for each $3 of earnings. This year, approximately 800,000 \nseniors will lose benefits. Repealing the earnings test will allow \nolder Americans who have skills and expertise to continue working and \nmaking a contribution to society and to our economy.\n  I am concerned about the Social Security earnings test and realize \nthe difficulties that many older Americans experience because of it. \nFor many seniors, working beyond the age of 65 is necessary just to \nmake ends meet. Changing the earnings limit will allow them to earn \nextra income without losing hard-earned Social Security benefits. They \nhave spent a lifetime working for these benefits and they should get \nthem, whether they choose to continue to work or not.\n  I have supported past legislation to raise the earnings test limit. \nToday, I fully support this legislation to eliminate the earnings test \nfor all individuals who have reached full retirement age.\n  This bill is especially important to North Dakota because we have one \nof the highest rates of seniors receiving Social Security benefits.\n  I am also pleased because this bill is fiscally responsible. In the \nlong term, it will not have any financial impact on our Social Security \ntrust fund.\n\n[[Page S1537]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today is a particularly important day for \nAmerican seniors. With a unanimous vote, the Senate passed H.R. 5, the \nSenior Citizens' Freedom To Work Act which will abolish a Depression-\nera Social Security restriction that lowers benefits paid to seniors \nages 65 to 69 who earn more than a specified amount each year. Earlier \nthis month the House passed H.R. 5 by a vote of 422 to 0. As a proud \ncosponsor of the Senate version of this bill, I am elated that Congress \nmoved swiftly to pass this long overdue legislation.\n  Presently, the Social Security earnings test reduces benefits $1 for \nevery $3 over earnings of $17,000 for retirees age 65 to 69. Due to the \ncap on earnings, older Americans, many of whom live on fixed, modest-\nincomes, are burdened with a 33.3 percent tax on their earned income. \nWhen this is combined with Federal, State, local and other Social \nSecurity taxes, it amounts to an atrocious 55-65 percent tax or even \nhigher. Such a policy defies the principals of self-reliance and \npersonal responsibility on which America was founded. Seniors who have \nsubstantial outside income from investments have never had a similar \ntax penalty to pay.\n  By eliminating the retirement earnings test, older Americans can now \ndecide whether and how much they want to work without a reduction in \ntheir current Social Security benefits.\n  An estimated 800,000 Americans lost all or part of their Social \nSecurity benefits in 1999 because they were employed and earned more \nthan the limit. Even a part-time job can put someone over the earnings \nlimit. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the elimination of \nthe earnings test will affect approximately 1,153,000 retirees and \nauxiliary retirees nationwide, including 3,462 seniors throughout South \nDakota.\n  I believe older Americans ages 65 through 69 should be able to work \nand supplement their Social Security without a benefit reduction, just \nas other beneficiaries can supplement, without restriction, their \nSocial Security with pensions and unearned income.\n  At a time when labor shortages loom on the horizon and people are \nliving longer, we should encourage, not penalize, older workers.\n  Faced with serious health care expenses, escalating prescription drug \nprices, long term care needs, and other expenses in caring for a spouse \nor other family members, older Americans are choosing to stay in the \njob market longer. By eliminating the earnings test today we have just \nimproved the personal and financial well-being of thousands of seniors \nthroughout South Dakota and our nation.\n  I am very pleased that President Clinton is supportive of the \nlegislation and has indicated that he will sign the bill into law \nimmediately.\n  Today marks a strong vote for older Americans. Seniors are one of our \nnation's most valuable resources and we should honor and respect them \nby providing the means necessary to live long, fulfilling lives without \nworrying about whether or not they can afford to pay their rent, \nheating bill, and other necessities. As we move forward with the 106th \nCongress, I look forward to working with my fellow colleagues to \nimplement further programs and a strong legislative agenda which \nstrengthens crucial programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and \nestablishes prescription drug coverage, nursing home reforms, new \nefforts on long-term care, tools to fight crimes against seniors, new \nplans to secure retirements and protect pensions, and other initiatives \nthat meet the needs of our growing population of seniors.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for too many years I have worked in \nsupport of repealing the unfair Annual Earnings Test on Social \nSecurity. Incredibly, working seniors currently forfeit one dollar of \nSocial Security benefits for every $3 they earn over the earnings limit \nof $17,000.\n  If an American spends a lifetime paying into the Social Security \nsystem with the guarantee that he or she will get their money when he \nor she turns 62 or 65 years old, no one should be able to take those \nbenefits away simply because the beneficiary wants to keep working. Why \nshould the federal government be discouraging those seniors who want to \nkeep on working from doing so? As our country faces increasing demands \nfor labor, we can ill afford to deprive ourselves of the skills and \nexperience America's seniors have to offer. The federal government \nshouldn't be in the position of discouraging anyone from working: \nseniors should be allowed to make their own decisions.\n  Over the past few weeks, I have listened to and read the comments of \nnumerous Washington state seniors who lose a portion of their hard-\nearned Social Security benefits simply because they do not wish to \nretire or stop working. I have been listening to these same comments \nfor many years, and I can honestly say that today it looks as if common \nsense will finally prevail and a solution will pass the House and the \nSenate. Importantly, President Clinton recently changed his position on \nthis issue and now says he will sign this legislation to abolish the \nEarnings Test.\n  I will cast my vote for abolishing this unfair tax. Repeal of the \nSocial Security Earnings Test is a victory for seniors and every \ngeneration of Americans.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues today--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike--in voting to repeal the Social \nsecurity earnings test. For 75 years now, Congress has kept a provision \nin the Social Security program that hurts our seniors who continue to \nwork. The Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act is a sensible measure. It \nwill correct an injustice in our Social Security program, infuse our \ntight labor market with experienced workers, and most importantly, help \nhundreds of thousands of seniors become more financially secure.\n  Currently, retirees drawing Social Security benefits are subject to \nan earnings test. This means that for seniors ages 65 to 69, benefits \nare deferred by $1 for every $3 that their earnings exceed $17,000. In \nmy state, nearly 2,500 seniors are hurt by the Social Security earnings \ntest. According to the Social Security Administration, the average \namount of benefits lost per recipient in 1995 was $3,596. My state \nbenefits from the contributions of these employees, substantively and \neconomically; yet these individuals are being penalized for their \nefforts.\n  It is now time for Congress to bring the Social Security program into \na new era. Retiring the earnings test, not our seniors, is a first \nstep.\n  In 1935, when the Social Security program was established, the United \nStates had a crowded labor field. The earnings test was designed to \nencourage seniors to leave the work force to open their jobs to younger \npeople. But today the rationale for the test has faded. It's about time \nwe replaced this antiquated provision.\n  Indeed, no one today would seriously consider structuring the program \nto discourage older workers. Our unemployment rate is at an historic \nlow. And our country is enjoying unprecedented economic prosperity. \nSeniors bring years of experience to the work force--knowledge and \njudgment that cannot be obtained from a textbook, but only from first-\nhand experience. Employers today are seeking skilled, dependable, and \nhonest employees. Many older Americans would be willing to fill this \nneed if they were not faced with decreased Social Security benefits. \nThe government should not tell people who want to work that they \ncannot, but this is exactly the message the earnings test sends to many \nseniors. This message is discriminatory and fundamentally wrong.\n  Moreover, at a time when we are experiencing such phenomenal economic \ngrowth, many of our senior citizens are struggling to pay for everyday \nneeds. This measure will help them. I have heard from hundreds of \nseniors from North Carolina who are struggling to pay their medical \nbills and daily living costs. By now, they have been working and paying \nSocial Security taxes for decades. These same seniors are the ones who \nstart to lose benefits because they continue to work, simply because \nthey earn a salary that the government believes is too high for them.\n  It must be said that this legislation is a patch to one problem in \nthe Social Security system that is currently riddled with holes. If \nCongress does not start considering overall Social Security reform, we \nwill eventually have a hole too big to fix. It is my hope that\n\n[[Page S1538]]\n\nthe current momentum to fix small holes in the system will lead to a \nlarger dialogue on how to save the Social Security program.\n  But until then, the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act is a win-win \nmeasure. It lets seniors earn a higher salary without retribution. It \nkeeps skilled employees in the workplace. It helps maintain a strong \neconomy. It helps our seniors to afford today's cost of living. And \nfinally, it's the right thing to do.\n  This bill has a lot of benefits, and it costs the government nothing. \nI look forward to its quick passage in the Senate and to the positive \neffects that it will have for our country.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in my State of Michigan, we currently \nhave less than a 3 percent rate of unemployment.\n  We used to think that just the people entering and leaving the job \nmarket, as well as those switching jobs, would keep unemployment to a \nminimum of 5 percent.\n  But our economy is exceptionally strong, and the demand for labor is \nthrough the roof. In fact, some companies in Michigan have threatened \nto leave the State because they can't find enough people to work.\n  Yet throughout the United States, we encourage our seniors between \nthe ages of 65 and 69 to not work because of the earnings test on their \nSocial Security benefits.\n  At the very time that we need experienced workers in the labor \nmarket, the government makes it uneconomical for our most experienced \nworkers to stay in the work force.\n  Under the current earnings test, Social Security beneficiaries under \nthe age of 65 lose $1 of social Security benefits for every $2 they \nearn over $10,000 per year.\n  And those under 70 lose $1 for every $3 earned over $17,000 of annual \nincome.\n  Not until they reach 70 years of age are seniors free to work again \non their own terms.\n  Seniors are being penalized by double taxation--and in this case, \nsimply for working.\n  I find it incredible that we force our seniors to forego over $3.9 \nbillion a year in Social Security benefits simply because they make \nmore than $10,800 if they are under 65 and $17,000 if they are between \n65 and 69 years of age.\n  But what is not seen is the income foregone by those seniors for whom \nthe earnings test makes it uneconomical to work.\n  A recent study by the Institute for Policy Innovation shows that your \ntypical 67-year-old married senior, making let's say the American \naverage of $37,000, could have a marginal tax rate of over 80 percent.\n  This is a huge disincentive to continue working, even though we need \nthese experienced seniors in our work force, many of them want to work, \nand they are able to do so.\n  In fact, a recent study by the Urban Institute indicated that because \nof longer life expectancies and better medical care, a 65-year-old \ntoday is healthier than a 40-year-old was before World War II.\n  This has the effect of forcing able workers out of the work force. In \n1948, 47 percent of men over 65 worked. Today, it's one-third of that \nwith about 16 percent continuing to work.\n  And if they do work, they limit how much they work because of the \nearnings test. In fact, 65 percent of those seniors that work, keep \ntheir total earnings under the earnings test limit in order to avoid \nthe penalties.\n  But if we repealed the earnings test, we could unleash the economic \npower of our seniors.\n  The National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that repealing the \nearnings test on workers age 65 to 69 would increase the annual number \nof hours worked throughout the economy by 5.3 percent.\n  That may not seem to be much, but it actually represents 63 million \nmore hours worked per year, or the equivalent of almost 31,500 jobs.\n  Because seniors would have more money to save, invest, and spend, \nit's estimated that overall gross domestic product would rise by $19.5 \nbillion, increasing the projected growth in disposable personal income \nby more than 5 percent.\n  And this would ripple throughout the economy, adding $6.8 billion to \nthe stock of U.S. capital invested in new jobs.\n  Finally, the extra growth that would be brought about by this repeal \nwould generate enough new tax collections to totally offset the higher \nSocial Security benefit payments within 10 years.\n  That is why I was proud to join Senator McCain last year in \ncosponsoring S. 279 to repeal this antiquated test and allow our \nseniors to keep all of their Social Security benefits. And that is why \nI will also support passage of H.R. 5.\n  But I think we need to look at the broader issues of retirement \nsecurity, including the taxation of Social Security benefits, and the \nforced depletions of individual retirement accounts.\n  In 1993, the President forced through an increase on the amount of \nSocial Security benefits subject to taxation from 50 to 85 percent for \nthose singles making more than $34,000 and those couples making over \n$44,000.\n  When coupled with the earnings test, these benefits taxes can punish \nsome couples with a 103 percent marginal tax rate. These couples \nactually lose more than a dollar for making another dollar. Not only is \nthis grossly unfair, it's also an even further disincentive for savings \nand work.\n  But the government's raid on senior's retirements assets doesn't even \nstop there. It also levies a 50 percent tax on IRA savings when seniors \nfail to withdraw when Washington wants them withdrawn.\n  Current law requires seniors to start withdrawing their IRA savings \nbeginning at age 70\\1/2\\.\n  And seniors must usually make these withdrawals in annual amounts \nlarge enough to deplete the entire IRA by the time they reach age 85.\n  Failure to follow these rules earns a whopping 50 percent penalty.\n  This withdrawal requirement can only be viewed as a punishment for \nthose who plan and save for retirement. Even worse, seniors who live \npast 85 may find themselves short on funds because the Federal \nGovernment forced them to spend their own savings. That's not right, \nand it must be stopped.\n  To remedy all of these gross disincentives to seniors planning and \nsaving for their retirement, and staying active in the work force, I \nintroduced the Senior Citizens' Financial Freedom Act, S. 2180.\n  This legislation would accomplish three objectives:\n  First, it would repeal the Social Security earnings test working \npenalty on seniors, just as the legislation before us today would.\n  Second, it would roll back the Clinton administration's 1993 tax \nincrease on Social Security benefits.\n  Finally, it would increase the age when minimum IRA distributions \nmust begin, from 70\\1/2\\ to 85.\n  Passage of H.R. 5 is vitally important to the financial well being of \nour seniors who chose to remain in the work force.\n  And I hope we will continue to work toward truly protecting the \nfinancial well-being of America's seniors by also addressing this year \nthe other issues of Social Security benefits taxation and forced IRA \nwithdrawals.\n  With these two important pieces of legislation, we can really \nstrengthen Social Security for our seniors in the most important place \npossible--their wallets.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senate is going to take an important \nand long overdue step to stop penalizing older workers in our Nation--\neliminating the Social Security earnings penalty. This is a change I \nhave advocated for many years. So I am very pleased we are taking this \nimportant step.\n  This legislation, H.R. 5, is an important step for a number of \nreasons. First, it is simply the right thing to do. There should not be \na penalty for working.\n  Second, we are now facing and will continue to face tight labor \nmarkets. In my State of Iowa, this is an acute problem in some areas. \nBy eliminating the earnings penalty, experienced workers who were \ndiscouraged from continuing in or rejoining the work force will have a \nnew incentive to work. The emergence of the Internet and home computers \noffers tremendous opportunities for seniors to work at home. Marrying \nthese new job opportunities with a repeal of the earnings penalty will \nbecome even more important as the Baby Boomers retire.\n  Third, a large number of older Americans need the income. Over half \nof today's workers have no pension plans\n\n[[Page S1539]]\n\noutside of Social Security. They are going to need additional sources \nof income to maintain their standard of living.\n  Some critics have expressed concern that this change would have a \nnegative budgetary impact. I believe that by attracting more Americans \nback into the work force, either on a full-time or part-time basis, it \nwill strengthen Social Security and the federal budget. And I believe \nthey will add to the productivity of our nation.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has been able to come together on a \nstrong bipartisan basis to pass this bill. The President has indicated \nhis support and so it should become the law of the land in the next few \nweeks. That would be a good step forward for our Nation.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments on the \nSocial Security earnings test elimination bill. Today I join my Senate \ncolleagues in supporting important legislation that will benefit \nmillions of American seniors who want to remain working after age 65 \nwithout facing a reduction in their Social Security benefits.\n  In America today there are roughly 800,000 Social Security recipients \nbetween the ages of 65 and 70. Under current law if you are one of \nthose 800,000 Americans and you earn more than $17,000 this year you \nwill begin to see a reduction, $1 in loss for every $3 earned over \n$17,000 in Social Security benefits. I think it is important to \nrecognize that those being penalized are those who have been paying \ninto Social Security their entire working lives. I have long \ndisapproved of this punitive system that places restrictions on a \nperson's right to work, and an employer's ability to hire the right \nperson for the job. Too often Social Security is viewed as a handout, \nbut for the vast majority of Americans this is an earned benefit that \nshould not be subject to Depression-era work restrictions.\n  The Members of this body are familiar with the numerous obstacles \nfacing employers, particularly small business owners, in these times of \nnear full employment. In my home State of Colorado, our small \nbusinesses, hospitality and tourism employers are struggling to find \nexperienced, qualified individuals even in these times of prosperity. \nHere in the Senate we have looked at increasing the number of guest \nworkers visas and streamlining the visa process in an effort to provide \nemployers with an opportunity to reach employees. While we will still \nconsider these efforts, the passage of the Social Security earnings \ntest elimination bill will allow employers to tap an eager and rich \npopulation of employees already living in every community in our State. \nImportantly, this legislation will put an end to a depressing practice \nthat has forced working seniors to leave their jobs mid-year once their \nearnings threshold has been reached. Not only will America's working \nseniors be spared unnecessary grief, but these seniors and their \nemployers will be free to develop stable, life-long working \nrelationships.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this legislation \nwill cost $22.7 billion over the next 10 years. I understand that \nactuaries from the Social Security Administration have reported that \nthis cost will be negligible over the long term. I mention this solely \nin the context that as we pass this legislation we recognize that this \nmeasure is associated with a cost. Congress must budget appropriately \nin response to this cost. Repealing the earnings limit is an idea whose \ntime has come, whose time came years ago. Part of constructing good \npublic policy is making hard choices. I hope that my colleagues will \nrecognize that if we are not willing to assume the responsibilities of \nthese costs in other areas of the budget we run the risk of continued \nfiscal irresponsibility that threatens Social Security and a balanced \nFederal budget.\n  Like many of my colleagues in the Senate today I had the good fortune \nto work on a precursor to this legislation when I served in the House \nof Representatives. During the 104th Congress I voted in favor of H.R. \n2491, the budget reconciliation bill that carried a number of \nprovisions outlined in the Contract with America. One of these \nprovisions was the gradual increase of the Social Security earnings \nlimit. In December 1995, President Clinton vetoed this legislation. I \nam thankful that today the Senate will pass this legislation \noverwhelmingly, insuring relief and increased economic freedom for \nAmerica's seniors.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, when the Social Security system was \nestablished, a retirement test, also referred to as an earnings test, \nwas made part of the criteria for determining an individual's benefits. \nThis criterion was established because Social Security benefits are \nintended to replace, in part, earnings lost by an individual or family \nbecause of retirement, disability, or death. Therefore, benefits are \nwithheld from individuals who show by their substantial earnings from \nwork that they are not in fact ``retired''.\n  What this means today is that recipients aged 62-65 could earn up to \n$10,080 annually without having their benefits affected, and those \nbetween 65-69 could earn up to $17,000 a year. For earnings above these \nlimits, recipients aged 62-65 lose $1 in benefits for each $2 of \nearnings while those between 65 and 69 lose $1 in benefits for each $3 \nin earnings. The earnings test does not apply to recipients age 70 and \nover, and the exempt limits increase each year at the same rate as \naverage wages in the economy. Currently, it is estimated that there are \napproximately 600,000 recipients age 65-69 affected by the earnings \nlimit test.\n  Today we are repealing the earnings limit for people between the full \nretirement age and age 69, giving them the opportunity for increased \nfinancial security, and providing an increase in skilled workers during \nthis tight labor market.\n  Removing the earnings limit will provide seniors with greater \nindependence and financial security. Today, too many Americans struggle \nthrough their retirement years trying to make ends meet. The steps we \ntake today will allow seniors to work longer, and depend on their \nsavings less, giving them more security into their later years. In our \nmodern workplace it makes no sense to penalize workers for staying in \nthe workforce longer. Congress works hard to encourage people to plan \ntheir retirement years thoughtfully, and removing the earnings limit \nwill give working families one more tool for planning their financial \nfuture.\n  This move is especially timely in our tight labor market and booming \neconomy. Removing the earnings limit will allow experienced workers to \nbe able to stay in the workforce. I have heard from several business \nowners in Wisconsin who are desperate for skilled workers in a number \nof industries. While the long term answer to the skilled worker \nshortage is increased worker training and education, encouraging older \nworkers to remain in the workforce will certainly help meet the current \ndemand. Proven, experienced, mature workers will help our economy \nmaintain its momentum.\n  We should not feel too jubilant, however, about today's \naccomplishment. Comprehensive Social Security Reform is still \nnecessary. Today's changes will do nothing to hold off the coming \ncrisis that will begin when we start drawing down the Social Security \nTrust fund in 2014. Congress needs to deal with this soon, otherwise we \nare shirking our duty to the American people.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge all my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. It is \nhigh time we eliminated this Depression-era provision which penalizes \nmotivated senior citizens for working to augment their Social Security \nincome.\n  As the law currently stands, if a person between the ages of 65 and \n69 earns more than $17,000 per year, their Social Security benefits are \nreduced by $1 for every $3 they earn above $17,000. That just isn't \nright. Ours is a society which values hard work; only our Government \nwould devise a scheme to penalize people for working.\n  Before too long, in 2025, Montana will have the third largest \nproportion of senior citizens in the Nation. This growth rate is \nnationwide, however. Our country is aging and the programs which our \nparents relied on in their golden years need to change if they are to \nkeep pace with the changing face of American society.\n  Most of the senior citizens affected by this unfair provision are \nthose who can afford it the least. These are the very people who \nstruggle to make ends meet every month. Many may face the impossible \ndecision of putting food on\n\n[[Page S1540]]\n\ntheir tables or prescriptions in their drug cabinets. We expect \nretirees to augment their Social Security income with money from \noutside resources but then turn around and penalize them for working. \nIsn't it about time to bring consistency into Social Security? \nEliminating the Social Security earnings limit is one important step in \nreforming the laws which affect our senior citizens.\n  I urge the Senate to follow the House of Representatives by \nexpediting passage of this important legislation. Working seniors \ndeserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nH.R. 5, the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act. This bill will do away \nwith the Social Security earnings test for those individuals between \nthe ages of 65 to 69. The earnings test has proved to be a disincentive \nfor able and healthy senior citizens to be a productive part of the \nworkforce. On March 1, the House of Representatives approved H.R. 5 by \na vote of 422-0. Moreover, the administration has expressed its support \nfor the bill. While I believe the amendment offered by Senator Kerrey \nhad merit, attaching it to this bill would have delayed enactment of \nthis important legislation. Therefore, it is my belief that we should \npass this bill immediately and send it to the President for his \napproval.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nrepealing the Social Security Earnings Test for working seniors. Many \nof my colleagues and I have been working together for the past 12 years \nto pass this legislation. At long last, the Senate is going to retire \nthe Social Security Earnings Test.\n  The Social Security Earnings Test is a 70 year old dinosaur of a law \nwhich was initiated to insure that Social Security benefits were \ngranted specifically to retired persons. Today, unfortunately, economic \nreality dictates the need for many senior citizens to continue working \nin order to achieve a basic standard of living. The Social Security \nEarnings Test stands as a roadblock to independence for tens of \nthousands of seniors throughout the United States. Furthermore, \nAmerica's seniors represent a wealth of talent and skill. A national \npolicy which discourages them from working is simply counterproductive.\n  Clearly, few other states have been as impacted by the unfair Social \nSecurity Earnings Test as the people in my home state of Florida. I've \nseen first-hand the impact upon Seniors of laws which limit income. We \nhave already seen the impact caused by President Clinton's 1993 tax \nhike on Seniors, when he raised the Social Security benefit tax from \n50% up to 85%. When are we, as a nation, going to stop penalizing \nsuccess?\n  It's not a group of greedy millionaires who are being impacted by the \nearnings test restrictions. It's lower and moderate income Seniors who \nneed some relief from their government to simply survive. In Florida, \nwe are talking about grandparents who live on Social Security plus any \noutside work they can get. And if you have grandma in the hospital or a \nnursing home fighting Alzheimer's Disease, and grandpa has go find some \nwork to pay the bills, the Social Security Earnings Test is simply \nanother hurdle they have to overcome.\n  Several years ago, I was visiting a worksite in Safety Harbor, \nFlorida where I met with a group of working Seniors. I asked them why \nthey were working past the traditional retirement age. Some said they \nsimply wanted to have a reason to get out of the house and do something \nproductive. Others said they needed the additional income to take care \nof a loved one. Still others said they wanted to maintain a certain \nlifestyle without Federal interference.\n  But I was most struck by one gentleman who said to me, ``Senator, we \nlive in a throw away society. Don't let them throw us away.'' What this \ngentleman was saying was that the message the Earnings Test sends is \nthat society no longer needs you. How can we, as a society, say such a \nthing? Clearly, we shouldn't.\n  Finally, consider this thought. Baseball fans might remember my \ngrandfather, Connie Mack, who spent many years in major league \nbaseball. In 1929, he managed the World Champion Philadelphia \nAthletics. In 1929, he was 66 years old. Suppose he had succumbed to \nthe idea that, at that age, there was no purpose for pursuing one's \nideas, one's dreams in life. Suppose he had been told by our nation \nthat he was no longer of value to society. He might not have had the \nopportunity to produce that great team. Fortunately, we didn't have a \nlaw which could have forced him into retirement.\n  The Federal government is sending a message to working Seniors that \nthey are over the hill. The only thing that is over the hill is the \nEarnings Test. We need to retire the Earnings Test, not our Seniors.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Moynihan, for his kind and gracious but too generous remarks. I \nknow we were able to get this accomplished through his leadership. As I \nsaid earlier, I do not only want to congratulate him for his role \ntoday, but for his continuing role in his many years of service in the \nSenate. I thank him for his leadership, for his contribution, and for \nhis steadiness on this most important matter.\n\n[[Page S1541]]\n\n  I also say to my distinguished colleague that it is important we \nrecognize the staff who worked so hard on this historic measure on the \nmajority side.\n  I thank Frank Polk, Alec Vachon of the majority staff; on the \nminority side, David Podoff and Jon Resnick.

Mr. President, I am aware that some Senators have come to \nthis floor in recent weeks to talk about rapidly increasing petroleum \nprices, and other Senators have raised serious concerns about home \nheating oil prices in the Northeast this winter. I also recall that \ncertain regions of this country were threatened by electricity \nbrownouts last summer, to say nothing of the difficulties our \nbeleaguered farmers may face this year and to say nothing at this \nmoment of what they faced last year. All of these issues raise serious \nconcerns that affect our everyday lives in every season and region of \nthe country. The crisis that we have all been witnessing not only \nforces us to question our dependence on foreign oil, but, more \nimportantly, to confront the crying need for a serious domestic energy \nstrategy.\n  I remember very well, because I was here, the energy problems this \ncountry experienced in the 1970's. During that decade, we were forced \nto confront our energy demands and our vulnerability to the whims of \nforeign powers. A quarter century later, this nation is still facing \nthat same vulnerability. While some circumstances may have changed, the \nUnited States is now importing more than half of its oil from overseas. \nThis fact, in addition to the potential for volatile market swings, is \nvery unsettling to me. The United States should not be held hostage to \nthe capricious decisions of other nations--friend or foe. We should not \nhave to go, hat in hand, to other nations to beg them to produce more \noil so that our supply and prices in the United States do not plummet \nto levels that stifle the economy. We should not have to think of \nsending in the troops every time some regional difficulty arises in the \nMiddle East.\n  Our ultimate national interest lies with concerns that are much \nlarger than the current price hikes in gasoline, diesel, home heating \noil, or electricity. Though I am certain that, in time, this petroleum \ncrisis will pass as most crises do, I fear that, as a nation, we will \nsink back into somnolence, asleep at the wheel so to speak. The alarm \nis ringing loudly today, and it is time to wake up and address the \nunderlying issue--our lack of a serious, comprehensive national energy \nstrategy. That is the underlying issue. Our policies must take into \naccount our energy independence and U.S. energy security. We need a \npolicy that buffers our economy and our people from decisions made by \nforeign suppliers. It is past time to focus on increased research and \ndevelopment into advanced technologies, energy efficiency and \nconservation measures, and market incentives for these advanced \ntechnologies and conservation measures. Obviously we must also be \nsensitive to the environment. Clean air and clean water matter; the \nresponsible use of our land matters; and the potential impact caused by \nthe growth of greenhouse gases matters. We should aggressively \ninvestigate promising carbon sequestration technologies. In fact, a \ncomprehensive national energy strategy must also incorporate a strong \nenvironmental strategy. I believe that we can, and that we should \nundertake this challenge. We ought to do it now.\n  The United States is vast, and our resources are vast. We are a \nfortunate nation in that regard. The Creator has blessed us. Our \neconomy is booming and with that boom comes an increased appetite for \nenergy. We must consider how much we consume and how efficiently we use \nthese resources. We possess energy reserves of oil and natural gas, as \nwell as wind, solar, hydro, fuel cell, geothermal, and nuclear power. \nAnd, some of our most abundant energy sources are the coal reserves \nunderlying many areas of the United States. We will need all of these \nresources if we are ever to achieve the goal of stable energy \nindependence. It is time to examine the tough questions and to explore \nthe opportunities before us to increase our energy independence.\n\n  This is a daunting task, and its success is dependent on our active \nsupport of a focused research and development program. I serve as the \nRanking Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I am proud to \nhave been able to provide funding for a range of critical research and \ndevelopment programs for energy efficiency. I have been on that \ncommittee 41 years; now going on 42 years. I have been on that \nAppropriations Committee longer than any other Senator has ever served \non it. During that time, I have been conscious of the need for more \nenergy research and the need for a comprehensive energy strategy. So I \nhave provided funding for a range of critical research and development \nprograms for energy efficiency. One such research and development \neffort that I am especially proud of is the Clean Coal Technology \nProgram. I believe that it was, and continues to be, a commonsense, \nforward thinking program.\n\n  In 1985, I was able to provide the initial $750 million to create the \nDepartment of Energy's Clean Coal Technology Program. It has been a \nvery successful public-private partnership. Originally designed to \naddress acid rain reduction, the Clean Coal Technology Program is now \naddressing a broader range of emission issues, including the reduction \nof greenhouse gases.\n  Over the years, more than $2.4 billion in federal funding has moved \nthe clean coal program forward. I have supported every dollar that has \nbeen utilized in this way. To date, 40 projects have been approved, \nwith 32 either completed or scheduled to be completed by the end of \n2001. But there is a disturbing trend taking shape at the Federal \nlevel. These funds are being threatened by deferrals and rescissions by \nthis Administration. I have had to try to fight off these deferrals and \nrescissions that are being recommended by this administration. A \ncritical research and development program that supports more efficient \nuse of one of our most abundant domestic fuel sources--coal--must not \nbe eviscerated if we are serious about advancing our energy security \ngoal. We must continue to be ready in the event of a crisis. We have \nseen these crises occur before. Yet here we are with an administration \nthat wants to rescind, wants to defer, moneys that are to be spent in \nthe clean coal technology program.\n\n  The utter folly of such an approach is self-evident. Here we have \nbeen caught without a cushion, so we were not prepared for the crisis \nthe country is now in. We should have been prepared. Coal cannot be \ntaken off the list of domestic energy sources if we are ever to get out \nof the posture of begging, begging, begging OPEC for mercy.\n  I come from a coal State. Coal reserves are plentiful--not so \nplentiful as they once were in my State, but they are plentiful in this \ncountry. Coal supplies 56 percent of all electricity in this country. \nSee the lights up here. Electricity is what makes those lights burn. \nWhat is behind that electricity? Coal, C-O-A-L. It keeps the lights \nburning in the hospitals, in the schools, in the Federal buildings, in \nthe White House.\n  Coal, as I say, supplies 56 percent of all electricity in this \ncountry--56 percent.\n  Coal has literally fueled the American economy. It will continue to \nbe an important source of energy for the foreseeable future--and it \nmust continue to be. I know that there are concerns about coal mining \nand coal use.\n\n[[Page S1542]]\n\nSome past practices would, quite rightly, not be condoned today. But we \nare capable, as a nation, of doing better, and we are doing more by \nimproving these practices while also supplying the electricity that \noperates the wheels of industry and that lightens the offices so we can \ndo our work, supplying an important fuel that lights our homes and \nbusinesses.\n  For years, not just recently, I have promoted clean coal and other \nclean energy technologies through research and development. But many of \nthese newer, cleaner technologies are more costly to bring to the \nmarket. We also need to address the gap between the research and \ndevelopment of these promising technologies and their widespread \ndeployment in the marketplace. It is imperative that we fill that gap.\n  For this reason, I have worked with Minority Leader Daschle and other \nMembers of this body to develop a targeted package of tax incentives to \nencourage the demonstration and deployment of many energy efficient \ntechnologies. I worked with these Members for over a year and a half to \ncraft S. 1833, the Energy Security Tax Act of 1999. If Senators have \nconcerns about developing greater energy independence and encouraging \ncleaner, more efficient technologies, then I urge them to take a \nserious look at this legislation. Clean coal technologies are included \nin this package, as are a broad range of incentives for other fuels, \nincluding coal mine methane, renewables, and oil and gas. Additionally, \nwe have included incentives for energy conservation technologies and \nenergy efficient technologies and practices in the transportation, \nsteel, and agriculture sectors. I say to my colleagues, if you want to \nhelp develop a strategy for an energy-independent country, then work to \nget this bill passed. It is the right thing for our economy, for the \nenvironment, for trade, and for jobs. It is a step toward a \ncomprehensive national policy to promote energy efficiency, energy \nsecurity, and energy independence.\n  If we want to have a national energy strategy, we must sit down \ntogether and bring all of our interests and concerns to the table. We \nmust take a multi-pronged approach that looks at the whole range of \nfuels, the whole kit and caboodle, at more efficient energy \ntechnologies and conservation practices, and at the participation of a \nbroad spectrum of industries and interested parties. I do not want the \nUnited States to be at the mercy of rogue nations. I do not want our \neconomy to tremble each time OPEC flexes its muscle. I want to ensure \nthat we remain economically competitive. An efficient, stable supply of \nenergy is key. I believe that the challenges of this new century can be \nmet, lighting the way for a new energy strategy that recognizes the \nimportance of economic development and environmental protection at the \nsame time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, could the order standing on the floor \nat this time be indicated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska or his designee is recognized to speak for up to 60 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1542-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1542-S1548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BALANCED PRODUCTION OF ENERGY RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I compliment my good friend, the senior \nSenator from West Virginia, for his attention to the energy crisis that \nclearly this Nation faces, and particularly his attention to the \nrealization that we have become so dependent on imported energy which \nclearly affects our national security interests.\n  In 1973--this is a time the Senator would certainly remember, as many \nAmericans do--as a consequence of the Arab oil embargo, we had a very \nsignificant event in the United States. We had gas lines around the \nblock. Many younger people don't remember that time. We were 37-percent \ndependent on imported oil. We created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nas a consequence of our concern, fearing we might approach 50 percent \ndependence. We fought a war in the Persian Gulf. At that time, I \nbelieve we were 47-percent dependent.\n  Today, this Nation is 56-percent dependent on imported oil. The \nDepartment of Energy forecasts by the year 2015 to 2020 we will be 65-\npercent dependent. I hope we can learn something from history; that is, \nthat we lose our leverage if we become so dependent on that single \nsource of imports.\n  As the Senator from West Virginia pointed out, we have many forms of \nenergy in this country. We have coal, as the Senator notes; we have \ngas; we have hydro; we have nuclear. However, we don't have a cohesive \nenergy policy. As a consequence, we face a crisis. The farmers in this \ncountry are getting ready to plant, and they are going to be facing \nhigh energy costs. We have seen truckers come to Washington, DC, and \nplead because they can't pass on the increased price of diesel to \nconsumers. We have our Secretary of Energy in Nigeria, he was in Saudi \nArabia, he has been to Mexico, urging they produce more oil.\n  What we need is a balance. We need a balance in domestic production \nof energy resources in this country, including coal, oil, and gas, \nusing America's technology and America's know-how to develop these \nresources safely.\n  I commend my friend from West Virginia for bringing this matter to \nthe attention of this body and recognizing that we have a capability in \nthe United States to relieve our dependence on imported energy. The \nanswer is not to go out and generate more imports; it is to generate \nmore resources domestically. In his State of West Virginia and in my \nState of Alaska, we have a tremendous capacity to produce energy, if it \nis given the opportunity. We can do that because we have the advanced \ntechnology. He talks about clean coal technology. In our State of \nAlaska, we talk about drilling in the Arctic in the wintertime where \nyou do not make a footprint because you are on top of the frozen \nground. If there is no oil there, there is no scar, no footprint in the \nspring.\n  I have the obligation of managing some time this morning. Does the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia have anything further to say?\n  Mr. BYRD. Only 1 minute, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for his observations. He has very \ncogently and lucidly expressed those observations. I thank him for the \nwork he has done in this subject area. I have been glad to work with \nhim on some legislation, and I look forward to the opportunity of our \nworking and cooperating to deal with this very serious problem.\n  I thank him very much.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from West Virginia because I think \nhis years of experience and participation in this body on energy \nmatters is a legacy to which he continues to contribute, and we can \nlearn a great deal from his advice. I thank my friend.\n  I believe the Senator from Wyoming would like recognition at this \ntime. I ask how much time he would require.\n  Mr. THOMAS. About 6 minutes, I believe.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are here, of course, to talk about oil \nprices, high oil prices that affect each of us. Let me start by \nrecalling that less than 2 years ago, in 1998, we had what was \nconsidered to be the largest oil collapse since 1900. The price of oil \nin my State, which is heavy oil and less expensive than some other \nplaces, was $5 or $6 a barrel. Now, of course, we are faced with oil \nprices that are in the neighborhood of $30 a barrel.\n  I think we will hear a great deal of talk that we need to find a \nlong-term answer to stabilize the production cost of energy so we have, \nin fact, an ample amount of energy. We need an incentive to produce \nenergy on a continuing basis so the price is relatively stable.\n  I have talked to a number of the producers in my State, and \nproduction is still not as high--there are not as many wells, not as \nmany pumps--as it could be. We say the price is as high as it has ever \nbeen, but there is no assurance it will continue, so you are hesitant \nto invest the money you have--a great deal of money, as a matter of \nfact--when you do not know if that price is going to be back where it \nwas before. So what we are talking about basically is some kind of \npolicy that would bring about some stability in fuel prices.\n\n[[Page S1543]]\n\n  I thank Senator Murkowski, the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, for his interest and \nleadership in this matter. Why this has happened is no real surprise. \nThere are a number of things, frankly, that have happened over time, \nand this administration cannot be surprised that we now have energy \nprices that are impacting truckers' diesel fuel prices, that are \nimpacting seniors, that will have an impact on the tourism economy in \nmy State of Wyoming and in agriculture, and certainly in many places in \nhome heating.\n  It is not a surprise this has happened. We need a long-term energy \npolicy. We need tax relief for low-production wells. We need \ncommonsense royalty collection. We need access to public lands for a \nmultiple-use concept and to develop oil and gas and coal.\n  By the way, the Senator from West Virginia spoke of coal. Certainly, \nthat is very important as well. Wyoming is the largest coal producer in \nthe Nation, low-sulfur coal. We are very pleased with that.\n  There will be opportunities for quick fixes. Certainly we support the \nidea of Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Programs, for example. But \nthe fact is, over time, we will need a policy that is not just short- \nbut rather long-term so we can get away from this idea that we are \ngoing to be threatened in both our national security and our fiscal \nsecurity from time to time because of this.\n  Part of it is regulatory. EPA has tried to shut down coal-fired \npowerplants in the U.S. when all they were doing was routine \nmaintenance. Coal supplies 55 percent of the Nation's electricity. A \nthird of that is produced in Wyoming.\n  There is an interchange between energy uses. Of course, you do not \nuse coal in the car, but you can use coal in some places where you \ncould then release the oil for transportation.\n  Lots of things are occurring. The Secretary of Interior, Mr. Babbitt, \nis talking about taking down hydroelectric dams in the Pacific \nNorthwest. We have had substantial limitations on the use of public \nlands in the West particularly. Vice President Gore has promised to \nprohibit future exploration for gas in the Outer Continental Shelf, \nplaces where we could do this and at the same time protect the \nenvironment.\n\n  We are into this whole question of nonaccess to public lands. It is \npart of this administration's idea of the land legacy, where we have \nnow 40 million roadless acres in the forest. We have BLM roadless areas \nthat keep us from using the multiple resources. Interestingly enough, \nthe access thing goes so far as national parks, where now there is a \npolicy in winter use to keep people away from the access to Yellowstone \nPark but at the same time promote the burning of nuclear waste upwind \nfrom the park, and have no concern about its impact. Interesting.\n  A failed domestic policy is certainly what we have. It has already \nbeen mentioned that, since 1992, U.S. production is down 17 percent; \nconsumption is up 14 percent. In just 1 year of the Clinton-Gore \noperation, oil imports increased 7.6 percent. It is now at 56 percent \nand growing. It will be up as high as 65.\n  The United States is spending $300 million a day importing crude oil, \n$100 billion a year. One-third of the trade deficit is based on the \nimportation of oil.\n  So these are the kinds of things with which we are faced. We \ncertainly need a long-term policy. As I suggested, we need to take a \nlook at the Rocky Mountain States. We need to take a look at Alaska. We \nneed to take a look at offshore opportunities, tax incentives to help \noil production get started, exploration costs.\n  Yesterday, I cosponsored a bill introduced by Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison from Texas on marginal well credits. I think these are the \nkinds of steps we can take--incentives, of course, trying to make \nregulations that do not inhibit production moving forward.\n  We have a lot of things to do. There are some real impacts, in \naddition to the costs. In 1990, U.S. jobs exploring and producing oil \ninvolved 405,000 people. In 1999, jobs exploring and producing oil and \ngas were down to 293,000--a 27-percent decline in the production of \nenergy.\n  I think there is a great deal we can do, but the overriding demand is \nto have a long-term policy which helps us to increase our domestic \nproduction so we are less reliant on overseas oil. American families \nshould not have to bear the full cost of this failed energy policy. In \nthe long term, I hope the administration will embrace Congress' efforts \nand we will move forward. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my friend from Wyoming will yield for a \nquestion relative to the advanced technology applicable to coal.\n  I believe there have been projects in Wyoming that have addressed the \nissue in general terms of clean coal, how it can be reformulated to \nreduce the moisture and generate higher Btu's. I wonder if the Senator \ncould comment briefly as to the area in Wyoming, as well, that could be \navailable for oil and gas and coal exploration but has been withdrawn \nby the administration, and the rationale behind that; if those areas \nwere open, what they might contribute to lessen our dependence on \nimports.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The Senator is correct, of course. There are a great many \nthings that could happen. We have low-sulfur coal, which is very clean, \nbut it is relatively low Btu. You can do some things to enrich the \nBtu's. One of the problems is transportation. We have this great coal \nnow that costs us less than $5 a ton. That is what it is worth at the \nmouth of the mine. But if you take it then to Fort Worth, TX, it is $25 \nbecause of transportation. You could transport many more Btu's if you \nwould do this enrichment.\n\n  Fifty percent of Wyoming belongs to the Federal Government. Some of \nit is set aside, of course, and should be, as wilderness. Some of it is \nset aside in forests and lands that need special protection. But much \nof the land is high plains lands, and so on, that can be used for \nmultiple use, can be used for production. Frankly, it has been made so \ndifficult. We have had such a hard time with royalty payments, these \nkinds of things that really are unnecessary.\n  The Senator from Alaska is right. We can do a few things to encourage \ndomestic production and really take us out of this kind of a \nproposition.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Wyoming.\n  I believe the Senator from Maine seeks recognition, Ms. Collins. She \nrepresents a part of the country that has been very hard hit by high \nheating oil prices with a cold winter.\n  While we have seen excuses made relative to certain volumes of \nstorage capacity being taken out of existence for heating oil because \nof age and the fact that they did not comply with current environmental \nrequirements for fuel oil storage, we have seen refineries go out of \nexistence. But the constituents in her area have been hit very hard.\n  It is my understanding that this year in the Northeast corridor there \nis a potential threat associated with high electric prices as a \nconsequence of the likelihood that, indeed, some of the oil-fired \nplants are going to have to be put on line to meet peak demand. The \ncosts associated with the high price of oil to fuel those plants will \nbe passed on to the consumers in her areas, which puts a further burden \non the residents of the Northeast corridor. As a consequence, that \naddresses the dilemma we have: Whether we are going to continue to rely \non imports of energy or finally develop a balance with domestic \nalternatives.\n  How much time does the Senator from Maine need?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I request 10 minutes, if that is available.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I begin my remarks this morning by \ncommending the Senator from Alaska, the distinguished chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, for his outstanding leadership \nin pulling together a plan to deal with the oil crisis.\n  He has been very attentive and responsive to the concerns of those of \nus who represent Northeast States. He has pointed out, correctly, time \nand again that one reason we are in such a bind where we are \nexperiencing this oil crisis is that this administration has had no \nplan, it has had no policy. Thus, we have been particularly vulnerable \nto the manipulation of our oil markets by the OPEC nations.\n\n[[Page S1544]]\n\n  I commend the Senator from Alaska for his leadership. It has been a \ngreat pleasure to work with him.\n  During the past winter, in Maine, home heating oil prices have more \nthan doubled from the level of the previous winter. I point out, we \nstill have a lot of winter left in New England. It is difficult to \nremember, when we are in Washington and surrounded by the cherry \nblossoms that are in full bloom and the tulips that are coming up, that \nin my home State of Maine we still have a considerable amount of winter \nyet to go through.\n  In fact, last weekend, when I was in Maine, in Aroostook County, the \ntemperature was a very chilly zero degrees; and in southern Maine, in \nPortland, on Sunday morning the temperature was 9 degrees. The crisis, \nas far as the impact of home heating oil costs on my State--and on many \nNew England States--has not yet eased. The crisis is very much still \nwith us.\n  Moreover, we are now seeing the increase in oil prices affecting the \ncost of gasoline. According to the latest American Automobile \nAssociation survey, gasoline prices in Maine now average a staggering \n$1.62 a gallon. In some parts of the State, such as Aroostook and \nWashington Counties, the prices are even higher. And there is no end in \nsight.\n  The Department of Energy has predicted sharply higher prices for \ngasoline as the summer approaches. Again, this is a particular concern \nto my State of Maine. We are very dependent on the tourists who come to \nMaine to enjoy our beautiful scenery and outdoor recreation during the \nsummer months. I fear that many of them will stay away if they are \nconfronted with gasoline prices that approach, or perhaps even exceed, \n$2 a gallon.\n  The reason behind these soaring prices is simple. OPEC's decision to \nengage in unfair and anticompetitive practices to constrict the supply \nof oil and drive up the prices is responsible, primarily, for the \ncrisis we face. This cartel inflicts--and will continue to inflict--\neconomic hardship on the families and the businesses of the Northeast \nand throughout America. The results of the jump in oil prices may have \nbeen felt first in the Northeast, but they are rolling as thunder \nacross America.\n  Let's look more closely at the primary cause of the oil crisis.\n  OPEC is a cartel of 11 oil-producing states that supply over 40 \npercent of the world's oil and possess over 77 percent of the world's \ntotal proven crude oil reserves.\n  OPEC member countries have colluded to take some 6 percent of the \nworld's oil supply off the market in order to maximize their profits. \nAnd the strategy is working.\n  Although OPEC countries sold 5 percent less oil last year, their \nprofits were up by more than 38 percent.\n\n  Last October, I began warning the Clinton administration about OPEC's \nproduction squeeze and the detrimental impact the cartel would have on \nour economy. At that time, oil prices were already beginning to rise \nand U.S. inventories were falling.\n  Throughout the winter, Mainers and all Americans who heat with oil \nhave suffered from the highest prices in a decade. Gradually, the \neconomic pain caused by OPEC has spread throughout the country. The \nentire Nation is suffering--and will continue to suffer--the results of \nrecord high fuel costs.\n  Last fall, the administration, in response to the concerns Senator \nSchumer and I and other Members expressed, told us what it is still \ntelling us: Just wait and see. Be patient. We will somehow increase \nproduction. We will convince OPEC to raise production to normal levels.\n  We have waited and waited and waited. The cost of oil has gone from \n$20 to $25 to $30 to $34 a barrel. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has \nadmitted that the ``Federal Government was not `prepared' for this \ncrisis. When he was in Maine, he said they had been `caught napping'.'' \nThat is an astonishing admission of a lack of leadership by this \nadministration.\n  The fact is, this administration has no plan, no policy, no approach \nfor dealing with this crisis. It has no energy policy at all. The \nadministration should act immediately to combat OPEC's manipulation of \noil markets by using a tool that has proven effective in the past; that \nis, a measured release of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Along with Senator Schumer, I have repeatedly asked the \nadministration to release some of the oil from our Strategic Petroleum \nReserve into the marketplace. I have worked with the chairman to make \nsure it would be done in a way that did not in any way jeopardize our \nnational security. It would not in any way drain the reserve, which has \napproximately 575 million barrels in its storages. This would ease the \nprice.\n\n  Last November, again, Senator Schumer and I introduced a bill making \nclear the President's authority to act. Time and again, we called upon \nthe administration to take some action to provide us with relief. On \nMarch 2, we introduced legislation calling upon the administration to \ndraw down the SPR in an economically feasible manner using what is \nknown as swaps. A release from the SPR would have an immediate and \ndramatic impact on the price of oil. It would help break OPEC's resolve \nto maintain an iron grip on our Nation's oil supply.\n  I will relate what has happened in the two past cases where we did \nhave a measured release of oil from our reserves. In 1996, the \nadministration sold oil from the SPR simply to raise revenue, and oil \nprices declined almost immediately by over 7 percent. That was in \nresponse to merely the announcement of a one-time sale of 12 million \nbarrels. Previously, when President Bush tapped the reserves during the \ngulf war, prices dropped by 30 percent.\n  In proposing that we release oil from our reserves, I am pleased to \nhave the very strong support of the American Trucking Association. \nPerhaps no one has felt the pain of soaring oil prices more than our \nNation's truckers. The jump in prices deeply harms them and, by \nextension, all American consumers and businesses.\n  I have heard from a small Maine trucking company that is in dire \nstraits. One operator of a trucking company in Ellsworth tells me that \ndue to the high cost of diesel, many independent contractors with whom \nshe contracts will simply not be able to stay in business. Potato \nfarmers in northern Maine are concerned they are going to have \nincreasing difficulty in shipping their crop because the high cost of \ndiesel has made it economically infeasible for truckers to drive to \nAroostook County. High diesel costs also hurt our lumber and paper \nindustries.\n  Everyone shares in the pain inflicted by OPEC. Record-high crude oil \nprices hurt all Americans--at the pump, on the farm, in the \nsupermarket, at the airline ticket counter, and at home during cold \nnights. These exorbitant prices even hurt our kids. Recently a \nnewspaper in my State reported that the high cost of fuel is straining \nschool budgets in Maine. Several schools have canceled all field trips \nbecause they have already depleted their budget for gasoline, diesel, \nand oil costs for the year.\n  I have been disappointed that the administration has failed to heed \nour call during the past several months. What makes the \nadministration's failure to act even more perplexing is the fact some \nof the nations involved in the scheme to manipulate prices are \nsupposedly our allies. They have depended heavily on American support \nin the past. These countries include Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, \nand Mexico. I am so frustrated in particular with Kuwait and Saudi \nArabia. We rescued these countries; 147 Americans gave their lives in \nthe cause of freeing Kuwait and protecting Saudi Arabia.\n  I hope next week when the OPEC nation ministers meet they will decide \nto restore normal production levels. But we cannot wait. We have to \nkeep the pressure on. We have to provide short-term and long-term \nrelief.\n  There are other steps we could take. We should suspend the 3.4-\npercent gas tax hike while protecting the highway trust fund, and we \nmust make clear to the OPEC nations that we will not stand idly by.\n  Again, I thank the chairman of the task force and of the committee \nfor his excellent leadership. I look forward to continuing to work with \nhim on this very critical issue.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Maine for \nan update on what has occurred as a\n\n[[Page S1545]]\n\nconsequence of the crisis in the Northeast corridor and the \nimplications associated with that in her area. I think she certainly \nhas been diligent in attempting to bring about some relief for her \narea. It is unfortunate that the administration's answer seems to be \nsoliciting more imports. Of course, those of us who follow this closely \nknow that it is somewhere between 6 and 8 weeks before a barrel of oil \nthat originates in Saudi Arabia is going to be available in her area \nfor the benefit of relieving those who are subjected to the high prices \nof heating oil.\n  Before I recognize my friend from Texas who is seeking recognition on \nthis subject, I remind my colleagues that there is going to be a lot of \nfinger pointing as to who bears responsibility. The claim by the \nadministration that they have been ``caught by surprise'' suggests that \nthey must have been napping because evidence certainly shows that the \nPresident had knowledge of the extent of this crisis developing back in \n1994, when the Independent Petroleum Association of America petitioned \nthe Commerce Secretary, under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. \nUnder that act, upon a request from an interested party, which the \nindependent petroleum producers certainly were, the Secretary of \nCommerce must institute, over a 270-day period, an investigation into \nwhether imports threaten U.S. national security. Then, if the Secretary \ndetermines such imports do threaten national security, the President \nhas 3 months to disagree or agree and, if he agrees, to determine a \nresponse or a solution.\n  In 1994, the Independent Petroleum Association petitioned the \nCommerce Department. At that time, the late Secretary, Ron Brown, under \nsection 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, responded. After study, the \nDepartment of Commerce found that imports did threaten the national \nsecurity and reported this to our President. What was the President's \nresponse? I quote from the 1994 findings:\n\n       I am today concurring with the Department of Commerce and \n     their finding that the Nation's growing reliance on imports \n     of crude oil and refined petroleum products threatens the \n     Nation's security because they increase U.S. vulnerability to \n     oil supply interruptions.\n\n  Granted, that was in 1994, but something else happened in March of \n1999. The Congress asked for a new section 232 finding on oil imports.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter asking the Department of \nCommerce for an evaluation under section 232 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1999.\n     Hon. William M. Daley,\n     Secretary of Commerce, U.S. Department of Commerce, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Daley: For over a year now, the world oil \n     market has been glutted with excess supply, which has \n     severely depressed oil prices. The crash in oil prices has \n     resulted in record low gasoline prices and shaved at least \n     half a point off the inflation rate. At the same time, the \n     impact on domestic oil production has been devastating. \n     According to a January survey by the Independent Petroleum \n     Association of America (IPAA), 193,000 marginal oil and gas \n     wells have been shut down wth a loss in oil production of \n     360,000 barrels per day since November of 1997. Even if oil \n     prices were to increase to $14 for the next six months, \n     another 184,000 oil wells would likely be shut in. Once \n     marginal wells, well that produce less than 10 barrels per \n     day, are shut in they rarely come back into production. With \n     1 million barrels per day of U.S. production coming from \n     marginal wells, loss of that production would have a dramatic \n     impact on U.S. oil imports.\n       The future implications of a slowdown of this magnitude are \n     severe and long lasting. New drilling is down nearly 50 \n     percent. In general, the only wells being drilled are those \n     required to maintain a lease. The major oil companies have \n     announced significant cuts in capital spending, averaging 20 \n     percent. The impact on the United States, a high-cost \n     province, is expected to be a reduction in capital spending \n     on the order of 40 percent. The absence of new drilling means \n     that for several years we are going to have declining \n     production as old fields are depleted without new fields \n     being brought into production. Oil development requires long \n     lead times and oil production cannot be brought back up in \n     short order.\n       According to press reports, oil industry bankruptcy filings \n     started to accelerate late last year. The courts in Texas \n     alone are expecting over 80 Chapter 7 oil industry \n     bankruptcies as a result of the crisis. Over 24,000 jobs \n     directly in the oil industry have already been lost, with \n     another 17,000 expected. In the short run, the economic \n     impacts in some areas are staggering. In the long run, the \n     risk is the lost capability for domestic production. As \n     companies go out of business, equipment is taken out of \n     service and people are forced to find other lines of work. As \n     the United States discovered after the last price downturn, \n     once the expertise and capability disappear, they are costly \n     to replace when prices do recover.\n       The total U.S. trade deficit last year for goods and \n     services was $168.6 billion, up from $110.2 billion in 1997. \n     The petroleum contribution to the deficit was $20 billion \n     less than in 1997, even though imports of crude oil were up 6 \n     percent and all petroleum products 8 percent. When oil prices \n     recover, and they will as non-OPEC supplies decline and \n     developing country economies emerge from recession, our trade \n     deficit figures will see a sharp increase. The Energy \n     Information Administration, in its Annual Energy Outlook \n     1999, is projecting oil imports as high as 71 percent of \n     consumption by 2020 at a cost of $100-$158 billion. While low \n     oil prices have provided obvious benefits to the economy in \n     the short run, we believe it is reckless not to be taking \n     immedate action to mitigate the future impact of our \n     increasing dependence on imported oil.\n       In 1994, your Department conducted a review under section \n     232(b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1862) \n     and found that the nation's growing reliance on imports of \n     crude oil and refined petroleum products threatened the \n     nation's security because they increase U.S. vulnerability to \n     oil supply interruptions. On February 16, 1995, President \n     Clinton concurred with the finding, but took no action. In \n     1994, the U.S. was 51 percent dependent on foreign oil; in \n     1998 it was 56% dependent. Clearly, the security threat that \n     was found in 1995 has increased along with those imports.\n       With all these factors in mind, we are hereby requesting \n     that you conduct an expedited review and investigation into \n     the impact of low oil prices and ever increasing oil imports \n     on the United States national security under the authorities \n     granted to you under Sec. 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of \n     1962. A finding that the level of oil imports is a threat to \n     our national security will put the focus on a national policy \n     to respond to the crisis. We respectfully request that you \n     complete your investigation and send your findings to the \n     President within 60 days.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jeff Bingman, John Breaux, Mary L. Landrieu, Frank H. \n           Murkowski, Kent Conrad, Michael B. Enzi, Max Baucus, \n           Byron L. Dorgan, Trent Lott, Conrad Burns, Blanche \n           Lincoln.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Further, I note that that particular letter is a \nbipartisan letter. Many Democrats as well as Republicans are on that \nletter, specifically asking, again, for a new finding on oil imports \nand pointing out that the domestic oil and gas industry was basically \nin a free-fall--this was March of 1999 --and that that free-fall would \nfurther threaten our national security.\n  In April of 1999, Secretary of Commerce Daley initiated the study. \nThat study was delivered to the President last November. Now, the \nPresident has not released that study, but clearly that study is going \nto point out that national security is at risk because of our \nincreasing dependence on imports. Why hasn't the White House released \nthat report?\n  Yesterday the Majority leader, Senator Lott, along with Senator \nWarner, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Helms, \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and myself wrote to the \nPresident laying out this sequence of facts and asking the President to \nrelease that report that has been sitting on his desk since November. \nNow, he is required by law to do this within 90 days--which has past. \nSo when I hear from the administration that they were caught by \nsurprise, or caught napping, I can only assume they haven't been \nreading their mail, or they haven't been moving the reports, or they \nhave decided they didn't want to bring this issue up before the \nAmerican people, because they were told in 1994 and they were told \nagain last November that we were risking our national security as a \nconsequence of our import and dependence on foreign oil, which is now \nup to 56 percent.\n\n  The Department of Energy, in its own forecast last year, said in the \nyears 2015 to 2020 we will probably be in the area of 65-percent \ndependent on imports. I am not buying the excuse that they were caught \nnapping or caught by surprise. They were caught because they haven't \ndone anything about it. They haven't wanted to do anything about it. \nThey hoped they would get out of town before the American public became \naware, before the crisis hit, before the farmers came to Washington, \nbefore the truck drivers came to Washington, before we had a surcharge \non\n\n[[Page S1546]]\n\nour airline tickets, before we were approaching $2-a-gallon gasoline. \nBut it has caught up with them.\n  It will be very interesting to hear what the White House is going to \nsay now that they have this report under section 232 of the Trade \nExpansion Act; they have had it since November. And why haven't they \nreleased it to the American people?\n  I ask the Senator from Texas how much time she will need. We have had \n7 minutes. We have had 10 minutes. And we have a couple more speakers. \nIs 10 minutes adequate?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my good friend \nfrom Texas, who has been very much an integral part of our Special \nEnergy Committee to try to address some short-term, interim, and some \nlong-term relief for the crisis we are currently facing in our country.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska, the \nchairman of our Energy Committee, for taking the lead on this very \nimportant issue. Not one person who drives a car in this country or \nrides on an airplane can fail to realize what is happening--that we \nhave oil prices that are going through the roof and it is affecting \nevery one of us in our daily lives.\n  The sad thing is that this could have been avoided. We had the \nopportunity to present an energy policy in this country that would not \nmake us beholden to foreign oil resources. In fact, when President \nClinton took office, we imported 48 percent of the oil needs in our \ncountry. Today, it is approaching 56 percent. Over 50 percent of the \noil needs in our country are imported.\n  I am going to vote for all the quick fixes that we can to get prices \ndown as quickly as possible because it does hurt people who have to \ndrive for a living, or those who are planning family vacations, to have \nthis kind of added expense they didn't count on. But if we do a short-\nterm fix without a long-term fix, we are doing nothing to solve the \nreal problem in this country--that we are consuming more oil than we \nare producing and we are too dependent on foreign sources.\n  I want to help the people in the Northeast who are suffering from \nterrible heating oil shortages and high prices. I want to help every \nAmerican who is driving a car and seeing $50 register on the gasoline \npump. I want to make sure we realize we can do something to make our \nown country more self-sufficient and these are things that will be good \nfor everyone.\n  When prices were so low that small producers could not break even--in \n1997 and 1998--we lost much of the small business in our country that \nis in oil production. I have a great empathy for farmers in our \ncountry, as does Congress and the President. So when prices are \nartificially low for agricultural products, we do something for the \nsmall farmer to make sure they can stay in business because they are \nthe bread basket of America and it is in all of our interests to do \nthat.\n\n  But somehow, when we talk about small oil producers, people don't \nthink of that as a small business. They think of oil as big oil. They \nthink of it as J.R. Ewing. That is not the small producer in our \ncountry. A normal well in our country would be putting out 1,000 \nbarrels. In Alaska, they put out 6,000 barrels a day. When we talk \nabout a marginal well, we are talking about a 15-barrel-a-day quantity; \nthe output is 15 barrels a day. This is a very small, low-profit-margin \nwell. These are small businesses that are creating jobs in America.\n  What I want to do as part of a long-term solution is help those small \nproducers when prices go so low that they have to go out of business \nand close their wells. In 1997 and 1998, 20 percent of these producers \nwere put out of business because prices were $7, $8, $9 a barrel and \nthey could not break even. Once a well is shut in, they pour concrete \ndown the hole, so it is very expensive to reopen it.\n  Now, to put this in perspective, you might think, why would we want \nto save a 15-barrel-a-day well? The reason is that all of those small \nwells, put together--about 500,000 of them across the country--can \ncreate the same amount of oil as we import from Saudi Arabia. So if we \ncan keep these little guys in business, that creates a base for our \ncountry that does make a difference--the same amount of oil we import \nfrom Saudi Arabia that we are getting in our own country, creating jobs \nin our own country, creating taxpaying citizens, paying taxes to school \ndistricts, paying sales taxes to our States and income taxes to the \nFederal Government. So this is not a loss to the Federal Government; \nthis is a win for everyone.\n  In my State of Texas, where they have given tax breaks to small \nproducers--the 15-barrel-a-day producers--they have reopened wells and \nthey have put over a billion dollars into the economy of the State just \nby giving incentives for these small guys to stay in business. So if we \ncan do this when prices fall below $17 a barrel, we will create revenue \nfor our States and Federal Government, jobs for American people, and we \nwill create more oil so the price is stabilized, so we won't see the \nspikes caused by foreign countries deciding they are not going to \nproduce. It is a win for everyone.\n  This is not big oil. The big oil companies rarely, if ever--I would \nsay never, but I could be wrong; maybe there is a well out there that \nis 15 barrels a day, but it is not the kind of thing big companies do. \nBut it is a livelihood for a small producer, and we should treat them \nlike a small family farmer because it is in our interest to do so. It \ndoesn't hurt us in revenue, it helps us.\n  My addition to the long-term solution here is to help producers who \nare drilling wells that produce 15 barrels a day, or less, by giving \nthem a tax credit for the first 3 barrels of the 15 barrels when the \nprice falls below $17 a barrel.\n  That is it.\n  If it goes to $18 a barrel, there is no tax credit because then they \ncan break even on their own. But when it falls below $17, then they \nneed that help to keep those jobs, to keep that well pumping until they \nget to $18 a barrel. Frankly, if we did this, the prices would \nstabilize and we wouldn't have the lows and the highs.\n  I commend our chairman, Frank Murkowski, for putting together a \npackage. I wish we had an energy policy from the administration. I hope \nthey will work with us.\n  Our package says we are going to lower the gasoline taxes immediately \nuntil prices go back up to the $17 or $18 a barrel level; we are going \nto give help to people who need help in extra funding for fuel oil; we \ngive help to the truckers who rely on fuel prices being at a steady \nlevel when they make contracts. We will do the short-term fixes. But we \nmust address the long-term problems. If we did, we could pump \nimmediately 250,000 barrels a day in our country with the small guys, \nwith the little guys--the little oil producers who would reopen a well \nor believe they could make the investment to go back in and start \ndrilling again--and start our production so we would not be totally \nbeholden to foreign countries for our energy needs.\n  I hope our package is not just short-term fixes because if it is, we \nwill be walking away from the responsibility of Congress to have an \nenergy policy that will for the long term stabilize prices at a \nreasonable level so we can keep jobs in America and so we can have the \nsecurity that we will not import more than 50 percent of the needs of \nour country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask a question of \nmy friend from Texas relative to, again, the contribution of these \nsmall stripper wells. They are prevalent in our State, Oklahoma, and \nother areas. While they don't produce much, the numbers are \nsignificant. Collectively putting them together could offset \ndramatically a significant portion of what we import.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Does the Senator have a figure on how significant they \nare collectively?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think the chairman is exactly right. In fact, if we \nhelped these small stripper wells and these little guys so they could \nafford to go back in and drill again, we would be creating the same \nnumber of barrels as we import from Saudi Arabia. They could produce \n250,000 barrels almost immediately if they knew there was a policy that \nwould protect them against a drop because then they could afford to \nmake the investment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. When they are shut down, they are difficult to reopen \nand are almost lost.\n\n[[Page S1547]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is exactly right, and 250,000 barrels a day \ncould come on line practically immediately.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. This proposal of a floor and a ceiling for somewhere \nin the area of $14 to $17 would guarantee them an opportunity to \ncontinue when prices dropped below a figure and when ordinarily they \nwould cease to exist because they couldn't operate below that price.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. They couldn't exist when prices fell to $11, $10, or \n$9 a barrel. They cease to exist. Some of them will never come back.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We would be losing those jobs, and the dollars would \nbe spent overseas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. When the price goes to $18 a barrel, there are no tax \ncredits--nothing--because they can make it on their own.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I very much appreciate the contribution of the Senator \nfrom Texas who has been very instrumental, I think, in coming up with \nsome solutions as opposed to just importing more oil.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 6 minutes to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I think one thing the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, failed to \nsay is that she has legislation to do the very thing she is talking \nabout that is critical to more than just the economy of this country \nand just the price of oil but also to our national security.\n  I can remember in 1985 serving in the other body. At that time, we \nand Secretary of the Interior Hodel had a dog-and-pony show where we \nwould go around the Nation and explain to people in consumption States \nthat our dependency on foreign sources for our oil was a national \nsecurity issue. That means we are dependent upon them for our ability \nto fight a war. This is an incontrovertible fact. In fact, if you go \nback to World War I, the wars have been won by those countries that \nhave control of the energy.\n  I certainly applaud Senator Hutchison for her legislation. I am a \ncosponsor.\n  I think this is one of the ways we do it. We have two major sources \nin this country that we need to tap: One is in the State of Alaska, and \noffshore. I have been up there. I know how compatible that is to the \necology up there. I believe we are going to have to do it. Of course, \nin our areas, to some degree--Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas in the oil \nbelt--we have tremendous reserves. But all of it is in shallow steppes.\n  She talks about 15 barrels a day. I used to do this for a living. I \nwas a tool dresser on a table tool rig. Nobody knows what a table tool \nrig is anymore. But at that time, you had to work and work very hard.\n  It costs us in the United States of America 10 times as much to lift \na barrel of oil out of the ground than it costs in Saudi Arabia.\n  You would think we were smart enough in this country to learn from \nexperience, but we are not. In 1973, we were going through exactly the \nsame thing we are going through today. The OPEC countries could produce \noil cheaply. They had control of this. We were at that time only 36-\npercent dependent upon them, but that was enough for them to control to \nthe extent they lowered the price and starved out the small, marginal \nwell producers and stripper producers. They were no longer able to stay \nin business.\n  It is not easy to say: It is fine now because it is $38 a barrel, or \n$28 a barrel. It doesn't work that way. There has to be a \npredictability of price.\n  When you are making an investment decision to drill one of these \nwells, that has to be made about 6 months before you actually go into \nthe ground. If you have fluctuating prices, you can't find many people \nwho are willing to risk their capital to go in the ground. We have to \nhave predictability. The only way we are going to have that is with a \nnational energy policy.\n  I have probably been the chief critic of this administration in every \narea, from energy to national defense. But in this case I have to, in \nall fairness, say we do not have a national energy policy. We tried to \nget a national energy policy under President Reagan, under President \nBush, and certainly under President Clinton. We have not been able to \ndo it. This is where we are going to have to concentrate our efforts.\n  I think people who are concerned about prices need to understand \nthere is another thing coming, and that is the EPA. Truck drivers have \nbeen requesting that Congress step in to reduce the cost of diesel \nfuel. If they think prices are high now, wait until the EPA finalizes \ntheir sulfur and diesel rule. I have talked to small refiners. They do \nnot know how they can operate at that particular level. That is going \nto have a direct effect. It could double the cost of diesel.\n  Yesterday, Carol Browner said she wanted to eliminate the oxygenate \nmandate in fuels. However, she wants to mandate that all fuels contain \na 1.5-percent renewable component. That means the cost is going to go \nup. It is done under the banner of the ecology.\n  The issue we are dealing with today is far more serious than just the \nprice of gas at the pumps or the price of oil to heat our houses. This \nis a national security issue. We are now dependent upon foreign sources \nfor our ability to defend America.\n  It has to come to a stop. The only way it can come to a stop is \ndevelop a national energy policy, the cornerstone of which is a \npercentage beyond which we cannot go beyond for dependence on foreign \nsources. I applaud the chairman for his efforts and join in the efforts \nto bring about such a policy.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend, the Senator from Oklahoma. I remind \nthe Senator that in 1973 when we had the Arab oil embargo, we had a \nbipartisan effort to come together, to take steps to ensure we would \nnever be over 50-percent dependent on imported oil. We created the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. Clearly we didn't follow what we were \npreaching at that time. I thank my friend from Oklahoma for his \ncontribution.\n  In the remaining minutes, I will point out a couple of relevant facts \nI think Members need to be cognizant of. One of the short-term \nproposals that our energy caucus has come up with is to support a \ntemporary suspension until year end of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline \ntax that was added in 1993. Some will remember we had a debate on the \nfloor regarding that tax. We were tied on the 4.3-cent-per-gallon \ngasoline tax increase. Vice President Gore came to the floor and broke \nthe tie. Some have taken the opportunity to suggest this is the Gore \ntax, the 4.3 cent a gallon. It amounted to a 30-percent tax increase on \nthe gasoline.\n  We are proposing a temporary suspension. The proposal suggests we \nwill not jeopardize any of the contracts that are outstanding for \nhighway funding this year, that we will replace the offset by the end \nof the year through the general fund or surplus, or a combination of \nboth, or perhaps if the price of oil should come down, we will do it \nthat way. However, we clearly will not jeopardize the highway trust \nfund by this proposal.\n  Another reality I think is worth mentioning because it is very \nsignificant relates to the fact we are currently importing a \nsignificant amount of oil from Iraq. We fought a war over there not so \nmany years ago. We lost 147 American lives of service men and women. \nThe object was to expel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. We have 458 \nAmericans who were wounded; 23 were held prisoner of war. What has it \ncost the American taxpayer since the end of the Persian Gulf war to \nensure that Saddam Hussein stays within his borders? A little over $10 \nbillion--we were enforcing a no-fly zone; we were enforcing some \nembargoes. I mention this because of the inconsistency.\n  Now we are importing oil from Iraq. Our greatest percentage of growth \nin imports is coming from Iraq. In 1998, I think it was 336,000 barrels \na day; In 1999, it is over twice that much.\n  Where is the consistency in our policy? We can condemn the Saudis for \nnot increasing oil production. We can condemn the Mexicans. The \nSecretary of Energy went to the Saudis and said: We have an emergency, \nwe need more production.\n  Do you know what they said? They will have a meeting on March 27 and \nlet us know. He says: No, you do not understand. We have an emergency. \nAnd they said: No, we have a meeting.\n\n[[Page S1548]]\n\n  He went to Mexico and begged for more production from Mexico. Do you \nknow what the Mexicans said? They said: Where were you, United States, \nwhen oil was $13, $14, $15 a barrel and our economy was in the bag?\n  That is what we are hearing as a consequence of our dependence on \nthis source. Some suggest we should consider pulling out troops if OPEC \nfails to raise production. Obviously, that is contrary to our own best \ninterests, as well.\n  It is important to point out the inconsistencies associated with our \npolicies and the realization we have allowed ourselves to become so \ndependent. We were aware of it as evidenced by the section 232 Trade \nExpansion Act report. The President had it in 1994 by the Department of \nCommerce and he had it last November and he has not chosen to release \nit. That is where we are.\n  I conclude by reminding my colleagues that things are probably going \nto get worse in some areas of the country. We had the Senator from \nMaine indicate the difficulties associated with heating oil. Let me \nadvise the Northeast corridor that there may be higher electric \ngeneration prices coming this summer in their electric bills. Only 3 \npercent of the Nation's electricity comes from oil-fired generating \nplants, but in the Northeast corridor it is much higher. It is \nestimated that the older oil-fired plants will have to come online this \nsummer and the price will go up because they use a uniform price method \nto set prices.\n  In other words, the last energy source that comes online dictates the \nprice for the other sources and there is a windfall. In other words, \nthose providing electricity using gas, which is cheaper, charge the \nsame price as those generating electricity using oil. If I have not \nconfused the President, I think he has an idea of the point: \nElectricity prices will go up in the Northeast.\n  The Northeast corridor relies 33 percent, I am told, on fuel oil for \nits power generation. By some estimates, an oil plant that offered \nelectricity at $37 per megawatt hour 1 year ago may now seek a price of \n$75 or more--assuming fuel is purchased on the open market. It may be \nmore as owners of oil units are free to ask whatever price desired.\n  If there were an abundance of power this would not be an issue, but \nthere is not an abundance of power. It is very likely, according to the \nestimates we have received from sources in the industry, that every \nkind of generation available will likely be utilized this year in the \nNortheast corridor--including fuel-oil units.\n  The bottom line is that as long as OPEC controls the price of oil and \nwe allow our domestic production to continue to decline, American \nconsumers continue to pay the price.\n  The alternative is clear: We have to reduce our dependence on \nimported oil. To do that, we have to go across the breadth of our \nenergy sources. We have to have the people in the Northeast corridor \nrecognize the answer to their problem is more domestic production and \nless dependence on imported oil. That suggests an aggressive policy of \nopening up the overthrust belt in the Rocky Mountains, opening up \nAlaska, opening up OCS areas, and do it right, with the technology we \nhave. Otherwise, this situation will happen again and again and again. \nThe Northeast corridor will feel it first and foremost.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience and diligence in \nlistening to the presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Under the \nprevious order, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, or his designee \nis recognized to speak for up to 50 minutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I yield such time as necessary for this \npresentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, in the middle of a 10-day trip \nto Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel, I read a story in the \nInternational Herald Tribune about a discovery made by a joint Chinese-\nUnited States paleontology team in China. The team found 45-million-\nyear-old fossil remnants of an animal the size of a thumb they believe \nis a key evolutionary link between pre-simian mammals and human beings. \nFrom an analysis of the fossils, the team speculated that the animal \nmet an unfortunate fate: He became the regurgitated meal of a hungry \nowl.\n  Misery loves company and there are times in the Middle East when one \nfeels like that unfortunate animal trying to figure out and understand \nwhat our policy ought to be to pursue peace in that turbulent, \ndifficult region.\n  In the Middle East the search for peace can seem as slow to develop \nand the politics can be as brutal as the rules of natural selection \nwhere survival is the most important virtue. For most of the modern era \nsurvival in the Middle East has been defined in military terms. \nHowever, because the Middle East is not immune from the competitive \ndemands of the global economy, increasingly survival's definition has \nbeen modified with economic strategies and analysis.\n  That is among the most important reasons for improved chances of \npeace between Israel and Syria. To that end President Clinton's \ndecision to fly to Geneva, Switzerland to meet with Syrian President \nHafez al-Assad is a very hopeful sign. The President has a high degree \nof respect from both President Assad and Israeli Prime Minister Barak. \nAs such, he may be able to convince Mr. Assad to make some gesture to \nthe Israeli people which will make possible the eventual surrender of \nthe all-important Golan Heights. The Golan Heights were captured from \nSyria on June 10, 1967, at the end of the Six Day War, and have been a \npart of Israel for 33 years; no Israeli leader can surrender this land \nunless legitimate security concerns are thoroughly satisfied.\n  If the President's discussions with President Assad do help produce a \npeace agreement between Israel and Syria, it will add momentum to the \nsuccessful completion of final status talks between Israel and the \nPalestinians. It will decrease the potential for tragedy in southern \nLebanon following Israel's unilateral withdrawal by July 1. And \nfinally, it will increase the chances that Lebanon could become more \nindependent from Syria.\n  Syria's 15 million people are facing a very uncertain future. This \nuncertainty begins with the nature of their government--a dictatorship \nwith President Assad in absolute control. Mr. Assad has held power \nsince 1970 and has tried to give the impression of popular support with \ncoerced referendums; in 1991 he received a ``vote of confidence'' from \n99.9 percent of Syrians. However, Mr. Assad's age and health make it \nlikely that power will be transferred in the next few years. The \ncurrent leading candidate is the President's son, Bashar, a thirty year \nold ophthalmologist.\n  Peace with Israel would make it much more likely that President \nAssad's son would survive in power. A peace agreement would mean \nnormalized relations with Israel and an end to Syria's support of \nterrorism. It would make it more likely that badly needed investment \nwould enter the country and it would allow Syria to divert much needed \nresources from defense into health and education. The resulting \neconomic growth would bring new-found opportunities to the Syrian \npeople though not nearly as great as the opportunities they would have \nif they would begin a transition away from a dictatorship to democracy.\n  From the Israeli point of view, a peace agreement with Syria would \nbring benefits that could lead to solving regional economic problems as \nwell as contributing to a more favorable agreement with the \nPalestinians. Peace would mean that all three nations--Jordan, Egypt \nand Syria--with whom Israel has fought three wars would recognize \nIsrael's right to exist as an independent nation.\n\n  In theory it would seem like peace is possible, but the Middle East \nis a place where life is always standing theory on its head. Not only \nis a U.S. Presidential election coming to a theater near all of us in 8 \nmonths, but the political scene in both Syria--a dictatorship with \ntransition difficulties--and Israel--a democracy divided into smaller \nand less effective political groups than at an time in its 50-year \nhistory--makes it most likely that defeat will once more be snatched \nfrom the jaws of victory.\n  I would say the chances of success are comparable to making a three-\nball\n\n[[Page S1549]]\n\npool shot on a pool table littered with debris. However, given the \nbenefits of peace it is a shot work taking.\n  The benefits for the United States of an agreement between Israel and \nSyria are considerable. They include:\n  Improved security for Israel, our closest ally in the region;\n  Increased openness and opportunity for regional cooperation since \nIsrael would then have peace agreements with Syria, Jordan, and Egypt;\n  Decreased threat of terrorism directed at Israel or the United \nStates;\n  Increased chances that Lebanon can become a fully independent and \ndemocratic nation; and,\n  Greatly decreased threat of catastrophic use of weapons of mass \ndestruction in this fragile region.\n  The benefits to the United States must be quickly understood by \nCongress because when an agreement is reached, there is no doubt that \nthe United States will be asked to spend money in order to give both \nsides the confidence that peace will make them more secure. The figure \nof $17 billion over a 10-year period has been raised in the press, \nspecifically directed at funding means to give Israel the security \nwhich it currently enjoys from being present on the Golan Heights. The \ndollar costs are important, but I would like to focus less on the \namounts than on what will be needed to make an agreement successful.\n  First, Israel needs the assurance of early warning. It needs to be \nwarned about potential missile attacks--or other use of weapons of mass \ndestruction--so it can deter or intercept such attacks. It needs to be \nwarned of potential ground attacks so it has time to mobilize its \nground defenses. Without the assurance of early warning, the Israeli \npeople will not feel secure. To emphasize, Israel is a real democracy. \nThey do not have a dictator making the decision. The people have to \nfeel secure in order for a peace agreement to work. Without real \nsecurity, the Israeli people, quite rightly, will not support any peace \nagreement.\n  In my view, monitoring from the high ground overlooking the Golan \nHeights is essential to achieving any agreement and to maintaining \nIsrael's security. A largely automated equipment set should suffice, \nbut if personnel are required on site, I think American contractors, \nnot soldiers, can and should do the job. Operating on an isolated \nmountainside, they would be in more danger than are our peacekeepers in \nthe Sinai Multilateral Force of Observers. This is an appropriate task \nfor us.\n  Another potential cost, and one that is rarely mentioned, is economic \nassistance to Syria. The poverty and lack of economic dynamism in Syria \nis the fault of the Syrian regime, whose mania for control has largely \nsmothered the entrepreneurial instinct of Syria's talented people. And, \nunsurprisingly in a regime which has ruled  unchallenged for 30 years, \nthere is corruption. But if Syria will agree to a timetable of economic \nopening and a transition to democracy, U.S. economic aid for Syria \nwould be appropriate. Syrians need to see a peace dividend. Given the \nbusiness skills and ambition of Syrians, I expect a free-market, \ndemocratic Syria to move up quickly in global economic standings and to \nbe a partner with Israel in trade as well as in security arrangements.\n\n  Lebanon poses perhaps the biggest challenge to a comprehensive peace. \nIf Lebanon is to play a positive role in the peace process, and if \nLebanon is to become independent of Syrian domination, many Lebanese \nare going to have to act with both courage and generosity. As Israel \nwithdraws from southern Lebanon, Lebanese leaders should send their own \nrebuilt and united army to the south to disarm Hezbollah and the South \nLebanese Army and to prevent future attacks on Israel. Lebanon should \ndo this even if Syria objects. It is Lebanon's duty to be sovereign in \nall its territory, and to prevent attacks on other countries that \nemanate from Lebanese territory. I am sympathetic to all Lebanon has \nundergone over the past 25 years, but I am describing only the minimal \nduties of an independent state.\n  Occupying the south will take courage. Two other big problems--the \nfuture of the South Army and the future of Palestinian refugees in \nLebanon--will require generosity. The Lebanese Army should integrate \nthe SLA fighters into its own ranks and make them welcome. It should \nsimilarly integrate those Hezbollah combatants who request it. \nRegarding the Palestinians, some of whom have resided in camps in \nLebanon since 1948, Lebanon should likewise be generous. Those \nPalestinians who request it should be accorded citizenship and Lebanon \nshould make a special effort to integrate them fully into its national \nlife. It seems presumptuous of me to advise a country which fought a \nlong civil war over just such issues to now take bold action to \nintegrate its marginalized groups. But if Lebanon fails to do so it \nwill be neither peaceful nor independent, and its weakness will lessen \nthe chances of peace in the region.\n  Let us suppose that this extraordinary long shot works, that all \nthree balls go in their respective holes, and that Israel, Syria, and \nLebanon, with American help, make a real peace. There will still be \ndangers emanating from the Middle East. The weapons of mass destruction \nnow in the arsenals of Iran and Iraq, and the weapons those two states \nare still developing, present a lethal danger. The Iranian regime seems \nmore rational and more amendable to democratic change than does \nSaddam's regime in Baghdad, but there won't be true security in the \nregion until Iran and Iraq are free-market democracies and are fully \nintegrated into the family of nations.\n  Furthermore, looming overall these security challenges is the biggest \nproblem of the Middle East: The lack of water. Water is not a respecter \nof political boundaries; water shortages can only be solved on a \nregional basis, and if they are not solved diplomatically these \nshortages will be a longstanding source of military conflict.\n  Despite all of these challenges, it is still worthwhile for us to \nmaintain our patience for peace. The peace we are helping build today \nwill have enormous benefits. Perhaps the greatest benefit is that the \nburden of fear which overhangs the whole region will be lifted. I am \nthinking of the fear of a mother whose son has been drafted, the fear \nof a child in a bomb shelter, the fear that large crowds at a market or \nsports event might attract a terrorist bomb, the fear with which a \nfamily fits and adjust their gas masks, the fear of war that keeps \ninvestors away, the fear of the unknown alien race that lives in very \nsimilar circumstances just 30 miles away.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the people who deal with these fears \nare wonderful people. They are our friends, our actual relatives in \nmany cases. For many of us they are our spiritual cousins as well, they \nare at home in a region many of us call holy, and they have lived with \nfear for too long. That is why one of our Government's noblest efforts \nright now is the effort to help the pragmatism, good sense, and good \nwill of the region's leaders bring peace to the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \naddress an issue which is paramount now at this moment in time in this \ncongressional session. Each year, we have certain things we have to do \nbefore we can go home. The first of those things is to pass a budget \nresolution.\n  The President comes to Capitol Hill in January. He gives his State of \nthe Union Address and suggests a legislative agenda, as Presidents have \ndone, I believe, since President Woodrow Wilson. Then, shortly after \nthat speech, the President's wishes are translated into a budget \nproposal submitted by the President to Congress.\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\n  Of course, we have coequal branches of Government. We are very proud \nof our responsibility. We look at the President's budget as an \nindicator of where the country might be headed. Then we add our own \npriorities. We decide, if we agree with the President, that we will go \nforward with some of his spending plans. If we disagree, we come up \nwith our own proposal. That proposal is known as the budget resolution. \nIt is a resolution passed by the House, passed by the Senate, one we \nhope we can agree on, but it isn't signed by the President. It is \nreally the Congress' view of how we should spend the money the people \nof America give us to supervise and maintain.\n  The budget process is one where Congress has the burden on its \nshoulders. The President has met his responsibility. Now it is our \nturn. We usually try to make certain that before April 1 that budget \nresolution will be enacted so that then we can get to work on the \nAppropriations Committees.\n  The budget resolution is like a blueprint. The Appropriations \nCommittees take 13 different appropriations and spell out, in fine \ndetail, what the budget resolution has instructed them to do.\n  There are large-scheme things we consider and smaller things, as \nwell. On the larger scheme, we want to continue to bring down the \ndeficit that we have faced in this country for so long, and the \nnational debt which we have accumulated. On a smaller scheme basis--\ncertainly not small in terms of importance, but in spending, we \nconsider everything from the Federal prison system, education, the \ndefense of the country, foreign aid--you name it--each of the \nappropriations bills takes that into account. The first step is the \nbudget resolution.\n\n  I am a member of the Budget Committee. I kind of jokingly say that I \nserved a 6-year sentence on the House Budget Committee, and now I am \nback in the role of the Senate's Budget Committee serving my time as \nwell. It is not as tough an assignment as that might lead one to \nbelieve. We have a wonderful chairman in Senator Pete Domenici of New \nMexico; we have a great minority spokesman in Frank Lautenberg of New \nJersey. But we do have differences of opinion.\n  It appears this Presidential election year has made the budget \nprocess more difficult than ever. I think the majority party, the \nRepublican Party, has a tough job on their hands. They now have a \ncandidate for President, Governor George W. Bush, who has said his \nvision of America involves a substantial tax cut that goes primarily to \nthe wealthiest people in America. Virtually every Republican Senator \nand Member of the House has closed ranks and said he or she supports \nGovernor Bush, and that is the cornerstone of the Bush campaign, this \nlarge tax cut for upper-income Americans.\n  It has become difficult to convert the Republican Presidential \nprimary rhetoric into budget realities; in other words, to take the \npromises from the campaign stump by Governor Bush of a massive tax cut \nand turn it into a budget reality on Capitol Hill. I think that is why \nour budget process this week broke down. The Republicans canceled \ntoday's hearing to discuss the budget resolution. I am afraid the \nRepublican majority can't quite get it together.\n  I think they ought to think twice. I hope they do not include in \ntheir budget resolution Governor Bush's tax cut because, frankly, it is \na tax cut America cannot afford. It is one thing for us to say it is \nonly some $223 billion. In fact, it is much more over a 5-year period \nof time. If Leonardo DiCaprio and others will forgive me, we think the \nU.S. economy is doing very well, sailing along. In this Republican tax \nscheme, we see $223 billion up here that might be its cost over the \nfirst 5 years, but take a look at this iceberg below, which could sink \nthis ship, the U.S. economy. Once you have played out the cost of the \nBush tax scheme, it approximates $2 trillion; $2 trillion in an economy \nthat seems to be doing quite well as is.\n  Take a look last year at what was proposed by the Republicans as part \nof their tax relief. Over 5 years, it was $156 billion. Then as it grew \nover 10 years, it went to $792 billion. In this year's debate, the \nCongressional Republican budget plan is over $200 billion in the first \n5 years, and over 10 years, it just mushrooms and explodes in size.\n  One might say: Well, frankly, I would like to have a tax cut. \nWouldn't everybody, an individual, a family, a business? Of course. But \nwe have to ask a harder question. Would we risk endangering the current \neconomic growth in this country in order to pass a large and expanding \ntax cut that goes primarily to wealthy people? Would we be in favor of \nsuch a tax cut plan as opposed to paying down the national debt, a debt \nwhich, frankly, we have to raise tax money for every single day to pay \ninterest? Wouldn't it be better--incidentally, Federal Reserve Board \nChairman Alan Greenspan thinks so and I agree with him--to reduce the \nnational debt as opposed to giving tax breaks to wealthy people?\n  As that debt comes down, we are saying to our children: Here is an \nAmerica that is strong, a great democracy, a leader in the world, a \nnation unencumbered by debt that has been accumulated over the last \nseveral decades.\n  President Clinton's plan suggests that our first priority should be \nbringing down America's national debt before we start talking about \nmassive, risky tax schemes. I think the President is correct because in \nbringing down that national debt, we invest money in Social Security, \nmeaning that it is stronger longer, and we invest money into Medicare, \nthe health insurance plan for the elderly and disabled in America, a \nplan which needs our assistance. That, I think, is the responsible \ncourse.\n\n  As I have gone across my State of Illinois and met not just with my \nfriends on the Democratic side but independent voters and Republican \nbusinessmen and businesswomen, they agree. The most conservative, the \nmost disciplined approach is not a massive tax cut but rather bringing \ndown America's national debt so that our children are not burdened with \npaying interest on that. That is why my friends on the Budget Committee \non the Republican side are really having a tough time of it. They are \ntrying to sell something to America it is not buying. This Governor \nGeorge W. Bush tax cut is one that, frankly, could jeopardize our \neconomic growth, could take money away from reducing our national debt. \nI think the American people understand that is just not a good thing to \ndo.\n  The President's proposal is to focus on bringing down that debt--in \nfact, at three or four times the rate of what has been proposed by the \nHouse Republican Budget Committee--and at the same time, the President \nsays, with the surplus, without raiding Social Security, but with the \nsurplus, let's try to deal with some of the priorities of our Nation.\n  Take a look at our priorities: Save Social Security first; paying \ndown the debt; protecting Medicare. Here is one I found across Illinois \nthat is extremely important to people--providing a prescription drug \nbenefit for elderly people. Medicare doesn't include it. A third of the \nseniors do quite well and have coverage. Another third have some \ncoverage. But a third have none at all.\n  I have met these people. These are men and women who have \nprescription drug bills of $200 a month and more, living on fixed \nincomes. Many of us believe Medicare should include a prescription drug \nbenefit and some of the surplus should be dedicated for that. Sadly, \nsome of the proposals coming from the Republican side provide not a \npenny for a prescription drug benefit.\n  Then, from the same surplus, invest in education. I think we all \nagree and understand America is strong because we have a good \neducational system and a well-trained and well-educated workforce that \ncan compete in the world in the 21st century. We want to be able to say \nthis, too, can be an American century, and it means investing in \neducation.\n  What will we put the money into? Well, certainly to upgrade the \nskills of teachers so they can teach the latest in terms of science and \nmath and the best approaches to learning; in addition, modernizing our \nschools, and making sure they are safe. We can bring computer \ntechnology to our schools for every kid in America. We talk about \nafterschool programs so kids don't have those idle hours without \nsupervision. They have a chance to stay\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\nafter school, under supervision, to be tutored if they are falling \nbehind, enrichment courses if they are good students, counseling if \nthey are troubled. Those things are all helpful and move us in the \nright direction.\n  President Clinton has suggested that we should reduce class sizes so \nthat in the lower grades, when kids need more attention, we will have \nfewer kids in the classroom. I think that makes sense. I support the \nPresident on that. Those are investments in education with which most \nAmerican families would agree.\n  Then we think we can still have some money left for targeted tax \ncuts, not for the wealthiest people in the country but for working \nfamilies.\n  To give some examples, wouldn't it be great in America if working \nfamilies, in sending their sons and daughters to college, could fully \ndeduct their college education expenses? I think it would. I meet too \nmany families and young people who graduate from college with massive \ndebt. Sparing these young people and their parents this debt is a very \nworthy goal, indeed. I think the President's proposal of a tax cut for \nthe deductibility of college education expenses is a good one.\n\n  Let me share another example. The largest and fastest growing group \nin America's population are people over the age of 85. People are \nliving longer. As our parents and grandparents live longer, they run \ninto problems. Sometimes they need long-term care, and that can be \nexpensive. Many people don't have insurance to cover it. The President \nwants to give a targeted tax cut for working families to pay for this \nlong-term care for that parent or grandparent we love, that is the kind \nof targeted tax cut that makes sense. It doesn't jeopardize our \neconomic growth. It says let's help the families who are really \nstruggling to get by.\n  When we take a look at the tax cut that comes from the Republican \nside of the aisle, we can see that because it is so large, because it \nexplodes in the outyears, it is going to raid the Social Security trust \nfund. Take a look at this. Congressional Republican plans really could \ninclude a Bush tax cut that would raid Social Security to the tune of \nover $372 billion over a 5-year period. I thought that was something we \nall agreed, not too long ago, that we would not do again. We would \nprotect the Social Security trust fund. Yet this Bush tax cut plan \nendangers that trust fund--another reason I am sure the Republican-\ncontrolled Budget Committee is having a tough time getting started.\n  Take a look at the tax cut. I have said it helps the wealthiest of \nAmericans. Let's show this chart which proves it. When you take a look \nat the George W. Bush tax cut plan and the people who benefit from it, \nif you happen to have an income over $300,000 a year--and you don't \nhave to hold up your hand--you are going to see a tax cut of $50,000 a \nyear under Governor Bush's tax cut plan.\n  If you are a family with an income below $39,000 a year, it comes out \nto $249. That is about $20 a month. That is the Bush tax cut plan--$249 \nfor working families and $50,000 for the folks who are making over \n$300,000 a year.\n  So the Republican Presidential candidate would have us jeopardize our \neconomic growth, and would reach into the Social Security trust fund to \ncreate a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America of $50,000 a \nyear.\n  I have to tell you, quite honestly, if you are making $300,000 a \nyear, I am sure you can figure out what to do with another $50,000; but \nyou are probably pretty well off. If you have invested in the stock \nmarket during the Clinton-Gore administration, you have probably done \npretty well with your investments. I can't understand why George W. \nBush is focusing his tax cut on the wealthiest people in America.\n  Look at the prescription drug benefit plan. We understand what it \nwill cost. We understand under the House Republican budget what they \nthink it will cost for us to have a prescription drug benefit plan. The \nproblem is, in the House Republican budget no money is available for \nthat. Once you have dedicated yourself to the George W. Bush tax cut, \nyou lose the resources to provide for prescription drug benefits for \nthe elderly people in America.\n  For a moment, let me go back to education because I think this is \nworth repeating. What we are talking about under the President's plan \nis investing money in education. It is no surprise to me that everybody \nasked in national polls about the top issue facing Government will \nanswer that it is education. That is the No. 1 area that should be \nfunded and the No. 1 area we should pay attention to in Washington and \nin the State capitals. Now we are talking about making good on the \npromise to America that we elected officials will help out with \neducation.\n  Look at the President's plan: increasing education funding by 12 \npercent; making certain we prepare young children for school by \nexpanding the Head Start Program, one of my favorites; reducing class \nsize and training teachers.\n  As I go around in my State, I find this is something teachers want to \nhave--help and assistance to make sure they understand the technology, \nwhich changes almost on a weekly basis. Building up-to-date schools or \nmodernizing them is part of the President's investment for education \nplan; money invested in education technology so there is no digital \ndivide, so whether you are in a poor district, wealthy district, rural \nor urban, you will have the same access to technology. Kids coming out \nof the classroom will be part of our national workforce and they should \nall have the needed skills. Other priorities: helping the disabled, \npromoting afterschool learning, and improving college access and \naffordability by improving Pell grants, which help lower-income \nstudents complete their education, as well as the deductibility of \ncollege education expenses.\n  Let me say that the targeted tax cuts proposed by the Clinton-Gore \nAdministration and the Democrats, as I mentioned before, include \nhelping families care for elderly parents; targeting the surplus so it \ngoes to expanding educational opportunities; providing marriage penalty \nrelief, which both parties support; helping people prepare for \nretirement with new basic pension plans; and expanding the earned-\nincome tax credit, a benefit we give to a lot of working families who \notherwise might not be able to succeed. We want them to succeed.\n  The basic question we have to ask and answer during this budget \ndebate is whether America is headed in the right direction. You would \nexpect me, on the Democratic side and being proud of the record of the \nlast 7 years in terms of where our economy has come, to say, yes, I \nthink America is moving in the right direction. But as we ask American \nfamilies across the Nation, they agree; they know the Dow Jones \nAverage, which we follow now on a regular basis, has risen from some \n3,000 to over 10,000 in the last 7 years. They understand, as well, \nthat we have been able to see more businesses created across America, \nparticularly businesses owned by women. More people are building and \nowning homes than ever in the United States. Inflation is under \ncontrol. We see reductions in unemployment, reductions in the welfare \nrolls. We have the smallest welfare rolls in America in 30 years and \nthe lowest overall crime rate in 25 years. There are 20.4 million new \njobs under this administration.\n\n  Frankly, we are enjoying the first back-to-back budget surpluses in \n43 years. Not long ago, we were debating on the floor of the Senate \nabout amending the Constitution, a balanced budget amendment, so \nFederal courts could force Congress to stop spending into red ink and \ndeficits. Now we are talking about what to do with the surplus. Seven \nyears ago, in the era of spiralling budget deficits, who in the world \nwould have believed we would be talking about budget surpluses today? \nAmazing. And this has all occurred under the watch of the Clinton-Gore \nadministration. Most of us believe our country is moving in the right \ndirection and we should not launch some untried, unproven, new approach \nthat may jeopardize that economy.\n  I think the proposal by Gov. George W. Bush for massive, risky tax \ncuts for wealthy people does just that. You expect to hear that from a \nDemocrat. But go to somebody who might be dispassionate in this debate, \nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. He has basically said it \nis the wrong thing to do to give a massive tax cut. You could \njeopardize this economic growth. We don't want to see that happen.\n  Is America perfect? No. We don't like the cost of gasoline and \nheating oil today. We know we can do better in\n\n[[Page S1552]]\n\neducation. We know we can help families pay for some of their basic \nexpenses, take care of their parents and grandparents. So we continue \nto look for ways to provide that assistance to families. But we do \nbelieve we have made great progress over the last 7 years.\n  Now, the Budget Committee in the Senate has to try to calculate a way \nto put together a budget resolution, and they are in a dilemma. Are \nthey going to stand by their Presidential candidate, George W. Bush, \nand support a tax cut that risks the economic progress we have made? Or \nwill they turn their backs on their candidate and say, no, let's keep \ngoing on the right course and keep America moving forward?\n  I understand why they postponed this week's hearing, and I hope they \ncan resolve it in their own caucus. Let's bring this issue to the floor \nand let every Member of the Senate vote on the George W. Bush massive, \nrisky tax cut scheme. If they want to go on record supporting it, so be \nit, then they stand by their candidate. But they can step back and \nexplain how we are going to pay for it and why people making over \n$300,000 a year need a $50,000 tax cut. I don't think they will.\n  I think this country is moving in the right direction. I certainly \nhope Members of the Senate and the House, perhaps even on a bipartisan \nbasis, will say that continuing this economic progress in America is \nmore important than a ringing endorsement for any Presidential \ncandidate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak for 15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are on the eve of establishing a \nbudget priority for the budget year 2000, the one that begins in \nOctober and to next September.\n  I am the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee. I would like to \nestablish some parameters about the budget as I see it because we are \nwaiting patiently for the majority to produce a budget resolution, \nwhich is a responsibility of the Budget Committee. That is supposed to \nbe done by April 1 of this year. Other than meeting that deadline, the \nalternative would be for the majority leader to present a budget as he \nsees it.\n  The question arises: Why is it, when the target as proposed by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee is for a budget resolution to be here \nby March 1--and today is considerably past March 1--we are still \nwaiting?\n  I was advised yesterday as the senior Democrat on the Budget \nCommittee that we could expect to have a markup yesterday or today. \nThat was called off at a rather late moment last night. We are sitting \nhere, I will not say breathless but certainly curious, about what it is \nthat prevents us from getting a budget.\n  I have to do my own interpretation because I have not been given any \nexplanation. I know there are competent staff people working to get the \nbudget finished. We have them on both sides --on the Republican as well \nas on the Democrat side. Why isn't it finished?\n  Let me tell you why I think it is not and why we on this side of the \naisle think it isn't being done. It is because they can't get an \nagreement between the members of the committee. The tax cut package of \nGeorge W. Bush, candidate for President of the United States, is \nsomething that seems to me would break the back of this economy. It \nwould destroy all the rosy plans for paying down the debt, for making \nsure we rid ourselves of this obligation, this mortgage that we have \nall over our country. There isn't a family around who wouldn't look \nforward to the day when the mortgage on their home or the debt that \nthey have could be retired.\n  When we talk about a nice, healthy tax cut, or juicy tax cut for the \nwealthiest in the country, it doesn't ring a good bell even within the \nparty of George W. Bush, the Republican Party.\n  I know the chairman of the Budget Committee has had his hands full. \nHe is my friend as well as a colleague. He doesn't confide in me. We \nkeep our party business and our intentions separate. We discuss them in \nthe open. This is less than a bad joke. It is a travesty. It worries \npeople.\n  We are enjoying a boom the likes of which has never been seen in this \ncountry or anyplace in the world. The economy is perking along--almost \nboiling along. This is a wonderful opportunity to make needed \nadjustments within our structure. We can help families, particularly \nthe middle-class families, people who need a little bit of tax relief \nhere and there to help accomplish specific purposes. We can keep this \ncommitment, which we consider sacrosanct, sacred, to save Social \nSecurity first.\n  We want to take the surpluses which are generated by the robust \neconomy and use them to extend the solvency of Social Security. At the \nsame time, we want to pay down the debt. It has been the President's \nobjective to try to rid taxpayers of the public debt, that debt which \nis owed outside of Government, within about 15 years--bring it down to \nzero. What a difference it would make in our economy. We would be able \nto see people borrowing money without having to compete with the needs \nof the American Government, companies able to borrow without having to \ncompete with the Government for capital. It would be an excellent \nobjective if we could get there.\n  Protect Medicare, provide prescription drugs, extend the life of \nMedicare some 12-15 years, that is what the Democrats want to do.\n  We want to invest in education. I speak about education with a degree \nof knowledge because I came from a working-class family in New Jersey. \nMy father worked in the textile factories in Paterson, NJ. My mother \nwaited on tables. They struggled to make a living during those very \nlean years we were going through. We couldn't afford a college \neducation for me even though it was apparent I had the ability. College \ncame later on. I enlisted in the Army and was a beneficiary of the GI \nbill of rights. What a bill of rights it was for me. I was able to go \nto Columbia University. I never would have been able to afford that \notherwise. The Government said: Frank Lautenberg, you have served your \ncountry in Europe during World War II at the height of the war.\n  I came back and was able to get an education that helped me, with two \nvery good friends, start a business in the computing field. It was a \nlong time ago. We were pioneers. That company that I helped start \nemploys in the area of over 30,000 people today. I am listed as a \nmember of the Information Processing Hall of Fame. It is in Dallas, TX. \nThen I was able to run for the Senate. I am now in my third and last \nterm. It has made such a huge difference. I made a contribution to this \nsociety that has been so good to me between establishing a business, an \nindustry, employing people, and now being in this great body.\n  It means a lot when we talk about investing in education. We can say \nto young people across America: Even if you don't have the money, if \nyou have the ability to learn, we will help you achieve your \nobjectives--make an opportunity for yourself, lift yourself into a \nbetter lifestyle or better life pattern than your parents, who so often \nstruggle so hard.\n  Cutting taxes for working families to achieve those objectives, that \nis the Democratic budget agenda.\n  We talk about targeted tax cuts for families; help families care for \nan elderly parent with a $3,000 long-term care tax credit; Expand \neducational opportunities; Provide marriage penalty relief; Help people \nprepare for retirement; Expand the earned-income tax credit for those \nwho often need it desperately. That is our mission.\n  Instead, we are presented with something that hardly resembles that \nmission. We show this in graphic form by presenting this picture: a \nship at sea facing the tip of an iceberg. The iceberg is the Republican \ntax proposal,\n\n[[Page S1553]]\n\none that says you can spend more than you have and not admit that if \nyou want to keep on living, you may have to borrow money.\n  From where is that borrowing going to come? It will come from Social \nSecurity--that trust fund we hear everybody on each side, who would say \nunder oath, ``I want to make sure Social Security is there for those \nwho work and pay the taxes.'' They want to know when the time comes for \nretirement they will have something to look forward to.\n  Instead, what we have seen from the House Republican budget \npresentation that was sent over to the Senate is that we will have a \nsurplus, non-Social Security surplus, in our financial account, our \nbalance sheet, of $171 billion. However, the tax cut proposal we have \nseen is $223 billion. One doesn't have to be a mathematician to know if \none takes $223 billion away from $171 billion, one has to go elsewhere \nto pay the bills.\n  We made this very sacred promise, this commitment to the senior \ncitizens of this country. I am one of those senior citizens; I like it. \nIt is not bad.\n  The fact is, we made a promise, almost on bended knee, that we \nabsolutely will not touch, to paraphrase, a hair on yon gray heads for \nretirement opportunities. But the proposal we are looking at is one \nthat says we will spend $50 billion more on tax cuts than we have in \nour non-Social Security surplus.\n  That is not very good arithmetic. One does not have to be a \nmathematician, accountant, or economist to see that puts America deeper \ninto a hole that we will have to dig our way out. Just take it from the \nSocial Security, after we so diligently studied and agree that it is \nthe most sacred obligation this country has.\n  Where do we go from there? This graph ought to be presented \ndifferently. It shows a tip of the iceberg. The whole iceberg ought to \nbe lifted up because this is a crash we can see coming. If this program \nstays in place, the economy is going to run into a full-sized iceberg \nwith an enormous negative economic impact.\n  We are not going to be able to protect Social Security. We are not \ngoing to be able to pay down the debt. We will not be able to take care \nof obligations we have to veterans in education and health care. We \ncannot do that if we go ahead as planned.\n  We need to pay down our obligations. We need to give some targeted \ntax relief, to take care of the commitments we have. But, no, we cannot \ndo it because we are not going to have any money left with which to do \nit unless we borrow once again from Social Security. We have been \nthrough that. We had years and years of borrowing from Social Security \nto make up for the lack of revenue coming from the non-Social Security \nside of the ledger.\n  Finally, we are at a place in time where, with President Clinton's \nleadership and with the work of people on both sides of the aisle \nworking on a balanced budget, we have developed a surplus and now we \nare ready to start taking care of the financial structure of the \ncountry in a way so that we know we will be able to assure people \nMedicare will be there for them, that prescription drug costs, which is \nsuch a problem for so many elderly, will be taken care of in some form.\n  But we are not going to be able to do it if we put in place this tax \nscheme--and certainly, if not this one, Presidential aspirant George W. \nBush's tax plan, which is more than twice, almost three times, the size \nof the one that has been proposed in the House budget.\n  So the question for the American public is, Why is it that a \nRepublican majority, a significant majority, cannot get an agreement \nout that says: This is where we stand. Let the public judge the value \nof it. Let Democrats, let people outside, make judgments about the \ntruth in the presentation.\n  We have all kinds of smoke and mirrors that disguise what we are \ngoing to try to do here. But we know in the final analysis we are going \nto be borrowing money from the Social Security trust fund. So let's get \nit out here. Let's let the public see what it is that is going on \nbehind closed doors, because that is not the way we can operate \nanymore. We cannot operate with significant proposals and not permit \nthe public to scrutinize what it is we are doing.\n  We have to get to the job. We are way past the deadline we thought we \nwould be through. I am not happy about the prospect that a budget \nresolution will be dropped on the floor without having had the benefit \nof a committee discussion, some debate, some analysis in the public eye \nbefore we go ahead and start voting on it.\n  With that, I conclude by saying I and I know other members of the \ncommittee--Democratic members of the committee and I am sure many of \nthe Republican Members of the Budget Committee--are anxious to get out \nthe budget. If the leadership will accommodate us in the obligation we \nhave to the public to present it, we will have a chance to talk about \nsomething other than what is whispered about through the halls here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, I will propound a unanimous consent request. \nI have notified the Democratic leader that I intended to do that. I see \nthere are Senators on the floor who will probably have some comments to \nmake. But before I propound that request, let me outline what I would \nlike to do and what has transpired.\n  Senators will recall that last year there was a major effort made to \npass through the Senate bankruptcy reform legislation. That has been a \nbipartisan effort. The Judiciary Committee has done excellent work. \nChairman Hatch has been cooperative. Senator Grassley has been \nmagnificent in working with both sides of the aisle. Democratic \nSenators had input.\n  After some starts and stops, we made real progress, but it did get \nheld up at the end of the session. We did not get it completed.\n  When we came back in at the beginning of the year, we decided the \nbest thing to do was to move forward and have some votes on amendments \nthat were controversial on both sides, but we faced those votes. We got \nour work done, and we passed bankruptcy reform--basically, a good bill. \nThe House also has acted in this area.\n  We need to go forward and get bankruptcy reform legislation into \nconference and completed so we can improve this area in the law, so the \nlaw will be clearer for all those interested, and so we can send it to \nthe President for his signature.\n  In the process of the debate, and the amendments on this legislation, \namendments were offered with regard to the minimum wage. In fact, a \nminimum wage increase was passed and attached to the bankruptcy reform \nlegislation. Senator Kennedy offered the first amendment. That was \ndefeated. Then an alternative amendment was offered by Senator Domenici \nand others, and it did include small business tax relief to offset the \nimpact of a minimum wage increase. That was adopted. It became a part \nof the bill.\n  The problem in going forward is, because of the minimum wage and tax \nprovisions that were attached to the bill, it could be subject to, and \nwould be subject to, the so-called blue slip rules in the House. It \ncould be objected to, in effect, because it has the minimum wage and \nthe revenue measures as a part of it.\n  So we had not gone forward to try to send this to the House because \nof the potential blue slip problem and also to wait to see if the House \nwas going to go forward and act on minimum wage and the tax relief \npackage. In fact, a couple weeks ago, I believe it was, they did do \nthat. Now it is time we go to conference.\n  What I propose to do, even though I will do it in the Senate rules \nparlance--what it really says is split the two; send the Senate-passed \nbankruptcy bill to conference with the House-passed bill, have a \nconference,\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\nand they act on it, and then to separate out the minimum wage and the \ntax provisions and send them to conference with the House on minimum \nwage and the tax provisions.\n  I think that is the way to do all three of the issues. It is a fair \nway to proceed. It is a simple way to proceed. It gets rid of the blue \nslip problem, and then we can count on the conference to act on both \nbankruptcy and the minimum wage increase and the small business tax \nprovisions.\n  I just wanted to explain what was involved before I ask for unanimous \nconsent. But I am prepared to do that.\n  I ask Senator Daschle, do you want to comment before I propound that \nrequest or would the Senator like to do it after I do the request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's effort \nto try to move this legislation along. This bill, the bankruptcy bill, \npassed the Senate with more than 80 votes. Whether or not we get \nunanimous consent is not relevant. What is relevant is that we get \nthese two pieces of legislation successfully completed in a timely \nmanner. If we are not able to get unanimous consent, I intend to \nsupport finding a way to assure that we do go to conference both on the \nbankruptcy bill and the minimum wage.\n  I am hopeful we can instruct the conferees with regard to minimum \nwage. It would be my hope, at least, that the Senate could express \nitself in regard to the issue on minimum wage prior to the time we go \nto conference. But if we could accommodate that request, that we have \nat least an opportunity to express ourselves on the conference itself, \nthen I would certainly be supportive of moving on a motion to proceed \nto two conferences--one on bankruptcy and one on minimum wage.\n  The distinguished Senator from Vermont, and others, Senator \nTorricelli, Senator Durbin, and others, have done an extraordinary job \nin getting us to this point.\n  We have a much better bill, a stronger bill, in the Senate on \nbankruptcy than we do in the House. I hope we can take what we have \nbeen able to accomplish in the Senate and bring our House colleagues to \nthe realization that that is the kind of legislation that will be \nsigned into law.\n  On the minimum wage, the House version, at least in terms of the 2-\nyear approach, is the one the President said he will support. It enjoys \nstrong support in the Senate as well. We are concerned about the size \nand magnitude of the tax provisions. If we could target those, we would \nbe in good shape on that as well.\n  I understand the majority leader's interest in moving this. We want \nto be supportive in that regard; most of us do. I am hopeful we can \naccomplish it through a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield to Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with what the distinguished Democratic leader \nsaid. I would like to see us move forward. The bill we put together \npassed 83-14. The distinguished leader is right; it was in excess of 80 \nvotes. There was a tremendous amount of work on both sides of the \naisle. Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, Senator Torricelli, and I were \nthe four floor leaders on this, working with others--Senator Reid, \nSenator Daschle--to get people to take away hundreds of amendments. We \ngot rid of those, and we got down to several on which we voted and \npassed in a good package. I would advise the two leaders, I have been \nworking with Senator Torricelli, Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, and \nSenator Sessions to try to whittle it down even further, but to have a \npacket, one that could be acceptable on both sides of the aisle and \nalso could get signed down at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield on that point.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have been keeping in touch with the informal discussions \nthat have been going forward.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I know the majority leader has.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have the impression that the Senate potential conferees, \nDemocrat and Republican, have come up with a good proposal and are \nready to go forward with serious negotiations that I hope could be \ncompleted relatively quickly.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I hope we will find a way to go through this. I realize we \nhave issues of the minimum wage and others. We ought to vote them up, \nvote them down, whatever is necessary. I advise both leaders, I think \nwe have put together a good, bipartisan, compromise package that could \nbe the basis of final conference action and, if it were, would be \nsigned by the White House.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may just comment one second more before \nI propound the UC request, with regard to Senator Daschle's comments, \nwe do have a good, strong, bipartisan bankruptcy bill that we have \npassed. We also did have a debate and discussion on the minimum wage \nissue and the tax provisions. I didn't choose the debate and the \namendments to occur on this bill, but I knew it was going to come up \nand it should come up at some point. So it was offered to the \nbankruptcy bill. We had a good debate. We had a vote.\n  The interesting thing about the minimum wage, I think the parameters \nare pretty clear. We have the Senate-passed version, the $1 increase \nover 3 years, and the House version, that increase over a shorter \nperiod of time, only maybe a year or so. Then in the Senate provision, \nwe have some small business tax offsets, a relatively small package. \nThe House has a bigger package on the tax offsets. I think the \nparameters of the discussion on minimum wage are all represented in the \ntwo bills that have been passed. We can get conferees from the \nappropriate committees, and they can look at the minimum wage increase, \nand over what period of time, and the small business tax offsets or \nother tax provisions, and have a good conference and be able to get a \nresult. I hope we can do that without delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1554-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1554-S1556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to H.R. 3081, the House minimum wage bill now at the desk, and \nthat one amendment be agreed to, which is the text of the previously \npassed Domenici amendment No. 2547 now in the form of a substitute \nrelative to the minimum wage, the bill then be advanced to third \nreading and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that with respect to the bankruptcy \nbill, the Secretary of the Senate be directed to instruct the enrolling \nclerk to strike the Domenici amendment language just described above, \nall other parameters of the previous agreement be in order, and the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, objection was heard. If Senator Kennedy \nwould like to be recognized, I am glad to yield to him.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. President, I think Senator Daschle outlined what was a reasonable \nway of proceeding. I am under the impression that perhaps the majority \nleader has not had an opportunity to get into the kind of detail the \nDemocratic leader talked about.\n  Although I still need persuasion on the bankruptcy bill, I know what \nthe will of the Senate is on that issue. On the issue of the minimum \nwage, there wouldn't have been a blue slip on just the increase on the \nminimum wage. The blue slip was on the approximately $73 billion in tax \nbreaks that were added to the minimum wage.\n  The point our leader was attempting to work out was consistent with \nwhat the majority leader has outlined, and that is that at least there \nwould be a way in which the Senate would be able to address the minimum \nwage. Some colleagues may object to that process, but I would not.\n  As I understood Senator Daschle's proposal and the majority leader, \nby\n\n[[Page S1555]]\n\nsubstituting the Domenici bill for the House bill, there are 3 years. \nThat would go to conference. What he was asking for was not really any \nunusual procedure, just asking that we follow the Senate rules that \nwould permit a motion to instruct the conferees that, instead of being \n3 years, it would be 2 years. Given the fact it has been 6 months since \nthe Senate acted on the minimum wage and given the overwhelming support \nfor 2 years, which was bipartisan in the House, there might be support \nfor that. I believe there would be, if we had that opportunity to do \nso.\n  I hope the leader will consider what Senator Daschle proposed because \nit addresses the concerns of the leader and does it in a way in which, \nat least for those who are the most concerned about the 11 million \nAmericans who have not had a pay increase while we in the Senate have \nenjoyed a $4,600 pay increase in 1 year, they would have some degree of \nprotection.\n  Others have objected, and I join those and object with the hope that \nperhaps the leaders can get together and find value in what Senator \nDaschle offered as being a way to achieve the objectives of the \nmajority leader and the Senate and still protect the interests of the \nminimum-wage workers in this country.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may respond to that, I want to make \nsure we have an opportunity to consider those small business men and \nwomen who create the bulk of the entry-level jobs in America, to make \nsure they do not wind up having to go out of business or, even worse, \nthey don't hire the entry-level people who do deserve a basic minimum \nwage.\n  What I have been trying to do is to find the quickest and cleanest \nway, which is also not out of the ordinary, to separate these bills and \ngo on to conference and get a result that would be the best way to help \nall concerned, both those who will be negatively impacted if we don't \ngo forward with bankruptcy reform and those who are looking for a \nminimum wage increase, and those small business men and women who \nprovide so many jobs in America.\n  I understand if we don't do it this way, there is the further \ncomplicating factor that the bankruptcy bill will have to basically be \nstarted over again. We will have to have a new bill filed, and it will \nbe subject to amendment. There will be a very large amount of time and \ndifficulty in having to do that all over again. The procedure that was \nsuggested, I believe, is amendable and debatable.\n  We have had this debate. The question now is, Do we want to go on and \ngo to conference based on the votes already taken in the Senate and in \nthe House so that could get a result? That is why I asked consent to \nproceed in the way that I did. But we can talk about it further. I \nwould like to, for instance, make sure I understand correctly what is \nbeing asked for with regard to the bankruptcy reform bill because I \ncertainly hope that we would not have to completely rework that and \nhave that subject to amendment. We spent 2 or 3 weeks on that bill. So \nwhat we are doing here, we are talking Washingtonese, in effect. We are \ntalking about rules and procedures and how to do or not to do. I would \nlike to find a way to move all three of these issues, actually, quickly \nto conference and see if we can get a result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the interest of the majority \nleader in moving this legislation along. I recall how long it was that \nwe had to wait even to go to conference because of amendments that were \noutstanding. If I recall, we had to wait months, really, to \naccommodate, in fact, in this case, the majority; they wanted to offer \nsome specific amendments that they were not interested in voting on \nuntil we got back from the first session of the Congress. So this has \nbeen languishing for a long time in large measure because some on the \nmajority side were not interested in expediting consideration of this \nlegislation. We clamored for conference last year and were unsuccessful \nin getting the conferees appointed last year. Now the majority leader, \nunderstandably, is frustrated and concerned for the lack of progress. \nThat is understandable. There should not be any question that the \noverwhelming majority of the Senate wants to move to finish this \nlegislation as soon as possible. It is what we clamored for last year, \nand it is what we have been trying to get this year.\n  I hope there will be some degree of cooperation and communication \nwith regard to how we proceed. I look forward to talking more \ncomprehensively about my suggestion. It seems to me that going to the \nconference with the bankruptcy bill, as he has proposed, would make \nsense. Going to the conference on minimum wage would make sense if we \nhad the opportunity, once again, to express ourselves on it, since we \nhaven't been able to do that independent of the bankruptcy debate. If \nwe are going to have a separate minimum wage conference, there ought to \nbe a separate consideration, at least on the motion to instruct \nconferees. We could agree that it would not be amendable, that it would \nbe expedited and not delayed, but simply a vote would make a lot of \nsense, it seems to me. I am prepared to talk with the majority leader \nat greater length. We all recall how long it took to even get the bill \ncompleted, and that was in large measure because we weren't able to \ncomplete it as a result of concerns expressed by the majority.\n  We have now completed it. We now want to move on to the second phase \nof it. I want to work with the majority leader to see that it happens.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will inquire of Senator Daschle. Do I \nunderstand correctly that there is some thinking that we would have to \nstart over on the bankruptcy bill--or did that come as a surprise to \nthe Democratic leader? I had not had a chance to discuss that point \nwith him--and that it be subject to amendment and everything all over \nagain? Has the Democratic leader had a chance to look into that aspect \nof what we are trying to do?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am not aware of any effort on the part \nof Senators on this side to renew debate and start all over. As I said, \nI am more than willing and prepared to go to conference and to support \nefforts parliamentarily to ensure we are successful in going to \nconference.\n  I understand there are some strong feelings by a very distinct \nminority of the minority. It is their right, and certainly I respect \ntheir right to object. But there are other ways to deal with the issue, \nand I am prepared to find ways.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask the Senator to check into that and see if we can work \nthrough that point. I understand there are some Senators on that side \nof the aisle who do wish to go through that whole process again on \nbankruptcy. That would be an important part of working out this whole \nmaze of procedural questions.\n  Did Senator Wellstone wish to comment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wanted to make sure that I object. I \ndon't know if we have to go through the whole thing. The majority \nleader said we are talking in Washingtonese. To be clear about it, I \nthink the bill was harsh. It has a disproportionate impact on the \npoorest citizens, and it takes some off the hook----\n  Mr. LOTT. The bankruptcy bill?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct. We object to it being separated out. \nWe want to focus on this bill, and we want to have an opportunity to \nhave further discussion and debate on the floor of the Senate. So I \nobject on that basis.\n  Mr. LOTT. Would Senator Feingold like to speak?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes, I want to say a couple of words. I join in the \nobjection. I make no secret of the fact that I oppose each portion of \nthe bill. It is very unbalanced, and there is far too much money behind \nthe bill. I oppose the minimum wage portion because it involves 3 years \nrather than 2 years. I am especially concerned about the tax piece \nbecause it involves some $70 billion-plus that isn't paid for.\n  The reason I am objecting is because of the way this was put \ntogether. It got a high number of the majority by combining these \ndifferent elements. In effect, the pot was sweetened by adding on the \nminimum wage and the tax provisions. I think it is inappropriate at \nthis point to sort of bait and switch this. You close up the bill by \nputting these things together, and when they come back, you can't do \nanything about it under this procedure; it flies\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\nthrough. All we are asking, as Senators Kennedy and Wellstone have \nsaid, is that we have an opportunity to have the motions to instruct, \nand the minority leader's plan would provide that. That is the reason \nfor my objection. I thank the Chair and the majority leader for the \nopportunity to comment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1556-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 3081\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I will take a moment at this time to \nreview where we are on the question of the increase in the minimum \nwage. We have been trying to get, over the period of the last 2 years, \na vote on a 2-year increase in the minimum wage--50 cents this year and \n50 cents next year--for the 1 million Americans who are at the lowest \nlevel of the economic ladder.\n  These men and women are the ones working as aides for schoolteachers \nin our schools. They are working in nursing homes taking care of \nmillions of our senior citizens in those conditions. These are the \npeople who clean out the buildings at night so American businesses can \ncontinue to function effectively over the course of this extraordinary \nexpansion. But as we see this extraordinary expansion in terms of our \nAmerican economy, the group that has not benefited is the one at the \nlowest end of the economic ladder. These are men and women playing by \nthe rules and working hard. They have not been able to see the \nappropriate kind of increases in the minimum wage.\n  If the minimum wage today were to have the same purchasing power it \nhad in 1968, it would be $7.50 an hour. This whole group of Americans \nhave not only not participated in the expansion of the American \neconomy, they have fallen further and further behind.\n  That is why we believe we ought to have an opportunity to address \nthis issue on the floor of the Senate, and do it in a timely way.\n  There are questions about what the Senate is doing and how busy the \nSenate is. We are prepared to have a very short time limit. Every \nMember of this body knows what this issue is about. I think every \nMember of this body has voted effectively on the question of the \nminimum wage over a period of time. It is a rather simple, basic, and \nfundamental issue. It is an issue of fairness to millions of Americans. \nIt is an issue involving women because close to 70 percent of all of \nthe minimum-wage workers are women. It is an issue of civil rights \nbecause the majority of the workers who get the minimum wage are men \nand women of color. It is a children's issue because the majority of \nwomen who are receiving the minimum wage have children.\n  This has enormous implications in terms of how these children are \ngoing to grow up, what kind of home they are going to be in, and how \nmuch time their parents are going to have in terms of spending quality \ntime with these children when they are working one or two, and in some \ninstances three different minimum-wage jobs.\n  It is ultimately and finally a fairness issue where the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans believe, and believe very strongly, I think, that \nmen and women who work 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year ought not \nlive in poverty in the United States of America.\n  That is what this issue is basically all about, and we in the Senate \nare being denied the opportunity to vote on that issue. That is what is \noffensive.\n  This body was prepared to vote on a pay increase of $4,600 to be \nimplemented immediately. They were prepared to go ahead on that. They \nare not prepared to delay that. But when you talk about a $150 increase \nin the minimum wage, they want to spread it over 3 years.\n  This is an issue of fairness. People ought to have accountability. \nWhen Members go to the polls, people in their congressional and \nsenatorial districts ought to know how they stand on this issue of \nfairness. We are being denied that opportunity by a majority in the \nSenate. That is wrong.\n  Anyone who believes we are not going to continue after this issue \ndoesn't understand the rules of the Senate. We are going to be voting \non a 2-year increase in the minimum wage. We are going to be voting on \nit soon, and we are going to be voting on it again and again and again. \nSo get used to it because you are going to vote on it. You will be able \nto go back and say: Oh, yes. I voted one time to increase it for 3 \nyears. Yes; I voted against it 15 times for 2 years. And for all those \nin small business, I voted for a $73 billion tax break, unpaid for.\n\n  The House bill was $123 billion. We don't want to hear from that side \nof the aisle about fiscal responsibility anymore--$73 billion at the \ndrop of a hat and $123 billion over in the House of Representatives and \n90 percent of it goes to the top 5 percent of the American taxpayers. \nIsn't that interesting?\n  We are trying to get a 50-cent increase for the lowest paid \nAmericans--tax break; 90 percent of it goes to the highest paid. We are \nnot going to permit Members of the Senate to vote. We have a majority. \nWe are not going to permit a majority of the Senate to vote on whether \nwe are going to have a very simple concept of 50 cents this year--50 \ncents. No; we are going to take our $4,600 and put it in our pockets \nand walk out of here. For every single year of that, an increase in the \nminimum wage is being delayed.\n  Do you think they are going to forget that? The other side thinks it \nis going to go away. It isn't going to go away. No matter how many \ntimes these little proposals are going to come up in terms of consent \nagreements, no matter how many times you are going to try to close out \nopportunities to bring this up, no matter how many times you go through \nthe parliamentary gymnastics on this kind of issue, it is coming back \nagain and again and again. So get used to it because you are going to \nget it. You are going to vote on it. Americans are going to know who is \ngoing to stand for fairness and decency and who is opposed to it and \nblocked it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized in \nrecognition of the fact that very shortly we may have an agreement on \nthe crop insurance risk management debate. At the suggestion of the \nleadership, I would like to initiate debate on the subject, and perhaps \nwe can move along expeditiously in the event we finally have a \nparliamentary structure in which to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1556-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1556-S1562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AGRICULTURE RISK MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President,  today we will debate a matter of special \nsignificance and timeliness to agriculture producers throughout the \nUnited States, and that is the subject of risk management legislation.\n\n  During many full committee hearings, a public roundtable and hundreds\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\nof hours of research and public discussion spanning the past year, \nmembers of the Senate Agriculture Committee have engaged in active \ndeliberation, considering a host of options in providing risk \nmanagement assistance to our Nation's farmers.\n  The task has been formidable. Variances in agriculture production, \nregional considerations of weather patterns, and different perspectives \non farm management have contributed to a most complex and yet \nbeneficial discussion.\n  The foundation of our efforts was section 204 of the Concurrent \nResolution on the Budget for fiscal year 2000. Six billion dollars was \nprovided over a 4-year period commencing October 1, 2000 for \nagricultural risk management. The basic rationale was that farm \nproducers could take action to minimize risk, including severe market \nprice fluctuations, and therefore render emergency recovery legislation \nless necessary.\n  My colleagues Senator Grassley and Senator Conrad played a major role \nin the Budget Committee's action on risk management and have advocated \ncrop insurance legislation offered by Senator Roberts and Senator \nKerrey that would increase Federal subsidies for crop insurance premium \npayments to make Federal crop and revenue insurance policies more \naffordable for farmers, particularly at the higher levels of coverage.\n  In recent months, I suggested that risk management strategy involves \nmore than crop insurance. Cash-forward contracts, hedging contracts, \nreduction of farm debt, diversification of crops, conservation, and \nsubstantial capital land improvements are important risk management \ntools also available to farmers, and hopefully will be utilized by \nfarmers.\n  As a result of our extended debate on risk management matters in the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, more producers are aware or at least \nreminded of the risk management tools available to them. I am grateful \nfor the support so many have shown to my initiative.\n  Nevertheless, on March 2 of this year the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee acted and approved legislation, principally the legislation \noffered by Senators Roberts and Kerrey, that over the next 4 years \nrecommends $6 billion for improving and strengthening the Federal Crop \nInsurance Program, beginning with the 2001 crop. Included in the bill \nis a pilot program providing $500 million in direct risk management \nassistance to farmers who choose to forego crop insurance subsidies in \na particular year.\n  A producer would receive a risk management payment for utilizing 2 \nout of 12 risk management options. The legislation also raises premium \nsubsidies to make Federal crop and revenue insurance policies more \naffordable for farmers, particularly at the higher levels of coverage. \nThe bill eases actual production history so that farmer insurance \ncoverage is less likely to be artificially suppressed by successive \nyears of bad weather; encourages the development of insurance coverage \nfor specialty crops and revenue insurance on a whole farm rather than a \ncommodity-by-commodity basis; it eliminates requirements of the area-\nwide loss before disaster payments can be made to producers of \ncurrently noninsurable crops; and it reduces the potential for \ninsurance fraud and abuse with strong program compliance provisions.\n  In my judgment, it is very important that the Senate act favorably \nand promptly on this legislation. It will provide an important safety \nnet component for agricultural producers.\n  Let me mention a practical example of how crop insurance works in my \nown situation. There may be others in this body who have been \npurchasers of crop insurance on their farm. The Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley, comes to mind. I have utilized crop insurance on my farm. Let \nme suggest to the Chair the crop insurance that is now available to \nfarmers may insure the yield; that is, take a look at your farm and try \nto make certain that the yield you believe you would normally get is \ngoing to be there through insurance, or at least as great a percentage \nof that as possible you can insure, and for a premium price you can \ninsure that yield. Or farmers can insure the revenue that might come \nfrom yield and price and take out a policy that might cover that \nsituation. Farmers can do both--yield and revenue.\n  There have been in the past catastrophic insurance policies. They \ncontemplated the loss of over half of the crop. A while back, such \ninsurance was required. The requirement was relieved by the farm bill \nof 1996. This is available to farmers to guarantee income to them, \nregardless of the weather or other hazards that might come from nature; \nlikewise, hazards that might come from loss of exports as it affects \nthe revenue that comes from that farm.\n  To take a very practical example, last Friday I was in a situation \nwhere I was able to make a sale of 2,000 bushels of corn from my farm \nto a grain elevator in Indiana. A commonsense person would ask: But you \nhaven't planted the crop yet; where did you get the corn to make a \nforward contract, a promise, to deliver 2,000 bushels of corn? I \npromised to deliver that corn in March of 2001, and I will receive \n$2.57 a bushel for that corn.\n  For me, that was a significant contract. That may not be the top of \nthe market, but I point out that in our debates on agricultural pricing \nlast year, the Chair will recall some debaters pointed out that the \nprice of corn had fallen to $1.70 a bushel. Many pointed out that \neffectively there was a floor through the loan deficiency payment of \nabout $1.96 for corn farmers throughout the country. That was the \nminimum price for corn in most sections of our country. The current \ncash price for corn in some elevators around the country is somewhere \nbetween $2.10 to $2.15, as of March, if you are going to deliver.\n  I mention this to give some benchmarks. Mr. President, $2.57 is \nobviously much higher than the floor of $1.96 which would still prevail \nin the current crop we are speaking about, much higher than the current \ncash price. That is, obviously, far higher than journalistic accounts \nof how far the price of corn fell last year.\n  I was able to make that sale because I have crop insurance. Last \nyear, I took out a 65-percent CRC policy, a crop revenue coverage \npolicy. That particular policy means, in essence, I can take a look at \nthe number of acres I want to plant, the average yield from those acres \non my farm. The crop insurance people then take a look at the price of \ncorn in the December futures as reflected for a period of 30 days; they \ntake a look at what happened in the past. In essence, I am guaranteed \nat least that if I want to I can sell my crop in advance and take bold \nmaneuvers with regard to marketing.\n  That is one of the major purposes of crop insurance. What I have \ndescribed is a fairly simple device used by most farmers; namely, a \nforward contract, based upon the fact you have something to sell and \nbased upon the fact the price for corn goes up and down. You can look \nat futures markets. You can look at the trends and make sales. You are \nnot left to wait for the elevator price at the time the corn comes in. \nAn abundant harvest sometimes puts corn and other grains on the ground \nbecause elevators cannot handle it or railway cars cannot take it away.\n  I mention this because crop insurance is obviously an extremely vital \npart not only of a safety net to make sure farmers are going to have a \nsubstantial amount of income but as a part of marketing strategy. As a \npart of this debate, we have talked about marketing strategies because \nthey are going to be required for most farmers in America to make a \nprofit and to do well enough to support their families. It will not \nwork for farmers to plant, as they always have planted, whatever does \nwell on their land, and to hope that the price will be high at the time \nof harvest. As a rule, price is low at the time of harvest. Unless \nthere is a marketing strategy, farmers do not maximize their income, \nand many are not doing very well.\n  This is a very important part of the 1996 farm bill legislation. As \nmy colleague, Senator Roberts, has pointed out during his chairmanship \nof the House Agriculture Committee, this is a part of the picture that \nwas never completely filled in. We have an opportunity to do that \ntoday.\n  The bill Senator Roberts, Senator Kerrey, and their staffs have \nresearched, and which I support, calls for higher possible percentages. \nI spoke of a 65-percent policy which I took out last year, but higher \npercentages are\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\npossible. Of course, that means higher premiums.\n  The bill before the Senate lessens those premiums to farmers by \noffering a much stronger subsidy. There is a certain inversion of the \nsubsidies. By that I mean, if farmers reach out for more safety, \nfarmers receive more support from this bill. The point is to try to \npersuade farmers to take seriously the safety net provided by crop \ninsurance risk management tools. This bill goes a long way to offering \nthose incentives.\n\n  Let me take, once again, a concrete example anecdotally from my own \nsituation last year. The premium for my crop insurance on my corn crop \nwas $1,700, quoted by the crop insurance salesman out in Indiana. \nUltimately, I paid about $700-plus. The subsidy to the policy was about \n$1,000. That is a very strong inducement to take crop insurance \nseriously.\n  In my home State of Indiana last year, approximately 44 percent of \nfarmers did take crop insurance seriously, although many at much lower \nlevels--some at simply the catastrophic level, at a very low premium. \nTherefore, even after we pass this legislation, which I hope we will \ndo, and confer with the House--they have passed legislation that is \nvery similar to this--and enact this so it comes into force prior to \nthe fiscal year that begins the first of October, each one of us will \nhave an obligation to visit with our farmers, to visit with the \nextension offices of our agricultural universities and others, to \nexplain the possibilities that are there for risk management for a very \nlarge safety net provided in the farm bill and provided by the Budget \nCommittee for these next 4 years.\n  This is an extraordinary opportunity. We owe it not only to the \ncountry to pass legislation, but we owe it to our farmers to make sure \nour advocacy reaches a new level of information and education about \nvery constructive legislation.\n  I yield the floor for my distinguished ranking member of the \nAgriculture Committee. In due course, I know Senator Roberts will want \nto be heard, and should be heard, and Senator Kerrey, who have been \nlargely responsible for fashioning portions of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his leadership \nand graciousness on this bill and for working hard to get it out on the \nfloor in a timely manner. I am hopeful that we can dispose of it fairly \nrapidly today and move on.\n  We are here considering passage of a crop insurance reform bill that \nwe just reported out of the Agriculture Committee on March 2. It has \nbeen a long and difficult journey to get to this point, not the least \nbecause we had a lot of good ideas from Members of this body and of the \ncommittee. I think there were no fewer than six comprehensive bills \nintroduced on this issue. I would like to think the bill we will have \nat the desk shortly incorporates the best provisions of each of them. I \nam sure our colleagues in the House are eager for us to finish our work \non this because they passed their crop insurance bill last September. \nSo hopefully we can get this passed and get to conference and get this \nthing wrapped up.\n  The bill we are going to have before us shortly, S. 2251, takes \nadvantage of the opportunity offered by last year's budget resolution \nto apply $6 billion to a reform of the Federal crop insurance system. \nThis effort probably has taken on some added urgency recently due to \nthe low commodity prices faced by our farmers. But I caution my \ncolleagues not to place too much emphasis on the potential role of crop \ninsurance in remedying those problems. When the last set of crop \ninsurance reforms were passed in 1994, this program was complemented by \na number of others which together comprised what was called the farm \nsafety net. Much of the countercyclical element of that safety net was \nremoved by Freedom to Farm, laying the foundation, I think, for some \nunreasonable expectations about the ability of crop insurance to offset \nthe effects of an agricultural economy that went south. I do not mean \ngeographically.\n  Aside from problems in the general farm economy, which crop insurance \nwas never intended to deal with, the last few years have exposed other \nweaknesses in the program, which this bill does attempt to address. \nFirst of all, although the program currently covers about two-thirds of \nacreage for eligible crops, much of that coverage either represents \ncatastrophic policies or policies at the lower levels of buy-up \ncoverage. This bill offers enhanced subsidies for the purpose of buying \ncrop insurance. Under the current system, the percentage subsidy peaks \nat the 65/100 level, making farmers eat a 35-percent loss of crop value \nbefore they qualify for any relief. We want to encourage farmers to \ninsure their crops at a higher level of buy-up, which we hope will have \nthe effect of reducing the probability of future ad hoc disaster relief \nprograms. We are also equalizing premium subsidies for revenue \ninsurance coverage, which Iowa farmers have eagerly adopted. In 1999, \nCrop Revenue Coverage and other revenue products covered more than 60 \npercent of insured acres in my State of Iowa, I might add, the highest \npercentage in the country. The revenue insurance concept was one of the \nbest things to come out of the 1994 reform, and I want to thank those \nat USDA and the private sector who did the hard work to make it \navailable.\n  In addition, this bill includes provisions which fixes APH problems \nassociated with multi-year natural disasters, makes the Noninsured Crop \nDisaster Assistance Program more attractive, and offers greater support \nand flexibility in conducting research and development of new crop \ninsurance products, especially for specialty crops. On the \nadministrative side, it strengthens oversight of the industry and \npenalties for noncompliance and fraud, clarifies reporting \nrequirements, makes changes to the structure of the Board of Directors \nof the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, and requires USDA to pay \nmore attention to regions of the country where crop insurance is not \nviewed as an attractive option.\n  Chairman Lugar offered a competing vision for addressing concerns \nabout crop insurance and risk management for farmers. His approach was \nto encourage farmers to adopt a wide range of risk management \npractices, rather than focus just on crop insurance. In the spirit of \ncompromise, this bill included a $500 million risk management pilot \nwithin the substitute amendment offered and passed in committee, and I \nlook forward to what USDA learns from implementing this program for 3 \nyears, assuming it will be implemented into law.\n  I am pleased that the committee adopted an amendment I offered during \nmarkup which restores the conservation compliance requirement for crop \ninsurance, which passed by voice vote. I do not believe it is \nunreasonable to treat crop insurance and risk management payments in \nthe same way as we treat FSA loans, disaster payments or any other USDA \nbenefits. For all those other benefits, farmers do have to comply with \nconservation programs. That is especially so considering that crop \ninsurance is already a substantial USDA program, costing nearly $2 \nbillion a year. With this legislation, we will add about $1.5 billion a \nyear in additional spending for crop insurance and risk management \nprograms. It seems only right that for some $3.5 billion a year, we \nshould be doing all we can to ensure the programs are also promoting \nconservation of our precious soil and water.\n  We also worked to strengthen the risk management program by adding \nresource management practices and organic farming as eligible options, \nand instructed the Risk Management Agency to view scientifically sound \nsustainable and organic farming practices as good farming practices.\n  All in all, I think this crop insurance bill is a good piece of \nlegislation. I especially want to compliment my colleagues, Senator \nKerrey of Nebraska and Senator Roberts from Kansas, for their strong \nleadership in a bipartisan manner on this bill. I believe they have \nengineered and built a good bill, a bill that will help us in all parts \nof the country in those things I just spoke about--everything from \nspecialty crops in one area to the big wheat and grain crops in other \nparts of the country--with the provisions in there that mandate that \nUSDA is to find new ways of making crop insurance more attractive in \nthose areas of the country that have low sign-up rates. Finally, I \nthink the\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\nvision of both Senator Roberts and Senator Kerrey in getting the \nsubsidies for the buy-up--that really is the heart and soul of this \nbill to ensure that farmers will have a better deal when they buy up \ntheir risk coverage for their crops and their crop insurance programs.\n  It is a good bill. It deserves the support of the Senate. Hopefully, \nwe can get it up, and hopefully get it through in due course yet today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, as has been indicated by my colleagues, \nthe distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, we have before us--we do not have before us, but we would \nlike to have before us S. 2251, entitled the ``Risk Management for the \n21st Century Act.'' It has been certainly aptly described by the \ndistinguished chairman and Senator Harkin.\n  This legislation is a slightly modified version of a bill by the same \nname; that is, S. 1580 which was introduced by Senator Kerrey and \nmyself last fall. It was supported by a large number of our colleagues.\n  Our farmers and ranchers have to deal with multiple threats of \nweather and pests and disease that few, if any, businesses must \nexperience on a daily basis. As we all know, it can often be a very \nbrutal up-and-down cycle, a real price roller coaster that our farmers \nand ranchers must face. To get through these cycles, our producers must \nhave crop insurance and risk management tools at work.\n  This bill represents a real personal effort on my part and that of my \nstaff, as well as Senator Kerrey and other colleagues.\n  But it was about 20 years ago that my predecessor in the House of \nRepresentatives, the Honorable Keith Sebelius, cast the deciding vote \nto create the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Since that time, it has \nbeen almost 20 years now we have gone through numerous reforms to get \nthis right. This has been a personal commitment of mine for some time.\n  If you sit on the wagon and listen to farmers, regardless of which \nregion they come from, or what commodity they are involved in, time and \ntime again they have come to us and said it is time for major reforms \nin the program.\n\n  Two years ago, Senator Kerrey and I agreed to work together on this \nissue. I said: Bob, do you think we can do this?\n  He said: Well, we don't have any other alternative but to try.\n  Tackling the national and comprehensive Crop Insurance Program has \nbeen--I don't know--sort of like pushing a rope. But we certainly \nagreed on the issue. We have been working on this legislation with able \nstaff and with the help of the chairman and the distinguished ranking \nmember. We have been working on this for nearly 18 months nonstop.\n  We began the effort in earnest when we gave every farm, commodity, \nlending, and insurance group the opportunity to provide their \nsuggestions for improvements in the Crop Insurance Program. We asked \neverybody--we cast a wide net: How do you want to improve this?\n  The response to this call for comments was overwhelming. The comments \nwe received certainly gave us a clear and common direction in which we \nneeded to go in regard to this legislation.\n  Who am I talking about? If I could find the list here because we have \na letter dated just a couple of days ago:\n\n       As organizations representing farm, lending, and insurance \n     industries, we are writing to strongly urge that the Senate \n     pass the recently reported Senate Agriculture Committee crop \n     insurance risk management bill.\n\n  We have the American Association of Crop Insurers, the American \nBankers Association. Don't forget, this is a lender's issue as well. \nThis is an issue that affects the lending institutions. Many of them \nsimply will not continue to go down the road on behalf of our producers \nwithout what they believe is reasonable crop insurance.\n  We have the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Feed \nIndustry Association, the American Nursery and Landscape Association--\nlet me repeat that--the American Nursery and Landscape Association. Why \nam I saying that? Because that particular group represents, in many of \nthe Northeastern States, the No. 1 major agriculture interest. I \nunderstand there is some concern on the part of those from the \nNortheastern part of our country that perhaps their needs have not been \naddressed to the extent that they believe would be commensurate with \nproper reform.\n  We have the American Soybean Association, the Crop Insurance Research \nBureau, the Farm Credit Council, the Independent Community Bankers \nAssociation, the Independent Insurance Agents of America.\n  I do not mean to get too tedious, but this is a long list of \neverybody involved in agriculture who has come to the conclusion that \nthis bill is a good bill and we should pass it.\n  We have the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National \nBarley Growers Association, the National Corn Growers Association, the \nNational Farmers Union, the National Grain Sorghum Producers, the \nNational Pork Producers Council, the National Sunflower Association, \nthe National Association of Professional Insurance Agents, the Rural \nCommunity Insurance Services, the Society of the American Florists. If \nMembers will vote for this, they will get a floral bouquet, as well as \nbouquets of credits from all these organizations.\n  We have the U.S. Canola Association. I could go on with other lists, \nbut I think I have made my point.\n  These groups told us to do the following. This also represents all \nthe producers from all regions of the country, every commodity group, \nthat told us, No. 1, to make higher levels of coverage more affordable. \nWe want to encourage our farmers and ranchers to buy up more crop \ninsurance, certainly not less.\n  Second, to provide an equal subsidy for both yield and revenue \ninsurance products. It is the revenue insurance product that may well \nbe the foundation for the next farm bill. I am not saying that will be \nthe case, but certainly that is an option. So to improve those \nproducts, it seems to me, is very important.\n  The chairman has gone over this in his remarks.\n  Third, to develop steps to address the problems associated with a \nlack of production history for a farmer that is just beginning and \nconcerns that an adequate policy does not exist to address multiple \nyears of disasters. How many times have we had a farmer come and \ntestify before the committee and say: Look. I can't get any crop \ninsurance. I have been hit. The Good Lord was not willing, and the \ncreeks did rise or they didn't rise, and we got into all sorts of \nmultiple disasters and I could not get the crop insurance.\n  Fourth, the creation of new and expanded crop insurance policies for \nspecialty crops and improvement in what is called the Noninsured \nAssistance Program, which covers many specialty crops.\n  I am going to come back to that because when we put together this \nbill, Senator Kerrey and I knew we had to reach out to every region of \nthe country. We knew there was a lot of consternation and frustration \non the part of Members who represented farmers from the Northeast and \nproducers also from the South that the current Crop Insurance Program \nwas not favorable to their interests, that it was discriminatory.\n  So we sat down with staff. I remember in one of the first meetings we \nhad, why, Senator Kerrey told me: Pat, we have to reach out to these \ngroups. We have to cover the specialty crop producers, more especially, \nsince the Northeast and the Eastern part of the country went through \nsuch tough times in regards to last year and the drought.\n  We have tried to do that. It seems to me to be a paradox of enormous \nirony that the very region of the country we are reaching out to, now \nwe have distinguished Senators who are privileged to represent the \nfarmers and the ranchers and the producers, the specialty crop folks \nfrom that part of the country, saying: Well, wait a minute. We're \nworried that this bill does not address our concerns. Address them? We \nreached out to them. This is the most favorable crop insurance reform, \nI won't say that could be imagined, but these are the very folks to \nwhom we reached out.\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\n  Next the farmers told us: We want some increased emphasis in \nspecialty crop policy research and development; use the good offices \nand the expertise and skill of the Department of Agriculture for pilot \nprojects with regard to research and development for specialty crops, \nnot only the program crops, the wheat, barley, corn, and feed grains, \nall of that, cotton and rice, but the specialty crop folks; they \ndeserve that. And that is in the bill.\n  They asked for major changes in the Federal Crop Insurance \nCorporation's board of directors, more farmer input, if you will. That \nhas certainly taken place.\n  They asked to streamline and remove the roadblocks in the product \napproval process. Somebody could come up with a new pilot project and \nit would lay around 6 months, 8 months, a year, and we couldn't get any \napproval. We have deadlines now to be approved.\n  We take some significant steps to address the fraud and abuse of the \nprogram. The chairman has pointed out that we don't want a situation \nwhere if you are going to reform crop insurance, you simply encourage \npeople from challenged lands, if that is the proper term for it, to \nfarm the program, if you will. We have very strong language in regard \nto fraud and abuse. I cannot imagine any producer who, once they take a \nlook at the penalties, would ever go down that road.\n  It is my hope the bill does all the things I have said and more. I \nhave the rest of my statement here. I will not ask that it be put in \nthe Record at this point because I would rather simply go into the \ndetails when we have the bill before us and have a time agreement. I \nhope we can get the time agreement.\n  Again, I think it is a paradox of enormous irony that when you reach \nout to certain sections of the country, you find yourself in a real \nquandary. You scratch your head and have a lot of frustration. You have \nsome degree of concern that Senators from the very part of the country \nyou have included in the major crop insurance reform--and by \n``included,'' I mean asking those Senators and their staff to come to \nus and to provide some answers; they have done so, and we have put it \nin the bill. Now it seems that this is where the concern is coming \nfrom, and we are holding up the bill.\n  I can go into all of the provisions we have for specialty crops; \ni.e., the matter of concern with regard to folks in the Northeast. I \nwill not do that. I am going to save that until we have some of the \nSenators on the floor to point out to them just what we have done. But \nthere are four big ticket items, and additional items of interest, \nabout 15 of them. I think it is very salutary to the concerns of \nproducers in that area.\n  Both Senator Harkin and the chairman of the committee, Senator Lugar, \nindicated that this bill should be on the unanimous consent calendar. \nWe had the debate in the committee. The chairman had a different \napproach in regard to a risk management approach. It was a very \nlegitimate option. We have committed some funds to see if we can go \nforward with that kind of option step by step. But the majority of the \nbill pretty much mirrors what they have done in the House.\n  Now, how did the House do this? Did they have a big debate? Did \nregions of the country have some problems with this? No, the House of \nRepresentatives, in their infinite wisdom, passed this by unanimous \nconsent.\n\n  With all due respect to my colleagues in the other body, a body in \nwhich I was privileged to serve, they have a lot of trouble deciding \nwhen to adjourn, let alone doing anything by unanimous consent. I hope \nthey take that in the spirit in which I say those comments.\n  They passed it by unanimous consent. That means any one Member out of \n435 could have stood up and objected. Nobody did that because they knew \nthat this was on the agenda. We promised this 4 years ago, the \neditorial ``we,'' both Democrats and Republicans, when the new farm \nbill was passed. Despite all of the criticisms we have heard in regard \nto the new farm bill--and this is not the time to get in to that \ndiscussion or debate--both Senator Lugar and I held up the chart--\ncertainly Senator Lugar referred to it--which said, if you go to a more \nmarket oriented farm policy, these are the things you have to have with \nit to give the farmer the risk management tools to compete. It was \nsupposed to be done 4 years ago after the 1994 reform.\n  We did not do that, ``we'' meaning the administration and leadership \non both the Democrat and Republican side. We all bear part of that \nresponsibility. There were honest differences of opinion. Sometimes \nthings take a little longer. But if the House of Representatives can \npass this by unanimous consent without one objection, what are we doing \nhere holding up this bill, especially when we are reaching out to the \nvery people who are raising the objections.\n  If Senators have some problems with this, please come down and talk \nto Senator Kerrey and me and the distinguished chairman and Senator \nHarkin. We think we have some very good answers for you. We think we \nhave done what you want us to do. I don't know when enough is not \nenough, but it seems to me we ought to do that.\n  One of the biggest reasons why we should do this, you never know what \nthe weather is going to do. You never know when a section of the \ncountry could be hard hit. We provide that assistance under disaster \nbills. Ours is not a disaster bill. It addresses some of the concerns \nfarmers have in regard to going through disasters in that it gives them \na risk management tool. They control that, along with their lender and \ntheir insurance company. They can better guard against the natural \ndisasters that can happen. But everybody here knows what has happened \nwhen we have a disaster, more especially in the even-numbered years. \nWhen we have a disaster, it is a disaster to try to devise a disaster \nprogram that is fair and is equitable. That was a concern on the part \nof the Senators from the Northeast during the last disaster bill that \nwas passed in the last year to provide assistance to hard-pressed \nfarmers. They believe they were discriminated against. I think they \nhave a point. But the proper way to address that is not on the crop \ninsurance reform we have constructed to be in their best interest. That \nis a separate issue.\n  If we passed the crop insurance reform and the money is in the budget \nthrough the efforts of the good Senators mentioned by the distinguished \nchairman, we have $6 billion there. It is not over budget. But if we \nhave add-ons with different amendments, obviously we will be over \nbudget. That is not the answer to this.\n  In addition, if you have the crop insurance risk management tools in \nplace, in my personal view, you are not going to have the tremendous \nneed or the tremendous support for annual disaster bills. We got along \nfor 2 years, I think, after passage of the farm bill, where we didn't \nhave to spend $1 for disasters. Obviously, we have a lot of folks who \nwould predict that it doesn't happen every year. But if the farmer has \nthe proper risk management tools, yes, it is going to cost some money, \nbut it will save the taxpayer much more money in the long run rather \nthan treating this on an annual basis in terms of disaster bills. This \nis in the best interest of the taxpayer.\n\n  I think I have pretty well made my point. I will save the rest of my \nstatement when we do get agreement. I will say again that I hope we do \nget the agreement soon.\n  I wish to pay special credit to Senator Kerrey and to his assistant, \nBev Paul, along with a young man who assisted me in this effort, Mike \nSeyfert. They have worked day after day, hour after hour, back and \nforth between every commodity group, every farm organization, every \nSenator, every region. It has been tedious work. How many Senators will \nget a blind phone call from somebody trying to sell you insurance? I \nthink probably insurance is not the most favorable topic about which to \nbe talking. Crop insurance does tend to be a high glazer, as we can see \nby the lack of colleagues on the floor. So they have taken this rather \ntedious subject, this detailed and complex subject and have worked out \na major reform.\n  Senator Kerrey has done a splendid job. We have both, as I said \nbefore, tried to truly listen to our producers to come up with \nsomething we think will be the answer.\n  I think this is one of the major reforms in farm program policy. I \nthank Senator Kerrey and the dedicated staff, both his and mine, and \ncertainly the staff of Senator Lugar. We have worked through a very \ndifficult time. Well, now is the time. As I said, we\n\n[[Page S1561]]\n\nought to do it by unanimous consent. I hope we can get this thing done \nand we can work out the agreement. I know people are working overtime \nto get this done, but tempus and the weather fugit. That means we can't \ndilly-dally around with this.\n  I must say, given the considerations that it is an even numbered year \nand the amount of angst and frustration on the part of our farmers and \nranchers, this has been promised for years. So the people who hold up \nthis bill should know there is a groundswell of support for the bill, \nand there will also be, I suspect, a tad bit of criticism for the \npeople who are holding it up. That is just a thought.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Lugar. He has done great \nwork in allowing the process to come forward and allowing suggestions \non how to improve crop insurance and make it more responsible. There \nhas been some abuse of the program. Senator Roberts talked about it, \nand he has been a champion on that problem. We don't want a program \nthat encourages people to farm for insurance rather than actually \nproduce a crop. His suggestion to produce a program that gives people a \nvariety of options that includes crop insurance, I think, is an \nimprovement in the risk management offering to provide the farms and \nranchers in the United States of America.\n  I also thank Senator Leahy. I understand he spoke yesterday. In the \nNortheast, although there is only 2 percent of the farm land and 6 \npercent of the dollar value of crops produced on an annual basis, it is \nstill important. There are farms in New Hampshire, Vermont, upstate New \nYork, and New Jersey. They are concerned; they have expressed those \nconcerns. We have taken their concerns into account. The House bill \ndoes not, I should point out to those from the Northeast. We have \naccommodated those concerns, unlike the House. You will see it if you \nlook at the language of the legislation.\n  I thank Senator Roberts. It has been fun working with him. I think we \nhave produced a piece of legislation that will provide producers with \nwhat they have been asking for, at least in Nebraska--the most \nimportant.\n  We have been blessed in the United States with a successful \nagriculture strategy over the last 100 years. But it has lulled us to \nsleep in many ways.\n  We are hoping to get an agreement on the bill. I ask my colleagues to \ntake this opportunity to discuss agriculture in general. There are so \nmany misconceptions about agriculture. It is seen as sort of an old \npolicy. Agriculture is oftentimes seen as a special interest when, in \nfact, out of an $8 trillion economy, agriculture still accounts for a \ntrillion dollars of that. Nearly 1 out of 8 jobs--almost 20 million \njobs--in the United States are there as a consequence of the food and \nfiber grown on the farms and ranches of the United States of America. \nIt is quite a remarkable success story. We take it for granted too \noften.\n  In this morning's New York Times there is an article by an economist \nby the name of Paul Krugman, talking about an issue that is quite hot: \ngenetically modified organisms. Mr. Krugman, quite accurately, said \nthat many of the opponents of GMOs are people who don't understand that \nit is the application of technology that has not only made our food \nbetter but made it affordable and relatively easy to acquire. It is \nalmost nothing if you want to order the food that you can't get in \nrelatively short order as a consequence not just of the way we produce \nfood, but the way we distribute it, transport it, store it, and the way \nwe process it. It is quite a remarkable success story and still \naccounts--even with declining sales internationally--for the most \nimpressive part of our trade story. In fact, about the only good news \nright now in the trade story is we still have a slight surplus with \nagricultural exports. We tend as a consequence to take agriculture for \ngranted and sort of see it as a marginal part of the economic debate.\n  Agricultural policy should be front and central to any economic \nstrategy. Producing a trillion dollars in output and producing 20 \nmillion jobs is obviously significant to those of us who have portions \nof our economy dependent upon agriculture in our States, and it is \nobvious to us that it is a part of the new economy. The Senator from \nIndiana can talk eloquently about it because he still has an active \nfarm. But you don't achieve success on a farm today without applying a \nsignificant amount of technology, without being a part of the new \neconomy, without using computers, without being able to know exactly \nwhat your costs are, and without being able to know how to market and \nwhere the market is. There is almost nothing that is taken for granted \ntoday when it comes to production agriculture.\n  So it ought to be a central part of our economic strategy. I know we \nattempted not just to accommodate but to take into account the concerns \nof States that don't have as much agriculture but are still important, \nsuch as the Northeast, where, as I said, it is only 2 percent of the \nagricultural land in production and 6 percent of the total dollar \noutput; it is still important for a lot of reasons, both economic and \nsocial. As we try to figure out our economic strategy, it ought not to \nend up on some shopping list down there with a list of 30 or 40 things \nthat people want to get done.\n\n  The unfortunate part of agriculture is that there is considerably \nmore risk. That is what this legislation does. I want to talk about \nthat risk because I get asked about this in urban environments in \nNebraska, such as Omaha, Lincoln, Hastings, or some other smaller \ncommunities. Oftentimes, they say: Why do we have a special program? \nWhy do we do crop insurance at all? Why do we have a Government-private \nsector partnership to help farmers manage risk? What makes them special \nor different than us?\n  There is an answer that may not be readily apparent, although it is \nquite obvious to those of us who are from States where there is an \nawful lot of production agriculture. The answer is, unlike all other \nmanufacturing businesses, agriculture is at risk to the weather. I am \nin business. I have restaurants and health clubs.\n  In 1975, on the 6th of May, at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, a \ntornado came up out of the Northwest. We had been in business a little \nover 2 years. The tornado blew us away; it completely destroyed our \nbusiness. We had to start again from scratch. It happened in May, and \nwe reopened 18 weeks later. We didn't even lose the 4 months sales we \nthought we were going to lose because we opened with greater volume. \nBut if I am running Dick Lugar's farm and a tornado comes through, it \ncan take away not just 4 months' revenue but an entire year's revenue.\n  It is different. In my restaurant, I control the environment. I don't \nsuffer declines as a consequence of drought, as we are currently \nexperiencing in the State of Nebraska. I don't suffer as a consequence \nof all the different changes in the weather that can put the crop of a \nfarmer or ranch unit at risk. So there is considerable risk, which is \ndifferent than in other kinds of businesses. No other manufacturing \nbusiness produces its product out of doors, and no other manufacturing \nbusiness is at risk of losing an entire year's revenue as a result of \ntoo much water, too little water, rain, hail, and all the other sorts \nof things that can happen that cause a producer to lose an entire \nyear's income.\n  In addition, very few businesses have the economic situation that \nagriculture does. That is to say, just a little more supply than what \nis necessary will cause prices to go down. It is just a slight more \nsupply than is needed--if you produce, say, 15 or 20 percent more than \nwhat the market will absorb in a single year's time, the price will go \ndown sharply. There is tremendous sensitivity to excess production.\n  In Mr. Krugman's excellent observation this morning in an op-ed piece \nin the New York Times, he said the very people who tend to oppose GMOs \nare the people who are least likely to be able to produce food on their \nown and who have benefited from the application of technology and the \nconsequence of lower prices, greater quality, and greater accessibility \nto food. They have no difficulty getting food. They live in relatively \nwealthy nations, and they are not going to suffer as a consequence of \nnot bringing the GMOs on line. It will be the poor, less developed\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\nnations that will suffer the consequence. It is easy for Prince Charles \nto oppose GMOs.\n  We find ourselves in a short supply-and-demand situation where \nconsumers are basically saying: We don't want our farmers and ranchers \nto produce less than what we want. We don't want to be short of food. \nWe don't want prices to go up too high. We have a policy--it is \nespecially true with large processors--where processors not only want \nprices to be stable but prefer prices to be in the lower range, if \npossible. That is always good business. You try to keep your costs \nunder control. If we overproduce, the prices are always going to be on \na downward pressure.\n  This legislation, the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act, \nallows the continuation of the development of products that are offered \nto farmers to manage the risks of price declines and revenue losses \ncoming from changes in the market over which they have no control.\n  The Senator from North Dakota talked about currency fluctuations at \ngreat length when we discussed trade agreements and trying to get \nsomething in trade agreements that allow us to accommodate the sort of \nthings that we saw after NAFTA with the peso decline. We found \nourselves at a significant disadvantage as a consequence. These \ncurrency declines can have a tremendous impact on the earning ability \nof our farmers. It is a risk that the farmers of America have to \nmanage.\n  In this new and improved crop insurance proposal, we will have an \nincreased likelihood, in my view, that market-oriented products will \nenable a producer to manage the risk of loss of income due to \nunexpected and uncontrolled declines in their income associated with \nprice declines. Also, those products will be developed and available to \nthe market. Not only do we increase the subsidies and make it more \nlikely that people will buy, but we also provide risk-minded options. \nWe make changes in the existing crop program. Key among them is we \nrestructure the risk management agency to make it more likely that \nproducts will be brought to market more quickly. It is more likely to \nbe market-oriented as well.\n  My hope is that we can move this legislation--as Chairman Lugar and \nSenator Roberts have indicated, and earlier Senator Harkin spoke, and \nwe could not have developed this piece of legislation without the \ndistinguished ranking member as well--and pass a good, strong bill that \nis beneficial to all regions of the country so that it is more likely \nto come out of conference as a bill that is closer to what the Senate \nhas. The House, as I said, does not have many of the provisions that \nthe Northeastern Senators have been talking about. We did in ours. My \nhope is that we can pass this piece of legislation with a large \ninfluence and in a positive way for the conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have had an hour of general debate and \ndiscussion.\n  On behalf of the leader, I would now like to offer a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to Calendar No. \n464, S. 2251, the crop insurance bill, and it be considered under the \nfollowing time agreement:\n  One amendment to be offered by the managers limited to 10 minutes and \nnot subject to second-degree amendments and no budget points of order \nbe in order prior to the disposition of the managers' amendment, and \nfor the purposes of complying with section 204 of H. Con. Res. 68, the \nbill, as amended by the managers' amendment, be considered as the \ncommittee-reported bill:\n  Two relevant first-degree amendments in order to be offered by the \nmajority leader, or his designee;\n  Two relevant first-degree amendments in order to be offered by the \nminority leader, or his designee;\n  That those first-degree amendments be subject to relevant second-\ndegree amendments;\n  That all amendments except where noted be limited to 30 minutes \nequally divided in the usual form;\n  That no motions to commit or recommit the bill be in order;\n  And following disposition of the above-described amendments and use \nor yielding back of debate time, the bill be advanced to third reading.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following third reading of the \nbill, the Senate proceed to the House companion bill, H.R. 2559, and \nall after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 2251, as \namended, if amended, be inserted, the bill be advanced to third reading \nand passage occur all without any intervening action or debate.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that following passage, the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, the Chair \nbe authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, and the \nSenate bill be placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  If I could just explain for a moment, we have been working closely \nwith a number of our colleagues, I understand, on a bipartisan basis \nfrom the Northeast who want to be able to offer an amendment. I know at \nleast in some cases they haven't had the opportunity to see the bill \nuntil yesterday. So they have asked for our indulgence in working with \nthem to see if we can accommodate their needs. I have indicated a \nwillingness to do that.\n  I noted to Senator Lott just a few minutes ago that we are close to \nreaching a procedural arrangement whereby that could be done. I am \nhopeful that we will be able to get that agreement sometime shortly. I \nhave no objection to proceeding to the bill. We could certainly do \nthat.\n  Earlier, a suggestion was made and a unanimous consent request I \nthink was offered which would allow us to go to the bill for general \ndebate only. As I understand it, that was objected to. But whether we \ngo to the bill without an agreement or go to the bill and seek a \nunanimous consent that would allow for a general debate, either of \nthose approaches would work.\n  I hope that by the end of the day we can get a unanimous consent \nagreement that would spell out in more detail, as perhaps the chairman \nhas suggested, an amendment list. As I said, we are close. I certainly \nhave no objection myself to moving forward, as he has suggested. I want \nto accommodate Senators who have been working in good faith to try to \nfind a way in which to amend the bill, and they should be prepared to \ndo that before the end of the day.\n  I will object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I had hoped to come to the floor today in \nsupport of the long-awaited, long-anticipated crop insurance reform \nbill. My colleagues, Senators Roberts and Kerrey, have toiled over this \nlegislation, laboring to ensure that the risk management activities \nAmerica's farmers will undertake are fair, affordable, and \ncomprehensive.\n  Instead, I understand that a few of our Democratic colleagues have \nplaced a hold on the bill, while ironically, an editorial in the \nWashington Post this morning decries the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act and \nthe very legislation I had hoped would pass today.\n  Mr. President, nearly every major commodity group in the nation \nsupports the Roberts/Kerrey bill and have, through the voices of their \nmembership, called upon us to act. Instead of working to pass crop \ninsurance legislation growers from across the country have been \nanxiously awaiting, we instead find ourselves once again defending the \nprinciples of freedom to farm.\n  To use America's farmers as a pawn in an election year political \ngame, at a time when the agriculture economy is in a serious state of \nflux, in my opinion invalidates their plight. When we should be passing \ncomprehensive, bipartisan legislation that enhances the\n\n[[Page S1563]]\n\nsafety net for American farmers, we instead find ourselves fighting to \naddress a bill the farming community nearly overwhelmingly desires.\n  As of late, farmers in the Pacific Northwest have found themselves in \nthis same game far too often. At the same time the Administration sends \nofficials out to Washington state claiming to provide solutions to \nthese serious issues, regulators under the Clinton-Gore watch are \nworking to eliminate the water, transportation infrastructure, \nchemicals, and in general the tools necessary for farmers to continue \ntheir livelihood.\n  Last week, the Washington Association of Wheat Growers made the 3,000 \nmile trip to Washington, DC to encourage me to support the crop \ninsurance reform we were supposed to address today. At a time when \ncheck books barely balance, fuel prices are outrageously high, while \ncommodity prices are low, these folks asked for our help. Unfortunately \ntoday, these proud and previously profitable growers must wait. They \nmust wait for several folks on the other side of the aisle to make a \npolitical monster of crop insurance before they can receive this \ndesired reform.\n  Mr. President, when the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act \nfinally comes before us here in the Senate, I will support the efforts \nof Senators Roberts and Kerrey, of the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nand of those voices in rural America who demand crop insurance reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1563-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1563-S1571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to Calendar No. 464, S. 2251, the crop insurance bill, and that \nit be considered under the following agreement: First, an amendment to \nbe offered by the managers, limited to 10 minutes and not subject to \nsecond-degree amendments, and no budget points of order be in order \nprior to the disposition of the managers' amendment, and for the \npurposes of complying with section 204 of H. Con. Res. 68, the bill, as \namended by the managers' amendment, be considered as the committee \nreported bill.\n  Parenthetically, the amendment offered by the distinguished Senators \nfrom New York and New Jersey would be a part of that managers' \namendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I first thank the Senator on behalf of myself and the \nSenators from New Jersey, Rhode Island, all of us, as well as the other \nmembers of the committee. This is an extremely important amendment to \nall of us. I ask the Senator, will the Senate in the conference do \neverything it can to keep the language and the amount of money we have \nagreed to?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am sure the Senate will argue the merits of the \nSenators' suggestions as well as the rest of the managers' amendment, \nand whatever else transpires, with vigor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator, again, for understanding our \nparticular problems with agriculture in the Northeast. As the Senator \nmay remember, last fall when disaster struck, we were unable to protect \nour farmers. Being allowed to be included in the crop insurance program \nfor specialty crops such as fruits and vegetables is extremely \nimportant. We are very appreciative of those efforts that were made.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I am certain he \nunderstands many of us believe that the long, slow erosion of the \nagricultural community in the Northeast must come to an end. Those who \nare engaged in specialty crops and other products in New York, New \nJersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and other States have \nsuffered very badly in recent years.\n  I think the agreement we have come to is of some real note. That is, \nthis isn't simply an agricultural crop insurance program; it is now a \nnational program. For the first time in my experience, we have reached \nacross the Nation's borders, coast to coast, and designed a program \nthat can work for every State. This is a very important moment for the \nState of New Jersey and preserving those farms that remain. I am \ngrateful and very much appreciate his commitment to fight vigorously in \nconference so that the Senate provisions prevail. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New York and the \nSenator from New Jersey for their great efforts. I thank the chairman. \nAs my colleague so well expressed, there is a tendency to not realize \nor understand that the Northeast part of the United States has a \nsignificant farming industry. We learned that the hard way, in some \nrespects, last fall when we discovered our farmers were in desperate \nstraits because of drought, loss of crops, and environmental conditions \nthat affected them. Today, we are recognizing their standing along with \nfarmers throughout this country, and not only their need but their \neligibility now for Federal assistance in times of need. I thank the \nchairman for his efforts, and I thank my colleagues for working so hard \non this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senators from New York, New Jersey, and Rhode \nIsland for their leadership.\n  Mr. President, can we lock in that part of it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator completed his unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. LUGAR. No. This is a portion of it. The request is the managers' \namendment be offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me proceed.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that a relevant amendment by the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, with a time limit of 30 \nminutes be entertained, and that a statement by Senator Kennedy of \nMassachusetts be permitted for not to exceed 30 minutes; that a sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment be offered by the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone, and that one relevant amendment be offered by \nSenator Wellstone.\n  May I inquire of the Senator if he would permit us to have a 30-\nminute time limit for each of these two amendments?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, on the time, I have to decide on the \nsecond amendment. On the first amendment, it is not my wish to go on \nand on, but I would not agree to 30 minutes. There were 2,500 to 3,000 \nfarmers, and 500 came from Minnesota. I would like to commend them for \nthe Rally for Rural America, and call on Congress to take some action \nto deal with the crisis in our rural communities. I don't think I can \ngive justice to what they did in 30 minutes. Other Senators would like \nto speak as well. I would not agree to only 30 minutes.\n  The second point I wish to make is that these are agriculture-related \namendments. I wish to make sure that is acceptable to my colleague.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The request that we made to the Chair is that they be \nrelevant to the legislation before us.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will object to the whole agreement because these \namendments are agriculture-related. I don't think they would \nnecessarily be ruled relevant to crop insurance. I can do the sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment within an hour, I think, basically recognizing and \ncongratulating people for coming and talking about our commitment to \ntake some action. I might not even do a second amendment. Certainly, \nthey are agriculture-related. There isn't anybody in the world who \nwould say that the sense-of-the-Senate is not agriculture-related, \ndealing with the price crisis. But I thought that would be acceptable. \nIf it technically has to be relevant to crop insurance, that would be \nout of order. If it is out of order, I will not agree.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I have to respond to the Senator, on behalf of our leader, \nSenator Lott, that it needs to be relevant to the legislation. The \nChair might be asked to rule on that or might not be asked to rule on \nthat. I understand the Senator, and I am attempting to be \naccommodative. The importance of what he has to say is obvious. But if \nthe Senator could achieve both of his objectives within an hour of \ntime, perhaps we could proceed on that basis.\n\n[[Page S1564]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to achieve the objective within an \nhour of time. I can do that. I am not trying to hold up the bill. I \nthink I can do that. I am not going to agree if I am going to be ruled \nout of order. Maybe we can proceed on that basis.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I pledge to the Senator not to raise a point of order. To \nreiterate, I ask unanimous consent that we have a Kohl amendment with a \nlimit of 30 minutes; a Kennedy statement with a limit of 30 minutes; \nand the Senator from Minnesota, with a total of 1 hour for either a \nstatement or an amendment, or a motion, as the case may be.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This would be for a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. If \nit could be in the agreement that there could be 1 hour and there would \nnot be objection to it----\n  Mr. LUGAR. All right. Three elements: the sense of the Senate for 1 \nhour, the Kohl amendment for 30 minutes, and the Kennedy statement for \n30 minutes.\n  Mr. President, these would be the only permissible amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, further, I ask unanimous consent that these \namendments have equal division of time and be considered in the usual \nform, and that no motions to commit or recommit the bill be in order, \nand following disposition of the above amendments, or the yielding back \nof time, the bill be advanced to third reading.\n  I further ask consent that following third reading of the bill, the \nSenate proceed to the House companion bill, H.R. 2559, and all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 2551, as amended, if \namended, be inserted, the bill be advanced to third reading, and \npassage occur, all without any intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nshall not, let me thank all Senators for their cooperation and for \ntheir willingness to work with the leadership to accommodate the many \nconcerns that have existed on both sides.\n  Let me say briefly, however, for the record, this is yet another \nexample of the minority again cooperating with the majority and denying \nourselves the right to offer nonrelevant amendments first, that is \nnonagricultural amendments, or any other amendments that are \nnonrelevant, and limiting ourselves to relevant amendments to this \nparticular bill. We are doing it as a result of the urgency that I \nthink everyone understands about this matter, and we are doing it in an \neffort to try to accelerate consideration of this bill and also \nultimately come to a conclusion. It is an abrogation of the rights of \nall Senators to again be asked that they preclude the consideration of \nany nonrelevant amendments.\n  We will do it again in this case. But I think that, at some point, \nthe Senate has to be the Senate, where Senators have the right to offer \namendments regardless of subject matter. Again, in this case, I \nappreciate the cooperation of everybody. I hope we don't continue in \nthe Senate what I think is a dangerous pattern--that we limit Senators \nin such a narrow way, as we are doing in this case. We are doing it for \ngood reason, but I hope we can find ways in which to allow Senators to \nexpress themselves and be full participants in debate on other matters \nand other vehicles.\n  I certainly don't object. I commend the chairman for getting this \nagreement.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, before I ask for the ruling, let me ask the \nleave of my colleagues and that Senator Jeffords be recognized for 30 \nminutes on an amendment on our side. I have just been advised that the \nSenator may have an amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask if the amendment is relevant.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The amendment would be relevant.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, finally I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing passage of the bill, the Senate insist on its amendments and \nrequest a conference with the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am advised by the distinguished minority \nleader that, of course, I will be in a position to name conferees on \nour side, and he also will be in a position to do so.\n  My hope would be, as I am certain it is his, that we could proceed to \nconference with the House as rapidly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the distinguished minority leader and all Senators who have \nhelped us in this.\n  We are now prepared to offer the managers' amendment;\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2251) to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act to \n     improve crop insurance coverage, to provide agricultural \n     producers with choices to manage risk, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2887\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send the managers' amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] for himself, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Kerrey, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2887.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I know of no debate on the managers' \namendment. I ask the Chair to pose the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2887) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  The bill is now open for the amendments that have been designated in \nthe unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to strongly endorse the crop \ninsurance bill that is before us. It is a product of a bipartisan \neffort.\n  I especially want to congratulate my colleague, Senator Kerrey of \nNebraska, who has labored hard and long in order to produce this \nresult. Senator Roberts of Kansas is a cosponsor. We are all indebted \nto them for their leadership on this issue because this bill brings a \nnew measure of stability to rural America. From the Northeast, to the \ngreat heartland, to the South, this bill is going to make a difference \nin the lives of farmers who we know are too hard pressed.\n  For those who are listening, crop prices are the lowest they have \nbeen in 50 years. We have just had a rally on the Mall that went on for \n2 days with thousands of participants from all over America with \nfarmers telling us they simply have to have help or they are going to \ngo under in unprecedented numbers. That is the message that has been \ndelivered.\n  Our first response is the crop insurance reform bill--to say we are \nready to help and this Congress is prepared to respond.\n  I also want to thank my colleague, Senator Grassley, a member of the \nBudget Committee and the Agriculture Committee, who joined me on the \nBudget Committee to reserve the funds so that this bill could go \nforward. We achieved $6 billion in funding last year for crop insurance \nreform. That is what this bill provides. This bill reforms crop \ninsurance by making coverage more affordable, by fixing an unintended \nconsequence of our effort to reform crop insurance in 1994 that \nunfairly lowered coverage for producers facing unexpected circumstances \nwith repeated natural disasters.\n  It requires USDA to implement new quality adjustment procedures. It \neases qualification for noninsured crop disaster assistance. It \nprovides for the development of improved specialty crop policies and \nbrings livestock into the crop insurance system.\n\n[[Page S1565]]\n\n  This bill also provides a pilot program to test an alternative risk \nmanagement approach.\n  With respect to the question of multiple years of disaster, let me \nexplain, in brief, the problem.\n  In areas of the country that have experienced multiple years of \ndisasters, under the current crop insurance law, the formula under \nwhich they recover damages is dramatically altered by repeated years of \ndisaster. This legislation offered by our colleagues, Senator Kerrey, \nSenator Roberts, and a number of other of us on a bipartisan basis, \naddresses that problem. I am grateful for it.\n  My State has been affected by multiple years of disaster. I pray that \nour time of suffering is over. But other States may have a similar \nexperience. They shouldn't have to suffer unduly. Crop insurance should \nwork for them. That reform is included in this bill. We can be proud of \nit.\n  I want to respond, if I can, to an editorial that was in the \nWashington Post this morning. That editorial, which makes the assertion \nthat crop insurance promotes production on marginal acres, or so-called \n``environmentally sensitive lands,'' requires a response.\n  I believe the facts do not support that claim. I believe the \nWashington Post in their editorial is precisely wrong about the effect \nof crop insurance. The fact is meaningful crop insurance did not exist \nuntil 1994. Has crop acreage increased in that period? Let us review \nthe record because I think the facts speak in direct contradiction to \nthe fundamental assertion in the Washington Post editorial.\n  This chart shows the number of acres being planted in this country \nfrom 1996 to 1999. One can see the blue bar. Those are the acres \nfarmed. You can see the acreage hasn't expanded. The acreage has been \nreduced under an expanding crop insurance program.\n  The fundamental assertion by the editorial writers in the Washington \nPost is wrong. They may assert, well, it is not fair to look at just \nacres planted and acres taken out of production. You have to look at \ninsured acres.\n  Let's do that. This chart, again, is from 1996 through 1999. Again, \nthe acres that are insured are the blue bars. You can see that we are \ndown from 1996. We have not had an increase. The acres insured are \ndown.\n  One has to ask this question: If farmers are taking acreage out of \nproduction, are they taking out their most productive acres? Is that \nwhat they would do? I don't think so. I think just the opposite would \noccur.\n  As farmers take acres out of production, they would take out their \nmost marginal acres. They would take out those acres that are most \nenvironmentally sensitive. That is the record.\n  I wish our friends who write editorials down at the Washington Post \nknew a little more about agriculture because I frequently find them in \nerror, but they are never in doubt.\n  I say to my friends that they need to get out in the heartland of \nAmerica. They need to get out of Washington. They need to get outside \nthe beltway to find out what is really going on in agricultural America \nbecause over and over, as I read their editorials, they have almost no \nrelationship to the reality of what the people I represent are \nexperiencing.\n  We had a breakthrough today in terms of an agreement with our \ncolleagues from the Northeast. The fact is they had an unfair result in \nthe disaster bill of last year. I acknowledge that. I regret that \noccurred. I can say my own State has been dealt with generously in \ndisaster programs. We had a horrible disaster in 1997. We had the worst \nwinter storm in 50 years, the most massive flood in 500 years, and the \nlargest mass evacuation of American cities since the civil war. This \nCongress responded generously to the needs of the people I represent. I \nwill be forever in the debt of my colleagues.\n  When similar disasters hit the Northeast last year, they were not \ndealt with as generously. I think we must all acknowledge that. \nHopefully, this is a step toward recognizing the very real economic \nhurt that occurred there.\n  I conclude by thanking the chairman and the ranking member of our \ncommittee. Especially, I direct my comments to the chairman. This is \nnot a bill he favored. He had an alternative approach. But he \ngraciously allowed Members to debate and discuss in the committee. He \nwas eminently fair in the consideration of this bill in the committee. \nWhen his side did not prevail, he was a gentleman, and he has come out \non the floor of this Senate to help pass the final product of a \ndemocratic process.\n  I thank the chairman very much for his fairness and also his \npatience. His patience is quite remarkable as we fight and joust about \nissues that matter an awful lot to Senators as individuals representing \ndifferent parts of the country, many from States in very deep financial \ntrouble.\n  Let me finish by again thanking my colleagues, Senator Roberts of \nKansas and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, for truly outstanding leadership \nin bringing this reform bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it. I think it is something of which they can be proud.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, first I thank my good friend and \ncolleague for his very kind comments, and I associate myself with his \nremarks, most especially with regard to the editorial that appeared in \nthe Washington Post. I think he set the record straight.\n  I indicated in my earlier remarks there were some provisions of this \nbill I would like to outline, and I would like to do so at present as a \ncoauthor of the legislation. I said at that particular time we spent a \ngreat deal of time--by ``we,'' I mean Senator Kerrey, I, and our \nstaff--sitting down with producers and our farmers and ranchers and \nvirtually every interest group that has a remote interest in this bill.\n  They told us to do the following things:\n  One, to make a higher level of coverage more affordable;\n  Two, to provide an equal subsidy for both yield and revenue insurance \nproducts;\n  Three, to develop steps to address the problems associated with a \nlack of production history for beginning farmers and concerns that an \nadequate policy does not exist to address the multiple years of \ndisasters.\n  They also told us to try to create new and expanded crop insurance \npolicies for specialty crops and improvements in the Noninsured \nAssistance Program which covers many of the specialty crops.\n  They warned of some increased emphasis in specialty crop policy \nresearch and development;\n  Major changes in the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation board of \ndirectors, certainly with more farmer input;\n  To streamline and to remove the roadblocks and the product approval \nprocess;\n  And to take significant steps to address fraud and abuse in the \nprogram.\n  As I indicated earlier when I went through this list, I think we have \ndone that. I believe, and it is my hope, that the bill now before the \nSenate does accomplish those goals.\n  Let me go over specifically what is included in this bill. We made \nhigher levels of coverage more affordable so we will, hopefully, avoid \ncalls for disaster assistance in the future. In my earlier remarks, I \ntried to emphasize to Senators that once we have national comprehensive \nrisk management available to producers, hopefully we will not get into \nthe expenditures we have had in the past with annual disaster bills.\n  We made the adjustments to the APH to address multiple years of \ndisaster.\n  We made significant changes to the Noninsured Assistance Program, \nincluding the elimination of the area trigger. Now that is a rather \ncomplex description of a problem that is of tremendous concern to the \nspecialty crop producer. That was the No. 1 complaint we heard from \nproducers who use this program.\n  We provided $150 million in pilot program funding to create pilots to \ndevelop new policies, especially for specialty crops.\n  We provided $20 million per year in new funding to provide research \ngrants to develop new risk management strategies for specialty crops.\n  We changed the membership at the corporation's board of directors to \ninclude, as I mentioned before: Four farmers from geographic regions to \nbe selected by the Secretary of Agriculture, one member active in the \ncrop insurance industry, one member with reinsurance expertise, and \nthen the Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\nAgricultural Services, the Under Secretary for Rural Development, and \nthe chief economist at the Department of Agriculture.\n  We have streamlined the product approval process and set deadlines by \nwhich decisions must be made on new policies that are submitted for \napproval. We allow companies to charge minimal fees to other companies \nselling their products in order to allow the recovery of research and \ndevelopment costs. This should also encourage expanded policy \ndevelopment which is a very important goal of the bill.\n\n  I also thank my colleagues from the Northeast in reaching an \naccommodation to address their concerns. We have had a considerable \ndiscussion here. They have released their hold on the bill. However, I \nwill have printed in the Record the provisions for specialty crops with \nwhich we worked so long and hard.\n  I pay special credit to Mr. Santorum, the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania. Senator Santorum obviously came to us after the \nconference bill was passed during the last session of Congress and \nsaid: Look, this is not adequate.\n  He didn't say that; he said it in a little stronger language. He \nsaid: If we are truly going to have a national program, we have to \naddress the concerns of the Northeast.\n  We heard Senator Santorum. We paid a great deal of attention to \nspecialty crop producers, not only in Pennsylvania but all throughout \nthe Northeast. We put together, as I certainly tried to indicate in my \nprevious remarks, a plan where we really reached out. I thank Senator \nSantorum for all of his advice, his counsel, his expertise, and that of \nhis staff. This particular provision for specialty crops would not have \nhappened had we not had his input, advice, and counsel.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these \nprovisions, with the understanding that Senator Santorum should receive \nfull credit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Provisions for Specialty Crops\n\n\n                  noninsured assistance program (nap)\n\n       Removes the NAP area trigger, the number one complaint of \n     specialty crop producers.\n       Allows different varieties of the same crop to be combined \n     as one.\n       Reduces the 35 percent prevented planting requirement to 15 \n     percent.\n       Establishes a mechanism by which producers growing a new \n     crop can get coverage.\n\n\n                      additional items of interest\n\n       Allows pilots to be conducted on state, regional, and \n     national basis.\n       Allows nursery and greenhouse crops to be eligible for risk \n     management activities pilot.\n       Allows grants to be made on a competitive basis for the \n     research and development of specialty crops.\n       Provides $20 million per year for partnerships to be \n     developed with appropriate public and private entities to \n     develop risk management and marketing options for specialty \n     crops.\n       Sales closing date for obtaining coverage for a specialty \n     crop cannot expire before the end of the 120 day period \n     beginning on the date of the final release of materials from \n     RMA.\n       Corporation and specialty crops coordinator are to conduct \n     studies regarding the feasibility of developing new policies \n     for specialty crops.\n       Section requiring study to determine steps that can be \n     taken to provide adequate coverage and improve participation \n     in states with participation percentages well below the \n     national average.\n       Drastically improve the product approval process so that \n     new policy proposals do not languish for months at RMA \n     waiting for approval.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this legislation also establishes \nmonetary penalties. If we are worried about fraud and abuse, we have \npenalties up to $10,000 and potential disbarment from the program and \nall USDA programs for any producer, any agent, any loss adjuster, or \napproved insurance provider who is found to have defrauded the program.\n  These provisions in terms of fraud and abuse are strong; they are \nclear. Those who attempt to defraud the program and taxpayers will be \npunished.\n  Every year, our producers put the seed in the ground and they believe \nif the good Lord is willing and the creeks don't rise or we don't have \na drought, they will produce a crop. When the events do occur, they \nmust have the tools to manage these risks.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter signed \nby 23 different farm and commodity organizations, agricultural lending \norganizations, and organizations associated with the insurance industry \nwho support the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Pat Roberts,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Roberts: As organizations representing farm, \n     lending, and insurance industries, we are writing to strongly \n     urge that the Senate pass the recently reported Senate \n     Agriculture Committee crop insurance risk management bill. \n     The reported bill has strong bipartisan support and includes \n     the risk management ideas of many senators representing \n     farmers with differing risk management needs.\n       Through hard work, farm-state representatives on the House \n     and Senate Budget Committees persuaded Congress to include $6 \n     billion in funding for risk management in the current \n     Congressional budget resolution. The House of Representatives \n     passed H.R. 2559 on September 29, 1999 by voice vote. The \n     Senate needs to pass a crop insurance risk management bill \n     before the next budget resolution is written or those funds \n     will be unused.\n       For several years the agriculture community has been \n     promised and desperately needs an improved crop insurance \n     risk management program. We endorse prompt consideration and \n     passage of the crop insurance bill and oppose efforts to make \n     major changes or slow its consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n     American Association of Crop Insurers\n     American Bankers Association\n     American Farm Bureau Federation\n     American Feed Industry Association\n     American Nursery and Landscape Association\n     American Soybean Association\n     Crop Insurance Research Bureau\n     Farm Credit Council\n     Independent Community Bankers Association\n     Independent Insurance Agents of America\n     National Association of Crop Insurance Agents\n     National Association of Wheat Growers\n     National Barley Growers Association\n     National Corn Growers Association\n     National Farmers Union\n     National Grain Sorghum Producers\n     National Pork Producers Council\n     National Sunflower Association\n     National Association of Professional Insurance Agents\n     Rural Community Insurance Services\n     Society of American Florists\n     U.S. Canola Association.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Our lending organizations and all of the groups and \ncommodity organizations have spoken loudly. They have all continually \nexpressed the need to improve the risk management tools available to \nour producers. I believe this legislation does accomplish this goal. I \nam proud of this bill. It is a strong bill. It is a fair bill. It \nimproves the program for both the taxpayers and our farmers and \nranchers. It shows us that despite all of the differences we sometimes \nhave on both sides of the aisle, as some of my colleagues have already \nsaid, we can listen to our constituents; we can take their ideas; we \ncan work in a bipartisan manner to improve the programs available to \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers.\n  After hundreds of hours of discussion and deliberations, I believe we \nhave achieved the strongest bill possible. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation in behalf of their constituents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2888\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding the Rally for \n                  Rural America and the rural crisis)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2888.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 92, strike lines 7 through 13 and insert the \n     following:\n\n                   TITLE IV--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 401. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RALLY FOR RURAL AMERICA AND \n                   RURAL CRISIS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) on March 20-21, 2000, thousands of rural citizens, \n     working families, and those representing the environmental \n     and religious\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\n     communities traveled to Washington, D.C., to participate in \n     the Rally for Rural America;\n       (2) a broad coalition of over 30 farm, environmental, and \n     labor organizations that are concerned that rural America has \n     been left behind during this time of prosperity participated \n     in organizing the Rally for Rural America;\n       (3) although the majority of America has reaped the \n     benefits of the strong economy, rural Americans are facing \n     their toughest times in recent memory;\n       (4) the record low prices on farms and ranches of the \n     United States have rippled throughout rural America causing \n     rural communities to face numerous challenges, including--\n       (A) a depressed farm economy;\n       (B) an escalation of mergers and acquisitions;\n       (C) a loss of businesses and jobs on rural main street;\n       (D) erosion of health care and education;\n       (E) a decline in infrastructure;\n       (F) a reduction of capital investments; and\n       (G) a loss of independent family farmers;\n       (5) the Rally for Rural America urged Congress to reform \n     the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 \n     (Public Law 104-127) to formulate rural policies in a manner \n     that will alleviate the agricultural price crisis, ensure \n     fair and open markets, and encourage fair trade;\n       (6) thousands of rural citizens have advocated farm \n     policies that include--\n       (A) a strong safety net for all agricultural producers;\n       (B) competitive markets;\n       (C) an investment in rural education and health care;\n       (D) protection of natural resources for the next \n     generation;\n       (E) a safe and secure food supply;\n       (F) revitalization of our farm families and rural \n     communities; and\n       (G) fair and equitable implementation of government \n     programs;\n       (7) because agricultural commodity prices are so far below \n     the costs of production, eventually family farmers will no \n     longer be able to pay their bills or provide for their \n     families;\n       (8) anti-competitive practices and concentration are a \n     cause of concern for American agriculture;\n       (9) rural America needs a fair and well reasoned farm \n     policy, not unpredictable and inequitable disaster payments;\n       (10) disaster payments do not provide for real, meaningful \n     change; and\n       (11) the economic conditions and pressures in rural America \n     require real change.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the participants in the Rally for Rural America are \n     commended and their pleas have been heard; and\n       (2) Congress should respond with a clear and strong message \n     to the participants and rural families that Congress is \n     committed to giving the crisis in agriculture, and all of \n     rural America, its full attention by reforming rural policies \n     in a manner that will--\n       (A) alleviate the agricultural price crisis;\n       (B) ensure competitive markets;\n       (C) invest in rural education and health care;\n       (D) protect our natural resources for future generations; \n     and\n       (E) ensure a safe and secure food supply for all.\n\n           TITLE V--EFFECTIVE DATES; TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY\n\n     SEC. 501. EFFECTIVE DATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c)(2) and section 502(a), this Act and the amendments made \n     by this Act take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n       On page 93, line 10, strike ``SEC. 402.'' and insert ``SEC. \n     502.''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleagues, \nthe Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Nebraska, and I also thank \nthe Senator from Indiana, for this legislation. I think this is a \nterribly important piece of legislation. I think this is good \nlegislation. So I say to my colleague from Kansas, I thank him for his \nexcellent piece of legislation.\n  Both Senator Kerrey and I thank the chairman for having this \nlegislation on the floor. It is substantive and important, and I thank \nhim for his work.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield, I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota. I know we are going through a very difficult \ntime in farm country. This is something we have tried to do for almost \n20 years, and I think it is the strongest bill possible, and I thank \nhim very much for his comments.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator for his work.\n  Mr. President, I want to go through this amendment. This is a sense-\nof-the-Congress resolution on the Rally for Rural America, the rally \nabout the rural crisis that just took place in Washington, DC. Let me \nsimply talk about what happened.\n  Starting Sunday night, we started out with a wonderful prayer \nservice, an ecumenical service. It was nourishing. The church was \npacked here in the city just a few blocks away from the Senate. There \nwere some beautiful words that were uttered, but in particular I \nremember one of the ministers. She said, ``We have taken the culture \nout of agriculture.'' I thought a lot about that. I think that is the \nreason why so many people came to the Nation's Capital, because for \nmany of our family farmers this could very well be their last bus ride \nhere.\n  We had from around the country, I don't want to exaggerate because \nthat does not do justice to people, but I guess somewhere around 2,500, \n3,000 people, many of them family farmers. From the State of Minnesota, \nwe had close to 500 people here, most of them family farmers. I point \nout to my colleagues, this was an unusual gathering. This was a \nhistoric gathering. This is probably the most family farmers who have \ncome to the Nation's Capital, I would say, in the last 20 or 25 years, \nat least from the State of Minnesota.\n  I want my colleagues to also know that most of these farmers came by \nbus. They did not come by jet. They didn't have the money to come by \njet. They came by bus. Many of them are elderly. A good number of them \ncame with their grandchildren. They came to Washington, DC, for two \nreasons.\n  First of all, they came to the Nation's Capital to try to have a \nconversation with America, to make sure people in the country know what \nis happening. I think one of the challenges for us is that, with all \nthe news about the booming stock market and the booming economy, the \nvast majority of people in the country have not a clue what is \nhappening to family farmers. I do not think they have a clue. This is a \ngood country and we have a lot of good people in our country. We have \ngood people in the Senate and the House. I hope, and I think the \nfarmers really hope, this gathering in the Nation's Capital will bring \nout the goodness in us.\n  Right now what we have, and I am not even going to talk about all the \nstatistics, record low income. We have record low prices. We have, as I \nsaid yesterday, many broken dreams and broken lives and broken \nfamilies. I am talking about people who were good managers of the land. \nI am talking about people who work 19 hours a day. But the fact is--and \nI say this to my colleagues--time is not on the side of many family \nfarmers in my State and many other States. They are simply going to go \nunder. We are going to lose many of our producers. We could lose as \nmany as another 2,000 family farmers in Minnesota this year.\n  People came to the Nation's Capital to say: We call upon you to \nrespond to the needs, circumstances and concerns of our lives. What \nthis sense of the Congress says is that the participants in the Rally \nfor Rural America are commended and that their pleas have been heard.\n\n  I think people should be commended for coming from such a long \ndistance away and sacrificing so much to be here. They would not have \ncome here, except they are hoping we can make some changes that will \nhelp them and their families, not only family farmers but our rural \ncommunities.\n  The Congress should respond with a clear and strong message to the \nparticipants, rural families, that Congress is committed to giving the \ncrisis in agriculture and all America its full attention by reforming \nrural policies in a manner that will: No. 1, alleviate the agricultural \nprice crisis; No. 2, ensure competitive markets; No. 3, invest in rural \neducation and health care; No. 4, protect our Nation's resources for \nfuture generations; and, No. 5, ensure a safe and secure food supply.\n  I say to my colleagues, I worded this in such a way that leaves \nplenty of room for different interpretations as to how to accomplish \nthese goals. We do not all agree. I understand that.\n  The Senator from Indiana, the chairman of the committee, is someone--\nI have said it to my own family members, I have said it to people in \nMinnesota--for whom I have the most respect. It is the truth. I say it; \nI mean it. I would not say it to my own children if I did not mean it. \nWe do not agree on the Freedom to Farm bill, which I call the Freedom \nto Fail bill. But this sense-of-the-Congress resolution is broad in its \ninterpretation. It is\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\njust an effort on my part, as a Senator from Minnesota, to say to all \nthe people who came: I acknowledge the fact that you came. It is not as \nif you come here and we do not go to work to try to do something. This \nbill is an effort to try to respond.\n  But it is but only one piece. For my own part, I believe we must \nrespond to the price crisis. People cannot--they will not --be able to \nsurvive right now unless there is some income stabilization, unless \nthere is some safety net, unless there is some way they can have some \nleverage to get a decent price in the marketplace. That is the missing \npiece of Freedom to Farm or Freedom to Fail. Flexibility is good. But \nthat has not worked, and I see it every day in every community that I \nam in. I do not want to just keep visiting with people and listening to \ngood people and caring about good people without trying to get the \nSenate on record that we are going to take some action. That is part of \nwhat this resolution is about.\n  We can have the debate about what kind of changes we could make that \nwould provide some real help for family farmers, that would enable \nfamily farmers to get a decent price, that would provide some income \nfor families, what kind of steps we could take that will put some free \nenterprise back into the food industry and deal with all the \nconcentration of power.\n  For my own part, I do think there is a very strong correlation \nbetween three and four firms dominating 60 to 70 percent of the market, \nand family farmers not getting a decent price. I find it puzzling. I \nfind it more than puzzling. I find it to be an outrage that so many of \nour producers are facing extinction but the packers and the big grain \ncompanies are doing well--in some cases receiving record profits. The \ngap, the farm/retail spread grows wider and wider, and the gap between \nwhat people pay at the grocery store and what the farmers get for what \nthey produce grows wider and wider.\n  I am saying we have to have more competitive markets. I am saying we \nwant to make a commitment to sustainable agriculture.\n  I did not say in this resolution, although I think it is terribly \nimportant and I know Senator Conrad would be the first one to talk \nabout this, that we need to have a fair trade policy. More than \nanything else, I come to the floor of the Senate wanting to acknowledge \nthe presence of close to 3,000 farmers and people from rural America. \nThey were here yesterday in the pouring rain under a tent on the \nCapitol mall. People came to speak out for themselves. They came to \nmeet with Representatives and Senators. They did not come because they \nhave some party strategy. They did not come because they had a \nparticular partisan orientation. They are thinking about their own \nfamilies and their own communities.\n  I wish to say on the floor of the Senate, because I am lucky enough \nto get a chance to speak on the floor of the Senate and these farmers \ncannot speak on the floor of the Senate, there is an economic \nconvulsion taking place in agriculture today.\n  Many wonderful people are being spit out of the economy. Too many \nlives are being shattered. The health and the vitality of our \ncommunities in rural North Dakota or Minnesota or any of the other \nheartland States is not based upon the number of acres farmed or the \nnumber of animals someone owns, but the number of family farmers who \nlive in these communities.\n  Whether we are talking about dairy farmers or corn growers or wheat \ngrowers or livestock producers, it is an absolutely intolerable \nsituation--a situation from which we cannot turn our gaze away.\n  For me to summarize, the findings talk about thousands of rural \ncitizens and families and the religious communities coming to \nWashington to participate in the rally. The religious communities' \nvoice was wonderful.\n  The findings talk about a broad coalition of over 30 farm, \nenvironmental, and labor organizations that are concerned that rural \nAmerica has been left behind during this time of prosperity that \nparticipated in organizing the Rally for Rural America. I thank the \nAFL-CIO for being here. I thank Bernie Brommer, the president of the \nMinnesota AFL-CIO, for being here. I thank Jerry Macaffey from AFSCME \nfor speaking at the rally. I congratulate them for being here. The \namendment makes the point that although the majority of America is \nreaping the benefits of a strong economy, rural America is facing the \ntoughest times.\n  The findings in this amendment talk about the record low prices on \nthe farms and the ranches, and the way in which they have rippled \nthroughout rural America, causing rural communities to face all kinds \nof challenges: A depressed farm economy, an escalation of the mergers \nand the acquisitions, a loss of businesses and jobs on Main Street, an \nerosion of health care and education, a decline in infrastructure, and \na loss of independent family farmers.\n  The purpose for this resolution: ``To express the sense of Congress \nregarding the Rally for Rural America and the rural crisis'' is to \nthank people for being here and to talk about and make it clear that we \nwill, in fact, respond with a clear and strong message to the \nparticipants, that we are committed to dealing with this crisis, that \nwe are committed to giving it our full attention, in a manner that will \nalleviate the agricultural price crisis, that will ensure competitive \nmarkets, that will lead to an investment in rural education and health \ncare, protect our natural resources, and ensure a safe and secure food \nsupply.\n  If, in fact, we continue to lose our producers, and if, in fact, we \ngo the trend of an increasingly corporatized, industrialized \nagriculture, it will be a transition that our country will deeply \nregret.\n  I think this is very important for America. I tell you, my heart and \nsoul goes out to the people who were here. I hope there will be good \nsupport for this sense-of-the-Senate amendment to this very good piece \nof legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the Senator from \nKansas, Mr. Roberts; Senator Kerrey from Nebraska; my colleague, \nSenator Conrad from North Dakota, and others, for their excellent work \nin bringing this legislation to the floor of the Senate. It is my \nintention to support this legislation.\n  I also say that I think the sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by \nthe Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, is certainly thoughtful and \nworthy of support, as well.\n  I, too, join him in saying to my colleague, Senator Lugar, that I \nhave always believed he is a major contributor to most every public \ndebate in this Senate, especially on foreign policy, and a range of \nother things. But it is true, we disagree on farm policy from time to \ntime. We recently had an exchange of letters about that disagreement. \nBut that does not, in any way, diminish my respect for him as a leader \nand a legislator.\n  My fervent hope is at some point I could reach over and reach out to \nSenator Lugar and convince him that we need to--tomorrow or Thursday--\nstart a series of hearings and change the farm bill. But I do not \nexpect that will be the case. He will certainly explain his position on \nthese issues in an articulate way soon.\n  But let me describe some of my feelings about where we are. Let me \nstart with this: I say to my friend from Minnesota, this morning for \nbreakfast I had something called Cream of Wheat. I do not know how many \nservings of Cream of Wheat are served in America every morning or every \nyear but a lot of them.\n  Cream of Wheat, if you want to know the origin of it, just for fun--I \nnotice the Presiding Officer is hanging on my every word here--came \nfrom Grand Forks, ND, in the year 1893. A little old mill called the \nDiamond Mills was not doing very well. They had a scientist who was \nsort of moving around and trying to figure out what he could do with \nvarious parts of the grain. He used what are called the middlings of \nwheat, and he concocted what he called a ``breakfast porridge.''\n  So a man named Tom Amidon from Grand Forks, ND, in 1893, concocted \nwhat he called ``breakfast porridge'' with the middlings from wheat, \nand it is what is called Cream of Wheat. It is what I ate for breakfast \nthis morning.\n  Cream of Wheat comes from the wheat fields in North Dakota and other \nplaces in the country. A farmer gases a tractor, buys the seed, plants \nthe seed, and does all the work to produce this\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\nwheat. Then it is ground up. Among that grinding you get some \nmiddlings. Somebody produces breakfast food with those middlings.\n  Cream of Wheat does not come from Grand Forks, ND, I must say with \ndisappointment. Cream of Wheat is owned by Nabisco Company. It happens \nto be produced in my colleague's home State of Minnesota. The \nmiddlings, the wheat, the Cream of Wheat, the jobs, do not belong to \nthe folks that gas the tractor and plant the seed and harvest the \ngrain. No, that is not the way it works in agriculture.\n  Our farmers go out and plant a crop--corn, wheat, barley--and then \nsomeone comes along and buys it. They take a look at that kernel and \nsay: You know what we ought to do. We ought to puff that up and then \nput it in a bright-colored box, and we will take that wheat and call it \npuffed wheat. Guess what that costs. Go to the grocery store and buy \npuffed wheat, puffed rice. They puff it; they shred it; they crisp it; \nthey manipulate it in a hundred different ways and send it to \nthe grocery store shelf in bright-colored boxes.\n\n  The farmer gets a pittance for that grain because the farmer is told \nthat grain does not have any value anymore. At the grocery store shelf \nit costs a fortune because now it has been puffed. So the puff is \napparently more valuable than the grain that is produced out of the \nground from the tireless work of a family farmer.\n  That describes part of the problem in this system of ours. We had a \ncouple thousand people come to town, as the Senator from Minnesota \ndescribed. They are the ones who could afford to come. I am sure it was \na struggle for many of them.\n  Folks from my State--400 of them--got on buses, seven buses. I think \nthey will have traveled close to 6 days--they are still on a bus, I am \nsure--traveling to Washington and back to North Dakota.\n  The fellow from just west of Valley City would not have been among \nthem because he stood up at a meeting I had some while ago, and his \nchin began to tremble, and he had tears in his eyes--a big, husky guy \nwith a beard. He said his granddad farmed his farm; his dad farmed his \nfarm; and he farmed it for 23 years. Then his chin began to tremble, \nand he said: But I can't do it anymore. I'm being forced off the farm.\n  You could see that for him it was not about dollars and cents; it was \nthe loss of a dream--a broken heart and broken dreams. I am sure he did \nnot come out here because he is not farming anymore and could not \nafford it. He is probably struggling, after 23 years on a farm, trying \nto find something else to do--another job to try to make some income.\n  He made a point, as so many farmers do, that he was a good farmer. He \ndid not waste money. He did not go to town on weekend nights. He did \nnot buy new clothes. He told the kids they could not afford a new pair \nof jeans for school because they did not have the money.\n  He said: This isn't my fault. Collapsed prices are not my fault. Bad \ntrade agreements are not my fault. Monopolies that press their boots \ndown on the chests of family farmers are not my fault.\n  He was right about that. He didn't cause these problems. Somewhere in \nthe crevice between mathematics and virtue rests a blindness that \nsomehow refuses to recognize value and values. We tend to think of all \nof this in the context of economics and numbers, not understanding, \napparently, that family farmers produce something more than a crop.\n\n  Yes, a farmer produces wheat in the fields of North Dakota. That \nfamily living on a farm also produces a social product that most \neconomists and most others believe has no value whatsoever in our \ncountry, a social product called community, called family values, \ncalled part of our culture that all of us understand, an environment \nthat is good, a neighborhood that is free of crime, a lifestyle in \nwhich neighbors help one another.\n  When Ernest had a heart attack at harvest time in my hometown, his \nneighbors took the crop off the field. Why? Because they were \ncompetitors? No, because they were neighbors. That is a social product, \nbut economists say it has no value.\n  The Europeans say it has value. In fact, in the trade negotiations \nbetween Europe and the United States, they say they want something \ncalled multifunctionality considered. Our trade people scratch their \nheads and say: What on Earth are you talking about, multifunctionality? \nThe Europeans say: This is an important element of farming that you are \nmissing when you just look at the hard numbers. What is missing is \ncommunity, values, a certain culture we want to retain and sustain in \nour future. Our trade negotiators just can't understand that. They say: \nWe don't understand that. This is all about dollars and cents. This is \nabout markets.\n  My point is, family farms produce more than just grain. They produce \nsomething very important for this country. It is a social product that \nthis country ought to want to retain and keep.\n  There are a series of things we must do to respond to the urgent \nneeds of family farmers. We must repair a safety net that does not now \nprovide the kind of assistance family farmers need when prices \ncollapse. Family farmers can't make it across the valley when prices \ncollapse without some kind of safety net to bridge that valley. That is \nNo. 1.\n  No. 2, we must have better trade agreements. Family farmers cannot \ncompete with one arm tied behind their backs. It is not fair. The \nCanadian trade agreement wasn't fair to our family farmers. It sold out \nfamily farmers' interests. I regret to say that, but I can bring data \nto the floor released yesterday that demonstrates that was the case.\n  NAFTA was unfair and GATT was unfair to our family farmers. I will be \nhappy to come and speak at great length about that, but I won't today.\n  We must have a better safety net, better trade policies, and action \nagainst monopolies. Farmers ought not to have to market upstream when \nthey are selling fat steers into a circumstance where just several \ncompanies control 80 percent of the steer slaughter. The same is true \nin every direction a farmer looks. If you want to put the grain on a \nrailroad someplace, guess what. You will put your grain on a railroad \nthat is a monopoly in most cases. The railroad will say to you: Here is \nwhat we charge. If you don't like it, tough luck.\n  Just as an example, if you have a carload of wheat in Bismarck, ND, \nand you will ship to Minneapolis, you will be charged $2,300 to ship it \nfrom Bismarck to Minneapolis. Ship the same carload of wheat from \nMinneapolis to Chicago, about the same distance, and you are charged \n$1,000. Why are North Dakota farmers charged more than double to ship a \ncarload of wheat about the same distance? Because there is no \ncompetition in North Dakota on that line. Between Minneapolis and \nChicago, there is. That is called monopoly pricing, and it is unfair to \nfamily farmers.\n\n  The fourth thing we need to do is fix crop insurance. That is what \nthis does. That is why I am here supporting it. I know that is a long \nintroduction to get to my support. I will be very brief to say that I \nthink this legislation has a lot to commend itself to the Senate. This \nis a good piece of legislation--perfect, no, but good.\n  Here is what it does. It makes crop insurance more affordable at buy-\nup coverage levels that are most useful to farmers. It addresses the \nproblem of multiyear losses, which has been a very difficult problem \nfor North Dakota farmers, and their impact on insurance coverages. It \nmakes an important financial commitment to crop insurance expansion, \nresearch and development, education and outreach--issues that are \nparticularly important to specialty crop communities. It authorizes a \npilot program for livestock. It improves the Noninsured Crop Disaster \nAssistance Program.\n  This is a good bill. I know my colleagues have struggled mightily to \nproduce this legislation. This bill comes to the floor with bipartisan \nsupport, Republicans and Democrats supporting it. I am pleased to \nsupport it and to commend all those who have helped bring this to the \nfloor and who will support it in the Senate. It is but one step in a \nseries of steps we must take to try to give family farmers some help.\n  Those 400 North Dakotans who are on 7 buses now on the highways going \nback to North Dakota could well have\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\nbeen elsewhere this week. In most cases, in ordinary years, they would \nhave been in the machine shed and they would have been working on their \ntractor, working on their farm equipment, repairing, replacing, \nrenovating, greasing, changing the oil, getting all ready for spring. \nThat is what farmers do. Farmers only can farm if they have hope. In \nmost cases, these families live out on the farmsteads because they love \nthat way of life.\n  The only way any of us could understand this is if we were to take \nour income each year. We have a salary in the Senate; we know what we \nare going to get each month. Wouldn't it be interesting if all Members \nof the Senate could let their income rest on certain things that are \noutside their control and have no certainty of income. Perhaps let your \nincome rest on the question of whether it rains enough or too much, \nwhether insects come to the Midwest, whether crop disease surfaces, \nwhether there is a hail cloud that shows up or a funnel cloud that \nshows up in late August before harvest. If perhaps if we had that risk \nof income, we would be able to understand better, as all Members of the \nSenate, what family farmers face.\n  It is a very unusual, risky proposition that family farmers face \nevery single year, with many elements in the determination of what kind \nof income they get that are completely outside of their control. That \nis why this is different. The enterprise of farming is different. \nThomas Jefferson said it in words I cannot nearly match. But family \nfarming is different. It is critically important to the future of this \ncountry. It is much more than just economics, finance, or math. It is a \nsocial product produced on our family farms in this country that \ncontributes mightily to the character of this country as well. That is \nwhy this is an important piece of legislation. I hope it is but a first \nsmall step in a journey we can make together to improve the \nopportunities for family farmers in our country.\n\n  I think the amendment offered by my colleague from Minnesota, which \nis a sense-of-the-Senate amendment commending those who came to \nWashington, DC, this week, is an appropriate amendment. I hope the \nSenate will agree to that amendment as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I do want to point out that there are two parts to this sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment. One part is to thank the farmers and others for being \nhere. The second part is to put us on record and say we will respond \nand, in particular, we will respond to the price crisis. We are going \nto talk about how to ensure competitive markets. For my part, I think \nthat means strong antitrust action. We are going to invest. We are \ngoing to understand that in the discussion about education and health \ncare--these are rural issues as well--we are talking about sustainable \nagriculture. We will make a commitment to responding.\n  This is only a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. However, I don't view \nit as just being symbolic. I think it would be great to have a strong \nvote. I want it to be a bipartisan vote. I would love to see us work on \nthe additional pieces Senator Dorgan and I have talked about together, \nas Democrats and Republicans. I pray--I don't use that word very often \non the floor of the Senate--that we will make some changes so our \nproducers, our family farmers, will have a fighting chance to earn a \ndecent living so they can give their children the care they know they \nneed and deserve.\n  This is thanking these farmers, but it is also putting the Senate on \nrecord that we, in fact, are going to respond. That is the second part. \nThat is an important part.\n  Yes, it is just a sense of the Senate, but I will be coming back over \nand over again talking about the sense of the Senate with my own ideas \nabout how we can make a difference. Other Senators may have different \nideas. I just want us to address it. I don't want us to put family \nfarmers in Minnesota or North Dakota or Indiana, or anywhere, in \nparentheses or in brackets and act as though this isn't happening.\n  I don't want us to turn our gaze away from them. I don't want there \nto be an inaction. That is the why of this.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, I didn't realize I was \nspeaking on Senator Wellstone's time. I ask the chairman if the Senator \nneeds more time, I am sure he will be accommodating. I appreciate the \ngenerous opportunity.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I was very pleased to have the Senator speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me say that I appreciate very much the \nwords of the Senator from Minnesota. I think his tribute to the farmers \nwho came is certainly appropriate and very moving. The Senator has \nobviously worked to make certain that meeting was constructively \nsuccessful. I assure the Senator that the voices in the meeting have \nbeen heard and, clearly, we were prepared to move on this legislation. \nBut it is a part of the action that we must take to provide a stronger \nsafety net. I feel that we will do so today. I am confident we will \nmove this bill appropriately.\n  Very clearly, there is much more we need to do. I say to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota and my colleague from North Dakota that I know from the \nincome on my own farm last year that it was down. It was down the year \nbefore from the year before that. I suspect I am one of the few Members \nwho keeps the books, who tries to settle with the family members. I \nunderstand prices and difficulties. I am looking at this from the \nstandpoint of a 604-acre farm, and that is not untypical of many farms \nin my State and the Senator's State. Our problems are profound but not \nbeyond solution. I look forward to working with the Senator.\n  At this moment, I am prepared to say on our side we accept the \namendment, and we certainly want to see it approved by acclamation. \nBefore I make a further comment on that, may I take a moment to say \nthat I am hopeful that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kennedy, is approaching the floor, and likewise, the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Kohl, who have statements or amendments for which time \nhas been provided, so we might proceed.\n  I have received word from the majority leader that he proposes that \nany rollcall votes that might occur with reference to this legislation \nhappen tomorrow morning. At some point, he will be offering a unanimous \nconsent request or make an announcement that would be appropriate on \nthat point. So I am hopeful we will have further debate soon. But for \nthe moment I commend the Senator and I indicate support on our side. I \nhope his amendment will be taken by acclamation and with praise.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I may respond to my colleague for a \nmoment, first of all, I thank him for the words. I will ask for the \nyeas and nays. I do want to have a vote on this amendment. My request \nwill be if the majority leader wants to do it tomorrow--I was trying to \ncome out and help facilitate this--I wonder whether or not we could at \nleast have 2 minutes to summarize before the vote. I hope that will be \nthe case.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask that the vote on the amendment be \npostponed until tomorrow. My understanding is that the majority leader \nwill be prepared to add provisions for the debate the Senator has \nsuggested--perhaps 2 minutes to a side--and I will offer assurance to \nthe Senator that I will make that recommendation to the leader.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator's word is good enough for \nme.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have been advised that in our colloquy \nobtaining unanimous consent we indicated that additional language from\n\n[[Page S1571]]\n\nSenators Leahy, Torricelli, Schumer, Rockefeller, Reed, and Kennedy \nwould be made part of the managers' amendment. Apparently, some further \neditorial work needs to be done to incorporate that language in the \nmanagers' amendment. I ask unanimous consent that we have an \nopportunity and the right to add the language that fulfills the \nobligation we made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. This will tidy up the housekeeping regarding the managers' \namendment.\n  I mention for the record, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the managers' amendment before us brings the crop insurance \nbill into compliance with the budget resolution in that spending in the \nbill is below $6 billion.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. 2270 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1571-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1571-S1582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY--Continued\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this legislation. The crop \ninsurance bill before us today provides $1.5 billion over each of the \nnext 4 years to support the Nation's farmers, and they clearly deserve \nthis assistance. Hard-working farmers across the Nation deserve to live \nwith dignity. Federal assistance is justified to protect them when the \nharsh weather destroys their crops or volatile markets undervalue their \nproduce.\n  I hope in the coming weeks the Senate will also have an opportunity \nto address a related urgent need. I am talking about hunger and the \ninadequacy of the current Food Stamp Program. The problem is that the \nprogram's reach in curbing hunger among working families has weakened \nover time. It is unacceptable for children and working families to go \nhungry in America today. The latest research is clear, and it calls for \nour urgent action.\n  The General Accounting Office reports that ``children's participation \nin the Food Stamp Program has dropped more sharply than the number of \nchildren living in poverty, indicating a growing gap between need and \nassistance.''\n  Census and state food stamp data show that between 1995 and 1998, \nwhile the number of poor people fell by almost 2 million, the number of \nfood stamp beneficiaries fell by over 7 million, leaving millions more \npoor people without food stamps.\n  The Department of Agriculture reports that 10.5 million U.S. \nhouseholds experienced some degree of food insecurity in 1998, and 1 or \nmore people went hungry in 3.7 million of these households.\n  The Tufts University Center on Hunger and Poverty in Massachusetts \nreports that a third of children living in immigrant households with \nfood stamp cuts were experiencing moderate to severe hunger.\n  With Project Bread in Massachusetts, the Center on Hunger and Poverty \nalso coauthored an extraordinary study of Child Hunger in Massachusetts \nabout a year ago. It was cosponsored by Ralph Martin, who was a \nRepublican district attorney in Suffolk County, and Congressman Joseph \nKennedy. They did extensive studies in Massachusetts in a wide variety \nof communities--some of our older cities, some of our more prosperous \ncities with pockets of extraordinary poverty, and then in a number of \nthe rural areas. It is an absolutely superb report. Rather than putting \nthe whole report in the Record, I will raise it throughout the \ndiscussions of hunger to come. Dr. Larry Brown directs the Center on \nHunger and Poverty, and as I think most of us who have worked on the \nhunger issue over the years know, he has had an extraordinary career, \nbeen an invaluable resource for this Nation in terms of finding hunger \nand being constructive and positive in helping us deal with that issue \nin a constructive way.\n  One in five American children is poor in today's America. The Center \non Budget and Policy Priorities reports that while the total number of \nchildren who are poor has declined, the intensity of poverty among \nthose children who are left behind has increased, and one of the \nreasons poor children are poorer is that their access to food stamps is \ndiminishing.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors reports that demand for emergency food \nassistance increased 18 percent during 1999. This is the largest \nincrease since 1992. Limited resources meant that 21 percent of \nrequests for food were unmet. In addition, 67 percent of the adults \nrequesting emergency food assistance in the Nation's cities were \nemployed.\n  Especially in this time of recent economic prosperity and record \nbudget surpluses, we must do more to protect working families across \nthe Nation who need food. America's farmers have a long and proud \ntradition of service to the Nation, and their hard work produces an \nabundance of foodstuffs. Surely we can ensure that this abundance is \nused in a way that no one in America goes hungry.\n  I know the issue of hunger is of deep concern to the chairman and the \nranking member of the Agriculture Committee, who oversee the Nation's \nantihunger efforts. For $500 million a year, we could provide modest \nhunger relief for low-income families. These additional resources \nshould be allocated to the Food Stamp Program, as bipartisan coalitions \nin both the House and the Senate have proposed in the Hunger Relief Act \nthat many of us support.\n  Our proposal makes four long overdue improvements in the Food Stamp \nProgram. It authorizes States to use their own TANF rules to determine \nwhich vehicles families may own to get to work themselves and safely \ntransport their children to school--enormously important, a very modest \nrecommendation, but very important.\n  Second, for families forced to spend over 50 percent of income on \nshelter, it increases the present shelter deduction and indexes it to \ninflation--incredibly important. The cost of housing, particularly in \nthe older communities, has gone right up through the roof and because \nthe shelter deduction is capped, families who must pay high shelter \ncosts are helped less and less by the Food Stamp Program. This is a \nvery modest recommendation to increase the cap and index it to \ninflation.\n  Third, the bill restores eligibility to vulnerable legal immigrants. \nWe all know the history in terms of the moving of immigrants off the \nFood Stamp Program as part of welfare reform. I never believed it made \na great deal of sense at that time, nor do I think it still makes a \ngreat deal of sense. We have been trying to work for restoration of \nfood stamp benefits to legal immigrants since they were imposed.\n\n  Legal immigrants are going to be American citizens. They are people \nwho have abided by the rules in order to come here. The reason they \nhave immigrated is primarily because they have members of their \nfamilies who are here. That is the overwhelming reason for it. So they \nare going to be American citizens. To deprive people, particularly \nchildren--although we made limited progress in that in recent years--\nwho are otherwise going to be American citizens never seemed, to me, to \nbe a wise policy. We seek appropriate restoration in this legislation.\n  It also increases Federal support for emergency food pantries and \nsoup kitchens. I think the excellent research from the Conference of \nMayors is a powerful justification for those modest recommendations.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates together these steps will \ncost about $2.5 billion over 5 years, benefiting over a million \nchildren and working adults. Nearly 1,200 national, State, and local \norganizations, representing concerned citizens in all 50 States, have \nurged Congress to pass the legislation.\n  I hope we can enact this important hunger relief measure this year. \nFamilies living in hunger across the country need and deserve our help. \nI am hopeful\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\nthat the Budget Committee will create a reserve fund dedicated to \nhunger relief. Next, I hope that the Agriculture Committee will apply \nits expertise to the work we have begun and report this legislation.\n  Again, I thank Senator Lugar, who has been a leader in the \nAgriculture Committee, and has also been a leader on this concern, as \nwell as working with us on this issue historically, and our good \nfriend, Senator Harkin from Iowa. Senator Specter has been a leader, as \nwell. I thank Senator Leahy and Senator Jeffords and Senator Daschle, \nall who are strong supporters. We have a number of our colleagues who \nare cosponsors. But all of them have had long careers on the issue of \nhunger in America. We are grateful for their continued interest and \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me simply respond quickly to the very \nspecific points the distinguished Senator has made. Hunger relief \ncontinues to be a top priority for the Agriculture Committee. That will \nalways be the case.\n  One priority should be that States should have the flexibility they \nneed to determine how vehicles are counted under the Food Stamp Program \nsince States know best about the transportation needs of the families. \nThe Senator has mentioned that is one of the points he has. We strongly \ncommend that idea. We look forward to working with the Senator and with \nothers.\n  I wish to take advantage of this opportunity simply to say that in my \nown State of Indiana I have been visiting food banks, four very \nsubstantial efforts in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Evansville, and in \nLewisville, serving nine Indiana counties.\n  The reason for my doing that is that the demands for food from these \nfood banks and from the food pantries that they serve have increased \nvery substantially during the last year. This is counterintuitive to \nmany Americans, but not to the Senator from Massachusetts who has \nhighlighted that in his remarks today.\n  In part, it comes because of a transition from welfare to work. A \nnumber of individual Americans--and a 7-State survey pointed out--these \nindividuals have, in fact, accepted jobs. A majority of those who were \non welfare rolls in Indiana have moved into jobs. But for most of these \npeople, the incomes, on an annual basis, are somewhere in the \nneighborhood of $10,000 to $15,000.\n  Many have substantial families. They have moved from welfare but not \nout of poverty. The survey found that 50 percent of these families had \nextended families. They went, as we would, to their kinfolk. They were \nable to gain food during desperate periods. The other half essentially \nwent to food banks; thus the increased demand.\n  I have offered a modest piece of legislation, which the Finance \nCommittee is now considering--I hope they will consider it carefully--\nthat further codifies the tax exemption given to companies that already \nare given an exemption for food contributed to food banks but extends \nthat to partnerships or proprietorships, to individual entrepreneurs, \nrestaurants and others, as well as to farmers and ranchers, many of \nwhom make these generous contributions now. It is in recognition of a \nvery substantial need. There has been great support, at least in my \nState, for meeting the needs of those who have them.\n  Clearly, reforms of the Food Stamp Program are very important in the \nsame regard and for the same reason--the many Americans who face \nproblems of hunger. The Senator is certainly correct; the distribution \nproblem, the equity problems, are profound. But those are ones we must \ndeal with, and I thank the Senator for taking the floor today for this \nimportant colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments and \nfor his energy in visiting these distribution centers himself.\n  I will put in the Record some of the findings in a number of the \ndistribution places in Massachusetts, with the increasing escalation of \nfamilies who are receiving the benefits of these foods and increasing \nnumbers of children, and that the total ages have gone down extensively \nas well. It is a very powerful and moving commentary about what is \nhappening.\n  I agree with the Senator, at a time when we all remind ourselves \nevery day about how strong this economy is and the significant economic \nprogress we have made, all of that is very true, but there are a number \nof people in our country who are facing significant deprivation in the \narea of food. We want to see what can be done to try to provide some \nrelief. We will work closely with the committee and with the chairman. \nI am grateful to him.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I fully agree with my friend from Massachusetts that \nhunger relief needs to be a top priority for the Agriculture Committee, \nand resources should be found to address the problem. I am especially \nconcerned that states have the flexibility they need to determine how \nvehicles are counted under the Food Stamp Program, since states know \nbest what transportation families need to work and to safely transport \ntheir children.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I look forward to working with my good friend from \nIndiana and Massachusetts to pass strong hunger relief legislation this \nyear. In my work on the Agriculture Committee, the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and the Labor, HHS, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have been dismayed not only to see the \nreports of increasing hunger among children and working families that \nSenator Kennedy describes, but also to hear scientists explain how \ninadequate nutrition limits children's ability to learn at school and \nadults' ability to concentrate at work. I join my colleagues in urging \nthe Budget Committee to report a resolution that includes a reserve \nfund of $2.5 billion over five years to alleviate hunger in America.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I decided to join my friend from Massachusetts in \nintroducing the Hunger Relief Act after carefully reviewing the \nevidence of persisting hunger in Pennsylvania and the U.S., and after \nextensive consultations with local leaders who are working under \nenormous strains to meet growing needs. As chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee that covers education and labor programs, I \nshare the concern expressed by my friend from Iowa that our education, \nhealth, and workforce improvement efforts are threatened by unmet needs \nfor nutritional assistance. I too hope that the Budget Committee \nresponds to the needs that our hunger relief legislation addresses, by \nincluding a reserve fund of $2.5 billion over five years.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. My good friend from Pennsylvania makes an excellent \npoint about investigating hunger in his state. He has shown impressive \nleadership throughout our deliberations on hunger during this Congress, \nand helped hone our proposal to target the most urgent needs. From my \nmany discussions with Senator Specter, I know that he has carefully \ninvestigated the hardships faced by his constituents in Pennsylvania. I \nurge every Senator in this Chamber to follow his example. In \nMassachusetts:\n  An eleven-year-old child in Brighton reported to investigators last \nyear that ``Sometimes I'm really hungry. Sometimes I have nothing to \neat but Cheerios and milk. . . . I wake up and I can't go back to sleep \nbecause I have stomach pain. Then I wake up in the morning and I feel \nsick. I wish that every time we need food, we just had it in the \nfridge.''\n  A mother in Springfield worried, ``Should my kids sit in the dark or \nshould they go hungry? One of my kids has multiple handicaps, so I have \nto pay the utility bills to have heat and light. But, then we have no \nfood.''\n  A 12-year-old youngster in Dorchester reports, ``When I'm hungry I \nfeel like I'm dying. I eat ice because it fills me up with water. . . . \nWhen I don't eat, in school I get sleepy and bored.''\n  When I looked at studies conducted throughout the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts, I found that 35 percent of Massachusetts food bank and \nsoup kitchen clients are under 18 years old. Moreover, 63 percent of \nMassachusetts community food providers have reported an increase in \ndemand for food aid in the last year, with 49 percent of programs \nnoting an increase in demand among families with children. This \nevidence of ongoing urgent needs is inconsistent with the fact that \n118,000 people\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\nin Massachusetts left food stamp roles in the three years preceding \nSeptember 1998 even though during this time the number of people living \nin poverty increased by 50,000. I think that if any Senator conducts a \nsimilar review of the data, unfortunately a similar picture will \nemerge.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The needs described so well by my colleagues are \npervasive, urgent, and fully within our means to address. Hunger has a \ncure. As ranking member of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Research, \nNutrition, and General Legislation, I will do all I can to pass the \nHunger Relief Act this year. I respectfully and insistently ask the \nBudget Committee to cooperate in creating a $2.5 billion reserve for \nthis purpose.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Hunger in this time of prosperity should not be \ntolerated by people of any party affiliation. The American people \noverwhelmingly support hunger relief efforts, and many of them \nvolunteer their time and resources to help in their communities. I'm \nencouraged that the groundwork for modest hunger relief has been laid \nentirely in a bipartisan spirit, and should continue this way through \npassage of legislation that the experts on the Agriculture Committee \nhave perfected. I join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in \ninviting the Budget Committee to preserve this spirit as it reserves \n$2.5 billion over five years for hunger relief legislation. This will \nproduce a significant bipartisan, moderate accomplishment this session \nfor people in obvious need.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. In this time of instant millionaires, it's easy to close \nour eyes to the fact that people, particularly children, go hungry in \nthis country. But hunger is a fact and it's a national tragedy. It's \nparticularly troubling that many working families find themselves short \nof food.\n  When Congress enacted welfare reform in 1996, we worked to ensure \nthat families would have the support they need to get off welfare. Food \nstamps are a critical part of that support. Yet food stamp enrollment \nhas declined more rapidly than the poverty data would suggest is \nwarranted.\n  The policies we are talking about today are urgently needed to reduce \nhunger in this country, particularly in working families that need \nextra help as they work to become self-sufficient.\n  I commend the Senators who have spoken today for their efforts to \naddress the serious problem of hunger in America. A number of us met \nrecently with Secretary Glickman to discuss this issue. I look forward \nto working with them to enact hunger relief legislation this year and \nurge the Budget Committee to reserve $2.5 billion for this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for that colloquy.\n  In completing at least the unanimous consent list of amendments, the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, has offered an \namendment which is in the form of language he has presented to me. I \nask unanimous consent that the Kohl amendment be made a part of the \nmanagers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I further ask unanimous consent that Senator Grams of \nMinnesota be added as a cosponsor to the Kohl amendment which is now \npart of the managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Managers' amendment (No. 2887), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, strike the table of contents and insert the \n     following:\n\nSec. 1.

Mr. President, this completes the amendments list. At this \npoint, I yield the floor to Senators who wish to speak on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair.\n  I am very pleased to support a crop insurance reform bill that has \nbeen a long while in the making. I compliment the chairman of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee for his diligence in this. He has \ncertainly worked hard and put forth a great effort in working with all \nof us to come up with a final product. I appreciate his diligence and \npatience and all his hard work and wisdom that have gone into it.\n  As we all know, the Budget Committee included funds to reform our \nailing Crop Insurance Program last year. I have been working diligently \nwith the Senate Agriculture Committee to develop a bill that will \nimprove the current program because for us in the South, the current \nprogram doesn't work. What we are considering today is the result of \nthe efforts and hard work of all of us.\n  I believe this bill makes fundamental changes to the existing Federal \nCrop Insurance Program that are necessary to make crop insurance more \nworkable and affordable for producers across the country, and I urge \nits passage. Congress has been attempting to eliminate the ad hoc \ndisaster program for years because it is not the most effective way of \nhelping our farmers who suffer yield losses.\n  Last year, Senator Cochran and I introduced a comprehensive bill that \naddressed what we saw as the various reforms necessary in the Crop \nInsurance Program. I am pleased that many of those provisions are \nincluded in the bill we are considering today.\n  As we all know, the Government's role in farm programs has changed. \nThe 1996 farm bill phased out our traditional support for our farmers, \nand the current farm programs require producers to assume more risk \nthan ever before.\n  Due to the agricultural economic crisis we are experiencing, there \nhas been much discussion lately on the issues of the safety net for our \nNation's producers. On that point, I will be perfectly clear. Crop \ninsurance is a risk management tool to help producers guard against \nyield loss. It was not created and was never intended to be, and will \nnever be, the end-all, be-all solution for the income needs of our \nNation's producers.\n  As the crop insurance reform debate proceeds, I am hopeful my \ncolleagues will be cognizant of the various needs in the agricultural \ncommunity and recognize that while crop insurance is an important part \nof the safety net, it is not and should not be the only income guard \nfor our Nation's farmers.\n  In Arkansas, the last estimates I heard indicated that fewer than 2 \npercent of our cotton producers were participating in the buy-up \nprogram. Buy-up coverage for all commodities in Arkansas historically \nis below 20 percent. That tells me the producers in my home State don't \nthink crop insurance is currently providing the kind of help they need.\n  In the South, we traditionally grow capital-intensive crops. As we \nhave\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\ngrown these crops in the past, and certainly as we will in the future, \nthe way the current Crop Insurance Program is structured, the rating \nprogram has never suited our needs or made it a good business decision \nfor southern farmers to purchase crop insurance. This bill establishes \na process for reevaluating crop insurance rates for all crops and for \nlowering those rates if warranted.\n  It was only after pressure from Congress last year that the risk \nmanagement agency reduced rates by as much as 50 percent for cotton in \nArkansas and the Midsouth. The provision included in today's bill will \nrequire further review of all southern commodities in the rating \nstructure. By making the Crop Insurance Program more affordable, \nadditional producers will be encouraged to participate in the program \nand protect themselves against the unforeseeable factors that will be \nworking against them once they put a crop into the ground. This is the \nultimate goal, to get more participation in our insurance program.\n  The bill also provides for an enhanced subsidy structure so producers \nare encouraged to buy up from their current level of coverage. The \nstructure included in this bill will make the step from catastrophic to \nbuy-up easier for producers and will make obtaining the highest level \nof coverage easier for those who are already participating in the Crop \nInsurance Program.\n  In an attempt to improve the recordkeeping process within USDA, this \nlegislation also requires that FSA and RMA coordinate their \nrecordkeeping activities. Current USDA recordkeeping, split between FSA \nand the RMA, is redundant and insufficient. By including both Crop \nInsurance Program participants and nonprogram participants in the \nprocess, we hope to enhance the agricultural data held by the agency \nand make acreage and yield reporting less of a hassle for already \noverburdened producers.\n  In addition, this bill establishes a role for consultation with State \nFSA committees in the introduction of new coverage to a State. The need \nfor this provision was made abundantly clear to Arkansas' rice \nproducers last spring.\n  A private insurance policy was offered to farmers at one rate, only \nto have the company reduce the rate once the amount of potential \nexposure was realized.\n  In my discussions with various executives from the company on this \nissue it became apparent that their knowledge of the rice industry was \nfairly minimal. Had they consulted with local FSA committees who had a \nworking knowledge of the rice industry before introduction of the \npolicy, the train wreck that occurred might have been stopped in its \ntracks.\n  I am pleased that another reform measure that I worked on has been \nincluded to help rice producers suffering losses caused by drought.\n  Recent droughts have left many Arkansas farmers with low reservoirs \nand depleting aquifers. If rains do not replenish them, an adequate \nirrigation supply may not exist by summer.\n  In addition, drought conditions in Louisiana have caused salt to \nintrude into the water supply used for irrigation on many farms. \nCurrent law states that rice is excluded from drought policies because \nit is irrigated. This is not equitable since rice producers do suffer \nlosses due to drought.\n  I have worked with Senators Breaux and Landrieu to provide these \npolicies for our rice producers who are experiencing reduced irrigation \nopportunities due to the severe drought conditions that have plagued \nthe South for the last two years. I am pleased that this provision has \nbeen included in the bill. I thank Senators Landrieu and Breaux for \ntheir hard work on it.\n  Many of the problems associated with the crop insurance program have \nbeen addressed in previous reform measures. However, fraud and abuses \nare still present to some degree.\n  This bill strengthens the monitoring of agents and adjusters to \ncombat fraud and enhances the penalties available to USDA for \ncompanies, agents and producers who engage in fraudulent activities.\n  There is simply no room for bad actors that recklessly cost the \ntaxpayers money.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I was prepared during our committee markup \nearlier this month to offer an amendment related to a cooperative's \nrole in the delivery of crop insurance.\n  I held off at that time due to concerns from the committee related to \npossible ``rebating'' ramifications and preemption of state law.\n  I am pleased that Senators Kerrey and Grassley, as well as the Risk \nManagement Agency, were willing to work with me to include my amendment \nin this bill.\n  This amendment does nothing to preempt state law or even change \ncurrent federal law. It simply provides that current approved business \npractices be maintained.\n  With the inclusion of my amendment Congress is recognizing the \nvaluable role cooperatives play in the crop insurance program, \nspecifically, encouraging producer participation in the crop insurance \nprogram, improving the delivery system for crop insurance, and helping \nto develop new and improved insurance products.\n  My amendment requires the Risk Management Agency to finalize \nregulations that would incorporate the currently approved business \npractices of cooperatives participating in the crop insurance program \nand to do so within 180 days of enactment of this act.\n  If farmer owned entities are not allowed to sell crop insurance, then \nanyone can sell crop insurance in America except an American farmer. \nSuch a legal result would give the appearance that crop insurance is \ndesigned for a closed club to exploit farmers.\n  In my opinion, that appearance would inhibit broader use of crop \ninsurance, which is the overall objective we have been trying to reach. \nI don't believe that such a result is the intent of those who have put \nso much effort into improving the Crop Insurance Program, and I am \npleased our amendment has been worked in.\n  Mr. President, I personally want to thank all of the staff members of \nthe committee and the industry representatives who have helped in this \neffort. It certainly doesn't happen without their long hours of work, \ndiligence, and perseverance in making all of this come together.\n  Arkansas farmers have told me time and time again that crop insurance \nisn't affordable for the amount of coverage they receive. As the \nprogram currently exists, it does not make sound business sense to \npurchase crop insurance in our State. Since this reform process began, \nI have been working to correct this inequity. I hope the changes we \nmake today will lead to a Crop Insurance Program that is equitable, \naffordable, and effective.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska has asked the \nSenate to consider adding wild salmon to the list of crops for a pilot \nstudy is to be conducted as a basis for making federally-sponsored crop \ninsurance available to fishermen. My understanding is that this is not \nthe first time that the Department of Agriculture would be reviewing \nfish stocks for crop insurance. In the past, there was concern that \nwild fish can be too hard to track, and that fisheries managers don't \nreally know when the stocks have failed. However, fisheries managers \ntrack fish stocks, especially wild salmon, very closely.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My good friend, the chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, is correct. The State of Alaska has been managing wild \nsalmon since statehood more than 40 years ago. In fact, one of the \ndriving forces behind our statehood movement was to gain management \ncontrol over our resources, particularly the salmon fisheries. I see my \nfriend, the Senator from Kansas, may have a question on fisheries \nmanagement.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. And is it true that fisheries managers can accurately \npredict how much fish can be caught from year-to-year?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The chairman of the Agriculture Committee is correct. \nFisheries managers try to ensure that salmon returning to spawn reach \ntheir escapement goal, which is the number of spawners needed to return \na heathly population of juveniles to the streams and oceans. \nHistorically, managers can accurately estimate how many fish are \nexpected to return based on the lifespan of the salmon and the \nescapement numbers from previous years. Fisheries managers also track \nhistorical trends, which are often linked to long term weather cycles, \nand their relationship to escapement numbers. The State of Alaska in \nparticular uses in-season\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\nmanagement to ensure its pre-season escapement goals.\n  However, occasionally the fish do not return. For example, chum \nsalmon runs in areas of western Alaska were at all time lows in 1997 \nand 1998. The low chum runs have had a devastating effect on the \nwestern Alaska economy. This exactly the type of crisis that could be \nalleviated by making crop insurance available to salmon fishermen. \nFishermen are the farmers of the sea, and they deserve the same \nprotections we afford to our farmers in the inland states.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator from Alaska for informing us of these \naspects of fish harvests.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from \nKansas for their hard work on this important legislation and for \naddressing my request.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the farmers and ranchers of this country \nhave been struggling with terrible economic conditions over the past \nthree years. They have seen their prices collapse and remain at, or in \nmany cases below, the cost of production. Not only have farmers in my \nstate and across the country endured these low prices, they have also \nbeen subject to the unpredictable forces of droughts, floods and crop \ndisease.\n  We have before us a bill that will help farmers and ranchers survive \nthese bad times and manage production risks. S. 2251, the Risk \nManagement for the 21st Century Act, is a comprehensive approach to \nreforming and improving crop insurance for producers across the \ncountry. It will make the federal crop insurance program more \naffordable and effective.\n  Currently, the government provides subsidies for multi-peril crop \ninsurance, but subsidies are progressively less at higher levels of \ncoverage. This aspect of the crop insurance program often has the \neffect of restricting farmers from investing in the most efficient \nlevels of coverage for their farms. This bill inverts this subsidy, so \nthe higher levels of coverage are subsidized at the highest levels. \nThis makes meaningful and comprehensive coverage much more affordable \nto farmers in this country who rely on the program to manage their \nproduction risks.\n  This bill also addresses another issue of critical importance to \nfarmers in South Dakota and nationwide. Many parts of the country have \nsuffered devastating crop losses for several years in a row. As \ndisastrous conditions persist, farmers' eligibility under the current \ncrop insurance program decreases--the opposite of what common sense \nwould dictate. This bill enables producers to protect and sustain their \ncrop insurance eligibility so that crop insurance remains an \neconomically viable option for them for the long term.\n  This legislation also authorizes the Risk Management Agency (RMA) to \ndevelop insurance products on a pilot basis for livestock producers. \nFor too long, we have excluded our cattle ranchers, hog producers, and \nother livestock producers from federal agriculture programs, including \ncrop--or perhaps we should say ``commodity''--insurance. This bill \nexpands the flexibility of the program in this way so that more \nproducers can benefit from this important investment.\n  This legislation also provides great benefits for producers of \nspecialty crops. It improves catastrophic loss insurance coverage by \nincreasing the access specialty crop farmers have to quality crop \ninsurance policies. Current crop insurance policies do not cover the \nunique characteristics associated with the planting, growing, and \nharvesting of specialty crops. This bill will promote specialty crop \nproducer participation in the federal crop insurance program, encourage \nhigher levels of coverage than provided by catastrophic insurance, and \nenable those producers to make better planning and marketing decisions. \nFurthermore, the bill requires that at least fifty percent of the funds \ndedicated to research and development for new crop insurance products \nare focused on specialty crop product development. This legislation \nalso specifically provides funds to the RMA to enter into public and \nprivate partnerships to develop specialty crop insurance policies, and \nauthorizes funds for pilot programs that would be conducted at the \nstate, regional, and national levels.\n  Finally, this bill eliminates the area trigger for the non-insured \nassistance program, making any grower whose crop is uninsurable and who \nexperiences a federally-declared disaster eligible for disaster funds.\n  Some have shared a concern that this crop insurance plan does not \nadequately address the range of problems across the country. They \nshould be assured that this bill was written with the input and support \nof lawmakers, farmers, and agricultural organizations from all regions \nof the country.\n  The crop insurance program has grown in popularity over the last \nseveral years. This bill will significantly improve an already \nimportant and successful program. Effective and affordable crop \ninsurance is a vital part of an improved safety net that farmers and \nranchers need to protect themselves from production risks, and to \nsurvive and succeed this year and in years to come.\n  But make no mistake. Passage of this bill is only one part of our \noverall effort to improve farm policy. We must consider the many other \nways in which our current policies have contributed to the poor \neconomic conditions plaguing our farmers and ranchers. I look forward \nto that debate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, Mr. Lugar, for his work on the legislation before the \nSenate today. The Senators from Kansas and Nebraska deserve \ncommendation also because of their active influence in shaping this \nbill.\n  I wish I could support this effort to reform crop insurance, but it \nhas a built in bias against Southern agriculture. I supported the \nmeasure that was put before the Committee by the Chairman and I voted \nagainst the substitute amendment that was offered during the committee \nmarkup by the Senators from Kansas and Nebraska. Their amendment \nprevailed, and it is now the pending business before the Senate. The \nChairman's mark offered farmers a choice between higher government \ncontributions to their crop insurance premium or a new risk management \npayment that they could use for eligible activities which lower the \nfinancial risk of their farming operation.\n  Farmers in Mississippi preferred the Lugar bill. Mississippi has the \nthird lowest crop insurance participation rate in the country. This \nbill will not increase the participation rate in my state and I don't \nthink it will eliminate the need for Congress to provide disaster \nassistance in the future.\n  The bill now before the Senate, while including some of the \nprogrammatic changes that I have advocated and introduced in a bill \nwith the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, falls short \nof the reform that we have promised agriculture producers.\n  Here are two specific examples. First, it contains a subsidy \nstructure which heavily favors regions of the country which already \nhave high crop insurance participation rates and low premiums. This \nbill will make premiums even lower for those producers, while at the \nsame time, effectively raising rates for producers that purchase \ncoverage in the middle levels. The effect of this subsidy structure is \nthat farmers who currently purchase catastrophic coverage and want to \nmove into higher levels of coverage will only benefit from this \nlegislation if they buy at the lowest and highest levels of coverage. \nOtherwise, they would be better off under current law.\n  Second, farming is not a ``one-size-fits-all'' enterprise, but some \nbelieve that crop insurance should be. This bill fails to provide \nbenefits for those producers that find crop insurance to be \nuneconomical. Certainly many of the changes that are incorporated in \nthis bill will result in lower premiums, but for some producers in \nMississippi, that will not be enough.\n  I am encouraged that the Committee has provided $500 million in a \npilot program that may address the needs of those who find that crop \ninsurance is not a good business decision. However, the funds provided \nare significantly less than those that were included in the Lugar bill \nand will likely not produce a program that will be meaningful. I hope \nthat this amount will be increased in conference so that it can provide \nmeaningful assistance while not setting dangerous precedents for future \nfarm bill debates. I'm hopeful this legislation can be improved in \nconference with the other body.\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\n  Mr. President, I will vote no on this bill, I will work with the \nChairman and other committee members to resolve these concerns in \nconference.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased that my amendment to include \ndairy in this $6 billion crop insurance bill has been accepted by the \nbill managers and I thank them for their cooperation. In particular, I \nwant to thank Senators Lugar, Kerrey, Roberts, and Daschle for their \nassistance. I look forward to working with them prior to and during \nconference to ensure my amendment is part of the final bill reported by \nthe conference committee.\n  Dairy farmers have for too long been without any risk management \ntools to help them manage the risk of milk price volatility. The Dairy \nOptions Pilot Program, authorized by the 1996 farm bill, was set to \nexpire in 2002 and would have reached its 100 county cap at the end \nthis year. If we had allowed that to happen, we would have taken from \ndairy farmers this important educational risk management program at a \ntime when milk prices have hit their lowest levels in more than two \ndecades. The DOPP program helps farmers pay for the out-of-pocket costs \nof buying ``put'' options on the commodity exchanges while the pilot is \nin effect in their county. Equally important, the program requires that \nfarmers participate in an education and training program on the use of \nthe futures market for risk management purposes.\n  My amendment extends the Dairy Options Pilot Program until 2004 and \nraises the number of counties that can participate to 300. Moreover, \nthe amendment raises the number of counties in each state that can \nparticipate from six to 25. This is important to Wisconsin since, at \nthe end of this year, Wisconsin would have hit its county cap as well.\n  The DOPP, on top of forward contracting through their cooperatives or \nother milk buyers, provides dairy farmers with an additional risk \nmanagement tool. It is a tool that will be available, under my \namendment, to dairy farmers throughout the nation. It is a national \nprogram, not a regional program. And I hope my colleagues from other \nregions will join me in looking for every possible national tool we \nhave to help dairy farmers across the United States.\n  This is, Mr. President--and I cannot stress this enough--only one of \nthe many things we need to do to help dairy farmers struggle through \nincreased dairy market volatility. Dairy farmers in my state are \nhurting right now. The DOPP, while important, is not the answer to the \nunacceptably low milk prices. We must do more--much, much more. DOPP, \neven with my amendment, will still be available to farmers in only 300 \ncounties.\n  That is why I am also seeking $500 million in additional dairy market \nloss payments to put more money in the pockets of dairy farmers. \nFarmers nationwide need that help right now and I hope to work to \nprovide that assistance through my role as ranking Democrat on the \nAgricultural Appropriations subcommittee.\n  I also want to work with my colleagues to craft a national dairy \npolicy that will provide dairy farmers with a meaningful safety net \nthat does not distort markets or provide unfair regional advantages.\n  But I am pleased that S. 2251 bill will make this one tool--the \nDOPP--available to more farmers. It is, Mr. President, the very least \nwe can do. And I thank the managers for working with me to include this \namendment in the bill.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks regarding the \nRisk Management for the 21st Century Act.\n  Floridians know all too well the impact of natural disasters on the \nagriculture community. While I am proud of the ability of our growers \nto rebuild their farms after such devastating losses, enormous disaster \naid bills only serve as a band-aid fix to the problem. We must work \nharder to ensure that all farmers have access to the necessary risk-\nmanagement tools. This bill encourages growers to purchase appropriate \nlevels of crop insurance, hopefully avoiding the band-aid fix in future \nappropriation measures.\n  Florida is the ninth leading agricultural state in the nation, with \nannual farm receipts totaling $6 billion. The industry employs over \n80,000 people and generates more than $18 billion in related economic \nactivity. In 1998, hard working Floridians produced more than 25 \nbillion pounds of food, and more than 2 million tons of livestock feed. \nI am proud to say that Florida leads the nation in production of 18 \nmajor agricultural commodities including oranges, sugarcane and fresh \ntomatoes. With these statistics in mind, it is imperative to ensure \nthat federal programs work with, not against, Florida's farmers.\n  As an original co-sponsor of S. 1401, the Specialty Crop Insurance \nAct of 1999, I support the effort to reduce the dependence of the \nspecialty crop industry on catastrophic loss insurance coverage by \nimproving its access to quality crop insurance policies. By failing to \naccount for the unique characteristics associated with farming \nspecialty crops, current crop insurance policies do not include many \nspecialty crop producers.\n  Through promotion of affordable crop insurance policies, S. 1401 \nwould increase specialty crop producer participation in the Federal \nCrop Insurance Program. Today's legislation, S. 2251, the Risk \nManagement for the 21st Century Act, includes many of these specialty \ncrop provisions.\n  This legislation requires that 50% of the funds dedicated to research \nand development for the new crop insurance products are focused on \nspecialty crop product development. At a level of $20 million per year, \nthe legislation authorizes the Risk Management Agency to enter into \npartnerships with private and public entities to increase the \navailability of risk management tools for specialty crops. The \nexpertise of outside agencies will most certainly help the Risk \nManagement Agency develop sound specialty crop insurance policies.\n  The Risk Management for the 21st Century Act also includes an \nexpansion of Risk Management Agency pilot authority, removal of the \nNon-insured Assistance Program (NAP) area trigger, incentives for \ngrowers who purchase ``buy-up'' coverage, and it proposes a premium \nrefund for low-risk producers. These reforms will ease our nation's \ngrowers dependence on short sighted disaster relief bills.\n  This bill is the product of countless hours of negotiation, and I \nbelieve it represents an incredible opportunity to improve our Federal \nCrop Insurance Program. The Agriculture Committee has been extremely \nhelpful in including the interests of specialty crop producers, and I \nthank them for their time and effort. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Risk Management for the 21st Century Act.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend the Chairman for moving this \nissue forward today. One of Georgia farmers' biggest complaints has \nbeen the inadequacies of the crop insurance program. The current \nprogram does not work and needs to be substantially reformed. Georgia \nfarmers and ranchers continue to experience severe financial \ndifficulties as a result of the lowest commodity prices in a decade, \nthe devastating loss of international markets, and back to back \ndisasters. They need a crop insurance program that provides the most \neconomic benefits possible. While Congress helped stave off disaster in \nrural America by providing economic and weather related loss assistance \nin the fiscal year 1999 and 2000, it is evident that more needs to be \ndone. Farmers need risk management programs that provide some \nprotection against weather related and economic losses beyond their \ncontrol. As it currently stands, crop insurance is too expensive for \nmost farmers and has resulted in a low participation rate by many \nGeorgia farmers.\n  The legislation before us today, while not perfect by any means, is a \nstep in the right direction. I am reluctantly supporting this measure \nin an effort to move the debate forward. I would like to thank the \nChairman for all his efforts on this important issue. While we are \ndisappointed, of course, that the Chairman's mark did not prevail in \ncommittee. The Chairman's bill would have allowed Georgia farmers to \nchoose whether or not traditional crop insurance was a viable risk \nmanagement tool for their farms. There is $6 billion at stake though, \nand we need it to reform the program. The House has passed a bill with \nfavorable provisions\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\nfor the Southeast. We intend to fight for perfections to the bill we \npass today, so our region of the country is treated fairly.\n  The Roberts/Kerry bill has many important reform provisions that were \nincluded in the Cochran/Lincoln bill, of which I was proud to be a \ncosponsor. Some of these provisions included are increased subsidy \nrates for farmers, affordable specialty crop insurance policies, multi-\nyear APH adjustments, equal prevented planting for all crops, and \nrating methodology reform. This bill also includes over $400 million \nfor a risk management pilot program which we hope to tailor to the \nGeorgia farmers' needs. All in all, this bill needs to go forward. We \nwill ultimately arrive at a program that will be much better for our \nfarmers than the status quo.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, members of the Senate, I am proud to offer \nmy support for the legislation. As many before me have said, this bill \nis the product of extended debate and compromise on all sides of this \ndebate.\n\n\n            crop insurance is a tool to reduce disaster aid\n\n  Over the last 3 years, we have passed large disaster aid packages to \nfarmers. Over the last 2 years, we have spent billions of dollars in \ndisaster relief for farmers.\n  Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin said it best: a stitch in time saves \nnine. If we invest in crop insurance, it will significantly lower the \ncosts associated with agricultural disasters. The choice is simple: \ngive farmers the tools they need to plan for catastrophic weather, or \nrisk emergency, after-the-fact spending that impedes our ability to \npreserve social security.\n  Of particular interest to my state of Florida are the provisions in \nthis legislation dealing with the needs of specialty crop producers. \nAgriculture in Florida has many different faces. There are 40,000 \ncommercial farmers in the state.\n  In 1997, Florida farmers utilized a little more than 10 million of \nthe state's nearly 35 million acres to produce more than 25 billion \npounds of food and more than 2 million tons of livestock feed.\n  Florida ranks number nine nationally in the value of its farm \nproducts and number two in the value of its vegetable crops. Florida \nagriculture is not only valuable, but also diverse. Florida ranks \nnumber two nationally in horticulture production with annual sales of \nover $1 billion. Florida grows 77 percent of U.S. grapefruits and 47 \npercent of the world supply. The state produces 75 percent of the \nnation's oranges and 20 percent of the world supply.\n  Florida's farmers led the Nation in the production of 18 major \nagriculture commodities in 1997 ranging from oranges and grapefruits, \nto a wide variety of vegetables, to tropical fish. Florida livestock \nand products sales were $1.1 billion in 1997. Florida is the largest \nmilk-producing State in the southeast. The bottom line for Florida \nagriculture is that our State has a wide variety of non-traditional \ncrops.\n  On July 29, 1999 I introduced S. 1401, the Specialty Crop Insurance \nAct of 1999, with my colleagues Senators Mack, Feinstein, Boxer, and \nBingaman. This legislation sought to reduce the dependence of the \nspecialty crop industry on catastrophic loss insurance coverage by \nimproving its access to quality crop insurance policies.\n  Current crop insurance policies available for specialty crops do not \ncover the unique characteristics associated with the planting, growing, \nand harvesting of specialty crops. We need a different approach for \nthis unique sector of U.S. agriculture.\n  Our legislation sought to promote the development and use of \naffordable specialty crop insurance policies. This action is intended \nto increase specialty crop producer participation in the Federal Crop \nInsurance Program, encourage higher levels of coverage than provided by \ncatastrophic insurance, and encourage better planning and marketing \ndecisions.\n  I am extremely pleased that the legislation we are considering today \nincorporates the provisions in my legislation.\n  (1) The biggest problem for specialty crop growers is availability of \naffordable policies. According to a 1999 GAO Report on USDA's progress \nin expanding crop insurance coverage for specialty crops, even after an \nexpansion in policies available to specialty crops planned through \n2001, the existing crop insurance program will fail to cover \napproximately 300 specialty crops that make up 15 percent of the market \nshare.\n  To increase the availability of affordable crop insurance products, I \nproposed that we give the Risk Management Agency the resources and the \nability to tap into expertise in the private sector during product \ndevelopment. S. 2251 accomplishes this goal.\n  The bill before us today requires that at least 50 percent of the \nfunds dedicated to research and development for new crop insurance \nproducts are focused on specialty crop product development. Fifty \npercent of these funds are to be spent on outside contractors, giving \nthose with expertise on specialty crops the opportunity to develop \npolicies.\n  The legislation specifically authorizes $20 million per year for RMA \nto enter into public and private partnerships to develop specialty crop \ninsurance policies.\n  It also establishes a process to review new product development and \nensure that crop insurance products are available to all agricultural \ncommodities, including specialty crops.\n  I believe the actions taken by S. 2251 will give RMA the authority \nand resources it needs to use the expertise of the private sector to \ndevelop good crop insurance products for specialty crops.\n  (2) To further encourage development of new policies, I proposed \nexpansion of the RMA pilot authority. This legislation authorizes funds \nfor pilot programs. It allows pilots to be conducted on state, \nregional, and national basis for a period of four years to be extended \nif desired by RMA. S. 2251 also includes the authority for RMA to \nconduct a pilot program on crop insurance for timber, a provision I \noriginally introduced on April 22 of last year in S. 868, the Forestry \nInitiative to Restore the Environment.\n  (3) Growers who do not have access to crop insurance policies depend \non the Non-insured Assistance Program (NAP). To ensure that aid from \nthis program actually reaches farmers in need, I proposed elimination \nof the area trigger for non-insured assistance program, making any \ngrower whose crop is uninsurable and experiences a federally-declared \ndisaster, eligible for these funds. This bill does the same.\n  (4) My legislation took action to encourage growers to purchase buy-\nup coverage. The Risk Management for the 21st Century Act increases the \nrate for 50/100 coverage, the initial buy-up level after catastrophic \ncoverage to 60 percent.\n  (5) To encourage farmers to take proactive risk management action, \nboth my legislation and S. 2251 propose a premium refund for low-risk \nproducers.\n  I believe that the provisions in the Risk Management for the 21st \nCentury Act will ensure that specialty crop producers have access to \nhigh-quality insurance products designed to meet their needs.\n  I am pleased that the goals of my legislation, S. 1401, the Specialty \nCrop Insurance Act of 1999, are met by the legislation before us today. \nI commend my colleagues for their efforts to ensure that crop insurance \nreform passed by the 106th Congress will take into account the needs of \nall agriculture producers, not just one sector. I offer my support for \nthis legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is an important day. Today we are \nfinally bringing to bear over eighteen months of hard work toward \nreforming the Federal Crop Insurance Program. This is an issue of vital \nimportance to Montana.\n  First, however, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in \napplauding Senators Roberts and Kerrey for their hard work in bringing \na comprehensive solution to the table as well as Chairman Lugar for \nhelping us work quickly to pass this important legislation. We can all \nbe proud of a job well done.\n  The bill before you to day, the Risk Management for the Twenty First \nCentury Act, is a fine example of what can be done when we work on a \nbipartisan basis to solve a difficult problem. I am pleased that \nMontana producers and crop insurance providers also contributed largely \nto this effort.\n  Last spring, I held a crop insurance community hearing in Shelby, MT. \nKen\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\nAckerman, director of the Risk Management Agency, flew out for that \nhearing and got quite an earful. Montana farmers told us they wanted a \nprogram they could count on. A risk management tool that would be more \nefficient, more cost effective, more responsible, and more accountable. \nA program that encourages farmers to try new and innovative crops. And \na reliable system that moves us away from the annual ad hoc disaster \nband-aids. I would like to extend a personal thank you to Ken Ackerman \nand his agency for listening to our concerns and helping draft them \ninto this legislation.\n  Today, I am optimistic that we in the Senate are soon to make those \ngoals a reality. The $6 billion legislative package before us today \nwill amend the Federal Crop Insurance program in several specific ways. \nThe measure will:\n  Make crop insurance more affordable and broaden coverage to encourage \nproducers to purchase the highest levels of coverage;\n  Create more realistic production history so that produces won't be \npenalized for losses over several years;\n  Encourage producers to plant new specialty crops;\n  Require producer input on the federal crop insurance program board of \ndirectors to ensure that the program works for the people who are \nbuying the insurance product; and\n  Make it easier for producers to get disaster assistance for crops \nthat have no production history.\n  I would like to highlight one particular section in this bill--that \nis the provision that at long last addresses the fact that during \nprevious farm programs, Montana specialty crop producers have had \nlittle or no safety net. This is important since traditional crop \nprices have collapsed and farmers have ventured into specialty markets \nto survive. But because they have little or no production history, they \nare not eligible for traditional crop insurance coverage. Instead they \nare subject to the Non-Insured Agriculture Program.\n  Unfortunately, the NAP program does not work. I have been told that \nin order for a farmer to be indemnified, she must be a ``very lucky \nperson.'' A loss suffered per se does not trigger payments. Instead, at \nleast five other producers in a defined 320,000 acre area must also \nsuffer severe losses in order to trigger NAP coverage. Clearly, unless \nall the pieces fall together in a perfect puzzle, it is likely that the \nproducer will not be paid.\n  Last year, I offered legislation that will help Montana farmers try \nnew and innovative crops by streamlining the NAP. Among other \nprovisions, our proposal eliminates the area trigger. That way if \ndisaster strikes, the producer will be covered. Plain and simple. \nSenator Larry Craig joined me in that effort, and I am pleased that our \nlegislation is included in the Senate bill that we are currently \nconsidering.\n  Folks at home want to farm. They can not control the weather, but \nthey should be able to invest in a program that helps them manage \nnature's unpredictable whims. With an improved crop insurance program, \nMontana farmers will be able to diversify, take risks and move beyond \nour traditional way of thinking.\n  We have before us the perfect opportunity to do what is right for \nMontana and rest of rural America--pass comprehensive crop insurance \nreform. I thank everyone who contributed to this effort and look \nforward to passage in the Senate, a successful conference and President \nsigning the bill into law in the very near future.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to support \nlegislation on the Senate floor today that improves and expands the \ncrop insurance and risk management tools available to farmers in the \nUnited States. After months of uncertainty on this issue it is my hope \nthat farmers desiring enhanced crop insurance and risk management \noptions will be reassured that Congress will take a positive step and \nenact reform this year.\n  Beyond the day-to-day uncertainties facing family farmers and \nranchers, matters are complicated today by current economic conditions \nin rural America. Collapsed crop and livestock prices, weak export \ndemand, and agribusiness concentration continue to threaten the \nviability of our independent family farmers and ranchers. Crop \ninsurance provides many agricultural producers with a risk management \ntool, but Congress needs to reform the current program at this time to \navoid allowing both low prices and an inadequate safety net to force \nfarmers out of business.\n  Nonetheless, I must caution that no matter how well crop insurance is \nimproved, it is not a substitute for a sound farm policy or safety net. \nInstead, crop insurance is an important part of that farm safety net. \nIt is my desire to also participate in a farm bill debate this year so \nCongress can reform the underlying farm bill. But, we must take \nadvantage of this day to act on crop insurance.\n  In 1994, I chaired the House of Representatives subcommittee charged \nwith reforming crop insurance. At the time one of our goals was to \nimprove insurance to a point where the government would not need to \ndevelop ad hoc disaster programs. Ad hoc disaster programs are \ndifficult to create, difficult to administer, and are politically \nunpopular. While I am pleased with many of the reforms we made in 1994, \naction in Congress to pass crop loss disaster programs in the last two \nyears reminds us that crop insurance has not fully replaced the need \nfor ad hoc disasters.\n  Crop insurance is critical to the farmers of South Dakota. Nearly \ntwenty South Dakota grown crops are currently eligible for crop \ninsurance, and among our major commodities, participation in the crop \ninsurance program is high. Ninety-five percent of our corn acreage is \nenrolled in crop insurance while 92 percent of our soybean acres are in \nthis program. Wheat producers in South Dakota place 76 percent of their \nacreage in crop insurance. After the reforms made to the program in \n1994, over 10 million acres of farmland in my state have been enrolled \nin crop insurance.\n  I am pleased to co-sponsor a bipartisan reform bill that is a \nmodification of S. 1580, the Kerrey-Roberts Crop Insurance for the 21st \nCentury Act. Our bill clearly recognizes improved crop insurance is \nabsolutely necessary for farmers in the future. Our underlying bill \nclosely mirrors the crop insurance reform bill enacted in the House of \nRepresentatives last year. Finally, our bill addresses some of the most \nserious concerns of the current crop insurance program; affordability, \ndependability, and flexibility.\n  The major reform proposed in our bill ensures greater affordability \nfor farmers, especially for higher levels of protection. Nearly every \nfarmer I talk to wants the opportunity to purchase higher levels of \ncoverage, but most have found that a threshold exists were buy-up \ncoverage becomes cost prohibitive. The Kerrey/Roberts bill makes \ncoverage more affordable by providing higher subsidies for higher \nlevels of coverage. South Dakota farmers support this provision of our \nbill because affordability seems to be the most pressing issue facing \ncrop insurance today.\n  In recent years, the issue of coverage dependability has come into \nserious question. Farmers in South Dakota and elsewhere have suffered \nunder multiple years of weather related disasters.\n  The bill I support ensures greater coverage dependability by \nproviding relief for producers suffering from insurance coverage \ndecreases and premium increases due to multi-year crop losses resulting \nfrom natural disasters. The bill adjusts actual production yield \nhistory--APH--for farmers by allowing producers who have suffered under \nthree natural disasters in five years to drop their lowest APH. It also \nprovides APH credit to assist beginning farmers and those who are \ndiversifying with new crop rotations.\n  Finally, the proposal I support authorizes the development of cost of \nproduction crop insurance policies. This should eventually be a new, \nuseful tool for producers. It also provides livestock producers hope \nthat the development of some type of livestock coverage is a priority. \nLivestock producers are the major contributor to South Dakota's \nagricultural economy, and risk management options are essential for \nthese producers.\n  However, our proposal, S. 2251, differs somewhat from our underlying \nbill, S. 1580, as well. Months of debate between members of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee has resulted in a certain degree of compromise on \nthe overall issue of crop insurance and risk management. Some in our \nCommittee believe a lump sum risk management payment\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\nis preferred by farmers in parts of the United Sates. While I am very \nconcerned that a de-coupled, lump sum payment is the wrong approach to \ntake for several reasons, I understand the need to have comity and \nreasonable compromise in the Senate. Therefore, our proposal includes a \npilot project to give farmers a choice between either crop insurance \ncoverage or a risk management payment on a commodity by commodity \nbasis. Yet, there are differences between the two risk management pilot \nprograms offered by our coalition and those supporting large direct \nlump sum payments.\n  I am concerned the de-coupled payment alternative offered by others \nof the Committee is flawed. First, dividing a limited amount of money \namong many producers with a risk management payment fails to ensure the \nneed for ad hoc disaster programs is eliminated. These direct lump sum \npayments will also be capitalized in land values and make it difficult \nfor small and beginning farmers to compete for land.\n  Moreover, the alternative bill pushed by others in the Committee \nallows ``double dipping'' of benefits which I oppose. Those who choose \na risk management payment are then also eligible for crop insurance \nunder the current premium subsidy structure in the alternative \nsupported by others today. This leads to a problem of complexity in \nterms of administration because crop insurance agents would be required \nto be able to quote two sets of premium rates available for farmers.\n  Nonetheless, members of the Senate have every right to propose risk \nmanagement alternatives that they believe suit the interests of the \nfarmers they represent. So with caution, I understand the need to offer \na compromise bill with my colleagues on the floor today that offers \nsome degree of ``choice'' and compromise. So, while the bill I support \ntoday also includes a risk management payment choice, it requires a \nmore rigorous set of conditions through certification and random \nauditing to ensure program compliance. Therefore I believe the risk \nmanagement payment in our approach is more responsible. That said, I \nwould be remiss if I did not state, unequivocally, that I deeply \nappreciate the chairman's leadership in the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, and I respect the fashion in which he allowed the mark-up \nhearing to take place on March 2.\n  I want to mention one final issue very critical to the overall \nacceptance and viability of a taxpayer funded program like crop \ninsurance. The issue of potential abuse in the insurance program was \ndiscussed in Congressional hearings on crop insurance reform last year. \nI do not believe fraud or abuse is of epidemic proportion in the crop \ninsurance program. In fact, I believe the lion's share of interests \n(farmers, agents, loss adjusters, industry, and government) working in \nand around federal crop insurance are doing so with the highest degree \nof integrity. However, I am cognizant that questionable claims and \npotential abuse were of great concern last year. That said, unless \nsteps are taken to bolster compliance and oversight the public support \nfor this vital program may diminish.\n  I am pleased to learn that earlier this month the risk Management \nAgency announced a major commitment to work with the private insurance \nindustry to strengthen the integrity of crop insurance. I am hopeful \nthis joint effort begins to end the concerns of this important program. \nI commend those involved in taking this positive step.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the pending amendment No. 2888 occur at 11 a.m. Thursday \nmorning, with 2 minutes equally divided for closing remarks prior to \nthe vote. I further ask consent that following that vote the bill be \nread the third time, under the previous consent, and the Senate proceed \nto vote on passage of H.R. 2559, the crop insurance risk management \nbill, as amended, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to address the crop insurance reform \nproposal. I thank you for the opportunity to address this legislation \nthat I think is so crucial to the economic health of farmers in \nMinnesota and across the country. I have appreciated the hard work and \neffort put into this bill, and I believe it is one of the key reform \nissues the Congress must address this year to create an economic \nclimate that will enable America's farmers to thrive.\n  As a sponsor of crop insurance legislation in both the 105th and \n106th Congress, I am certainly no stranger to this issue. Working with \nproducers, rural lenders, economists, and other stakeholders, I think \nwe have fashioned a bill that would encourage more participation in the \nprogram, help encourage producers to buy higher levels of coverage, and \nwill also reduce the instances of ``moral hazard'' to keep everybody's \npremiums lower, and also help maintain the integrity of the program.\n  Mr. President, I first introduced my crop insurance bill in the 105th \nCongress, and I am pleased that much of my own legislation has now been \nincorporated into the Roberts-Kerrey measure, including pilot programs \nthat would offer farmers premium discounts for using whole farm units \nor one crop units of insurance, and allowing producers to cross State \nand county boundaries to form insurable units, plus a pilot program \npermitting producers to ensure their crops are based upon a future \nprice. Also, I am pleased that this bill will now also include an \nexpansion of the dairy options pilot program. I think this is also a \nvery important tool for producers who are attempting to weather the ups \nand downs in the dairy market. So I think it is great that we have \nincluded this provision that is going to help dairy farmers in the \nMidwest and across the country as well.\n  Participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program has increased \nfrom 10 percent of the eligible acres in 1980 to about 70 percent of \neligible acres last year, 1999. I think that is encouraging, but we \nstill need higher levels of participation if our farm is to \nsuccessfully manage its risk in the face of ever-changing global \nmarkets. Like almost no other form of employment, producers are subject \nto a host of variables that impact their bottom line, including \nweather, disease, production levels in other countries, foreign trade, \nincreasing production costs, and changing consumer demand. All are out \nof the control of the producer.\n  As most of you know, America's farmers are fiercely independent and \never optimistic and were glad to get the freedom to make their own \nproduction decisions that came with the 1996 farm bill. However, part \nof the promise of Freedom to Farm was that there would be accompanying \nefforts to bring about trade negotiations to reduce barriers, \nregulatory reform, and improvements to the Crop Insurance Program to \nhelp producers manage the risk in open markets. Unfortunately, the \nadministration has not eased the regulatory burden on farmers, and we \nhave not initiated new WTO talks or negotiations. I am confident this \ncrop insurance reform legislation remains one of the most important \npieces of the farm prosperity puzzle. Tax relief and tax reform for our \nfarmers across the board is also very important because it directly \nimpacts the bottom line, the net income of our farmers and the ability \nof our farmers to pass farms from one generation to another.\n  Again, I am proud to be one of the early advocates for reform and \nthat the basic concepts of my proposal again were carried into this \nreform bill.\n\n[[Page S1583]]\n\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to speedily approve this bill so it can \nbe reconciled with the House bill and be completed as soon as possible.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1583-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1583-S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join many of my colleagues \ntoday in support of S. 2251, the crop insurance reform bill. Senator \nGrams spoke most eloquently on the issue and of its importance. He has \ncertainly led the issue, along with a good many other of our colleagues \nwho brought us to this point of shaping the legislation and bringing it \nto the floor.\n  I thank the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar, for \nrecognizing the issue and the need for the legislation. While he didn't \nagree with all that is in S. 2251, he recognized its importance. He \nrecognized the importance of building a compromise, as we were able to \ndo in the committee.\n  At this time, I am proud to join not only the chairman but certainly \nmy good friend, Senator Roberts, and Senator Kerrey, who really led the \nissues that are found and embodied in S. 2251.\n  There is no question that reform of the Federal Crop Insurance \nProgram was not only a necessity but it was an obligation. It was a \npromise that we in the Senate and the House made to America's \nproduction agriculture when we moved to the new agricultural policy \nembodied in the current farm bill, Freedom to Farm. We said not only \nwould we free up individual farmers to produce for the market absent \nspecific Federal programs but we would provide them with the necessary \ntools to compete. One of them would be a risk management tool--crop \ninsurance--so they could use it against downturns in the market or \ncertain environmental circumstances such as drought, frost, or floods \nthat might impede their ability to produce or destroy the very crop \nthey planted in the ground.\n  We also said we would look at the trade issue, and obviously the \nsanctions our Government had placed against certain potential markets \nacross the world. We addressed that last year in the Senate. We will \naddress it again this year. If we can pass the sanctions legislation \nand it becomes law, and if S. 2251 becomes law, then we will have \ncompleted a package that was promised a good number of years ago to our \nfarmers and ranchers across this country.\n  The bill before us addresses several concerns farmers in my State and \nI have had about crop insurance. The bill provides increased subsidies \nfor a greater buy-up of the crop insurance; funding for research and \ndevelopment of specialty crop insurance, which is critically important; \nremoval of the noninsured assistance program, better known as NAP, area \ntrigger which was a true impediment in past Federal crop insurance \nprograms; and several other items.\n  Let me explain the uniqueness of Idaho agriculture.\n  There are sometimes two or three crop components to our large \nMidwestern agricultural producing areas. Idaho's great agricultural \neconomy is based on minor crops and nontraditional crops. We know about \nIdaho's potatoes. But we oftentimes don't know about Idaho's winter \npeas, or our trout, or our seed peas, or our lentils, or our sugar \nbeets, or our barley, or our mint.\n  Many people don't recognize that I have one of the most diverse \nagricultural counties in the Nation that produces large quantities of \nseeds for sweet corn, carrots, onions, celery, and all of those kinds \nof things you would not expect a State such as Idaho to grow, but we do \nbecause of our unique environment and our ability to control moisture \nthrough irrigation, and, as a result, creating the ideal situation for \nthe growing of some of these seed crops. These are all minor crops and \nhigh-value crops that are sensitive to certain environmental or market \ndownturns.\n  Current Federal crop insurance does not always provide for them. This \nlegislation not only provides for the research to move us in that area, \nbut it removes the NAP area trigger that was very prohibitive.\n  That is why I have worked with Senator Kerrey and Senator Roberts to \ninclude a provision to reform the Noninsured Assistance Program, or \nNAP, in this amendment. NAP is used by farmers who grow these \n``specialty'' or ``minor'' crops across our Nation. This legislation \nremoves the area trigger and makes it a much more workable proposition \nfor farmers in my State.\n  I often hear from farmers who are frustrated that crop insurance does \nnot exist for our many specialty crops. It is why my farmers don't use \nit at the rate other producers across the country do.\n  This legislation should move us in the direction of creating another \nrisk management tool for Idaho's agricultural production. I hope we can \naccomplish that. This legislation specifically encourages the \ndevelopment of specialty crop produce and allows the risk management \nagency to partner with entities to develop new crop insurance products. \nThe bill also inverts the subsidy formula to make higher levels of \ncoverage more affordable to farmers. These changes will speed new \nproducts to the market and make crop insurance a real risk management \ntool. These changes will help farmers protect crops against the \ndisasters that oftentimes hit.\n  I once farmed and ranched. I remember one day standing at the window \nof my farm and ranch home watching a hailstorm wipe out 200 acres of \nthe most beautiful barley crop I had ever raised. But I was fearful \nthat year that we were going to have hailstorms, and this was a unique \ncrop. This was a seed crop, and a high-volumn crop because it was a \nnew, hydrosized barley. I had it insured. While I was rather fearful of \nthe destruction of crop, as I watched it, I also knew I had protected \nmy investment. I had done the right thing. It was a tool that was \navailable in the market at that time, and it was affordable.\n  That was 25 years ago. Today, that tool doesn't exist at the level of \naffordability that it did in those days. As a result, farmers have \nwalked away from crop insurance and have oftentimes during disastrous \ncircumstances simply turned toward Washington to say to those of us who \nserve here: Help us.\n  What we are saying today with this legislation on the floor of the \nSenate is: Agriculture, help yourself. We are providing you with the \nultimate of risk management tools, so you should not have to rely on a \nFederal Government to bail you out of a circumstance that is beyond \nyour control. We give you the option, and we want you to use the \noption, providing for yourself as a stand-alone, private \nentrepreneurial entity of this economy.\n  This bill, however, provides a provision that concerns me, and it \nconcerns the cattle producers of my State. The provision is federally-\nsubsidized revenue insurance for livestock production. This could \ndisrupt markets by masking market signals and create dependency on \nsubsidies that could stimulate overproduction and create perverse \nincentives for producers who are striving to make sound, market-\noriented management decisions.\n  The livestock industry of our Nation has never turned to the Federal \nGovernment to help them. They have received in situations of drought \nsometimes feed assistance, but there has been no program in the past \nthat simply provided a level of stability to their income as has been \ntrue of other commodities produced by the agricultural sector. They are \ninherently worried about a Federal program that might create or cause \nmarket incentives that are not true to the livestock or beef industry \nmarket.\n  The beef industry is recovering now from a market downturn of the \npast few years. Relative to other segments of agriculture, the beef \nindustry works unobstructed by Government pricing and direct payments \nto producers and other controls. This allows beef producers to make \ndecisions about their own enterprises without having to worry about \nwhat Congress will do about the program or to the program. Cattle \nranchers tell me they like it that way although it is sometimes very \ntough. I would like to see the beef industry continue down the path \ntoward an open market approach, unstifled by any form of government \ninvolvement in their situation.\n  I hope in conference with the House we might work out this livestock \nprovision in a way that will not create a preferred market incentive.\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\n  In my view, S. 2251 does the most for specialty crops and minor crop \ninsurance of any proposal I have seen to date. Once again, I want to \nthank Senator Roberts, Senator Kerrey, Senator Lugar, and others who \nhave directed a tremendous amount of their energy to resolving the \nissue of Federal crop insurance by presenting the legislation now \nbefore the Senate. I hope we will have a sizable vote on it tomorrow \nand that we can move it to conference with the House to work out our \ndifferences and put it on the President's desk at the earliest possible \ndate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I don't think there has been anyone in \nthis body who has been more critical of the administration for the \nthings that have taken place, for what has happened to our defense \nindustry, for what has happened in many other problem areas that have \ncome up, but I have to rise today to actually compliment the \nadministration for an action that they took on March 14 of this year \nwhen they filed an article 84 action with the International Civil \nAviation Organization, usually referred to as ICAO.\n  ICAO was put together as an organization where all of the nations \nthat with aviation and commercial aviation would agree to certain \nstandards so there is some degree of uniformity. They got together and \ndetermined we would have a noise standard that was classified as \nchapter 3.\n  The European Union, and I hate to say this, has demonstrated much \narrogance. I guess they think that all of a sudden they have gone from \na small fish in the pond to the big fish in the pond and they have \ntotally disregarded agreements they have made. They signed an \nagreement, a trade agreement, an ICAO agreement with all of the other \ncountries saying that by a certain date they would have to have chapter \n3 noise level.\n  Then, not too long ago, they unilaterally decided they were going to \nabrogate that treaty and unilaterally say that they are going to not \nallow chapter 3 noise level unless it is done through new airplanes or \nre-engining, so a muffling system that takes it to the same noise level \nwould not comply.\n  This means we in the United States are discriminated against. I think \neveryone is aware the big competition worldwide now is Boeing aircraft \nin the United States and Airbus in Europe. As a result of this, it \ngives a tremendous advantage to Airbus over Boeing. They would be \nfinancially discriminating against the U.S. in a way that would cost \nthe United States and depreciate the value of the inventory of many of \nour Boeing aircraft.\n  The ``hush'' industry is a huge industry in the United States. They \nhave been able to use this technology to bring down the noise level of \nexisting aircraft to chapter 3 standards, and it shouldn't make any \ndifference how we get to this level.\n  The administration has taken this into consideration when on March 14 \nthey passed an article 84 against the European Union with ICAO. I think \nit is very significant. I know it will be a long and drawn out process, \nbut I hope and I admonish the administration not to use the fact that \nit will be a long and drawn out process to go sideways or to cave in on \nthis very critical issue to American workers and American \nmanufacturers.\n  I can assure the administration that we will be working with them \nvery closely to correct this action to be able to use any method that \ncan be used that is on the market today in order to reach the chapter 3 \nnoise standards.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1584-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1584-S1586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CROP INSURANCE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I come to the floor to stand in support \nof S. 2251, the crop insurance reform bill. I thank all of my \ncolleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee for the tremendous work \nthey did in getting this bill to the floor. First and foremost, thanks \ngoes to the chairman of the committee, Senator Lugar, for his \nwillingness to bring this issue up in a timely fashion, so we could get \nthis legislation out of committee and to the floor to get some \nmeaningful support for our Nation's farmers, particularly those farmers \nwho are not participating in the current Crop Insurance Program.\n  Congress is reaching out to farmers, encouraging them to participate \nin the Crop Insurance Program to give them the kind of risk management \ntools they need to deal with the uncertainties of weather conditions, \nprices, et cetera, experienced in the past several years in \nagriculture.\n  I thank the chairman for his good-faith adherence to moving this bill \nin a prompt fashion. I thank in particular also Senator Pat Roberts of \nKansas and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska for their incredible work \nwith me as one of two Senators from the Northeastern part of the United \nStates on the Agriculture Committee. They reached out to see what we \ncould do in crafting a piece of legislation which would broaden the \nbase of the Crop Insurance Program to include many areas of the country \nthat have not participated in the old Crop Insurance Program, basically \nbecause it wasn't tailored to meet the needs of many regions of the \ncountry, particularly the Northeast.\n  Believe it or not, agriculture is the No. 1 industry in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. Most people don't realize that, but we \nalso have the largest rural population of any State in the country. \nAgriculture is very important to the way of life for the millions in \nPennsylvania who do not live in Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, who live in \nbetween those two cities in the great rural areas of our commonwealth.\n  We have the third lowest participation rate in crop insurance in the \ncountry. We are anywhere from single digits to reaching a high of about \n20 percent participation of our farmers. It is a very small rate of \nparticipation. We need to encourage our very diversified farmers to get \ninto this program to provide a safety net for them in the event of \ndrought, floods, or other problems they may encounter in producing \ntheir crops.\n  There is an opportunity for them now with this bill. With about a \nthird of the money in this bill devoted to specialty crops, it is a \nreal opportunity for our fruit growers and for our vegetable growers--\ntruck farmers, we call them--folks who produce potatoes up in the great \nnorthwestern part of our commonwealth, and a variety of other \nproducers, as well as nursery men and women. Those are the folks who \nnow cannot get any kind of help or support. We have provisions included \nfor them in pilot programs. There is a real opportunity for risk \nmanagement tools that many farmers in our States have not had the \nopportunity to enjoy.\n  Special thanks, again, go to Senator Roberts and Senator Kerrey. They \ncome from the bread basket, Nebraska and Kansas. Frankly, they \nunderstand very well the issues of agriculture. To their credit, they \nunderstood that if we were going to move forward with agriculture \npolicy under Freedom to Farm, we would have to make sure that all areas \nof the country had the kind of tools necessary to be able to farm \nsuccessfully. This legislation will go a long way in providing \ngovernment aid to an area of the farming country that has been left \nbehind in the past.\n  I heard Senator Roberts and I thank him for his kind comments. \nSenator Roberts talked about the battle we had on the floor of the \nSenate last year with respect to the agricultural supplemental.\n  There was a record drought, a 100-year drought in Pennsylvania, which \ncaused about $1 billion in crop losses. It was a frustration to me in \nthat there was a very small part of that bill which was designated to \nhelp farmers who had suffered as a result of that nonprogram crop, \nformer program crop farmers. We have a very small percentage of those \nin Pennsylvania.\n  As a result, a lot of the help in that bill was in the form of AMTA \npayments. A very small percentage of our farmers in Pennsylvania \nreceive any AMTA payments. As a result, the bill was of minimal help to \nour farmers. We tried to include some things for dairy and livestock \nand some things for specialty crops, and we were successful--I thank \nthe Senator from Mississippi for including that--but it highlighted the \nconcern that many of us in the Northeast have with the direction of \nfarm\n\n[[Page S1585]]\n\npolicy in the Senate and in the Congress generally.\n  In this legislation, for the first time in quite some time, we have \nseen a nod to the Northeast, saying what goes on up there is not \ninsignificant. Pennsylvania, for example, is the fourth largest dairy-\nproducing State in the country. New York is the third largest dairy-\nproducing State in the country. We have real production agriculture in \nmany States in the Northeast and that production agriculture needs to \nhave the same tools available to be able to survive through the \ndifficult times as other areas of the country. We may not have the \nfrequency of disasters as in other areas of the country, and I \nunderstand that and respect that, but it does not mean we should have \nany fewer tools to be able to deal with the vagaries of the marketplace \nor the vagaries of the weather.\n  This bill does that. It does it in a very fair way, reaching out to \nfarmers who have not participated in the program in the past. It \neliminates some of the hurdles and obstacles which have limited our \naccess in the past and I think will create a much stronger backbone for \nagriculture in Pennsylvania which we desperately need.\n  Rural Pennsylvania is lagging behind economically from the rest of \nthe Commonwealth. We have record employment rates in metropolitan \nareas, but, still, some rural counties in Pennsylvania have double-\ndigit unemployment rates where the principal economy is either mining \nor agriculture.\n  These kinds of tools to support farmers who are the backbone of that \neconomy are very important to keep these farms operating through very \ndifficult weather disasters. It is very important to have these tools \navailable to our farmers at an affordable rate and to provide real \ncoverage for these losses, not as we have seen in the past.\n  I again thank Senator Lugar and particularly Senator Roberts and \nSenator Kerrey for their outstanding work on this legislation. I hope \nwe can move on this bill rather quickly, get this passed, and move \nforward to join with the House in a conference that can result in a \nstrong, bipartisan piece of legislation to be sent to the President. I \nam enthusiastic about the product we have on the floor and hope we can \ntake care of that quickly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation \nbefore us. I think the crop insurance legislation before us this \nevening is very important. It is one of the pieces of legislation that \nshould have been passed in 1996 when we passed the current farm bill. \nWe promised farmers we were not only going to provide a safety net for \nthem, we were also going to do what we could to expand trade, change \nthe tax laws so they could better manage the highs and lows associated \nwith on-farm income, spend more money for research, and provide a crop \ninsurance program that provided a more opportunities to managing risk.\n  We still have not passed the necessary tax legislation. We have not \ndone all we can do to promote trade in American agricultural products. \nAnd we have not done all we can to tear down the barriers to trade \naround the world. There is still a lot that should have been \naccomplished in 1996 that has not been done, but finally we are able to \nadd one more thing that was promised in 1996. Now 4 years later, we are \nfinally getting it done. What I am refering to is the ability of \nfarmers to protect themselves from natural disasters over which they \nhave no control by insuring for the productivity that they would \nnormally experience in a good year.\n  This legislation will provide farmers in Iowa and across the country \nsound risk management opportunities that were promised in 1996. As \neveryone involved in agriculture knows, the weather is an unavoidable \nrisk farmers must deal with every day. The Federal Crop Insurance \nProgram was established to protect farmers from unavoidable risks such \nas adverse weather, plant disease, and insect infestation. There are \ntwo ways to respond. One is through a crop insurance program that \nfarmers can manage and make their own participation decisions. This \nwould be their decision, not my decision. The other way is through \ndisaster relief. The farmer has little control over whether Congress \nwill provide, at the time of a natural disaster, some disaster relief \nfor him.\n  In most instances, Congress has responded. But that makes the \nindividual family farmer a pawn of Washington. His welfare is based \nupon decisions that Members of Congress might make, which might not \nprovide the relief that is needed.\n  Once again, the 1996 farm bill was meant to give farmers more control \nover their own destiny, with the proper tools. Crop insurance is one of \nthose proper tools.\n  The agricultural community has recently been subjected to more than \njust unavoidable natural disasters. My neighbors in Iowa, where my son \nand I have a family farm have felt the brunt of the world economic \ncrisis and its increased foreign competition and poor trade diplomacy. \nThese factors have led to significant reductions of farm income.\n  Just last year, it was necessary for Congress to provide $8.7 billion \nin additional assistance to farmers. This was only a short-term fix, \nnot a long-term solution. But it did keep a promise to the family \nfarmers of America that we made in 1996 when we passed a 7-year farm \nbill. We set aside $43 billion to meet the obligations of the safety \nnet in that farm bill because we thought $43 billion was enough. But \nnobody anticipated 4 good crop years with record yields, reduced \nprices, and the Far East financial crisis that reduced our exports.\n  The $43 billion that was set aside for the 7 year farm bill in 1996 \nwas not enough to meet our promise of a smooth transition for farmers \nand the maintenance of a safety net. Consequently, we had to provide \nmore money. In doing so we kept our commitment to the farmers of \nAmerica to provide a strong safety net.\n  With the farm economy in the tank and the price of multiple \ncommodities hitting 20-year lows last year, many individuals have \ndecided to lash out against the 1996 farm bill.\n  I would be the first to admit that Government policy was partly \nresponsible for the instability within the agricultural community. But \nthat is not the farm bill. That is a lack of wise International \nMonetary Fund policy regarding loans to countries whose banks went in \nthe tank, a seemingly passive pursuit of trade opportunities for \nagriculture, and Congress, for that matter, not giving the President \nthe authority to negotiate. While I have found fault in the past in our \ninability to pass a substantive crop insurance bill and the \nadministration's failed efforts to open markets for our agricultural \ncommodities, I hope this bill remedies one of those shortcomings. This \nlegislation provides a long-term solution to the agricultural community \nfor risk management which better mediates the unavoidable risks farmers \nexperience.\n  The Congress can do disaster relief with the political exigencies \nthat are involved with that or it can promote risk management. Through \nthis legislation, we are promoting risk management, giving farmers the \ntools to respond to and control their destiny rather than having \nCongress involved in the family farmers destiny.\n  This legislation is entitled the Risk Management for the 21st Century \nAct. It is bipartisan. It will accomplish many of the most important \ngoals requested by my farm constituency.\n  This has been a bipartisan cooperative effort from the beginning \nbecause those of us who understand agriculture know this is the right \nthing to do. Senators Pat Roberts and Bob Kerrey wrote an excellent \npiece of legislation. Senator Conrad of North Dakota and I, along with \nSenator Rod Grams and Chairman Domenici of the Budget Committee, worked \nhard 12 months ago to provide sufficient budgetary authority to fund \nthis blue ribbon reform proposal that is now before us.\n  By adopting this legislation, we will increase the affordability of \ncrop insurance, make the program more flexible and more responsive to \nchanging demands, improve the public-private\n\n[[Page S1586]]\n\npartnership, provide opportunities for livestock coverage--so that \nlivestock farmers will have the same opportunity to better manage risk \nas crop producers have had in the past--and last, but certainly not \nleast, equalize subsidies for revenue-based products.\n\n  This means a lot for my State of Iowa. Eighty-one percent of all corn \nand soybeans are insured in the State of Iowa; in other words, meaning \n81 percent of the acreage that is planted to corn and soybeans is \ninsured. 85 percent of the insured acres are covered by buy-up \npolicies. And 65 percent of the insured acres in Iowa are covered by a \nrevenue insurance product.\n  Iowa has the highest percentage of revenue coverage in the United \nStates. This might reflect the idea that farmers in my home State of \nIowa distrust Congress to respond with disaster relief more than \nfarmers in any other State in the Nation. My farmers are taking the \nbull by the horns, making the independent judgment that each one of the \n97,000 farmers in my State has an opportunity to make. They are \nmanaging their own risks by purchasing crop insurance and not relying \nupon the Congress to cover their losses.\n  This bill makes crop insurance more affordable, especially when it \ncomes to revenue products. Iowa farmers will use the improved subsidy \nformula to benefit from the highest subsidy at the highest level of \ncoverage. The higher levels of coverage will help to support family \nfarmers in poor years and alleviate some of the need for what is \nbecoming an annual economic relief payment. Economic relief payments \nwill only end when we stop losing our foreign market share and increase \nagricultural exports for the one-third of our agricultural products \nthat we produce beyond the necessity of domestic consumption.\n  If we do not export, we will shut down one-third of our production. \nBy shutting down one-third of our production, we would not only be \nhurting farm income but obviously endangering our manufacturers. We \nwould be manufacturing fewer John Deere tractors with fewer jobs at \n``John Deeres,'' having less market for feed, for seed, fertilizer, and \nchemicals. There would be less income for farmers to buy products from \nthe retail merchants of the small towns of America, and more of those \nsmall businesses in the small towns of America would go out of \nbusiness.\n  When we talk about the necessity of exporting one-third of our \nproducts--because that is what we produce in excess of domestic \nproduction--we are talking not only about enhancing the income of the \nfamily farmers of America, but we are also showing the ripple effect \nthat positive cash-flow has through the economy of rural America. We \nmust reverse this trend to preserve small businesses and preserve \nnumerous other enterprises in America, including the union jobs at John \nDeere and other farm manufacturers.\n  This program we have before us won't open new markets abroad for new \ncommodities, but it will stabilize the potential losses my friends and \nneighbors could experience due to poor exports. This legislation will \nprovide the security necessary to help farmers through lean years so \nthey will be around to experience better prices and increased revenue \nin the future.\n  We have an opportunity tomorrow at 11 o'clock, when we vote on this \nbill, to provide the agricultural community with a tool, a very \nimportant tool to better manage the risks inherent in farming. \nImproving the Crop Insurance Program and ensuring that quality coverage \nis more affordable and better suited to the needs of farmers will only \nserve to provide much needed stability in rural America, not just \nstability among the family farms.\n  While we have more to accomplish to guarantee stability for the \nfamily farmer, this is a very important first step, a step that should \nhave been accomplished in 1996 but wasn't. In so doing, it would have \nprovided the farm bill more of the safety net as we promised. Today we \nare taking an important additional step. I appreciate the opportunity \nof fulfilling some of the unfulfilled promises made in 1996, to make \nthe 1996 farm bill the landmark measure it was meant to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week we remember another tragedy in \nAmerica's history, the 2-year anniversary of the school shooting in \nJonesboro, AR. Two years ago this Friday, the Nation watched two boys, \nages 11 and 13, open fire on their classmates, killing four young \npeople and a teacher.\n  At the time the school shooting in Jonesboro had the distinction of \nbeing one of the Nation's bloodiest. We were stunned that two boys so \nyoung had so much anger in them, anger that was made deadly by access \nto more than a half a dozen guns and 3,000 rounds of ammunition. In \n1998, the pastor of a church attended by one of the four children shot \nto death in Jonesboro said:\n\n       Nothing touches us more than when our children are hurt. \n     There's never been anything you could possibly compare this \n     to.\n\n  He didn't know that over the next 2 years there would be school \nshootings in Georgia, Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and recently in \nmy own home State of Michigan.\n  Sadly, these tragedies have not convinced Congress to act to try to \ntake guns out of the hands of children. In the aftermath of Columbine, \nalmost a year ago, the Senate passed a juvenile justice bill with \nmoderate gun safety amendments designed to reduce juvenile access to \nguns. That bill has been stuck in conference committee for months, and \nlegislative proposals to prevent juvenile access to guns has been \nstymied by this Congress.\n  Americans cannot understand why Congress has done nothing to prevent \nthe tide of shootings in our schools and public places. Americans do \nnot believe the National Rifle Association's rhetoric--the argument \nthat guns don't kill people, people kill people. They are absolutely \nand utterly appalled by the most recent statement of the NRA that the \nPresident is ``willing to accept a certain level of killing to further \nhis political agenda.''\n  I believe the NRA owes an apology to the American people for those \nincendiary comments by Wayne LaPierre, its executive vice president. \nHis words represent the lowest level of personal attack that has been \nhurled against any President that I can remember. They cross the line \nof acceptable political debate. There should be an outpouring of \nrevulsion, not just from persons who disagree with policies supported \nby the NRA but from the NRA's own members and from those who agree with \nits positions.\n  Americans may be divided on the need to pass gun-related legislation \nbut are surely united when it comes to protecting the lives of our \nfellow citizens and our children.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1586-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HERMAN WELLS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

MARCHETTE CIVIL ENGINEER CORPS, U.S. NAVY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the \nexemplary service and career of an outstanding naval officer, Captain \nLouis V. Marchette, upon his retirement from the Navy at the conclusion \nof more than 24 years of commissioned service. Throughout his \ndistinguished career, Captain Marchette has truly epitomized the Navy \ncore values of honor, courage, and commitment. It is my privilege to \ncommend him for a superb career of service he has provided the Navy and \nour great Nation.\n  Captain Marchette was born in Ogden, Utah and grew up in a Marine \nCorps family. After graduating from the University of South Carolina \nwith a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering, he was \ncommissioned an Ensign in the Navy in 1976. Captain Marchette began his \ncareer as a line officer but soon found his true calling and \ntransferred to the staff corps as a Civil Engineer Corps officer. His \nfirst assignment was with the Seabees of Naval Mobile Construction \nBattalion FORTY, homeported in Port Hueneme, California. In subsequent \nassignments, Captain Marchette was given some of the most challenging \nassignments the Navy Civil Engineer Corps had to offer.\n  As a junior officer, he served as Staff Civil Engineer, Naval \nTechnical Training Center Corry Station, Pensacola, Florida; Assistant \nPublic Works Officer, Naval Air Station Key West, Florida, and; \nResident Officer in Charge of Construction, Barksdale Air Force Base, \nLouisiana. In recognition of his exemplary performance and construction \nengineering expertise, he was then assigned as Operations Officer, \nNaval Mobile Construction Battalion SEVENTY-FOUR, homeported in \nGulfport, Mississippi. In this assignment, he directed contingency \nconstruction and military operations throughout Japan, Korea, the \nCaribbean, and Central America. He followed this tour with assignment \nas the Civil Engineer Corps Lieutenant Commander Assignment and \nPlacement Officer, Bureau of Naval Personnel, his only tour within the \n``Beltway.''\n  At this juncture, Captain Marchette had developed a truly outstanding \nreputation as a naval officer and engineer and he was rewarded with a \nvariety of leadership opportunities to include, Public Works Officer, \nNaval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico; Commanding Officer, Naval \nMobile Construction Battalion ONE, homeported in Gulfport, Mississippi, \nand; Chief Staff Officer, 20th Naval Construction Regiment, Gulfport, \nMississippi. On October 30, 1997, Captain Marchette took command of \nNaval Construction Battalion Center Gulfport, Mississippi, assuming the \ndual responsibility of Commanding Officer, 20th Naval Construction \nRegiment, the pinnacle of a most outstanding career.\n  In this capacity, Captain Marchette has spearheaded development of a \nworld class mobilization complex capable of mobilizing Seabees for \ndeployment anywhere in the world within 48 hours. Selfless commitment, \nexceptional technical prowess, and extraordinary accomplishment have \nbeen the hallmarks of this most outstanding professional. Whether \nrestoring order for the Mississippi Gulf Coast in the aftermath of \nhurricanes, responding to military contingencies throughout the world, \nor maneuvering through periods of severe budget constraints, he \nprovided unparalleled leadership, innovative concepts, and overall \nbrilliant managerial insight in accomplishment of the Navy and our \nNation's objectives. Under his dynamic leadership the Naval \nConstruction Force has experienced dramatic improvements in \ncomprehensive readiness, training attainment, mobilization, and \nmanpower/equipment resourcing. In short, Atlantic Fleet Seabees are now \nbetter trained and better equipped to accomplish the mission as a \ndirect result of Captain Marchette's efforts.\n  Captain Marchette holds a Master of Science degree in engineering \nfrom the University of Florida. He is a registered Professional \nEngineer in the State of Louisiana and a member of the Louisiana \nSociety of Professional Engineers and the Society of American Military \nEngineers. He is a Seabee Combat Warfare Officer whose personal \ndecorations include the Legion of Merit, five Meritorious Service \nmedals, the Navy/Marine Corps Commendation medal, and Navy Humanitarian \nService medal.\n  Captain Marchette's visionary leadership, exceptionally creative \nproblem solving skills, and uncommon dedication have created a legacy \nof achievement and excellence. Having spent half his 24-year career in \nthe great State of Mississippi, Captain Marchette and his lovely wife, \nFran, are true Mississippians who have brought great honor and praise \nto our State. Captain Marchette will retire on July 1, 2000 after 24 \nyears of dedicated commissioned service. On behalf of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, I wish Captain Marchette fair winds and \nfollowing seas. Congratulations on completion of an outstanding and \nsuccessful career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1587-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHANGES TO H.

Mr. President, on March 7, 1959, history was made \nwhen the first aviator charted over a million miles in a jet. Although \nit seems commonplace today, at the time, traveling a million miles was \nindeed, an aviation milestone. Well, today, more than forty years \nlater, we are considering another aviation milestone of sorts: a \nreauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration which will be of \nsignificant benefit to our nation's communities, our air infrastructure \nand the flying public.\n  I represent a state that has an enormous amount of aviation. Texas is \nhome to one of the Nation's busiest airports, DFW, but we also have 27 \nother primary airports, 21 designated reliever airports and more than \n1600 other small airports that Texans depend upon to get from one place \nto another. Therefore, I recognize the importance of aviation to my \nstate, the critical role my state plays in the national aviation system \nand the important of Airport Improvement Program funding in maintaining \nit.\n  This bill provides a framework and the necessary tools to responsibly \nand substantially fund our nation's air infrastructure as we have never \ndone before. For the first time we will guarantee that all receipts and \ninterest in the Air Trust Fund--totaling more than $33 billion--will be \nspent over the next three years for only aviation purposes. We will \nenhance air safety, allow local areas to provide for their financial \nneeds, and assist our traffic controllers in watching our skies and \nprotecting the flying public.\n  The Airport Improvement Program, on which so many of our airports \nrely, will see an increase of $1.9 billion this year alone. It will \nincrease to as high as $3.4 billion over the next four years. This \nfunding will allow our airports to make necessary improvements to their \nexisting facilities and expand to accommodate the amazing growth that \nall of our nation's airports have seen in recent years. Additionally, \nthe Military Airport Program, which helps to assist our current and \nformer military airports by providing funds for needed structural \nimprovements, will see a boost from twelve airports to fifteen \ndesignated and eligible this year, and 20 designees, thereafter.\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\n  In Texas, we are affected by both national and international air \ntraffic growth. Traffic to Latin America in the next few years is set \nto exceed capacity and place an even larger burden on neighboring air \nroute systems. This will affect traffic in the Gulf of Mexico, in \nparticular, where traffic is controlled in large part by the air \ntraffic control center in Houston.\n  In fact, this is one important area where improvements are greatly \nneeded. A large portion of the Gulf of Mexico remains without visual \ncommunication on radar, nor sufficient two-way communication, in \ngeneral. Traffic in much of the gulf is controlled solely by one-way \nradio communications. The Gulf of Mexico airspace accommodates \npassenger airlines serving destinations worldwide, cargo and general \naviation traffic engaging in air commerce, and heavy helicopter traffic \nserving the offshore petrochemical industry. It also serves important \nusers such as our armed forces, Coast Guard, Customs Service, and the \nDrug Enforcement Agency. All aircraft, from large commercial planes, to \nmilitary aircraft, to helicopters need to have direct two-way \ncommunication to protect the safety of all those who fly these skies.\n  Currently, if a craft hits turbulence due to poor weather and seeks \nto ascend or descend the pilot must radio in to a controller, who must \ncheck the frequency and the surrounding traffic and then dial and pilot \nback and advise him on altering his position. One-way communication \nalone simply to reach the controller can take as long as seven minutes, \nand as long as fifteen minutes total to relay back to the controller. \nThis is unacceptable for a pilot who needs to respond immediately to \nescape violent turbulence and blindly must change his altitude. This \nfrightening scenario could be all too real and common as air traffic \ngrows.\n  The FAA Gulf of Mexico Task Force was formed to highlight the \nproblems in the gulf and recommend solutions. More than 100 individuals \nrepresenting the Federal Aviation Administration, airlines, the \nmilitary, and others in the industry have come together to address this \nproblem and seek an expeditious and thorough remedy. We can wait no \nlonger to let this safety hazard go unaddressed. This bill gives the \nFAA the tools to begin to remedy this situation.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction to provide for our \naviation needs, both on the ground and in the sky. By putting our \nAviation Trust Fund dollars to work we can help all airports large and \nsmall provide for their needs. We can ensure that our skies are safe, \nour airports are secure and that our controllers have modernized tools \nto accommodate the growing air traffic demand.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has decided to pass this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1588-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EDUCATION BLOCK GRANTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on Saturday, March 11, an editorial in \nthe New York Times emphasized the significant concerns about the \nRepublican education block grant proposal which was recently approved \nby the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. As this \neditorial points out, education block grants to states would not be the \nmost effective use of public tax dollars. Block grants do nothing to \nensure change and reform through proven effective methods such as a: \nwell-qualified teacher in every classroom; reduced class sizes to give \nchildren the individual attention they need and allow teachers to \nmaintain order and discipline; helping all children to meet high \nstandards; and holding schools accountable for improving student \nachievement and giving the neediest children the extra help they need. \nEducation is a high priority for states, communities, teachers, \nparents, and students throughout the country, and it is important that \nwe listen to them as we consider the reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act in the full Senate in the weeks ahead.\n  I believe that the editorial will be of interest to all of us \nconcerned about this issue, and I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 11, 2000]\n\n                      Misdirected Education Money\n\n       Congressional Republicans, who in 1995 wanted to abolish \n     the federal Department of Education, now acknowledge that \n     federal support for education is necessary. But their \n     misguided insistence on sending federal education aid to the \n     states in the form of large, unfocused block grants threatens \n     to undermine services for disadvantaged students in the \n     poorest districts.\n       The federal government currently contributes less than 10 \n     cents of every dollar spent on public schools. That \n     contribution, though small, is crucial because much of the \n     money is directly aimed at especially needy schools in poor \n     communities. The Senate is now in the process of \n     reauthorizing the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act, the law that governs how more than $15 billion in annual \n     federal aid to public schools is spent. The House has been \n     working through similar legislation in several smaller bills.\n       The Republicans in both the Senate and House want to roll a \n     number of aid programs, including the Title I program that \n     provides $8 billion a year for instructional support for \n     disadvantaged children, into a single general block grant \n     that would allow states to spend the money with less \n     accountability and less focus on the neediest students.\n       Last October the House passed the ``Straight A's'' block-\n     grant bill that creates a 10-state pilot project. This week \n     the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \n     approved a broad measure that would allow all states to \n     receive most of their federal school aid in the form of a \n     block grant. Although the measure would require that states \n     allocate Title I money in the block grant to school districts \n     on the basis of poverty, it would also make available more \n     than $3 billion of block grants without targeting high-\n     poverty areas. State governors could direct the money toward \n     any ``educational purposes,'' including private school \n     vouchers.\n       The Senate committee also approved an amendment sponsored \n     by Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, that would allow \n     15 states to join a separate pilot project that would make \n     available a higher level of block grants with even less \n     federal oversight.\n       The Republicans want to give states flexibility. But their \n     proposals do not create adequate mechanism to ensure that \n     funds are spent effectively or where they are most needed. \n     Block grants could also become targets for cuts because they \n     are unfocused and susceptible to misuse. The Democrats and \n     the Clinton administration are right to oppose them. Congress \n     should be guiding the states in education reform by asking \n     them to focus on specific targets--better teachers, smaller \n     classes and higher standards--for all students, but \n     particularly for the most disadvantaged. The Republican \n     approach runs counter to that purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1588-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1588-S1589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO INDIA\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of President \nClinton's trip to India. For too long, the cold war, and India's \nleadership of the non-aligned movement, strained what should have been \nthe natural bond between our two great democracies. The end of the cold \nwar has now brought us together. India is a true friend to the United \nStates in a region where respect for democracy is rare.\n  India has made great strides since achieving independence. Literacy \nhas doubled, life expectancy has doubled, and infant mortality has been \nmore than halved. However, India recognizes that commitment to \ndemocracy must be accompanied by free-market principles in order for \nprosperity to flourish. India's initial pursuit of socialist economic \npolicies, including nationalizing production, subsidizing industries, \nand raising tarriffs and other trade barriers, while imposing high \ntaxes, caused its economy and its people to suffer.\n  With the end of the cold war, India's experiment with a centralized \neconomic system is waning. India is starting to liberalize the economy, \nprompting foreign investment and reducing barriers to trade. The \nresults are encouraging: India's growth rate, which had been stuck at 3 \npercent, is now exceeding 6 percent, and the outlook is promising for \nfurther improvement. While a commitment to socialism may still be \nenshrined in its Constitution, the economic reforms India is embracing \nare clearly leading the nation in a positive, new direction. For \nexample, India's prowess in the high-technology sector makes it an able \npartner in that area. The recent decision to open its insurance and \ntelecommunication sectors to foreign investors is emblematic of the \nkind of changes that will enable India to achieve its potential.\n  Mr. President, the only shadow over President Clinton's visit is the \neruption of violence in Kashmir. Indian and Pakistani troops started \nexchanging\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\nheavy artillery fire along the disputed border a day ahead of his \narrival in the region. While Kashmir has been a source of conflict \nbetween India and Pakistan for nearly a half century, the recent \nnuclear and ballistic missile tests by India and Pakistan have \ncompelled the international community to increase pressure on the \nparties to resolve this dispute. There has been a recognition of the \nvery real danger that Kashmir could become the ``flashpoint'' which \nsparks a wider regional war. I hope President Clinton uses this visit \nto encourage officials of India and Pakistan, and representatives of \nthe people of Jammu and Kashmir, to begin an official dialogue.\n  Mr. President, there is an Indian saying that, ``it is the spirit of \nthe quest that determines its outcome.'' The President's trip is an \nimportant symbol of the renewed spirit of cooperation between the \nUnited States and India. I look forward to the achievements we will \nreach together, as both partners and friends, in the next half century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1589-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator \nLieberman and Senator Evan Bayh, for their leadership on this important \nissue. I am proud to stand with them and several others in support of \nan outstanding piece of legislation, one which calls for us to reinvent \nthe federal funding stream, reinvest in our children's education and, \nperhaps most importantly, hold the system responsible when it fails to \nwork for our kids. Over the past year, we have worked together with \nindividuals and organizations from all fifty states, in an effort to \ncraft a bill which reflects the concerns of all those involved in \nelementary and secondary education in America. We spoke with parents, \nteachers, principals, administrators and, most importantly, the \nstudents. In doing so, we came to this rather simple conclusion, we owe \nour children more than we are giving them. The future of this country \ndepends on how well we are able to educate our children and prepare \nthem for the changing global marketplace. In order to raise academic \nachievement in our public schools, we must put the priority of federal \nprograms on performance instead of process, on delivering results \ninstead of developing rules and on actively encouraging bold reforms \ninstead of passively tolerating failure.\n  It is true that the Federal Government only contributes 7% to the \noverall spending in elementary and secondary education. But it is an \nimportant 7%, the portion which is directed to the most needy and \nchallenged children. We must begin to use this $13 billion annually as \nleverage to promote national priorities such as quality teachers, \nsmaller schools, lower teacher pupil ratios and raising the academic \nperformance of minority and disadvantaged students. By streamlining the \nmany different programs and funding streams currently under ESEA, over \nsixty to be exact, into six goal oriented titles we put the day to day \ndecisions of education back where it belongs, at the local level.\n  With this added flexibility, we propose to double our contribution to \nTitle I schools. As many of us know, Title I funding is essential for \nbridging the ever increasing gap in the quality of education available \nfor the rich and the poor. In Louisiana, this would mean a $100,000,000 \nincrease to support existing Title I programs as well as additional \nfunding to develop and implement new and innovative strategies for \nimprovement.\n  Of course, we all agree that those who are in the class room should \nbe qualified and confident to teach the subjects they are assigned to \nteach, yet we must ask ourselves what are we doing to ensure that they \nare. What are we doing to attract the best and the brightest to the \nclassroom? This bill would increase the funding available to states for \nthe professional development of teachers to $3 billion. With this \nmoney, states could develop and maintain programs to address the \nincreasing national teacher shortages and retain the quality teachers. \nIt supports efforts like Troops to Teachers and other transitional \nteaching programs. Most importantly, it requires that those who teach \nour children are competent to do so.\n  And finally the third and final R--Responsibility. Our proposal calls \nfor the Federal government to rededicate ourselves to the basic \nprinciples of accountability and consequences. In my view, \naccountability is an essential ingredient in any recipe for success.\n\n  As parents, how many of us would offer to pay our child a $10 or \nother incentives for every F they received on their report card? As \ninvestors, how many of us would double our investment in a company that \ncontinued to show poor earnings? Yet this is exactly what we continue \nto do in public education at the local and state level, we continue to \nfund failure and we do not reward progress. It is time to change that \napproach, it is not working. This proposal gives local educators the \nfreedom they need to meet their specific needs, since they know best \nwhat their students require. However, it also requires that they meet \nspecific performance measures--with real consequences for failure.\n  I am proud to say that Louisiana has been a leader in the call for \naccountability in public education. According to a recent report on \naccountability, ``Louisiana has one of the Nation's most comprehensive \naccountability systems including ratings and consequences for schools, \nexit tests for students to graduate from high school and monetary \nrewards for successful schools.'' By using the carrot and stick \napproach, Louisiana has begun to see some positive results. A recent \nNational Assessment of Educational Progress study found that Louisiana \nwas one of only seven states that achieved significant gains between \n1992 and 1994 in the percentage of fourth graders reading at proficient \nlevel or above.\n  In 1994, we decided, as a nation, that states should be held more \naccountable. Therefore, we attached Title I funding to standards based \nassessments to force states to take a long hard look where improvements \nneeded to be made. But we did not go far enough in making sure that the \nconsequences for not meeting these assessments were real. Under Three \nRs we do. Right now, regardless if a state or local agency is making \nthe grade, they receive equal funding. We aim to change that. Like a \nparent, we need to encourage schools to strive to achieve. We need to \nbegin to reward them for A's not F's.\n  We also make accountability mean more than statewide tests. We create \na funding structure that encourages states to implement an \naccountability system which includes report cards that summarize the \nperformance of individual schools; targeted assistance to help schools \nimprove; rewards for schools with high performance and the authority to \nclose or take over and reconstitute schools that don't get better over \ntime. In other words, real accountability.\n  Also, this proposal ensures that state and local educational agencies \nhave systems for additional or specialized\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\nassistance for children who are struggling to perform. Implementing a \npolicy to end social promotion before ensuring appropriate school \naccountability and the opportunity for all students to learn in well \nequipped schools with high quality teachers is fundamentally unfair and \nmust be stopped.\n  In closing, I would again like to thank my esteemed colleague from \nConnecticut. Because of his leadership and insight, this bill promises \nto bring about great change in public education. It is a bold step in \nthe right direction. A step I am happy to join him in making.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1590-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNITION OF PALADIN DATA SYSTEMS' SUPPORT OF THE WESTSOUND \n                               CONSORTIUM\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, when I travel across Washington \nstate, one of the first topics I hear about from local businesses and \nhigh-tech companies is their need for people with high-tech skills. A \nPoulsbo company, Paladin Data, has taken their efforts to find skilled \nemployees to a new level by donating is time and resources to train \nteachers in some of Washington state's public schools. For its \ncommitment to working with teachers, improving student learning and \nexpanding their skills, I am pleased to present Paladin Data with one \nof my `Innovation in Education' Awards.\n  Several years ago, seven school districts in Kitsap, Mason, and \nPierce Counties developed the West Sound School-to-Career Consortium \nwhich provides approximately 14,000 students with high-tech classes. \nThis year Paladin Data will begin its first year of a three-year \nproject that provides high-tech training to teachers involved with the \nWest Sound School-to-Career program. Paladin data is also contributing \n$50,000 in matching funds to a state grant of $100,000 to provide \nneeded curriculum materials and onsite teacher training in either a \nPaladin facility in Poulsbo or at a designated school district site. \nMoreover, each school district will determine what training their \nteachers will receive based on the needs of their district and their \nstudents.\n  Paladin is giving our teachers more information and skills that they \ncan take back to their classrooms and shows teachers what skills \nemployers are looking for in perspective employees, giving their \nstudents a leg up on the competition. Paladin's involvement is not only \nimproving the education of our students, but also giving them an \naccurate picture of what skills they need well-before they enter the \njob market.\n  The Washington Software Alliance reports that over 64,000 computer-\nrelated jobs are currently unfilled in the State of Washington--all for \nlack of properly trained workers. I find it encouraging to see \ncompanies like Paladin Data, that are contributing to our booming \neconomy, are taking an active role in ensuring the quality education of \nour children. I am proud to acknowledge Paladin Data System Systems \nCorporation's commitment to education and I look forward to hearing \nabout more companies making a contribution to our children's \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1590-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTING \n               ORIENTATION PROGRAM CELEBRATES ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BRYAN.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the State \nDepartment has filed an Article 84 petition with the International \nCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This will provide the basis for the \nUnited States to demonstrate that the European Union's (EU) hushkit \nregulation is not in accordance with international noise standards set \nby ICAO and is essentially targeting U.S. aerospace. Already this \nunfair regulation has hurt U.S. aerospace companies and workers because \nof the uncertainty it has introduced into the marketplace. Accordingly, \nit is imperative that the Administration pursue this Article 84 \nforcefully to show that we will not stand for discriminatory rules that \nhurt U.S. interests. If we do not make this point clearly, strongly, \nand now, we will have done nothing to prevent future efforts by the EU \nto act without regard to international standards and in ways designed \nto harm the United States' longstanding primacy in aerospace.\n  Filing an Article 84 is the beginning of what may be a long process. \nThe mere fact that it may take a period of time should not serve as an \ninducement to the Administration to seek to shortcut the ICAO process \nby entering into a negotiated settlement that does not fully protect \nour aerospace industry and workforce. Further, we must make clear that \nthe principle of adhering to international standards is essential in an \nindustry as global as aviation. If we fail to demonstrate the \nseriousness with which we take this matter, we will inevitably have \ndone nothing more than encourage the EU to try such incursions in the \nfuture.\n  I can assure you that I and many others will be working to see that \nthe right message is delivered on this critical matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1590-4", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               44TH ANNIVERSARY OF TUNISIA'S INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nTunisia, an old and devout friend and ally to the United States. March \n20, 2000 marked Tunisia's 44th anniversary of Independence.\n  In 1797, Tunisia and the newly independent United States signed a \n``treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation.'' The pact provided for \n``perpetual and constant peace'' between the parties. For more than 200 \nyears, our two nations have enjoyed such a relationship. During World \nWar II, Tunisia suppressed nationalistic sentiment to join the ranks of \nthe Allied Forces and then supported western democratic ideals during \nthe Cold War proving the U.S. could count on Tunisia. If all our \nforeign relationships were as faithfully observed as this one, our \nforeign relations would be more serene.\n  In the face of the ever-present strife that surrounds Tunisia, with \nits location between Algeria and Libya, the country has managed to \nmaintain internal stability. With its steadily increasing economic \ngrowth, Tunisia has built a stable middle class society. This growth \nhas allowed Tunisia to become a strategic partner in the growing \nAfrican market.\n  The United States has benefitted greatly from its strong and \nprosperous relationship with Tunisia. We can not forget our friend in \nAfrica who has stood by our side throughout our country's \nhistory.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/22/senate-section/article/S1591-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1591]]\n                     TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM J. CRAWFORD\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, yesterday in Colorado, at the \nchapel of the United States Air Force Academy, our country buried a \nhero.\n  William J. Crawford, a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor, \npassed away March 15th at the home he built himself in Palmer Lake, \nColorado. And while Mr. Crawford won the Congressional Medal of Honor--\nour nation's highest award--specifically for his actions during World \nWar Two on a hill in Italy, he showed that the medal was well deserved \nby the actions of each and every day of his life.\n  On September 13th, 1943, Private Crawford and his 3rd Platoon, 1st \nCompany, 36th Infantry Division were attacking Hill 424 near Altavilla, \nItaly. The platoon was pinned down by intense machine gun fire. Private \nCrawford, without orders and on his own initiative, singlehandedly \ndestroyed the machine gun and allowed the rest of his platoon to \nadvance. Later, the platoon was again blocked, this time from two enemy \nmachine gun positions and small arms fire. Private Crawford once more \nwent into action, destroyed both gun positions, and turned a captured \nGerman weapon on the withdrawing enemy, facilitating the company's \nadvance.\n  As his Medal of Honor citation says, this was an act of ``conspicuous \ngallantry . . . . above and beyond the call of duty.'' But Mr. \nCrawford's sacrifice for his country went further. He was captured \nduring the same battle later that day, and eventually served 19 months \nin a German POW camp. The Army thought he had been killed, and actually \nawarded his Medal posthumously to his father. It was not until 1984 \nthat a ceremony was held presenting the Medal to William himself. \nPresident Ronald Reagan had that honor, at the annual commencement \nceremony held at the Air Force Academy.\n  Every year, Mr. Crawford attended that graduation to present the \nOutstanding Cadet award. Because Private Crawford, even after his \nbravery, even after 19 months in a POW camp, and even after an \nadditional 22 years of post-war service to his country, continued to \nserve his nation. After his retirement in 1967, Mr. Crawford took a job \nas a janitor at the Air Force Academy. It let him supplement his \nretirement pay, and--more importantly--kept him around the armed forces \nlife, and in contact with the future leaders of our military, young \nofficers who can always use a outstanding role model of sacrifice, \nservice, and modesty. In his last years he was very active with \nchildren, speaking to and teaching them about WWII, and serving as a \nshining example of dedication and patriotism.\n  Mr. Crawford's life was one of service: from the gallantry in combat \nto the less intense but also important roles as mentor, community \nvolunteer, scoutmaster, and role model. As that life ends, as we honor \na departed hero, we also recognize the continuance of the memory and \nlegacy of a life well lived.

The Endowment \nis partnering with the White House Millennium Council on the \npresentation of ``Millennium Evenings at the White House,'' a series of \nshowcase events that explore the ideas and creativity of the American \npeople on the eve of a new millennium. These programs feature prominent \nscholars and creative thinkers and are accessible to the public by \nsatellite and cable broadcasts, and many State humanities councils are \ncoordinating local downlink sites. With support from SUN Microsystems, \nthese lectures and discussions are cybercast live from the East Room in \nthe White House. Viewers can submit questions via the Internet to the \nguest speaker or to the First Lady and me.\n  The NEH is well-known for its support of documentary films based on a \ncollaboration between filmmakers and humanities scholars. In 1998, the \nEndowment maintained this tradition of excellence with its support of \n``Eleanor Roosevelt,'' which drew upon outstanding new historical \nscholarship, archival films, photographs, and first-hand testimonies to \npaint a vivid portrait of one of America's most outstanding women.\n  The Endowment's grants also addressed the long-term needs of the \nNation's cultural and academic institutions. In 1998, the NEH created a \nspecial program designed to aid the Nation's public libraries in \nserving the public with humanities programming. Among the institutions \naided in 1998 by Challenge Grants was the African American Research \nLibrary and Cultural Center, a new facility created by the Broward \nCounty Public Library to serve Broward County's growing and diverse \npopulation.\n  Through its Preservation Programs, the NEH is preserving the content \nof hundreds of thousands of brittle books, periodicals, and American \nnewspapers--priceless sources for present and future historians and \nscholars. The Endowment's initiative to save such materials is now \nentering its tenth year, and will preserve nearly a million books and \nperiodicals by the time it is completed. The U.S. Newspaper\n\n[[Page S1592]]\n\nProject, an equally important effort to microfilm historic newspapers, \nis creating a comprehensive national database for scholars, students, \nand citizens who wish to research their community's history.\n  In November 1998, the First Lady and I joined the Endowment in \nhonoring at the White House nine distinguished Americans with the \nNational Medal of the Humanities. Through these awards and its grants \nprograms, the National Endowment for the Humanities recognizes and \npromotes outstanding efforts to deepen public awareness and \nunderstanding of the humanities.\n                                                  William J.

Section 60101, et seq.) to \n     allow states to adopt and enforce standards stricter than \n     federal standards where to do so would not interfere with \n     interstate commerce;\n       (2) Such Act be further amended to allow states at their \n     option to seek authority to administer and enforce federal \n     pipeline safety standards;\n       (3) As an interim measure pending congressional \n     consideration of such legislative enactments the President \n     direct the federal Office of Pipeline Safety to grant \n     authority to states that qualify to enforce federal \n     standards; and\n       (4) The Congress increase funding to assist states in \n     responding to pipeline accident emergencies, to implement \n     pipeline safety measures, to support states with delegated \n     authority to enforce federal standards, and to the Office of \n     Pipeline Safety for additional research and development of \n     technologies for testing, leak detection, and oversight \n     operations, be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable William J.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould direct the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins commemorating \nthe 2002 Salt Lake Olympic Winter Games.\n  The first modern Winter Olympic Games were held in Chamonix, France \nin 1924. Since then, the Winter Olympics has been held every four years \nto recognize outstanding accomplishments of athletes throughout the \nworld. Salt Lake City, Utah is proud to be hosting the 2002 Winter \nOlympic Games, the first Olympic Winter Games of the new Millennium.\n  While it is a great honor for us to host the 2002 Winter Olympic \nGames, our state will have a tremendous financial burden placed upon \nus. The proceeds from these commemorative coins are greatly needed to \nhelp us support these events and train future Olympic athletes. I would \nlike to stress that minting these commemorative coins will have no net \ncost to the Federal Government, and that the proceeds will be \ndistributed equally to the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the \nOlympic Winter Games of 2002 and the United States Olympic Committee.\n  Mr. President, this is the smallest Olympic coin program ever, \ncontaining\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\nonly two coins. Additionally, the program has been developed in \nconsultation with the Mint and the numismatic community to address \nconcerns over previous commemorative coin programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2266\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nban soft money donations, increase individual contribution limits to \ncandidates, and increase disclosure for issue advocacy; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                  campaign finance reform legislation\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich I hope might move the Senate closer to the passage of meaningful \ncampaign finance reform. I have voted for versions of the McCain-\nFeingold reform legislation at least six times in the past 4 years. I \ncontinue to support passage of that bill, and I will vote for it in the \nfuture.\n  I am concerned, however, that this legislation might not come up for \na vote again in this Congress. Earlier this morning, the Rules \nCommittee, of which I am a member and which Senator McConnell chairs, \nbegan a series of hearings on the constitutionality of campaign finance \nreform. At that time, I indicated that what I wished to do was submit a \nbill which might have an opportunity to break the gridlock surrounding \ncampaign finance reform, and develop some kind of consensus.\n  So if I may, on behalf of Senator Torricelli and myself, I send a \nbill to the desk and ask for its submission to committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the bill will be received \nand referred.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this bill has three simple provisions. \nFirst of all, it bans soft money. Second, it raises hard money \ncontributions to candidates from $1,000 to $3,000. Third, it requires \nthe disclosure of those parties who pay for the so-called issue ads, \nwho contribute to the soft money which at present is undisclosed. So it \nwould require disclosure of any expenditure of $10,000 or more of an \nindependent campaign within 48 hours, and it would require disclosure \nof any individual who contributes more than $3,000 to an independent \ncampaign. That is all this bill would do.\n  I think, any way you look at it, looking at campaign spending reform, \none has to look at the unregulated nature of soft money and the \nappearance--and I use the word ``appearance''--of corruption that it \nbrings to campaigns.\n  Clearly, when in the same session of Congress you have tobacco \nlegislation in front of this body and you have a tobacco company that \ncontributes $1 million in soft money at the same time, you can draw a \nconclusion--perhaps falsely, but nonetheless draw it--that that money \nis contributed in large amounts with hopes of gaining votes in support \nof the company.\n  I think the numbers, the size of soft money contributions, really, \nare what ought to concern this body. The Republican Party raised $131 \nmillion in soft money during the 1998 election cycle. That is a 150-\npercent increase over the last midterm election, in 1994. So from 1994 \nto 1998, 4 years, there has been a 150-percent increase in the amount \nof soft money. The Democratic Party raised $91.5 million during this \nsame period. That is an 86-percent increase over 4 years.\n  At this rate, you can see the amount of soft money is going to, by \nfar, dominate anything individual candidates can raise or do during an \nelection.\n  A recent analysis found that national political party committees \ntogether raised $107 million just during 1999 alone. That is 81 percent \nmore than the $59 million they raised during the last comparable \nPresidential election period in 1995. Congressional campaign committees \nof the national parties raised more than three times as much soft money \nduring 1999 as they raised during 1995--$62 million compared to $19 \nmillion.\n  We clearly have a trendline going. I think the decision one has to \nmake is, is this trendline going to be healthy for the American \npolitical process? Those who think it is will be for soft money. But I \nthink most of us believe, truly, that it is not.\n\n[[Page S1598]]\n\n  The problem comes because the contribution limit is so low for an \nindividual candidate. My bill says eliminate soft money, and the \ntradeoff is to increase the hard money contribution for every \nindividual candidate from $1,000 to $3,000.\n  We heard that the 1971 contribution limit of $1,000 today in real \ndollars is worth about $328. The limit was set 29 years ago and clearly \nneeds to be raised because the costs of campaign materials, consultant \nservices, television, radio, all of the necessary tools of any viable \ncampaign have clearly increased. So what was worth $1,000 in 1971 is \nnow worth $328. This would clearly be equalized to have a meaningful \nparity with 1971 if the sum were raised to $3,000.\n  What my bill will do is move campaign contributions from under the \ntable to above the table. Instead of hundreds of thousands of \nunregulated dollars flowing into the coffers of national political \nparties, this legislation will increase the amount an individual might \ncontribute to a candidate under the existing rules of the Federal \nElection Campaign Act. So what we would be doing is exchanging soft \nmoney for increased limits, soft money being undisclosed and \nunregulated and hard money being both disclosed and regulated.\n  It is not the small contributions to an individual's campaign, I \nthink, that Americans view as corrupting.\n  It is the large checks of $100,000, $250,000, and $1 million, or \nmore, to parties that creates this appearance. My bill would eliminate \nthis soft money while still allowing candidates to compete without the \ninfluence of the national parties and these huge amounts of money.\n  The final component of the bill is the greater regulation of so-\ncalled issues advocacy. A current campaign law loophole allows unions, \ncorporations, and wealthy individuals to influence elections without \nbeing subject to disclosure or expenditure restrictions.\n  Issue advocacy does not use the so-called ``magic words'', such as \n``vote for,'' ``elect,'' ``defeat'' or ``reelect'' that the Supreme \nCourt has identified as express advocacy and, therefore, are not \nsubject to FEC regulation.\n  This bill would define ``electioneering communications'' as an \nadvertisement broadcast from television or radio that refers to a \ncandidate for Federal office and is made 60 days before a general \nelection or 30 days before a primary.\n  Any individual or organization that spends more than $10,000 on such \nan ad must disclose the expenditure to the FEC within 48 hours. In \naddition, all contributions greater than $3,000 to groups that engage \nin electioneering communications must be disclosed to the FEC within 48 \nhours.\n  This takes that anonymous area of independent campaigns and clarifies \nexpress advocacy and regulates and discloses all of the money.\n  The Annenberg Public Policy Center has studied the amount that \nindependent groups have spent on issue advocacy in each of the last two \nelection cycles: 1995-96 and 1997-98. The study estimates that the \namount spent on issue ads more than doubled, to some $340 million.\n  The Center's report indicates that as election day gets closer, issue \nads become more candidate-oriented and more negative. This kind of \nunregulated attack advertisements are poisoning the process and driving \nvoters, I believe, away from the polls.\n  With the passing of every election, it becomes increasingly clear \nthat our campaign system desperately needs reform. I think this reform \nmeasure has a very real chance of being passed.\n  Once again, let me say, it bans soft money; it increases hard money \ncontribution limits to candidates from $1,000 to $3,000; it ties them \nto inflation after 2001; it says simply that anyone engaging in \nindependent campaigns must, in effect, disclose, within 48 hours, \ncontributions greater than $3,000 or expenditures of more than $10,000.\n  I strongly believe that congressional action on meaningful campaign \nfinance reform is a very necessary first step in restoring the public's \nconfidence in our government. I hope that my colleagues will see this \nas an attempt to reach across the partisan gap, and join me in \nsupporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire):\n  S. 2270. A bill to prohibit civil or equitable actions from being \nbrought or continued against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or \nimporters of firearms or ammunition for damages resulting from the \nmisuse of their products by others, to protect gun owner privacy and \nownership rights, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n       The right to bear arms protection and privacy act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a very significant \nbill--the Right to Keep and Bear Arms Protection and Privacy Act.\n  There is a gun control frenzy taking place in Washington. There are \nabout 1,070 bills either regulating or dealing with firearms pending in \nthe House and Senate. These range from imposing new Federal regulatory \nstandards on the manufacture of firearms to those requiring background \nchecks at gun shows. And President Clinton has written a letter \ninforming me that he will not sign long overdue, worthwhile and \ncomprehensive youth violence legislation unless it includes most of \nthis gun control agenda.\n  I have become convinced that, for conscientious and reasonable \ndefenders of the Second Amendment, it is not enough to simply oppose \nthe gun control communities legislative agenda. Instead, we just \nredouble our efforts and set out to pass an affirmative legislative \nagenda which safeguards the right to keep and bear arms.\n  Many gun control advocates claim that it is not their goal to \ninterfere with the rights of law abiding gun owners. Many question \nsincerity. The bill I am introducing today will afford gun control \nadvocates the opportunity to prove their critics wrong. This important \nbill is a first step in what I hope will become a bipartisan campaign \nto safeguard the rights of law abiding gun owners.\n  Simply put, this plainly written bill would end burdensome and \nfrivolous suits against law abiding firearm manufacturers, dealers, and \nowners, and preclude new ones, except in those cases where plaintiffs \ncould show that the manufacturer or seller knew that the firearm would \nbe used to commit a Federal or State crime. Thus, if it can be shown \nthat manufacturers and sellers knew that a specific product would be \nused to a commit crime, then they will be subject to a civil action, if \nnot a criminal prosecution. The provision also has the beneficial \neffect of striking a blow against ``legislation through litigation,'' \nwhich has enriched the trial lawyers while harming many of our nation's \nlaw abiding citizens and businesses.\n  In addition, the bill also addresses the concerns of gun owners and \nadvocates of the Second Amendment that the federal regulatory process \nwill be misused by the government to abridge the constitutional right \nto keep and bear arms. The bill thus contains the following provisions: \n(1) a prohibition against the government charging a background check \nfee in connection with the transfer of a firearm; (2) a gun owner \nprivacy protection component which requires immediate destruction of \nbackground check records for approved firearms buyers; and (3) \nestablishes a civil remedy for private citizens aggrieved by government \nviolations of the background check fee or gun owner privacy provisions. \nAfter all, if firearms manufacturers should be subjected to civil \nliability for illegal acts, why shouldn't the government be liable if a \nlaw abiding gun owner's privacy protections are violated?\n\n  As a Senior proudly representing the people of Utah, I take seriously \nour oath of office to defend our Union's defining document--the \nConstitution of the United States. I truly concur with the remarks of \nthe great British Prime Minister William Gladstone when he wrote in \n1878 that the ``American Constitution is * * * the most wonderful work \never struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.''\n  So too, I am an avid supporter of the Second Amendment. I believe, \nfollowing the teachings of virtually all the Founders of our Republic, \nthat the right of citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been \nconsidered as, in the words of the learned Justice Joseph Story, ``the \npalladium of the liberties of the republic; since it offers a strong \nmoral check against the usurpation\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\nand arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are \nsuccessful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and \ntriumph over them.''\n  It is astonishing to me that despite this pedigree of the Second \nAmendment, the enemies of the right to keep and bear arms, those \nadvocates of state-ism and the politics of the left, have stooped to \nnew lows in their crusade to diminish the God-given liberties of the \nAmerican people. Seeing that radical gun control measures are unpopular \nand cannot pass Congress and state legislatures, those hostile to the \nSecond Amendment have resorted to a new tactic in a not-so-veiled \nattempt to undermine the right to keep and bear arms.\n  They have resorted to misusing our civil litigation system by \nbringing law suits against the source of guns: firearms manufacturers. \nThey seek damages from firearms manufacturers for any harm caused by \ngun wielding criminals, even though the manufacturers are not \nresponsible for the crimes. This violates traditional precepts of \nAmerican law, which is based upon the free-will notion that only those \nresponsible should be held liable.\n  More specifically, over the past few years the firearms manufacturing \nindustry has been subjected to these numerous ``junk'' lawsuits seeking \ndamages or injunctive relief for harm caused by third-party criminal \nactors. Many of these cases have been brought by local government \nentities, including approximately thirty American cities. The Clinton \nAdministration had announced that it would support these lawsuits and \npublicly threatened that the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment would commence an action against the firearms \nmanufacturers.\n  Generally, the plaintiffs in these cases argue that although the \nfirearms are legal products and despite the criminal actions of third \nparties, manufacturers and sellers should be held liable because of the \nnegligent fashion in which they designed, marketed, and sold their \nproducts. This novel theory stands traditional tort law on its head.\n  These radical lawsuits are onerous and may well bankrupt many \nfirearms manufacturers. If a maverick judge were to rule in favor of \nthe plaintiffs in one of these cases, the industry could face financial \nruin. Indeed, the Louisiana state judge handling the City of New \nOrleans lawsuit recently refused to dismiss that lawsuit \nnotwithstanding the enactment of a state law that nullified the cause \nof action. The net result may very well be the disappearance of a \nlawful product--firearms--from interstate commerce.\n\n  Let me mention a junk lawsuit brought by the City of Chicago against \n12 suburban gun shops, 22 gun manufacturers, and four gun distributors. \nThe Chicago Tribune, in an editorial dated November 14, 1998, agreed \nthat the mayor's anger at the misuse of handguns was understandable, \nbut called his lawsuit ``wrongheaded and ill-advised'' because ``it \nrepresents an abuse of the tort liability system and a dangerous \nextension of the tactic employed in similar lawsuits against the \ntobacco industry of using potentially bankrupting lawsuits to force \nmakers of legal but unpopular products to quit.''\n  To one federal district court, such lawsuits are ``an obvious attempt \nunwise and unwarranted to ban or restrict handguns through courts and \njuries, despite the repeated refusals of state legislatures and \nCongress to pass strong, comprehensive gun-control measures.'' \n[Patterson v. Rohm Gessellschaft, 608 F. Supp. 1206, 1211 (N.D. Tex. \n1985)].\n  Indeed, in characterizing the federal lawsuit against the tobacco \nproducers and the HUD suit threatened against the firearms industries, \nand in complete candor, former Clinton Secretary of Labor Robert Reich \nnoted that:\n\n       * * * the biggest problem is that these lawsuits are end \n     runs around the democratic process. We used to be a nation of \n     laws, but this new strategy presents novel means of \n     legislating--within settlement negotiations of large civil \n     suits initiated by the executive branch. This is faux \n     legislation that sacrifices democracy to the discretion of \n     administrative officials operating in secrecy.\n\n[Robert Reich, ``Don't Democrats Believe in Democracy,'' The Wall \nStreet Journal, Wednesday, January 12, 2000].\n  Furthermore, these junk lawsuits seek to reverse the well-established \ntort law principle that manufacturers are not responsible for the \ncriminal misuse of their products. For instance, the Seventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals in Martin v. Harrington and Richardson, Inc., [743 F. \n2d 1200, 1205 (7th Cir. 1984)], held that criminal misuse of a handgun \nbreaks the causal connection between the manufacturers action and the \ninjury ``because such criminal activity is not reasonably forseeable.''\n  A judge from a federal district court noted that ``under all ordinary \nand normal circumstances in the absence of any reason to expect the \ncontrary, the actor may reasonably proceed with the assumption that \nothers will obey the criminal law.'' [Bennett v. The Cincinnati Checker \nCab, 353 F.Supp. 1206, 1209 (E.D. Kent, 1973)]. It is important to note \nthat in his opinion the judge cited the noted tort expert, the late \nProfessor Prosser, for the proposition that entities are not liable for \ncriminal acts of others because such acts are generally unforeseeable \nand thereby cut the chain of proximate causation. [Prosser, Torts, 3d \ned. at 176].\n\n  Moreover, these lawsuits suffer from the same defect that some, if \nnot all, of the courts in the federal tobacco lawsuit suffer from: lack \nof standing. Government entities, absent specific statutory authority--\nwhich is not present in either the federal tobacco case or these gun \nmanufacturers cases--may not recoup medical and other expenses paid by \ngovernment agencies from manufacturers of products alleged to cause the \nharm to ``third party'' beneficiaries of government programs. For \ninstance let me mention two cases. Holmes v. Securities Investor \nProtection Corp., [503 U.S. 258, 268-69 (1992)] and Laborers Local 17 \nHealth Benefit Fund v. Phillip Morris, [191 F. 3d 229 (2nd Cir. 1999)]. \nThese cases stand for the proposition that a complaint is too \n``remote'' when a plaintiff seeks to recover damage to a third party. \nTherefore, the plaintiff lacks standing to bring the suit.\n  This is exactly what Connecticut Superior Court Judge Robert McWeeny \nheld when he recently dismissed the City of Bridgport's ``junk \nlawsuit'' complaint for recoupment against Smith & Wesson. [Ganim v. \nSmith & Wesson, [No. CV 990253198S (Superior Ct. Conn., Dec. 10, \n1999)]].\n  Our judiciary is being transformed by these misguided advocates of \ngun control from courts of justice into tribunals of the gun control \nlobby. That is why this legislation is needed. The Congress has both a \nduty to protect federal constitutional rights such as the right to keep \nand bear arms, as well as to step in and reform our tort system when it \nis being abused and the abuse has a significant impact on interstate \ncommerce.\n  Let me say a few words about last Friday's announcement of the \nagreement between Smith & Wesson and HUD. Basically, the agreement \nmandates that Smith & Wesson would provide trigger locks within 60 days \nand make their handguns child resistant within a year. Smith & Wesson \nalso agreed to a ``code of conduct'' whereby the manufacturer would \nsell its products only to ``authorized dealers and distributors'' who \nagree to have their contract terminated if ``a disproportionate \nnumber'' of crimes were traced to the firearms they sell. Some sort of \noutside board will police the settlement. In return, the federal \ngovernment agreed not to bring suit against the firearms manufacturer \nand eleven of the thirty cities and local governments dropped their \nactions.\n  I believe that this so-called ``deal'' is the latest attempt by the \nAdministration to play on the fear of the American people for pure \npolitical advantage. It makes the Administration look good. It makes it \nseem that the Administration is doing ``something'' about gun violence. \nBut the record makes clear that the Administration has done little to \nenforce the federal laws on the books against gun wielding criminals. \nSo this settlement masks the truth. The Administration has been inept \nin preventing gun violence.\n\n  Let me say, first of all, that I don't believe that the \nAdministration ever really intended to see its lawsuit against the \nfirearms manufacturers to verdict. Indeed, in announcing the projected \nlawsuit against the gun manufacturers, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo \nadmitted to the press that the whole effort was simply a bargaining \nploy.\n  So let's call it what the federal lawsuit really is: extortion. It is \nan attempt to bypass the legislative process\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\nand the Constitution to achieve a gun control agenda that the public's \nelected officials oppose. Sue the industry and have them cave in or \nface imminent financial ruin by having to defend an avalanche of \nlegally dubious lawsuits and bad publicity. That's their game plan.\n  Well, Smith & Wesson caved in. Why? Published reports have it that \nthe owner of Smith & Wesson, Tompkins PLC of Great Britain, could not \nfind a buyer for the $161 million company with lawsuits hanging over \nits head. And Tompkins understands that three California gun companies \nhave gone out of business and that legal fees may very well bankrupt \nthe industry. So Tompkins surrendered.\n  And the reward for their surrender: it was announced on Saturday that \nHUD and the mayors of Atlanta, Detroit and Miami directed their law \nenforcement agencies to give preferences to Smith & Wesson when \npurchasing firearms. [``Smith & Wesson Earns Preference,'' @ Home \nNetwork, AP, March 18, 2000] This is outrageous. Not only does this \ndeal undercut the Second Amendment, it undercuts the principle of \ncompetitive bidding. It creates an incentive that tax payers will be \ngouged. It punishes innocent firearms manufacturers. It weakens the \nrule of law because innocent manufacturers are denied their day in \ncourt. It weakens democracy because the heavy hand of big government is \nused as a tool of despotism.\n  But it is the ``code of conduct'' term of the settlement that is the \nmost peculiar. Again, this provision mandates that Smith & Wesson sell \nits products only to ``authorized dealers and distributors'' who agree \nto have their contracts terminated if ``a disproportionate number'' of \ncrimes are traced to the firearms they sell. Well, how is this to be \ndetermined? What is a disproportionate number of crimes? And how will \nthis be traced to the dealer or distributor? And what if the dealer or \ndistributor were innocent of any wrongdoing?\n  It seems to me that this settlement term suffers from the same defect \nas the underlying ``junk lawsuits''--innocent parties are being held \nliable for the criminal acts of third parties.\n\n  The settlement represents the misuse of governmental power. It \nrepresents a weakening of our democracy and the rule of law.\n  Mr. President, let me turn to the provisions of the bill that will \n(1) prevent illicit fees to be charged for background checks, and (2) \nthat protect the privacy of gun owners from federal intrusion.\n  The Brady Handgun Control Act of 1993 is silent on whether the \ngovernment may charge a fee for the instant background check required \nunder 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(t). And let me add that it was never \ncontemplated that the government would charge such a fee when Brady was \ndebated and passed.\n  Nonetheless, despite no explicit legal authority, the Administration \nhas repeatedly attempted to require the payment of such a fee by \nlicensed firearms dealers--which fees would almost surely be passed \nalong to purchasers through higher prices. This would truly amount to \n``taxation without representation.''\n  Section 5 of our bill adds Section 540C to Title 28. This new section \nprohibits the Administration from promulgating a tax without Congress' \napproval. It codifies a prohibition on charging or collecting ``any fee \nin connection with any background check required in connection with the \ntransfer of a firearm.'' The prohibition would apply both to the \nFederal government and ``State or local officers or employees acting on \nbehalf of the United States.''\n  This section thus prohibits an unauthorized fee that may be \nconsidered to be a ``tax'' on the exercise of a constitutional right--\nin this case, to buy a firearm.\n  Finally, under the Brady bill, if the instant background check \nreveals that the buyer is eligible to purchase the firearm, the \ngovernment is required to ``destroy all records of the system with \nrespect to the call and all records of the system relating to the \nperson or the transfer.'' [18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(t)(2)(C)]. The Brady bill \nalso prohibits the government from using the instant check system to \nestablish a registry of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms \ntransfers, except with respect to persons prohibited from receiving a \nfirearm. [Pub. L. 103-159, Sec. 103(i)].\n  Despite the law, the Administration promulgated regulations in 1998 \nthat allowed the FBI to retain for 6 months information pertinent to an \napproved firearms sale gathered as part of the instant check system. \n[See C.F.R. Sec. 25.9(b)(1)].\n\n  But, I concur with those Second Amendment advocates who view these \nrecord retention periods as veiled attempts by the government to \nestablish a national firearms registry. Furthermore, the only way to \nensure the privacy and security of the information in the instant check \nsystem is to immediately destroy the records of approved firearms \ntransfers.\n  To address these concerns and preempt the Administration's efforts to \nundermine the Brady bill's ban on a national firearms registry, my bill \nwould establish a new statute, Section 931 to title 18, that would \nprohibit the use of the instant check system unless the system \n``require[s] and result[s] in the immediate destruction of all \ninformation, in any form whatsoever or through any medium,'' about any \nperson determined not to be prohibited from receiving a firearm.\n  The destruction requirement, however, would not apply to (1) ``any \nunique identification number provided by the [instant check] system,'' \nor (2) ``the date on which that number is provided.'' These exceptions \nparallel the exceptions contained in the Brady bill [see 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 922(t)(2)(C)] and allow the government to trace a firearm to a \ndealer, but not to a purchaser.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation to prevent extortion against the manufacturers of a lawful \nproduct, firearms. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to \nprohibit a tax on the exercise of constitutional right--the Second \nAmendment's guarantee of the right of the American citizen to keep and \nbear arms. And I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that \nprotects the privacy of citizens who lawfully and peaceably possess \nfirearms from federal intrusion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2270\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Right to Bear Arms \n     Protection and Privacy Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Citizens have a right, under the Second Amendment to \n     the United States Constitution, to keep and bear arms.\n       (2) Lawsuits have been commenced against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, and importers of nondefective \n     firearms, which seek money damages and other relief for the \n     harm caused by the misuse of firearms by third parties, \n     including criminals.\n       (3) The manufacture, importation, possession, sale, and use \n     of firearms and ammunition in the United States is heavily \n     regulated by Federal, State, and local laws. Such Federal \n     laws include the Gun Control Act of 1968, the National \n     Firearms Act, and the Arms Export Control Act.\n       (4) Businesses in the United States that are engaged in \n     interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, \n     marketing, distribution, manufacture, importation, or sale to \n     the public of firearms or ammunition that have been shipped \n     or transported in interstate or foreign commerce are not, and \n     should not be, liable or otherwise legally responsible for \n     the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse \n     firearm products or ammunition products.\n       (5) The possibility of imposing liability or other legal \n     restrictions on an entire industry as a result of harm that \n     is the sole responsibility of others is an abuse of the legal \n     system, erodes public confidence our Nation's laws, threatens \n     the diminution of a basic constitutional right, invites the \n     disassembly and destabilization of other industries and \n     economic sectors lawfully competing in America's free \n     enterprise system, and constitutes an unreasonable burden on \n     interstate and foreign commerce.\n       (6) The liability and equitable actions commenced or \n     contemplated by municipalities, cities, and other entities \n     are based on theories without foundation in hundreds of years \n     of the common law and American jurisprudence. The possible \n     sustaining of these actions by a maverick judicial officer \n     would expand civil liability in a manner never contemplated \n     by the Framers of the Constitution.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two \npieces of legislation that would impact the lives of many at-risk \nchildren living in foster care. In an effort to move forward and figure \nout what Congress needs to do next to help improve the operation of the \nchild welfare system following the 1997 enactment of the Adoption and \nSafe Families Act, my friend and colleague Senator Rockefeller and I, \nas well as Senators Landrieu, Levin, Kerry, Kerrey, Wellstone, Colins, \nBoxer, Chafee, Lincoln and Bingaman, are introducing the strengthening \nAbuse and Neglect Courts Act and the Training and Knowledge Ensure \nChildren a Risk-free Environment (TAKE CARE) Act.\n  Before I talk about these bills, specifically, it's important to \nunderstand how we arrived at where we are today with regard to the \nchild welfare agencies and the court system. Back in 1997, I was very \ninvolved in one of the success stories of the 105th Congress: The \npassage of the Adoption and Safe Families Act. This subcommittee played \na critical role in shaping that legislation. This law has many goals: \nFirst, it encourages safe and permanent family placements for abused \nand neglected children; second, it makes it clear that the health and \nsafety of the child always must come first in any decision involving a \nchild in abuse and neglect cases; and third, it decreases the amount of \ntime that a child spends in the foster care system. Specifically, the \nlaw requires initiation of proceedings to terminate parental rights for \nany child who has been in the foster care system for fifteen (15) of \nthe last twenty-two (22) months.\n  The Adoption and Safe Families Act represented a significant change \nin child welfare laws. Perhaps more important, we were changing the way \njudges and child advocates looked at child welfare cases. This \nrepresented a change in the culture of child welfare, as we know it, \nand forced the system to stop and rethink its processes and its \npurposes.\n  We all knew this law was not a quick nor a complete fix--more work \nwould be necessary to make the law a success and to implement a new way \nof thinking about child welfare--a way of thinking that says that it is \nno longer acceptable to place a child in long-term foster care without \na plan for permanent placement. We knew that a law that simply tells \njudges that the health and safety of the child must be paramount would \nnot necessarily be reflected in judicial decisions. To get there, \ntraining needs to be available so the law effectively becomes a part of \njudge's decisionmaking process.\n  A tragic local case--the death of twenty-three month old Brianna \nBlackmond--demonstrates the need for this training. Brianna had been \nplaced in foster care at the age of four months, due to her mother's \nneglect. In January of this year, Brianna was killed just seventeen \ndays after being returned to her mother from foster care. In the \naftermath of this tragedy, DC Superior Court Judges told the Washington \nPost about the agony they feel in making child welfare decisions. One \nof the judges quoted in the article said this: ``These cases are, for \nme, the most difficult thing we do. We feel the least trained and \nskilled at it.''\n  These judges are making tough, life-changing decisions for all \nparties involved. We have a responsibility to make sure they are \ntrained properly and feel confident about those decisions.\n  When we passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, we also knew that \nthe imposition of reduced timelines would create additional pressure on \nan already overburdened court system. These timelines, however, are \nvery important to the welfare of the children involved. Foster care, \nafter all, was meant to be a temporary solution--not a way of life.\n  These timelines can work only if the courts are able to process cases \nin a timely manner. To give you an idea of what the courts are up \nagainst, consider this: When the Family Court was established in New \nYork in 1962, it reviewed 96,000 cases the first year. By 1997, the \ncase load had increased to 670,000 cases. The courts must have a \nmanageable case load so that an appropriate decision can be made in \nevery case after all of the facts have been heard. We cannot rush \ndecision making in these cases--a child's life is at risk.\n  We also knew that the courts needed information to make the best \npossible decision for the child. This problem was demonstrated in \nCuyahoga County, Ohio. Until recently, the court had no central clerk's \nfile, so there was no way of tracking the location of a particular \nfile. If the file could not be found on the day of a hearing or review, \nit would result in a postponement, often adding months to a child's \nstay in foster care. It is undisputed that children need permanency as \nquickly as possible. It is simply unconscionable that children should \nbe trapped in foster care by a bureaucratic nightmare of paperwork.\n  We need to move forward and help improve the operation of the child \nwelfare system, and in particular, the courts. The legislation Senator \nRockefeller and I are introducing today will help move us in the right \ndirection. Taken together, our bills would provide competitive grants \nto courts to create computerized case tracking systems, as well as \ngrants to reduce pending backlogs of abuse and neglect cases so that \ncourts are better able to comply with the timelines established in the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act. These bills also would allow judges, \nattorneys, and court personnel to qualify for training under Title IV-\nE's existing training provisions and would expand the CASA program to \nunderserved and urban areas, so that more children are able to benefit \nfrom its services.\n\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that when Congress passed \nthe Adoption and Safe Families Act, I believed it was a good start. \nCongress, however, would have to do more to make sure that every child \nhas the opportunity to live in a safe, stable, loving and permanent \nhome. One of the essential ingredients is an efficiently operating \ncourt system--a system that puts the principles embodied in the law \ninto practice. After all, that's where a lot of delays occur. As well \nintentioned as the strict timelines of the 1997 law are, mandatory \nfiling dates are not enough to promote child placement permanency if \nthe court docket is too clogged to move cases through the system, or \njudges aren't changing their routine in a way that reflects the \nimportance of these timelines and the necessity of placing the child's \nsafety first.\n  The critical next step is to help the courts improve administrative \nefficiency and effectiveness--goals of the Adoption and Safe Families \nAct. I believe that our legislation can do that. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2271\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Training and Knowledge \n     Ensure Children a Risk-Free Environment (TAKE CARE) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Under both Federal and State law, the courts play a \n     crucial and essential role in the Nation's child welfare \n     system and in ensuring safety, stability, and permanence for \n     abused and neglected children under the supervision of that \n     system.\n       (2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law \n     105-89; 111 Stat. 2115) establishes explicitly for the first \n     time in Federal law that a child's health and safety must be \n     the paramount consideration when any decision is made \n     regarding a child in the Nation's child welfare system.\n       (3) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 promotes \n     stability and permanence for abused and neglected children by \n     requiring timely decision-making in proceedings to determine \n     whether children can safely return to their families or \n     whether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive \n     homes or other permanent family arrangements outside the \n     foster care system.\n       (4) To avoid unnecessary and lengthy stays in the foster \n     care system, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 \n     specifically requires, among other things, that States move \n     to terminate the parental rights of the parents of those \n     children who have been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 \n     months.\n       (5) While essential to protect children and to carry out \n     the general purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of \n     1997, the accelerated timelines for the termination of \n     parental rights and the other requirements imposed under that \n     Act increase the pressure on the Nation's already \n     overburdened abuse and neglect courts.\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\n       (6) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be substantially \n     improved by the acquisition and implementation of \n     computerized case-tracking systems to identify and eliminate \n     existing backlogs, to move abuse and neglect caseloads \n     forward in a timely manner, and to move children into safe \n     and stable families. Such systems could also be used to \n     evaluate the effectiveness of such courts in meeting the \n     purposes of the amendments made by, and provisions of, the \n     Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.\n       (7) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     Nation's abuse and neglect courts would also be improved by \n     the identification and implementation of projects designed to \n     eliminate the backlog of abuse and neglect cases, including \n     the temporary hiring of additional judges, extension of court \n     hours, and other projects designed to reduce existing \n     caseloads.\n       (8) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be further \n     strengthened by improving the quality and availability of \n     training for judges, court personnel, agency attorneys, \n     guardians ad litem, volunteers who participate in court-\n     appointed special advocate (CASA) programs, and attorneys who \n     represent the children and the parents of children in abuse \n     and neglect proceedings.\n       (9) While recognizing that abuse and neglect courts in this \n     country are already committed to the quality administration \n     of justice, the performance of such courts would be even \n     further enhanced by the development of models and educational \n     opportunities that reinforce court projects that have already \n     been developed, including models for case-flow procedures, \n     case management, representation of children, automated \n     interagency interfaces, and ``best practices'' standards.\n       (10) Judges, magistrates, commissioners, and other judicial \n     officers play a central and vital role in ensuring that \n     proceedings in our Nation's abuse and neglect courts are run \n     efficiently and effectively. The performance of those \n     individuals in such courts can only be further enhanced by \n     training, seminars, and an ongoing opportunity to exchange \n     ideas with their peers.\n       (11) Volunteers who participate in court-appointed special \n     advocate (CASA) programs play a vital role as the eyes and \n     ears of abuse and neglect courts in proceedings conducted by, \n     or under the supervision of, such courts and also bring \n     increased public scrutiny of the abuse and neglect court \n     system. The Nation's abuse and neglect courts would benefit \n     from an expansion of this program to currently underserved \n     communities.\n       (12) Improved computerized case-tracking systems, \n     comprehensive training, and development of, and education on, \n     model abuse and neglect court systems, particularly with \n     respect to underserved areas, would significantly further the \n     purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 by \n     reducing the average length of an abused and neglected \n     child's stay in foster care, improving the quality of \n     decision-making and court services provided to children and \n     families, and increasing the number of adoptions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Abuse and \n     Neglect Courts Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Under both Federal and State law, the courts play a \n     crucial and essential role in the Nation's child welfare \n     system and in ensuring safety, stability, and permanence for \n     abused and neglected children under the supervision of that \n     system.\n       (2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law \n     105-89; 111 Stat. 2115) establishes explicitly for the first \n     time in Federal law that a child's health and safety must be \n     the paramount consideration when any decision is made \n     regarding a child in the Nation's child welfare system.\n       (3) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 promotes \n     stability and permanence for abused and neglected children by \n     requiring timely decision-making in proceedings to determine \n     whether children can safely return to their families or \n     whether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive \n     homes or other permanent family arrangements outside the \n     foster care system.\n       (4) To avoid unnecessary and lengthy stays in the foster \n     care system, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 \n     specifically requires, among other things, that States move \n     to terminate the parental rights of the parents of those \n     children who have been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 \n     months.\n       (5) While essential to protect children and to carry out \n     the general purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of \n     1997, the accelerated timelines for the termination of \n     parental rights and the other requirements imposed under that \n     Act increase the pressure on the Nation's already \n     overburdened abuse and neglect courts.\n       (6) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be substantially \n     improved by the acquisition and implementation of \n     computerized case-tracking systems to identify and eliminate \n     existing backlogs, to move abuse and neglect caseloads \n     forward in a timely manner, and to move children into safe \n     and stable families. Such systems could also be used to \n     evaluate the effectiveness of such courts in meeting the \n     purposes of the amendments made by, and provisions of, the \n     Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.\n       (7) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     Nation's abuse and neglect courts would also be improved by \n     the identification and implementation of projects designed to \n     eliminate the backlog of abuse and neglect cases, including \n     the temporary hiring of additional judges, extension of court \n     hours, and other projects designed to reduce existing \n     caseloads.\n       (8) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be further \n     strengthened by improving the quality and availability of \n     training for judges, court personnel, agency attorneys, \n     guardians ad litem, volunteers who participate in court-\n     appointed special advocate (CASA) programs, and attorneys who \n     represent the children and the parents of children in abuse \n     and neglect proceedings.\n       (9) While recognizing that abuse and neglect courts in this \n     country are already committed to the quality administration \n     of justice, the performance of such courts would be even \n     further enhanced by the development of models and educational \n     opportunities that reinforce court projects that have already \n     been developed, including models for case-flow procedures, \n     case management, representation of children, automated \n     interagency interfaces, and ``best practices'' standards.\n       (10) Judges, magistrates, commissioners, and other judicial \n     officers play a central and vital role in ensuring that \n     proceedings in our Nation's abuse and neglect courts are run \n     efficiently and effectively. The performance of those \n     individuals in such courts can only be further enhanced by \n     training, seminars, and an ongoing opportunity to exchange \n     ideas with their peers.\n       (11) Volunteers who participate in court-appointed special \n     advocate (CASA) programs play a vital role as the eyes and \n     ears of abuse and neglect courts in proceedings conducted by, \n     or under the supervision of, such courts and also bring \n     increased public scrutiny of the abuse and neglect court \n     system. The Nation's abuse and neglect courts would benefit \n     from an expansion of this program to currently underserved \n     communities.\n       (12) Improved computerized case-tracking systems, \n     comprehensive training, and development of, and education on, \n     model abuse and neglect court systems, particularly with \n     respect to underserved areas, would significantly further the \n     purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 by \n     reducing the average length of an abused and neglected \n     child's stay in foster care, improving the quality of \n     decision-making and court services provided to children and \n     families, and increasing the number of adoptions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I am proud to join Senator DeWine and other concerned \ncolleagues in introducing two bills that are related and designed to \nhelp strengthen our court systems that preside over the child abuse and \nneglect cases. If we want the child welfare system to work well, we \nmust invest in improving our courts, as well as our State agencies. We \nneed to reduce the backlog of cases. We need to invest in computer \nsystems so that the courts keep track of these children. We need to \ntrain judges and court personnel so that they can make the tough \ndecisions required by the 1997 Adoption Act to make a child's safety, \nhealth, and permanency paramount.\n  These two bills are identical to a package we introduced last year, \nbut we hope dividing the legislation into separate bills will \nstreamline consideration. Both bills are urgent.\n  These bills build on the foundation of the Adoption and Safe Families \nAct, passed in October 1997. For the first time, this law established \nthat a child's health and safety must be the paramount consideration \nwhen any decision is made regarding a child in the abuse and neglect \nsystem. The law promotes stability and permanence for abused and \nneglected children by requiring timely decisionmaking in proceedings to \ndetermine whether children can safely return to their families or \nwhether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive homes. More \nspecifically, the law requires a State to move to terminate the \nparental rights of any parent whose child has been in foster care for \n15 out of the last 22 months. While essential to protect children, \nthese accelerated time lines increase the pressure on the Nation's \nalready overburdened child abuse and neglect courts.\n  Our courts play a vital role in the Nation's child protection system. \nThrough my discussions with judges in my State of West Virginia and \nacross the country, I have learned that abuse and neglect judges make \nsome of the most difficult decisions made by any members of the \njudiciary. Adjudications of abuse and neglect, terminations of parental \nrights, approval of adoptions, and life-changing determinations are not \nmade without careful and sometimes painful deliberation. Despite the \ncourts' commitment to the fair and efficient administration of justice \nin these cases, staggering increases in the number of children in the \nabuse and neglect system have placed a tremendous burden on our abuse \nand neglect courts.\n  Throughout the debate on the Adoption and Safe Families Act, we heard \nfrom dozen of judges--especially in my State of West Virginia--who \nmaintained that the biggest problems facing their courts are the \noverwhelming backlog of abuse and neglect cases. Without creative ways \nto eliminate such backlogs, the judges argued, new cases will never \nmove smoothly through the court system. That is why the Strengthening \nAbuse and Neglect Courts Act authorizes a grant program to provide \nState courts with the funds they need to eliminate current backlogs \nonce and for all. For some courts, that might involve the temporary \nhiring of an additional judge, a temporary extension of court hours, or \nrestructuring the duties of court personnel. This program will provide \ngrants to those court projects that will result in the effective and \nrapid elimination of current backlogs to smooth the way for more \nefficient courts in the future. Grants would also be established to \nfund computer tracking systems for courts to prevent backlog and ensure \ntimely consideration and information.\n  We also seek to expand the successful Court-Appointed Special \nAdvocate (CASA) Program. CASA volunteers are the eyes and the ears of \nthe courts, spending time with abused and neglected children, \ninterviewing the adults involved in their lives, and helping to give \njudges a better understanding of the needs of each individual child. \nDespite the incredible success of the CASA programs, thousands of \nabused and neglected children do not have the benefit of CASA \nrepresentation. The bill provides CASA with a $55 million grant to \nexpand its programs into underserved inner cities and rural areas.\n  The second bill, the TAKE CARE Act, Training and Knowledge Ensure \nChildren a Risk-free Environment, recognizes the need for improved \ntraining, continuing educational opportunities, and model practice \nstandards for judges, attorneys and other court personnel who work in \nthe abuse and neglect courts. More specifically, the bill requires that \nabuse and neglect agencies design and encourage the implementation of \n``best practice'' standards for those attorneys representing the \nagencies in abuse and neglect cases. It extends the federal \nreimbursement for training currently provided to agency representatives \nto judges, court personnel, law enforcement representatives, guardians-\nad-litem, and the other attorneys who practice in abuse and neglect \nproceedings. For the first time, such reimbursement would help fund \nspecialized cross-training agency and court personnel and training that \nfocuses on vital subjects such as new research on child development.\n  Abused and neglected children depend upon the courts to decide their \nsafety and to find a permanent home. This is what children need, and \ntoo many are waiting. We should move swiftly on the Strengthening Abuse \nand Nelgect Courts Act and the TAKE CARE Act to help such vulnerable \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S1607]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Harkin, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 2274. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide families and disabled children with the opportunity to purchase \ncoverage under the Medicaid Program for such children; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                     Family Opportunity Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nKennedy, Jeffords and Harkin in introducing the Family Opportunity Act \nof 2000. This new legislation will make life easier for many families \nand their children.\n  When you're a parent, your main objective is to provide for your \nchild to the best of your ability. If it takes a 12-hour day in the \nfield or in the factory, that's what you do. Our federal government \ntakes this goal and turns it upside down for parents of children with \nspecial health care needs.\n  The government forces these parents to choose between family income \nand their children's health care. That's a terrible choice. Families \nmust have a low income to qualify their children for both Medicaid and \nfederal disability benefits. This means parents often refuse jobs, pay \nraises and overtime just to preserve access to Medicaid for their child \nwith disabilities.\n  Families have to remain in poverty just to keep Medicaid.\n  Obviously this affects entire families, not just the child with the \nhealth care needs. Melissa Arnold, an Iowan, has a 17-year-old son who \ncan't work even part-time for fear of jeopardizing his brother's \nMedicaid coverage. Ms. Arnold has accepted several promotions without \nthe pay raises she's earned. Despite these challenges, this family has \nstayed together.\n  In the worst cases, parents give up custody of their child with \nspecial health care needs or put their child in an out-of-home \nplacement just to keep their child's access to Medicaid-covered \nservices. Why is Medicaid so desirable? It's critical to the well-being \nof children with multiple medical needs. It covers a lot of services \nthat these children need, such as physical therapy and medical \nequipment.\n  Private health plans often are much more limited in what they cover. \nMany parents can't afford needed services out-of-pocket. Today, my \ncolleagues and I will introduce legislation to fix the Catch-22 for \nparents of children with disabilities.\n  Our bill, the Family Opportunity Act of 2000, creates a state option \nto allow working parents who have a child with a disability to keep \nworking and to still have access to Medicaid for their child. Parents \nwould pay for Medicaid coverage on a sliding scale. No one would have \nto become impoverished or stay impoverished to secure Medicaid for a \nchild.\n  Our bill also establishes family-to-family health information \ncenters. These centers would be staffed by actual parents of children \nwith special needs as well as professionals. They would provide \ninformation to families trying to arrange health services for their \nchildren.\n  The Family Opportunity Act of 2000 is modeled after last year's \nsuccessful Work Incentives Improvement Act. Under that law, adults with \ndisabilities can return to work and not risk losing their health care \ncoverage. Parents of children with disabilities should have the same \nopportunities as adults with disabilities.\n  Everybody wants to use their talents to the fullest potential, and \nevery parent wants to provide as much as possible for his or her \nchildren. The government shouldn't get in the way.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleagues \nSenators Grassley, Jeffords, and Harkin in introducing the Family \nOpportunity Act of 2000. Our goal is to help children with disabilities \nby removing the health care barriers that so often prevent families \nfrom staying together and staying employed.\n  Despite the extraordinary growth and prosperity the country is \nenjoying today, families of disabled children and special needs \nchildren continue to struggle to keep their families together, live \nindependently and become fully contributing members of their \ncommunities.\n  More than 8% of children in this country have significant \ndisabilities. Yet many of them do not have access to the health \nservices they need to maintain and prevent deterioration of their \nhealth. Too often, to obtain needed health services for their children \nunder Medicaid, families are forced to become poor, stay poor, put \ntheir children in institutions, or give up custody of their children \nentirely. No parent should be faced with that unacceptable choice.\n  In a recent survey of 20 states, 64% families of special needs \nchildren report they are turning down jobs, turning down raises, \nturning down overtime, and are unable to save money for the future of \ntheir children and family--so that their children can stay eligible for \nMedicaid through SSI, the Social Security Income Program.\n  Today we are introducing legislation to close the health care gap for \nvulnerable families, and enable them to obtain the health care their \ndisabled children deserve.\n  The Family Opportunity Act of 2000 will remove the unfair barriers \nthat deny needed health care to so many disabled children and special \nneeds children.\n  It will make health insurance coverage more widely available for \nchildren with significant current disabilities, by enabling parents to \nbuy-in to Medicaid at an affordable rate.\n  It will enable states to develop a demonstration program to provide a \nMedicaid buy-in for children with potentially significant \ndisabilities--those who will become severely disabled if they do not \nreceive health services.\n  It will establish Family to Family Information Centers in each state \nto help families with special needs children.\n  The passage of the Work Incentives Improvement Act last year \ndemonstrated the nation's commitment to help adults with disabilities \nobtain the health services they need, in order to lead independent and \nproductive lives. The legislation we are introducing today makes a \nsimilar commitment to children with disabilities and their families.\n  I look forward to working with all members of Congress to enact this \nlegislation. Disabled children and their families across the country \ndeserve this help in achieving their dreams and participating fully in \nthe social and economic mainstream of our nation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Grassley, Kennedy and Harkin in introducing the Family \nOpportunity Act of 2000. We are taking the right step, the logical \nstep, and a much needed step.\n  The last bill signed into law in the 20th Century was the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act. Through it, we extended health care \ncoverage to adults with disabilities who work, by allowing them to buy-\nin to Medicaid coverage regardless of their income. Tomorrow, we set \nout to help children with disabilities by introducing the Family \nOpportunity Act. This legislation will create a similar Medicaid buy-in \noption for families of children with disabilities.\n  When a child is born, it is a time for joy, hope, and dreams. If the \nchild has a serious medical condition that may lead to a significant \ndisability, or if the child is born with a disability, these feelings \nare often put on hold. Instead, the families of these children must \nconcentrate on some basic facts, facts that may be a matter of life and \ndeath. These facts will shape the quality of life that the family can \noffer the child. The family will have to answer some important \nquestions. First, do they have health insurance? If so, does the \ninsurance cover the cost of the specialized services that their child \nneeds? Families who answer `NO' to these questions are overwhelmed and \nfearful, and their vision of the future is filled with uncertainty.\n  Every day, children in America are born with severe disabilities that \nrequire specialized health care services. Too often, the parents of \nthese children do not have health care coverage or their coverage does \nnot cover the needed services. These families do not have many options. \nTheir child can receive health care coverage only if the family is \npoor, or if the family gives the child up to the state. We have all \nheard heart wrenching stories, but none are more traumatic than these.\n  The Family Opportunity Act of 2000 is a solution to this tragic \nproblem. Children without health insurance will now be covered. Those \nchildren with\n\n[[Page S1608]]\n\ndisabilities whose health insurance does not cover the services they \nneed, will also be covered. Children with significant disabilities will \nno longer be denied the health care coverage they need, regardless of \ntheir family's income. Their families will, however, be expected to \ncontribute to the cost of coverage. In addition, these families will \nhave access to assistance from a Family Health Information Center. This \nservice will provide families with information about their options and \nwill help them exercise these options. Their children will receive the \ncare they need and deserve.\n  Data from the Social Security Administration indicates that in \nDecember 1999 there were 1,080 Vermont children with disabilities \neligible for Medicaid. That means that the families of these children \nare poor. Some of these families have chosen to keep their income under \nthe prescribed limits in law, so that they can access health care \nthrough Medicaid for their child with a disability. These families \ncannot access health care coverage for their children through the \nprivate sector.\n  With the Family Opportunity Act everyone wins. Through Medicaid, \nchildren with disabilities will receive the health care services they \ndesperately need. Through the Family Health Information Centers, their \nfamilies will be provided with the right information at the right time. \nFamilies will be able to make key medical decisions that will maximize \nthe quality of life for their children with disabilities. And, the \nfederal and state governments will have a cost-effective program to \nhelp children and families in need.\n  The Family Opportunity Act of 2000 will make time for joy, hope, and \ndreams, for families of children with special needs. This is a good \nstart to the 21st Century.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I rise in support of the Family \nOpportunity Act of 2000. I commend my colleague from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, for his work on this important piece of legislation. I also \nthank Senator Kennedy for his continued leadership on these issues. \nThis bill would help many children across the country get the services \nthey need to grow up and become independent and productive members of \nsociety. And, it will help their families stay afloat financially.\n  I am always encouraged when issues affecting individuals with \ndisabilities and their families rise above partisan lines. Disability \nis not a partisan issue. President Bush understood that. Bob Dole \nunderstands that. And I am glad to see that my fellow senator from Iowa \nhas joined me in the fight to ensure that children with disabilities \nand their families get a fair shake in life.\n  Just last year the Congress and the President agreed that we should \nremove barriers to work for people with disabilities in our national \nprograms when it passed the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives \nImprovement Act of 1999 into law. The Family Opportunity Act builds on \nthat bipartisan agreement and says that we should also remove barriers \nto work for families of children with disabilities. Right now, many \nfamilies are forced to spend down their savings and earnings on \nspecialized services for their children because their private insurance \nwon't cover them. Other families give up jobs and promotions so that \nthey continue to qualify for Medicaid.\n  This is wrong for two reasons. First, it's the child that suffers if \nappropriate services aren't available due to high cost and lack of \ninsurance coverage. Second, if a family is forced to pay for expensive \nservices time and again or forced to give up an employment opportunity, \nthe entire family is pushed to edge financially. As a result, the \nfamily can become impoverished or forced to give up custody of their \nchild in order to secure appropriate Medicaid services.\n  This bill provides a commonsense solution to the problem. The bill \nallows States to offer Medicaid coverage to children with severe \ndisabilities living in middle-income families through a buy-in program. \nchildren will get the right early intervention services, rehabilitation \nand long-term therapies, and medical equipment they need to keep pace \nand grow into adulthood. And, parents will no longer have to sacrifice \na job, a raise, or overtime so they can stay inside the income bracket \nthat qualifies their child for SSI/Medicaid.\n  Perhaps most importantly, this bill will ensure that children get the \nservices they need to stay at home with their families. Keeping \nfamilies strong is the best therapy for everyone--the child, the \nfamily, and the entire community.\n  Finally, the Family to Family Health Information Centers included in \nthe bill will ensure every family knows what about the services and \nopportunities that are available to them. I know this type of \ninformation exchange works because I've taken the lead to fund similar \nprograms in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  Ten years ago, as the chief sponsor of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, I said on the Senate floor that I wanted every child \nand individual with a disability to have an equal opportunity to \nparticipate in all aspects of American life.\n  Since that time, I have worked hard to ensure that every national \nprogram encourages independence and self-sufficiency for individuals \nwith disabilities. Each step we take to live up to the promise of the \nAmericans with Disabilities' Act is progress. Last year's Ticket to \nWork and Work Incentives Improvement was a big step toward equality. \nThe Family Opportunity Act builds on that legislation.\n  In my mind, the Medicaid Community Attendant Services Act (MiCASSA), \nintroduced by myself and Senator Specter last fall, takes the next big \nstep toward fulfilling the promise of the ADA. Given a real choice, \nmost Americans who need long-term services and supports would prefer to \nreceive them in home and community settings rather than in \ninstitutions. And yet, too often decisions relating to the provision of \nlong-term services and supports are influenced by what is reimbursable \nunder Federal and State Medicaid policy rather than by what individuals \nneed. Research has revealed a significant bias in the Medicaid program \ntoward reimbursing services provided in institutions over services \nprovided in home and community settings (75 percent of Medicaid funds \npay for services provided in institutions).\n  Long-term services and supports provided under the Medicaid program \nmust meet the evolving and changing needs and preferences of \nindividuals. No individual should be forced into an institution to \nreceive reimbursement for services that can be effectively and \nefficiently delivered in the home or community. Individuals must be \nempowered to exercise and real choice in selecting long term services \nand supports that meet their unique needs. Federal and State Medicaid \npolicies should facilitate and be responsive to and not impede an \nindividual's choice in selecting needed long-term services and \nsupports.\n  MiCASSA would eliminate the bias in Medicaid law toward institutional \ncare by providing that stats offer community attendant services and \nsupports as well as institutional care for eligible individuals in need \nof long term services and supports. The legislation also assists states \ndevelop and enhance comprehensive statewide system of long-term \nservices and supports that provide real consumer choice consistent with \nthe principle that service and supports should be provided in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to meeting the unique need of the \nindividual.\n  I look forward to building further bipartisan agreement on both \npieces of legislation. This is an exciting time for disability policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2275. A bill to amend the Mineral Leasing Act to prohibit the \nexportation of Alaska North Slope crude oil; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                     the oil supply improvement act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, gasoline prices have reached astronomical \nlevels. Nowhere has this price increase been more apparent than in \nCalifornia. For several years now, we have been experiencing gasoline \nprices well above what the rest of the nation has faced.\n  But now, this problem, which started on the West Coast, has moved \neast and is affecting everyone. On Monday, the Energy Information \nAdministration reported that the average price of gasoline in the \nUnited States was $1.52 per gallon--the tenth straight week gasoline \nprices have gone up. That price is\n\n[[Page S1609]]\n\n52 cents higher than the national average price just one year ago.\n  As I said, in California, the problem is even worse. The average \nprice for a gallon of gasoline is now $1.79--up 57 cents per gallon \nfrom this time last year.\n  These prices are all-time highs.\n  Mr. President, I believe that there are several steps that can be \ntaken to address this problem and to help American consumers. We should \nimpose a moratorium on major oil company mergers. We must have vigorous \nenforcement of the antitrust laws. We should increase the Corporate \nAverage Fuel Economy standard for SUVs and light trucks so that it \nequals the standard for cars. And, we should ban the exportation of \ncrude oil from Alaska's North Slope.\n  I want to talk about this last suggestion, because it is the subject \nof a bill I am introducing today, called the Oil Supply Improvement \nAct.\n  For 22 years--from 1973 to 1995--the export of Alaska North Slope oil \nwas banned. We banned it to reduce our dependence on imported oil and \nto keep gasoline prices down.\n  Unfortunately, at the behest of oil producers--and despite warnings \nof higher gasoline prices--the ban was lifted in 1995. Clearly, the \nfears of those of us who opposed lifting the ban have become reality. \nThe General Accounting Office has confirmed that lifting the export ban \nresulted in an increase in the price of crude oil by about $1 per \nbarrel.\n  In fact, some oil companies have used their ability to export this \noil to keep the price of gasoline on the West Coast artificially high. \nThe Federal Trade Commission makes this charge in its lawsuit to block \nthe merger of BP-Amoco and Arco. That suit also alludes to secret \ninternal company documents showing that there was price manipulation. \nAlaska North Slope oil was exported specifically to keep gasoline \nprices on the West Coast high.\n  Mr. President, I am not suggesting that this bill alone is the \ncomplete solution. It is only one piece of the puzzle, and only one of \nthe things that I am suggesting. But when we have an energy shortage in \nthis country, we should not be sending the oil in this country \nsomewhere else.\n  This is oil that is on public lands--and that is transported along a \nfederal right-of-way. Taxpayers own this product. In this time of an \nenergy shortage, it is time to put American consumers and industry \nfirst.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 2276. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to establish programs to recruit, retain, and retrain teachers, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n                     a million quality teachers act\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce A Million Quality \nTeachers Act. Thomas Jefferson once observed that of all the bills in \nthe federal code, ``by far the most important is that for the diffusion \nof knowledge among the people.'' ``No surer foundation,'' he said, \n``can be devised for the preservation of freedom and happiness.''\n  Unfortunately, our current foundation of elementary and secondary \neducation is grossly inadequate to enable American children of all \nincome levels and backgrounds to best realize the ``American dream'' \nand the economic freedoms that the ``American dream'' encapsulates.\n  Most companies dismiss the value of a high school diploma. Twelfth \ngrade students in the United States rank near the very bottom on \ninternational comparisons in math and science. The Third International \nMath and Science Study, the most comprehensive and rigorous comparison \nof quantitative skills across nations, reveals that the longer our \nstudents stay in the elementary and public school system, the worse \nthey perform on standardized tests.\n  High school graduates are twice as likely to be unemployed as college \ngraduates (3.9% vs. 1.9%). Moreover, the value of a college degree over \na high school degree is rising. In 1970, a college graduate made 136% \nmore than a high school graduate. Today it is 176%. Even more ominous \nare labor participation rates for high school graduates in an \ninformation economy. While labor force participation for adults is at \nan all time high in the American economy, this boom has masked a 10% \ndecline in participation rates for high school graduates since 1970 \nfrom 96.3% to 86.4%.\n  Our children cannot afford to be illiterate in mathematics and \nscience. The rapidly changing technology revolution demands skills and \nproficiency in mathematics, science, and technology. IT, perhaps the \nfastest growing sector of our economy, relies on more than basic high \nschool literacy in mathematics and science.\n  The Senate has begun to consider the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). As a member of the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I have worked \nhard to ensure that we change the current focus of our federal \neducation effort from a confusing, duplicative, categorical system that \nrelies on inputs to one that focuses on effectiveness and on increased \nstudent achievement as a result.\n  The bill that I introduce today is a good complement to the ESEA bill \nthat we will soon debate on the Senate floor. We have all heard about \nthe impending teacher shortage. The Department of Education estimates \nthat we will need over 2.2 million new teachers in the next decade to \nmeet enrollment increases and to offset the large number of baby boomer \nteachers who will soon be retiring. Additionally, although America has \nmany high-quality teachers already, we do not have enough, and with the \nimpending retirement of the baby boomer generation of teachers, we will \nneed even more.\n\n  the President and many Senate Democrats want to continue to devote \nsignificant resources to reducing class size, and the concept to hire \nmore teachers isn't a bad idea. Studies have shown that smaller class \nsize may improve learning under certain circumstances. But class size \nis only a small piece in the bigger puzzle to improve America's \neducation system, not the catapult that will launch us into education \nprosperity.\n  My bill takes the class size reduction money and redirects it to \nstrengthening and improving teacher quality. Tennessee's own William \nSanders, a professor at the University of Tennessee, has pioneered the \n``value-added'' system of measuring the effectiveness of a teacher. His \nresearch demonstrates that teacher quality has a greater effect on \nstudent performance than any other factor--including class size and \nstudent demographics. He goes on to say that, ``When kids have \nineffective teachers, they never recover.'' According to noted \neducation economist and researcher Eric Hanushek of the University of \nRochester, ``the difference between a good and a bad teacher can be a \nfull level of achievement in a single year.''\n  Unfortunately, there are too many teachers in America today who lack \nproper preparation in the subjects that they teach. My own state of \nTennessee actually does a good job of ensuring that teachers have at \nlest a major or minor in the subject that they teach--well enough to \nreceive a grade of A in that category on the recent Thomas Fordham \nFoundation report on teacher quality in the states. Even in Tennessee, \nhowever, 64.5% of teachers teaching physical science do not even have a \nminor in the subject. Among history teachers, nearly 50% did not major \nor minor in history. Many other states do worse.\n  Additionally, there is consensus that we are not attracting enough of \nthe best and the brightest to teaching, and not retaining enough of the \nbest of those that we attract. According to Harvard economist Richard \nMurnane, ``College graduates with high test scores are less likely to \nbecome teachers, licensed teachers with high test scores are less \nlikely to take jobs, employed teachers with high test scores are less \nlikely to stay, and former teachers with high test scores are less \nlikely to return.''\n  A Million Quality Teachers seeks to change that by recruiting, and \nhelping states recruit into the teaching profession top-quality \nstudents who have majored in academic subjects. We want teachers \nteaching math who have majored in and who love math. We want teachers \nteaching science who have majored in and who love science. This bill \nhelps draw those students into teaching for a few years at the very\n\n[[Page S1610]]\n\nleast, and studies have shown that new teachers are most effective in \nthe first couple of years of teaching. This bill would attract new \nstudents, and different kinds of students, into teaching by offering \nsignificant loan repayment.\n  While teachers are one of our nation's most critical professions, it \nis often very difficult to attract highly skilled and marketable \ncollege students and graduates because of a profound lack of \ncompetitive salaries and the burden of student loans. In addition to \nthe loan forgiveness and alternative certification stipends, the \nlegislation will allow states to use up to $1.3 billion originally \ndesignated in a lump sum to hire more teachers to instead allow the \nstates to use that money more creatively in programs to attract the \nkind of quality teachers they need but cannot afford. Using innovative \ntools already tested by many states, such as signing bonuses, loan \nforgiveness, payment of certification costs, and income tax credits, \nstates will be able to once again make teaching an attractive and \ncompetitive career for our brightest college graduates. Additionally, \nthe legislation does not limit states to these tools, but allows them \nto receive grants to continue testing other innovative and new programs \nfor the same purposes.\n\n  There are two parts to the bill:\n  Part I is a competitive grant program for States to enable them to \nrun their own innovative quality teacher recruitment, retention and \nretraining programs. Part II is a loan forgiveness and alternative \ncertification scholarship program to entice individuals with strong \nacademic backgrounds into teaching.\n  The State grant program will help States focus on recruitment, \nretention and retraining in the way that best serves the individual \nState. Some states may decide to offer a teacher signing bonus program \nlike the widely publicized and very successful program in \nMassachusetts. Other states may choose to institute teacher testing and \nmerit pay, or to award performance bonuses to outstanding teachers. The \nprogram is very flexible, yet the State must be accountable for \nimproving the quality of teachers in that State.\n  States who participate must submit a plan for how they intend to use \nfunds under the program and how they expect teacher quality to increase \nas a result, including the expected increase in the number of teachers \nwho majored in the academic subject in which they teach, and the number \nof teachers who received alternative certification, if the funds are \nused for recruitment activities. If the funds are used for retention or \nretraining, the State must focus on how the program will decrease \nteacher attrition and increase the effectiveness of existing teachers.\n  States must also report at the end of the three-year grant on how the \nprogram increased teacher quality and increased the number of teachers \nwith academic majors in the subjects in which they teach and the number \nof teachers that received alternative certification and/or how the \nprogram decreased teacher attrition and increased the effectiveness of \nexisting teachers.\n  The loan forgiveness provision is different than loan forgiveness \nalready in current law in that it targets a different population: \nstudents in college or graduate school today who are excelling in an \nacademic subject. The purpose is to attract students into teaching who \nmight not otherwise choose to pursue a teaching career and who are \nmajoring in an academic subject.\n  Any eligible student may take advantage of the loan forgiveness and \ndeferral. An eligible student has majored in a core academic subject \nwith at least a 3.0 GPA and has not been a fulltime teacher previously. \nLoan payments are deferred for as long as the student is obtaining \nalternative certification or teaching in a public school.\n  The federal government would actually forgive:\n  35% of all federally subsidized or guaranteed loans after the first \ntwo years that an eligible student teaches;\n  For the next two years, an additional 30% is forgiven;\n  After 6 years, an additional 20% is forgiven; and\n  After 8 years, the remaining 15% of the loan obligation is \neliminated.\n  The premise is that teaching is or will soon be like other \nprofessions where there is at least some degree of transience. In fact, \nrecent studies show that most new teachers leave within four years. But \nthese studies also show that new teachers are most effective in the \nfirst few years of teaching. This bill would attract new students, and \ndifferent kinds of students, into teaching by offering significant loan \nrepayment.\n  Alternative certification stipends will provide a seamless transition \nfor a student from school into teaching. The bill provides stipends to \nstudents who have received their academic degrees from a college or \nuniversity in order to obtain certification through alternative means. \nStudents who have received assistance under the loan forgiveness \nsection get first priority, but any student who has received a \nbachelors or advanced degree in a core academic subject with a GPA of \nat least 3.0 and who has never taught full-time in a public school is \neligible.\n  Students would receive the lesser of $5,000 or the costs of the \nalternative certification program, in exchange for agreeing to teach in \na public school for 2 years.\n  There is also a small amount of money available to the Department of \nEducation for the purposes of notifying eligible students of the loan \nforgiveness and alternative certification stipend programs and \ncontracting with outside groups of broaden public awareness of the \nprogram, including to advertise it in various media formats.\n  A Million Quality Teachers is a good complement to the Teacher \nEmpowerment Act contained in the ESEA proposal voted out of the HELP \nCommittee by a 10-8 vote. The Teacher Empowerment Act (TEA) directs \nfederal funds to local education agencies for professional development, \nrecruitment and class size reduction, while A Million Quality Teachers \ndirects federal funds to states for statewide initiatives like the very \nsuccessful Massachusetts teacher signing bonus program. A Million \nQuality Teachers also addresses the pressing need for more highly-\nqualified teachers in light of the teacher shortage by providing \nappropriate incentives to top students in order to entice them into the \nteaching profession.\n  The job of every new generation is to meet civilization's new \nproblems, improve its new opportunities, and explore its ever-expanding \nhorizons, creating dreams not just for themselves, but for all who come \nafter. Our job--the job of the current generation--is to help them do \njust that. Learning is the future. Education is the key. I think it's \ntime we embarked upon a national effort to bring up to a standard \ndemanded by the challenge, and improving teacher quality is the first \nstep. I hope that my colleagues will concur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url":
