Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1234, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1234) making appropriations for foreign \n     operations, export financing, and related programs for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the committee was provided an \nallocation virtually identical to last year's bill of $12.6 billion. \nAlthough it is $1.8 billion below the request, I think it effectively \nmanages our global responsibilities, and it does so within the budget \ncaps.\n  For the past few years, the bill has emphasized funding in two \nareas--export promotion and growth in the New Independent States of the \nformer Soviet Union. This bill sustains that commitment--in fact, \nexpands support for export promotion by $20 million for a total of $785 \nmillion to the Export-Import Bank.\n  This year, we have added recovery and reconstruction in Southeast \nEurope to our priority list.\n  While I expect the Europeans to bear the lion's share of \nresponsibility for reconstruction, we have concrete trade interests in \nregional economic recovery and security interests in promoting \nstability and democracy.\n  With funds straight lined, this becomes a zero sum game. We have to \nreach consensus on tradeoffs and priorities.\n  There is no question that this will mean reductions in other \naccounts--but it's time to recognize priorities. There are obvious and \neasy cuts that the administration can make. Just as one example, the \nadministration has asked for another $70 million for Haiti after \nspending billions in Haiti, with little to show for it. In fact, recent \npress accounts report an increase in drug trafficking through Haiti, \nand we have failed at every turn to restore a legitimate government.\n  This is just one example where I think the administration could cut \nback in order to serve more urgent priorities.\n  There are others. The request from the administration is redundant in \nthe area of peacekeeping. They have asked for funds for a global peace \nkeeping initiative, a regional Africa peacekeeping account and the \nAfrica Crisis Response Initiative which trains peacekeepers.\n\n[[Page S7836]]\n\n  I think we can and should shift priorities. We have just waged a war \nin Europe, and we need to build the foundation for sustaining the peace \nin the aftermath of that war.\n  The Balkans Initiative in this bill does three things to serve what I \nsee as our long term interests: It rids the region of Milosevic by \ndeclaring Serbia a terrorist state; we increase funding for stability \nand recovery; and we condition funds to Russia on total cooperation \nwith NATO in Kosovo.\n  Let me elaborate.\n  In section 525, the bill establishes Serbia's status as a terrorist \nnation. With this terrorist designation, the administration cannot \nprovide bilateral or support multilateral aid, and Belgrade is stripped \nof protections under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\n  This in turn, will allow Kosovars to take Milosevic to court for \ndamages rendered during his brutal war of ethnic annihilation.\n  The administration has complained that this designation is inflexible \nand unreasonable, that Serbia is not the same as the other countries on \nthe terrorism list because they don't sponsor groups such as Hezbollah.\n  Frankly, I am hard pressed to understand the difference between thugs \nblowing up a village with a car bomb or thugs shelling and burning a \nvillage to the ground.\n  The intent and the impact are the same. In both instances, innocent \ncivilians are the targets and the victims.\n  The second important change in the bill affects funding. We have \nincreased and changed the funding mix to fulfill two goals. We have \ntried to promote refugee confidence to return home, and relieve the \npressure on the front-line states.\n  The administration requested $393 million for Eastern and Central \nEurope which included $55 million for Serbia and $175 million for \nBosnia.\n  I have taken out Serbia's funds, cut back on Bosnia and added $142 \nmillion for a total of $535 million.\n  Of the total the bill earmarks $150 million for Kosovo, $85 million \nfor Albania, $60 million for Romania, $55 million for Macedonia, $45 \nmillion for Bulgaria, and $35 million for Montenegro, leaving $105 \nmillion unallocated for other regional uses.\n  We have also earmarked funds within the Kosovo account to promote \ninternal stability and confidence including the provision of $20 \nmillion to train and equip a Kosovo security force. Again, the \nadministration had complained bitterly about this provision on the \ngrounds that it arms the KLA at a time when the agreement is seeking to \ndismantle their capabilities.\n  There is nothing in the bill which calls for arming or supporting the \nKLA. In fact, the administration has plans to train and equip a police \nforce and has estimated that this will cost $25 million. The bill is \nnot consistent with the planning underway. It simply earmarks funds for \na security force which I view as essential to any Kosovar having \nconfidence the past will not be repeated.\n  Members of the KLA may very well be included in a security force, but \nthat is not a decision for us to make. A Kosovo civilian government \nshould make all decisions regarding recruitment standards, organization \nand supervision of internal security. Autonomy can not be preserved \nwithout security--that is just what this $20 million will launch.\n  In addition, to strengthen democracy, we have provided $20 million to \nsupport the development of local government institutions. This support \nshould help the Kosovars rebuild independent judicial, legislative, and \nexecutive branches of self-government, as well as help at the local \nmunicipal level.\n  The United States made a commitment at Rambouillet to support a three \nyear period of autonomy which would be followed by some kind of final \ndecision on political status. Specifically, the Secretary of State \npledged to support a referendum on independence if that is the course \nKosovars chose.\n  I think we all hope that a change of government in Belgrade might \nproduce conditions which would allow Kosovo to maintain some kind of \ntie with a democratic federation. In the interim, however, Kosovo must \ndevelop the capabilities and institutions to govern themselves, which I \nbelieve these funds will support.\n  Finally, the bill conditions future Russian aid on total cooperation \nwith NATO on peacekeeping. The administration seemed caught by surprise \nwhen Russian troops marched into and took up positions at the Pristina \nairport. Frankly, I was surprised that they did not take up positions \nalong the Belgrade-Pristina road. This move was calculated and \ninevitable--notwithstanding senior officials' attempts to explain it \nwas just a few rogue troops.\n\n  If stability is to be restored in Kosovo, the Russian's cannot be \nallowed to maintain a client relationship with Serbia which may lead to \nde facto partition of the country.\n  To prevent this outcome, we link Russian aid to the Secretary of \nState certifying that the Russians have not established a separate zone \nof operational control, and that their forces are completely integrated \nunder NATO command and control.\n  In the last few days, the Secretary of Defense seems to have worked \nout an arrangement that may secure these objectives. We all certainly \nhope so. But, just as the administration was surprised by the dash to \ncontrol the Pristina airport, they could be surprised by difficulties \nin implementing the agreement. We must maintain some leverage to assure \nthere is full compliance with the current expectations.\n  And, lest anyone doubt the relevance of this leverage, I suggest a \nreview of the vote to condition aid to Russia on a withdrawal timetable \nfrom the Baltics. This was a few years back. Every leader in the region \ncalled me after the 89-11 Senate vote to congratulate the Senate for \nsecuring immediate negotiations which produced the desired result.\n  In other words, what we did in the early nineties was to condition \nRussian aid on withdrawal of troops from the Baltic countries. Shortly \nafter we had that vote in the Senate, the Russian troops were out of \nthe Baltic countries.\n  Beyond, the Balkans, this bill maintains United States interests in \nthe New Independent States of the former Soviet Union and sustains our \nfinancial commitment to crucial allies ranging from Israel to \nIndonesia.\n  I also want to mention the increase in this bill's funding levels for \nthe surveillance and treatment of infectious diseases. A recent process \nreport noted that children and vulnerable populations are dying at a \nstaggering rate of treatable and often preventable diseases. Thanks to \nSenator Leahy's commitment, we are now in our third year of a multi-\nyear strategy to significantly increase the U.S. commitment to control \nand prevent infectious diseases.\n  Finally, let me say that there is no question we could have spent \nmore on foreign operations program. Senators Leahy and I have both \nexpressed strong support for increasing foreign assistance initiatives. \nHowever, working together, we have produced a bill which lives within \nthe budget caps. It is very similar to the bill we passed in the Senate \njust 1 year ago with an overwhelming bipartisan majority vote of 90-\n3. Senator Leahy and I certainly hope that will be the result again \nthis year.\n\n  Before passing the baton over to my friend and colleague from \nVermont, I thank him, at the beginning of what we think will be a \nrather short debate, for his leadership and cooperation in producing a \nbipartisan bill that went through the Appropriations Committee without \ndissent and we think has widely accommodated the interests of Members \nwho take a particular interest in this bill every year.\n  We anticipate very few amendments. I will say in advance what I hope \nto do is, sometime before noon, seek consent that all amendments be in \nby a reasonable time today--probably by noon --within an hour from now. \nWhat I hope we can do is ask for a consent agreement to have all \namendments filed before noon. There is every reason to believe this \nbill should be handled very quickly, and we hope we will have maximum \ncooperation from other Members of the Senate to do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Kentucky for \nhis comments, and as always, when working on this piece of legislation \nwith\n\n[[Page S7837]]\n\nhim, it has been a pleasure, notwithstanding the lack of allocations we \nhad.\n  I concur with the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky that we \nshould try to wrap this up at a time certain. I will join with him at \nthe appropriate time in a unanimous consent request that all amendments \nbe filed by noon today. The reason I mention that now is so that, on \nthis side of the aisle, people are alerted we will be making a request \nof that nature. I think it can be done.\n  With the agreement entered into last night by the distinguished \nmajority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader, there is an \neffort to move some of these bills forward so we can get on to the \nquestion of the Patients' Bill of Rights when we come back after the \nJuly 4 recess. I urge Senators who have amendments to come to the \nChamber and offer them.\n  This bill was reported by the Appropriations Committee with actually \nno debate and no amendments. One of the reasons, unfortunately, for the \nlack of any debate is the amount of funds in this bill is so far below \nwhat is needed to adequately fund our foreign policy priorities that \nthere is little point in debating it.\n  Even if Members want to make changes in the bill, there is no way to \npay for it. Everything in it is already underfunded. The bill is $800 \nmillion below the 1999 level. It is $1.9 billion below the President's \nrequest. No one can accuse the President of failing to try to protect \nthis country's global interests. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said \nfor the Congress. Devoting less than 1 percent of the Federal budget to \nour foreign policy is not responsible.\n  What this means is we are unable to meet our commitments--our solemn \ncommitments--to the international financial institutions. We did not \nprovide any funds for the President's expanded threat reduction \ninitiative, to dismantle Russian nuclear weapons, to protect fissile \nmaterial, and pay for other nonproliferation and security programs. We \nspent hundreds of billions of dollars--literally trillions of dollars--\nto defend against the threat of the then-Soviet Union.\n  We are unwilling to spend a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of 1 percent of \nthat same money now to dismantle some of those nuclear weapons and \nprotect the material from them--material that can fall into the hands \nof people who do not have the kind of controls that were imposed at the \ntime we were spending hundreds of billions of dollars to protect \nourselves. It goes beyond penny-wise and pound-foolish; it goes into \nirresponsibility, especially in a nuclear age. I, frankly, cannot \nunderstand how we have gotten to this point.\n  We had to cut funding for many of the programs of special interest to \nSenators, i.e., the Peace Corps. Is there any foreign policy program in \nthis country that we can point to with more pride than the Peace Corps? \nYet we cut that.\n  With additional funds, we could do a great deal more to promote \nAmerican exports in extremely competitive foreign markets. Other \ncountries that do not begin to have the ability to export as we do are \nspending more money in trying to build up their foreign markets because \nthey know that will create jobs, good-paying jobs, in their country. We \nstep back and say we do not want to do this.\n  We can improve global health at a time when infectious diseases are \nour greatest threat after nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. \nThere is no major infectious disease that is more than one or two plane \nrides away from our shores. And this isn't a case where we are showing \nsome great humanitarian gesture to try to stop infectious disease in \nother continents; it protects us. Not only does it protect the people \nthere, but ebola plague, a resistant strain of tuberculosis, and any \nother number of things can begin in one country and within hours be in \na major airport in our country and then in our population. When it gets \nhere, we will spend fortunes trying to get rid of it. We will not spend \npennies in trying to stop it in the first place.\n  We should be doing more to protect the Earth's natural resources. \nThey are under siege on every continent. Our health and our economy \ndepend on a clean environment. Yet we spend a pittance as we see the \nenvironment continue to degrade, almost as though we think as Americans \nwe can look at the borders of our great country and assume that we \ndetermine the environment for our people just within those borders.\n  The environment is determined by the rain forests of the world, by \nthe ``desertization'' of large parts of the world, by chemical and \nother dumping in our oceans in other parts of the world. If we want to \nprotect us--a quarter of a billion Americans--we ought to be concerned \nabout what happens in other parts of the world.\n  Half the world is asking for help in building new democratic \nsocieties, but we have little to offer. For decades, again, we spent \nhundreds of billions of dollars--trillions of dollars--saying we were \ngoing to stand up for democracy, we were going to stand up against \ncommunism; we wanted democracy in the world.\n  Well, the Berlin Wall has come down. The Iron Curtain has rusted \nthrough. These countries are saying: Thank God America is there; they \ncan help us form our democracy. And we say: When we thought you would \nbe Communists, we could spend billions and billions and billions of \ndollars to contain you, but now that you want to be democratic, we \ndon't really have even a tiny fraction of that amount to help you \nbecome democratic, to help you develop courts and a free press and a \ncivil system, and on and on.\n\n  We should double or triple our support for international \npeacekeeping, especially in places such as Sierra Leone where NATO \ncannot intervene but the atrocities are far worse. Daily we see it in \nKosovo. We almost have this thought that if we do not turn on CNN and \nsee atrocities, they are not occurring. I suggest that Senators read \nthe Intelligence Digest, read the free press, when they do report them \nand think of these atrocities that we could help stop.\n  If we do not do anything in these areas, all the areas I have talked \nabout, because we save some pennies today by not doing anything in \nthese areas, we are saddling future generations of Americans with far \ngreater costs, and as we go into the next century, we saddle future \nAmericans with a more dangerous and unstable world, a world that is \nincreasingly polarized between the very rich and the extraordinarily \npoor.\n  I have little doubt that the President would veto a foreign \noperations bill at this level.\n  Having said all that, Senator McConnell and I did the best we could \nwith the allocation we received. We have tried to allocate the funds we \nhad in the most responsible way possible.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Kentucky for the bipartisan way he \nworked with me to put this bill together. It has become a tradition of \nthe Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Vermont to work together \non these issues. I am grateful to him. I think what he has done serves \nthe Senate well. I think it serves the American people well.\n  Obviously, if I were in Senator McConnell's position, I might have \ndone some things differently, just as he would look at some of the \nthings I have asked to be put in this bill and are included and do them \ndifferently. But on the whole, we have worked together to write a \nbalanced piece of legislation. In fact, the funds are so tight, the \nbalance is so delicate, I cannot imagine how I might accept any \namendments, Democrat or Republican, to cut or add funds in this bill. \nThis is a Rubik's cube, a small Rubik's cube but a Rubik's cube \nnonetheless, we have tried to put together.\n  I think we Senators should thank the chairman and the ranking member \nof the full committee, the senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, who did their best to \ngive us a fair allocation within the limits they had to work with.\n  But if I might, before I yield the floor, mention a couple issues I \nam especially concerned about. One is the Global Environment Facility. \nIt is one of the world's leading international environmental \norganizations. It funds projects to protect biodiversity, to prevent \nocean pollution, to protect the ozone, and to prevent climate change.\n  Take a poll of the American people. Ask them how many are in favor of \njust those items. A resounding majority of the American people would be \nin\n\n[[Page S7838]]\n\nfavor of protecting biodiversity, preventing ocean pollution, \nprotecting the ozone, preventing climate change. For this endeavor, the \nadministration requested $143 million for fiscal year 2000. That \nincludes $35 million we owe already in prior year arrears. This bill \ncontains just $25 million for arrears, and that is not acceptable.\n  Ask the American people if they have a justifiable concern about \nterrorism, and they will say yes. Those of us, the chairman and myself, \nwho have access to the most current intelligence of our intelligence \nagencies know that the fear of terrorism is justifiable. The President \nrequested $33 million for antiterrorism training programs. Under our \nallocation, we could only provide him $20 million. The request also \nincluded $10 million for a new antiterrorism program to help developing \ncountries strengthen their border control systems--again, because the \nterrorism that may show up in those developing countries is a plane \nride away from our shores. Even though the President's antiterrorism \ninitiative is a good one, we cannot include any funds for it. Not that \nwe don't want to fund these programs; the money is not there to do it.\n\n  There are a lot of other programs I could mention that need \nadditional funds. Hopefully, before this session is over, we may get a \nrevised allocation that will allow us to go into some of these areas. \nBut right now I think we should act on the bill to move the process \nforward.\n  Again, I salute the chairman and ranking member of the full \ncommittee, the distinguished Senators from Alaska and West Virginia, \nfor pushing so hard to go forward. The fact that the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Kentucky and I have the working relationship we do, \nI think, helped us move forward with this. We should go forward with \nthe process. Hopefully the other body will start moving on theirs. I \nthink we could complete action on this bill in a very few hours. \nSenators who have amendments should not delay to offer them.\n  As I said earlier, to preserve the delicate balance of this bill, I \nexpect to be opposing amendments that do not have suitable offsets.\n  With that, I yield the floor. The Senator from Kentucky and I are now \nthe humble servants of the Senate, ready to start the sausage grinder \nforward. Hopefully, we can end up with a product very quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my good friend from Vermont for his \ncooperation in developing this bill on a bipartisan basis. I agree with \nhim that without the allocation that Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd \nprovided for us, we couldn't have even done this well. I do think that \neven with this, some would argue inadequate allocation, we can meet our \nresponsibilities around the globe. I believe we have done that in this \nbill.\n  Now the Senator from Kansas is here and has an important amendment to \nbe offered.\n  Let me just mention to all Members of the Senate, Senator Leahy and \nI, at about 10:30, are going to propound a unanimous consent request \nasking that all amendments to this bill be submitted by noon, which we \nthink will help the Senate dispose of this measure in a timely fashion.\n  Mr. President, seeing the Senator from Kansas here, who has an \namendment to offer, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1118\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to target \n assistance to support the economic and political independence of the \n           countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, the Senator from \nKentucky and the Senator from Vermont, for allowing me to bring forward \nthis amendment. At this time, I rise to offer an amendment to the \nForeign Operations Appropriations Act, and I send the amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1118.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1119 To Amendment No. 1118\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the amendment to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration, on behalf of myself \nand Senator Abraham of Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself and \n     Mr. Abraham, proposes an amendment numbered 1119 to amendment \n     No. 1118.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On Page 9, line 3, strike all after ``(c) Restriction \n     through line 12 States.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address the underlying \nsecond-degree amendment and to talk about the overall amendment itself \nand the area of the world with which we are dealing.\n  This amendment is an issue that has been heard in front of the \nForeign Affairs Committee, both this Congress and last, and has passed \nthis time by a voice vote of the Foreign Affairs Committee. It passed \nby a majority vote in the last Congress. It deals with an important \nregion of the world, and it deals with a difficult policy issue for the \nSenate and for our Government to consider.\n  The underlying bill itself is called the Silk Roads Strategy Act. It \ndeals with eight countries, and it provides an overarching policy \ntowards these countries in the south Caucasus and central Asia. \nSpecifically the countries are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan, \nKyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\n  I realize those are not common names of countries that people across \nthe United States perhaps banter around, but I think they do know and \nrecall with some knowledge the Silk Road, the old Silk Road made \nlegendary many years ago, discovered and traversed by Marco Polo and \nmany others who traveled throughout the region of central Asia.\n  It was really at that point in time the bridge; the Eurasian bridge \nwas developed and brought commerce from Asia to Europe and from Europe \nto Asia. We are seeking to reinitiate this Silk Road, a new Silk Road \nthat would have an economic corridor along with a freedom corridor in \ncentral Asia and the south Caucasus.\n  You can see this region of the world. I wish this map were a little \nclearer. I hope Members can see where this region of the world is \ncaught. These are all countries in the former Soviet Union. They are in \nthe south of the former Soviet Union; they are recently independent \nnations. They had some independence before, but these are just recently \ncoming out from underneath the rubble of the fall of the Soviet empire.\n  They are caught between world global forces that seek to have them \nunder their control. The Russians continue the desire to have an \nunusual influence, would be the best way to put it. The Iranians sit \nright here and seek to have a greater influence in the region. They \nseek to dominate most of these nations that have a Muslim-based \npopulation. They seek, the Iranians, to radicalize and put governments \nin place that are militant fundamentalist governments. China then, off \nto this side of the region--what we are seeking to do is to create an \narea of democracy, an area of free enterprise, an area of independence \nfree from these world powers that seek to dominate them, in a group of \nnations that seek to be united with the West, again, in a Eurasian \ncorridor of commerce and freedom. That is the new Silk Road Strategy \nAct. That is what this bill is about.\n  Lest we forget and just look at it as a geographic area, as important \nas this region is, I hope we will look at the people in this region. We \nare talking about nearly 72 million people involved in these countries \nof the Silk Road. You can look at them: the Armenian\n\n[[Page S7839]]\n\npopulation of 3.4 million; the Azeri population of 7.8 million; on \ndown, Uzbekistan being the biggest with over 23 million people yearning \nto be free, yearning to be associated with the West, yearning not to go \nback under Russian dominance or to be put under Iranian dominance or \nChinese dominance, but yearning to be free and associated with the \nWest. That is what this bill is about.\n  This is a sanctions lifting bill. It lifts a particular sanction, \nsanction section 907 that has a set of provisions limiting any sort of \nassistance, any sort of work of the United States with Azerbaijan, \nwhich is also a key country for this corridor, and it doesn't lift the \nsanctions. It merely provides a national interest waiver. So this \ndoesn't lift it. The President still has to say it is in the national \ninterest of the United States to waive this sanction, and then he has \nthe authority.\n  So it simply provides that authority to the administration, which is \nin line with the Freedom Support Act, which we originally passed to \nsupport these newly independent countries that came about from the \nSoviet empire falling. This act authorizes assistance for all these \ncountries, specific economic assistance, development of infrastructure \nassistance, border control assistance, as well as assistance in \nstrengthening democracy, tolerance in the development of civil society.\n  Authority in this bill to provide assistance for these countries of \nthe south Caucasus and central Asia is in addition to the authority to \nprovide such assistance under the Freedom Support Act, but it does not \nprovide any new resources. It simply allows us to offer these resources \nand assistance to these countries bilaterally and multilaterally. We \ncan provide assistance programs to the entire region, working it in a \npackage and saying to these countries: You are better off if you will \nwork together and bond together to be able to stand before the forces \nthat are seeking to dominate you once again.\n  Mr. President, I think the window of opportunity for the United \nStates to effect positive change in this region will only be open for a \nshort period of time. I think that is the very critical part of this \nbill and why we need to have this debate and pass this issue now.\n  The window is short. I want to show you some of the activity that is \ntaking place in this region. I mentioned the militant fundamentalists' \nefforts taking place to seek domination of most of these countries that \nhave a Muslim-based population.\n  This is a chart of Iranian worldwide export of terrorism and \nfundamentalism that we are putting up here. I want to highlight this \nregion that we are talking about. Of the eight countries we are talking \nabout, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan \nhave Iranians operating in this region. Afghanistan is operating here, \nseeking to put these countries under militant fundamentalist control. \nThey are doing this today.\n  As recently as 2 months ago, the President of Uzbekistan had an \nassassination attempt that was put forward by militant fundamentalists \nwho seek to have him removed. He provides mostly a secular Muslim \ngovernment. They said we want him out and we want a militant \nfundamentalist government in here, and we are going to do what we can, \nincluding trying to assassinate him. They are trying to destabilize the \nFergana Valley in this area. My point is, look at this map. It looks \nsimilar to the map I just put up here, the countries of the Silk Road. \nThe Iranians are funding this effort. They are going into the camps \nhere and funding the populations in this area. They are doing this \ntoday. Members can check this. This is happening.\n  If we want to let these countries slip off and go into the militant \nfundamentalist camps so we have more places to fight terrorism and more \ncountries we have to fight against that are willing to spawn hatred \nagainst the West, let's fail this bill, and with all due respect to the \nSenator from Kentucky, let's pass his amendment. We have a disagreement \nabout this particular amendment, section 907. I think it is critical \nand important that we pass and eliminate this bilateral sanction that \nwe have against Azerbaijan, which is much of the gateway for the flow \nof democracy and freedom throughout this region. Time is of the \nessence.\n  In my view, the single best way to consolidate our goals in the \nregion is to promote regional cooperation and policies that will \nstrengthen the sovereignty of each nation. Each of these countries has \nits own individual needs. However, many of the problems in the region \noverlap and are shared, and a number of common solutions and approaches \ncan apply. That is why we have put together this overarching Silk Road \nstrategy. This region has generally taken a back seat to U.S. foreign \npolicy. We have generally deferred to Russia and to Iranian policy and \nsaid we are going to let these drift along. The problem with the drift \nis that people are going to feel the power vacuum. It is being fueled \nby the Iranians and pushed by the Russians and other outside influences \nthat don't seek for them to have their freedom.\n  We have eight countries, as I noted earlier, most of which have \nsecular Muslim governments, that are fighting to stave off the Iranian-\nstyle Islamic extremism, which are looking westward, and at great risk \nto themselves, they have considerable economic ties with the West--and \nI want to note as well, with Israel.\n  Many of these countries in this region have historic and ancient \nJewish populations existing there as well; living, surviving, thriving, \nbut if you put in these anti-Western militant fundamentalist, those \npopulations, Jewish populations are going to be run out and these \ncountries are not going to be having good relationships with Israel.\n  These countries are recovering from 70 years of Soviet domination. \nThey need our help in all spheres, including human rights. No one is \nsuggesting that these are Jeffersonian democracies yet. There is a lot \nof pessimistic talk about the prospects for democracy in this region. \nAll of these countries have human rights violations.\n\n  At any given point in time, some of the human rights violations may \nseem worse than others. Here is our choice. Do we engage and try to \nmake what difference we can? Or do we ignore and let the region drift \nwithout us, becoming either violently anti-Western, anti-American, or \nbecome, once again, an extension of Russia, China, or Iran? It is a \npretty clear, simple choice. They seek our support.\n  Now, on the point of human rights--because I think a lot of people \nwill say there are human rights violations in this region and we really \nought to watch out for that and we should not support these areas. \nAgain, I point out that this is a waiver authority to the President. He \nstill has to certify and it will have the same standards as other human \nrights issues. Recently, we had the Israeli Minister for Trade and \nIndustry, Natan Sharansky, a well-known international figure on human \nrights, here in Washington, together with the Foreign Minister of \nUzbekistan. Mr. Sharansky's reason for being here was to make one \npoint, which I thank him for making.\n  He said:\n\n       Look at the human rights situation and weigh this against \n     the importance of the threat that is facing us. It is very \n     important to engage and continue to encourage a positive \n     process and the way to do this is to strengthen the role we \n     are playing in the region.\n\n  He supported and endorsed this Silk Road Strategy Act in the region.\n  I want to look particularly at the second-degree amendment that my \ncolleague from Kentucky put forward. I have immense respect for the \nchairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. He did excellent work \non the overall bill, but we have a difference of opinion on section \n907. I want to go specifically at this issue.\n  My overall amendment would provide a Silk Road Strategy Act for the \nentire region, providing a waiver authority in section 907. The second-\ndegree amendment leaves the rest of the language but does not provide \nthe national interest waiver on section 907. That is a key part of this \nbill, and that is why I oppose the second-degree amendment of my good \ncolleague from Kentucky and my colleague from Michigan, Senator \nAbraham, as well. We have a dispute on this. I want to go right at that \nissue of section 907.\n  With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Congress, in the fall of \n1992, adopted the Freedom Support Act. This was designed to provide \nfinancial and technical assistance to the newly independent states, \nthose of the former Soviet Union. I want to put that map\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\nback up here, if we could, so people can have that in mind. It was to \naid them on a path toward democratic and market reforms. Because of the \nthen ongoing conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the enclave \nNagorno-Karabakh, Armenian supporters were successful in including \nlanguage in section 907 singling out Azerbaijan--the only former Soviet \nrepublic so treated--for sanctions. I will put up here a map of that \nregion so you can see specifically what this area looks like. This is \nthe Armenia and Azerbaijan area and the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which \nwas in dispute, and this was in 1992, mid-1993, and late 1993.\n  In 1992, at that point in time, we passed the Freedom Support Act and \nArmenian supporters got narrow, bilateral sanctions against Azerbaijan \nput in place, saying we think Azerbaijan is treating Armenia wrong, \nblockading it. Therefore, we want section 907, which removes the United \nStates from providing any assistance to Azerbaijan. Bilateral \nsanctions, some of which have been lifted--the chairman of the \ncommittee has lifted portions of these, but not all have been lifted. \nWe provide waiver authority for the lifting of these bilateral \nsanctions. That was 1992. The only former Soviet republic so treated \nwas Azerbaijan. The 907 sanction prohibited the ability of the U.S. \nGovernment to provide direct bilateral assistance to Azerbaijan until \nthe President determined that demonstrable steps had been taken in \nceasing hostilities and lifting the embargo against Armenia. A cease-\nfire has been in place for the past 7 years since that time period.\n  Peace negotiations under the auspices of the OSCE group are ongoing.\n  To me, it makes no sense whatsoever to continue these 907 sanctions. \nProponents of retaining 907 argue that the restrictions should remain \nin place until the Azerbaijan embargo against Armenia is lifted. In \npoint of fact, however, it is Armenia's ongoing occupation of Nagorno-\nKarabakh and the surrounding territory. Armenia currently occupies \nabout 20 percent of Azerbaijan in violation of international law. Both \nthe OSCE and the U.N. have condemned this occupation.\n  This is the region on the map they are occupying against the OSCE and \nU.N. ruling. They both have said this is an international law \nviolation, that Armenia is occupying 20 percent of Azerbaijan. This \nfunctionally prevents the opening of the borders between the two \ncountries.\n  In an attempt to end the stalemate, the OSCE advanced a proposal \ncalling for Armenia to withdraw from the occupied land in exchange for \nthe reciprocal opening of rail and pipeline facilities by Azerbaijan. \nAzerbaijan has accepted the proposal. Armenia has rejected it. This \nwould be pulling back from a 20 percent of lands, and then opening up \nthe rail and pipe corridors. Azerbaijan accepted it. Armenia has not.\n  The imposition of 907, I think, was a bad idea in 1993. It was \nadopted over the strong objections of the Bush administration, and its \nrepeal is strongly supported by the Clinton administration.\n  For the United States to continue unilateral imposition of sanctions \nagainst Azerbaijan--that is what we have--does not make sense from \neither a geostrategic-political point of view or an economic point of \nview.\n  This is much of the corridor for the Eurasian bridge that is going \nthrough Azerbaijan.\n  The energy potential of the Caspian is one facet of Azerbaijan's \nstrategic significance to the West. The broader issue of the timing and \ndevelopment of the Iranian transit corridor and the sovereignty of the \nindividual republics of the South Caucasus is also at stake.\n  This provision--I might note, as well, the Silk Road strategy--is \nstrongly supported by all the countries in the region outside of the \nArmenians. I think it would be a great benefit to Armenia as well.\n  Continuing 907 is an impediment to the improved truce between the \nUnited States and Azerbaijan and the entire region. It undermines the \nability of American companies to secure their substantial investments \nin the region, and prevents the U.S. Government from being a truly \nhonest broker in the peace negotiations.\n  Repealing of section 907 would allow for commercial and technical \nassistance to aid in the development of infrastructure, trade, pipeline \nprojects, and to further development of democracy so they don't fall \ninto the hands of the Iranians or the Russians.\n  Further, with the ongoing political turmoil in Moscow, removal of 907 \nwould allow Azerbaijan to participate in a partnership for peace and \nbroader security programs, as well as market reform and democracy-\nbuilding initiatives necessary to promote political stability in this \npotentially volatile region.\n  Some may suggest this is not the time to do this on 907. I don't know \nof a better time other than 907 having not been put on in the first \nplace. It doesn't lift the sanction. It provides a waiver authority for \nthe President to do it.\n  Some may say, well, this is at a particularly susceptible time in the \npeace process. I don't think that is accurate. The last real peace \ninitiative was in 1997, calling for Armenia's withdrawal from the \noccupied territories in exchange for normalization of trade with \nAzerbaijan. This was rejected by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.\n  Unlike other provisions of the Freedom Assistant Act, I want to point \nout that section 907 does not provide for a national interest waiver. \nWhat we are doing here is making section 907 be in line with the rest \nof the Freedom Assistance Act in providing a national interest waiver.\n\n  The final point I want to make before yielding the floor for a \ndiscussion is, again, I point out my deep respect for my colleagues \nfrom Kentucky and Michigan who are opposed to the overall national \ninterest waiver on section 907. We just have a differing point of view \non this.\n  But the issue is, we are talking about a region of the world--a \nEurasian corridor--that has had historical roots in the old Silk Road. \nThey know how to relate with one another, and they are in a tough \nneighborhood. They have the Russians bearing down on them with undue \neconomic and other influence, and the President of Georgia has had \nseveral assassination attempts where the assassin fled to Russia.\n  Georgia wants this bill very much. They have undue influence from the \nIranians, who are providing aid to many of these terrorist groups \noperating in the region and fomenting discontent because they know they \nare inherently weak at this time. The Chinese have a certain amount of \ninfluence, but it is really between the Russians and the Iranians. And \nthey seek to be connected with us.\n  If you pull 907 out of this and its interest waiver, and you say, OK, \nwe are going to do everything but 907, as the amendment provides, you \nblock this part of the key corridor of providing economic trade, \ndevelopmental assistance, and, through much of the region, its commerce \nand its activity will flow through Baku and Azerbaijan. This is a \ncritical part of it. That is why, with all due respect, I oppose the \nsecond-degree amendment, ask my colleagues to vote against that and to \nsupport the underlying amendment without amendment, and pass this \ncritical issue that we really need for U.S. foreign policy.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  I thank the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                          Filing of Amendments\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this has been cleared on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all first-degree amendments to be \noffered to the pending appropriations bill must be filed at the desk by \n1 p.m. today, and, of course, other than the managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to commend my friend and \ncolleague from Kansas, first of all, for taking an interest in a part \nof the world that very few Members of Congress probably can find on a \nmap. I share his view that this is an extraordinarily important part of \nthe world.\n  As the Senator from Kansas pointed out, all of these countries are \npart of what used to be the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union very early \non, in the wake of the end of the cold war, said: This is our ``near \nabroad,'' sort of their version of the Monroe Doctrine, their\n\n[[Page S7841]]\n\nterritory, and we were not thereby expected by them to be in that area. \nNevertheless, the Russians don't make foreign policy for the United \nStates. And we are in the process of trying to develop our own strong \nbilateral relations with each of those countries.\n  The Senator from Kansas has been in the forefront of advocating the \nimportance of the United States having its own bilateral relations with \neach of those countries. I commend him for it because he has been very \nfarsighted in understanding the significance of this part of the world \nto the United States.\n  I think all other aspects of the Silk Road proposal are good. Where \nwe differ, as the Senator from Kansas indicated, is on that portion of \nthe Silk Road called the ``repeal of section 907.''\n  Reasonable people can look at this and reach different conclusions. \nWhat the Senator from Kansas would like to see--I am perfectly \nconfident in what I would like to see--is a settlement of this dispute \nbetween Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n  For our colleagues who have not paid a whole lot of attention to this \npart of the world, Nagorno-Karabakh is an almost entirely Armenian \nenclave, as the Senator from Kansas pointed out, within the territory \nof Azerbaijan connected by an area called the Lachin corridor. It is \nthis area which is in dispute.\n  As the Senator from Kansas pointed out, Armenia won the conflict that \noccurred with the breakup of the Soviet Union, and it occupies not only \nNagorno-Karabakh but the other territory adjacent thereto, which is \nAzeri.\n  The sad aftermath of that war is large refugee camps, which I \nvisited, and the Senator from Kansas visited as well, of displaced \npeople stuck in these refugee camps now for some 6 years, with the \nhopelessness and despair that develops in that atmosphere, reminiscent \nof an entire generation of Palestinians who have grown up in these \ncamps in the Middle East. It breeds a fanaticism, a terrorism, that is \nan enormous unsettling aspect of life in that part of the world. \nNothing could be better for that area than getting that dispute \nsettled. I am sure the Senator from Kansas and I agree on that.\n\n  The question is, How do you best get there? The Senator from Kansas \nmentioned the Minsk Group. I am not very optimistic that the Minsk \nGroup is going to bring about a settlement. The Minsk Group, in \naddition to including Azerbaijan and Armenia, includes Russia, France, \nand the United States. I think the Senator from Kansas and I probably \nagree that the Russians like things the way they are around there. \nThere are Russian troops in all of those republics still, with the \nexception of Azerbaijan. Some are there by invitation, some are not by \ninvitation. I think the Russians enjoy keeping the Caucasus \ndestabilized, with all due respect to our occasional friends, the \nRussians. The French, who most of the time are our allies, I think \nfrequently are difficult in these negotiating situations.\n  These are the players: The French, the Russians, the Americans, the \nArmenians, and Azeris. Nothing has happened, and I am not optimistic \nsomething will happen until the United States thinks this is important.\n  Think of the money, time, and effort we have spent in the Balkans \nover the last 3 or 4 years. I happen to be in the minority in our party \nwho think we have a national interest in the Balkans. I wish we had the \ninterest in the Caucasus that we had in the Balkans, because we might \nhave settled the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. We have not \nhad that, and nothing has happened.\n  The question before the Senate is, What kind of condition makes peace \nmore or less likely to occur? Reasonable people can look at the same \nset of facts and reach a different conclusion.\n  The Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, and I have offered this \nsecond-degree amendment because we believe that section 907 --even \nthough it has been constantly stripped down--is important to give the \nAzeris some incentive for ultimate settlement. It is the view of the \nSenator from Kentucky that the lifting of 907 ought to be part of the \nfinal settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. To give it away in \nadvance of final settlement makes final settlement less likely.\n  I completely respect the observations of the Senator from Kansas. As \nI said, reasonable people can differ about this. I think removing the \nlast element of leverage in advance of the final settlement is not a \nstep in the right direction.\n  We will have at some point today--although no time agreement can be \nentered at this point--a decision on this. I hope my colleagues will \nconsider whether or not lifting this sanction in advance of a final \nsettlement of the dispute is helpful in achieving a final settlement of \nthe dispute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I lend my support to this amendment. I \nrealize the chairman and ranking member have a number of other issues \nthey want to discuss. I am not sure at what point we will reconvene on \nthis second-degree amendment.\n  I clearly associate myself with the Senator from Kentucky, both as a \ncosponsor of the amendment as well as with his comments today. I share \nhis view that the appropriate role for the United States at this point \nis not to decide this matter by taking this action--which I think would \nbe premature; I think there still remain serious issues in play that \nwould argue against changing the status of section 907 at this point. \nMy view is that we should move forward with the balance of this \namendment.\n  I, too, applaud the Senator from Kansas, who I think has done great \nwork in this area. I fully support his efforts as well as the \ncontribution he makes by raising the section 907 issue. Hopefully, it \nputs all of our policymakers in the United States more in focus on the \nissues.\n  If we are to include the Silk Road Act or a major portion of it in \nthis legislation, it should be included without inclusion of section \n907. I am willing to speak on this at a later point if we extend the \ndebate.\n  I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Kentucky, and I look \nforward to working with him, as well as the Senator from Kansas, in \nhopefully resolving this.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I hope we can get a time agreement so \nwe know when we will actually vote on this particular issue.\n  Reasonable people may differ, and will differ, on what the U.S. \npolicy should be. Azerbaijan--section 907--is the only country from the \nformer Soviet Union that we have unilateral sanctions against.\n  We are not lifting those sanctions by this amendment. We are allowing \na national interest waiver to the President which is the same as the \nrest of the Freedom Support Act. In that sense, we will put \nAzerbaijan--which is at the gateway to much of the Eurasian platform as \nfar as connecting the countries together--on an equal footing with all \nof the countries that came from the rubble of the former Soviet Union.\n  We seek peace in this region. It is important that we have a \nsettlement in this region. This particular set of unilateral sanctions \non Azerbaijan has been the United States policy since 1992. It has not \nled to peace since 1992.\n  We are seeking to create an abundance of activity, on a multilateral \nbasis, of all the countries in the region, causing them to work \ntogether, to lift each other up economically, democratically, and \nregarding human rights, as an area, an entire region, that is \ndeveloping on those principles of a free democracy--free, independent \nstatus, and human rights.\n  To pull this one out--it is a key corridor--the concept of the \ncountries working together falls apart. It will not happen. It will not \nhappen if we do that. That has been the U.S. policy since 1992. It has \nnot led to peace yet between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I don't think it \nwill now. If we get these countries to work together, to say, together \nwe can support each other, we can grow economically in other ways, I \nthink we create the atmosphere for peace to take place. Everybody has \nan interest in peace occurring.\n  We are talking about a large set of resources in this area. They do \nhave the economic wherewithal to be able to grow and grow together. But \nwe have to have them all. You can't pull one of them out and say it \nwill not happen.\n  I think the proposal I put forward leads to peace and peaceful \nopportunities in the region. That is why I support it. I am happy to \ntalk further\n\n[[Page S7842]]\n\nabout this at a later date if we get a time agreement. With all due \nrespect, I disagree with my colleagues from Kentucky and Michigan. I \nthink we have the national interest waiver on section 907.\n  At the proper time, I will want a recorded vote on this so we can \nhave a determination by this body of U.S. policy here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Anne Alexander, a \nfellow in the office of Senator Feingold, be granted the privilege of \nthe floor during consideration of S. 1233.\n  I further ask unanimous consent Natalia Feduschak, an American \nPolitical Science Federation fellow in the office of Senator Frank \nLautenberg, be granted such floor privilege during debate and votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, again I remind Senators we have a unanimous \nconsent agreement entered into by the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky to have all amendments in by 1 o'clock today. I urge him to do \nthat. I had hoped we could wrap this bill up at a relatively early \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from Kentucky, \nwhat is his desire at this time on this particular amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Kansas, we are unable to get a \ntime agreement on this amendment at this time. It is my intention to \nlay it aside and deal with some other matters. We will keep working on \nit during the course of the day.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is certainly acceptable to me. I suggest to the \nSenator from Kentucky, the manager of the bill, I have a second \namendment dealing with the Sudan I am hopeful we can get worked out at \nsome point in time, rather than calling it up. But if we cannot, I will \nseek recognition on that as well later on.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Kansas, I am familiar with his \nother amendment. It is acceptable to me. If he will keep working on \nthat, I think we should be able to get it cleared in the course of the \nday.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, while we are waiting for other Senators \nto come up with amendments, I want to draw attention to an amendment I \nintend to offer if it is not accepted overall. It is an amendment \nentitled ``Humanitarian Assistance for the Sudanese Opposition \nGroups.''\n  This is a very simple amendment that would allow us to give food aid \nto the southern Sudanese resistance and also the northern Sudanese \nresistance efforts, food aid only. This is not other forms of aid. It \nis certainly not military aid. But it is food aid to the Sudanese \nresistance movement.\n  The language says, and I will provide the amendment:\n\n       The President is authorized to provide humanitarian \n     assistance, including food, to the National Democratic \n     Alliance [That is an overall alliance of the groups in \n     opposition to the government in Khartoum] and the Sudanese \n     People's Liberation Movement, operating outside of the \n     Operation Lifeline Sudan structure.\n\n  That is the simple amendment we put forward.\n  I recently led a congressional delegation. Congressman Don Payne from \nNew Jersey, Congressman Tom Tancredo from Colorado, and I went to Sudan \nand traveled to southern Sudan and met with the embattled groups that \nhave been fighting against the Khartoum government, which is a \ngovernment that was not freely elected. They stood for election in \n1988. They were defeated, got about 18 percent of the vote, and then \ntook over the government in a coup in 1989 and have since then been \noperating a terrorist regime in Sudan. It is terrorist internally in \nSudan and terrorist externally from Sudan.\n  They have killed, according to the IS Committee on Refugees, \ninternally in Sudan, in the last 10 years, 1.9 million people in a \ngenocide and ethnic cleansing the likes of which the world has not seen \nin recent times. This is the worst humanitarian situation in the world. \nThat is according to the director of USAID, Mr. Atwood, who testified \non the issue, on the Sudan--the worst in the world--nearly 2 million \nkilled, over 4 million internally displaced. That is the internal \nterrorism of this government.\n  This is a government--and this is incredible--that actually allows \nslavery to exist. That is documented. The Baltimore Sun did a series of \narticles documenting this. Christian Solidarity International has \nbought back the freedom of over 6,000 slaves of northern people \nempowered by the Government to go south, kill the men in the village, \ntake the women and children hostages, and make them slaves.\n  This is a picture taken by one of my staff members at Christmas this \npast year when she was in Sudan. This little boy is probably 11 or 12 \nyears old. He is holding his arm out in this picture. It actually has \non it his slave brand--branded slave.\n  What the Government in Khartoum does is, they allow people from the \nnorth to go down as raiders into these communities, and part of what \nthey get paid for is the slaves they can take. This is a closer picture \nof the little boy's arm showing the brand mark. They are taken and made \nto be herders, they are taken into sexual concubinage. The slave trade \nexists in the world today at the hands of the Government in Khartoum. \nIt is absolutely unfathomable that this continues to occur. That is on \ntop of the genocide and the ethnic cleansing that is taking place.\n  This is a picture of the civilian bombing that takes place within the \ncountry all the time. I was in Yei. The hospital in Yei has been bombed \nthree times in the last year. They are taking old Soviet cargo planes, \nAntonovs, and they roll bombs out the back. They are indiscriminate. \nThey are not militarily significant, but it kills a lot of people. It \nterrifies the people on the ground.\n  This is a picture of the hospital that has been bombed.\n  This photograph is, again, a civilian target. It has a big red X on \nthe top of it, and that is part of the bombing that takes place.\n  This picture shows people who are watching for the bombers.\n  I put up a quick chart of the atrocities of the Government in the \nnorth. Remember, this amendment we are going to offer simply allows \nhumanitarian aid to the resistance movement. It does not provide arms \nof any nature, but it does provide food aid to the resistance movement \nin Sudan.\n  This is what the Government in Khartoum has done. If people are going \nback and forth saying we are taking sides if we provide humanitarian \naid to the resistance, I point out, the Government in Sudan is a \nterrorist regime as determined by the United States State Department. \nIt is state-sponsored terrorism. They have housed Osama bin Laden since \n1997. He stayed in Khartoum.\n  Most of the terrorist groups operating in the world have a base of \noperation in Khartoum. The Government in Sudan is supporting terrorist \nmovements in three adjacent countries--Congo, Eritrea, and Uganda. They \nare seeking to expand this militant fundamentalism.\n  I pointed this out earlier:\n  Dead, 1.9 million people. It is the worst humanitarian situation in \nthe world.\n  An internally displaced population of 4.3 million.\n  Last year, they let famine alone kill 100,000 people. Mr. President, \nthis is the most incredible thing. Food sat in the country, and the \nGovernment in Khartoum would not let us fly relief planes into the area \nwhere they needed it, and the people died. They died at the hands of \nthe Khartoum Government because they would not let our planes deliver \nthe food aid.\n  Enslavement takes place, civilian bombings, forced religious \nconversions, terrorist threats throughout the region. This is the \nGovernment in Khartoum. This is the Government of\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\nSudan. If Members are hesitant to support food aid to the resistance \nmovement, this is against whom they are fighting. This is arguably one \nof the, if not the worst regimes in the world for the treatment of its \nown people and attempts to export a militant fundamentalism and spread \nit throughout Africa. They housed the terrorist who tried to kill \nPresident Mubarak of Egypt. I mentioned the Government in Sudan housed \nOsama bin Laden.\n  This is a simple amendment. Rather than calling it up at the present \ntime, I am making my colleagues aware, if it is not agreed to, I will \nbe calling this amendment up and asking for a vote on this amendment. \nIt is food aid to the opposition groups. It is not military aid. It is \nagainst the Government that supports the institutions of slavery, and \nit has the worst humanitarian situation in the world. Mr. President, \n100,000 were killed last year. This is the least we can do.\n  I see other Members in the Chamber. I do not want to take additional \ntime for this. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Robin \nGoodman and Howard Kushlan, who are interns in my office this summer, \nand John Bradshaw, who is a fellow, be granted the privilege of the \nfloor during the debate on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be laid aside. I say to my colleague from Kentucky, I \nwill speak on an amendment I am going to offer just to save us time so \nwe can move along today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1123\n\n   (Purpose: To combat the crime of international trafficking and to \n                     protect the rights of victims)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I will discuss one of the most \nhorrendous human rights violations of our time--the trafficking of \nhuman beings, which is particularly prevalent among women and children, \nfor the purposes of sexual exploitation and forced slavery.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced a bill, the International Trafficking \nof Women and Children Victim Protection Act of 1999, which addresses \nthis issue. This legislation was cosponsored by Senators Feinstein, \nBoxer, Snowe, Murray, Harkin, and Torricelli.\n  Today I am going to offer an amendment, which I will send to the desk \nshortly, to the foreign ops bill, which is basically this piece of \nlegislation. If adopted, this amendment will put the Senate on record \nas opposing trafficking for forced prostitution and domestic servitude \nand acting to check it before the lives of more women and more girls \nare shattered.\n  Trafficking in human beings is one of the fastest growing \ninternational trafficking businesses. Women and girls seeking a better \nlife, a good marriage, a lucrative job abroad, unexpectedly find \nthemselves forced to work as prostitutes or in sweat shops. Seeking \nthis better life, they are lured by local advertisements for good jobs \nin foreign countries at wages they could never imagine at home.\n  Every year, the trafficking of human beings for the sex trade affects \nhundreds of thousands of women throughout the world. That is hard to \nbelieve. Every year the trafficking of women and girls for sex trade \naffects hundreds of thousands of women or, for that matter, girls \nthroughout the world.\n  The U.S. Government estimates that 1 million to 2 million women and \ngirls are trafficked annually around the world. According to experts, \nbetween 50 and 100,000 women are trafficked each year into the United \nStates alone. They come from Thailand, Russia, the Ukraine, and other \ncountries in Asia and in the former Soviet Union.\n  Although trafficking has been a problem in some Asian countries, it \nwas not until the breakup of the Soviet Union that a sex trade in that \nregion began to flourish. This appalling trade has grown by leaps and \nbounds over the last decade. Trafficking is induced by poverty, lack of \neconomic opportunities for women, the horrendous low status of women in \nmany cultures, and the rapid growth of sophisticated and ruthless \ninternational crime operations.\n  Trafficking rings exploit and abuse poor, vulnerable women in the \ndevastated economies of Russia, the Ukraine, and other countries in \nCentral Europe, where women are unable to find jobs to sustain \nthemselves and their families.\n  As many of you know, I am deeply concerned about what has taken place \nin Russia today. I am deeply concerned about it because I believe what \nhappens in Russia, for better or for worse--and I hope it will be for \nbetter--will crucially affect the quality, or lack of quality, of our \nlives, our children's lives, and our grandchildren's lives. I suppose I \nam also concerned because my father was a Jewish immigrant who fled \nRussia.\n  In that country, we know that some 6.5 million women are unemployed, \nand 2.5 million children are not in school but they are in the streets. \nThese women and children are vulnerable to international organized \ncrime that preys on the jobless, the destitute, the desperate, and the \nnaive.\n  Upon arrival in countries far from their homes, these women from \nRussia and the Ukraine, and many other countries, are often stripped of \ntheir passports, held against their will in slave-like conditions, and \nsexually abused. It is just unbelievable that this is exactly what is \nhappening. Rape and intimidation and violence are commonly employed by \nthe traffickers to control their victims and to prevent them from \nseeking help.\n  Through physical isolation and psychological trauma, traffickers and \nbrothel owners imprison women in a world of economic and sexual \nexploitation that imposes a constant threat of fear and deportation, as \nwell as violent reprisals by the traffickers themselves to whom the \nwomen must pay ever growing debts.\n  Many brothel owners actually prefer foreign women--women who are far \nfrom help and home who do not speak the language--precisely because it \nis so easy to control them. Most of these women never imagined the life \nof hell they would encounter, having traveled abroad to find better \njobs or to see the world.\n  Many, in their naivete, believed that nothing bad could happen to \nthem in rich and comfortable countries such as Switzerland, Germany, or \nthe United States. Others who were less naive but desperate for money \nand opportunity are no less hurt by the traffickers' brutal grip.\n  Last year, First Lady Hillary Clinton spoke powerfully of this human \ntragedy. She said:\n\n       I have spoken to young girls in northern Thailand whose \n     parents were persuaded to sell them as prostitutes, and they \n     received a great deal of money by their standards. You could \n     often tell the homes of where the girls had been sold because \n     they might even have a satellite dish or an addition built on \n     their house. But I met girls who would come home after they \n     had been used up, after they had contracted HIV or AIDS. If \n     you've ever held the hand of a 13-year-old girl dying of \n     AIDS, you can understand how critical it is that we take \n     every step possible to prevent this happening to any other \n     girl anywhere in the world. I also, in the Ukraine, heard--\n\n  The Ukraine actually was where my father was born--\n\n       of women who told me with tears running down their faces \n     that young women in their communities were disappearing. They \n     answered ads that promised [them] a much better future in \n     another place and they were never heard from again.\n\n  We have had women from the Ukraine in our office, in face-to-face \nmeetings, talking about the awful problem of women and young girls \nbeing exploited, leaving the Ukraine, coming to countries such as ours, \nand then finding themselves in this kind of situation.\n\n  These events are occurring not just in far off lands but in the \nUnited States as well. Earlier this spring, 6 men admitted, in a \nFlorida court, to forcing 17\n\n[[Page S7844]]\n\nwomen and girls, some as young as 14, into a prostitution slavery ring. \nThe victims were smuggled into the United States from Mexico with the \npromise of steady work, but, instead, they were forced into \nprostitution. The ring was discovered when two 15-year-old girls \nescaped and went to the Mexican consulate in Miami.\n  According to recent reports by the Justice Department, teenage \nMexican girls were also held in slavery in the Carolinas and forced to \nsubmit to prostitution. In addition, Russian and Latvian women were \nforced to work in night clubs in Chicago. According to charges filed \nagainst the traffickers, the traffickers picked up the women upon their \narrival at the airport, seized their documents and return tickets, \nlocked them in hotels, and beat them. This is in our country. The women \nwere told that if they refused to dance nude in various nightclubs, the \nRussian mafia would kill their families.\n  Further, over 3 years, hundreds of women from the Czech Republic who \nanswered advertisements in Czech newspapers for modeling were ensnared \nin an illegal prostitution ring.\n  Because the victims of international trafficking are frequently \nunfamiliar with the laws, cultures, and languages of the countries to \nwhich they have been trafficked, these victims often find it difficult \nor impossible to report the crimes that have been committed against \nthem or to assist in the investigation and the prosecution of such \ncrimes. Further, victims do not have legal immigration status in the \ncountries into which they are trafficked, so the victims are often \npunished more harshly than the traffickers themselves.\n  Trafficking in women and girls is a human rights problem. This is a \nhuman rights amendment that requires a human rights response. \nTrafficking is condemned by human rights treaties as a violation of \nbasic human rights and as a slavery-like practice. Women who are \ntrafficked are subject to other abuses--to rape, to beatings, to \nphysical confinement--which are squarely prohibited by human rights law \nbut are happening all around the world. The human abuses continue in \nthe workplace in the forms of physical and sexual abuse, debt bondage \nand illegal confinement, and all are prohibited. But the practices go \non.\n  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the right to be \nfree from slavery and involuntary servitude, arbitrary detention, \ndegrading or inhuman treatment, as well as the right to protection by \nlaw against these abuses.\n  The United Nations General Assembly has passed three resolutions \nduring the last 3 years recognizing that international traffic in women \nand girls is an issue of pressing international concern involving \nnumerous violations of fundamental human rights. The United Nations \nGeneral Assembly is calling upon all governments to criminalize \ntrafficking, to punish its offenders, while not penalizing its victims.\n  Fortunately, the global trade in women and children is receiving far \ngreater attention by governments and nongovernment organizations \nfollowing the U.N. World Conference on Women in Beijing. The \nPresident's Interagency Council on Women is working hard to mobilize a \nresponse to this problem. Churches and synagogues, and nongovernment \norganizations are fighting the battle daily, but much, much, much more \nmust be done.\n  This amendment provides a human rights response to the problem. It \nhas a comprehensive and integrated approach focused on prevention, \nprotection, and assistance for the victims and prosecution of the \ntraffickers.\n  I am going to highlight a few of the provisions in the amendment.\n  One, it sets an international standard for governments to meet in \ntheir efforts to fight trafficking and assist victims of this human \nrights abuse. It calls on the State Department and Justice Department \nto investigate and take action against international trafficking. In \naddition, it creates an Interagency Task Force in the Office of the \nSecretary of State to Monitor and Combat Trafficking and directs the \nSecretary to submit an annual report to the Congress on international \ntrafficking.\n  The annual report would, among other things, identify states engaged \nin trafficking, the effort of those states to combat trafficking, and \nwhether their government officials are complicit in the practice.\n  Corrupt government or law enforcement officials sometimes directly \nparticipate and benefit in the trade of women and girls. Corruption \nalso prevents prosecution of the traffickers.\n  On a national level, as I look to this amendment, it ensures that our \nimmigration laws do not encourage rapid deportation of trafficked \nwomen, a practice which effectively insulates traffickers from ever \nbeing prosecuted for their crimes. Trafficking victims are eligible for \nnonimmigrant status valid for 3 months. If the victim pursues criminal \nor civil actions against a trafficker or if she pursues an asylum \nclaim, she is provided with an extension of time. Furthermore, it \nprovides that trafficked women should not be detained but instead \nreceive the needed services, the safe shelter, and the opportunity to \nseek justice against her abuser.\n  Finally, this amendment provides much-needed resources to programs \nassisting trafficking victims here at home and abroad. We must commit \nourselves to ending the trafficking of women and girls and to building \na world in which women and children are no longer subjected to \nhorrendous abuses.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I have worked on this bill for a long time with a lot of groups and \norganizations. I believe this will have strong bipartisan support. I \nhave tried to respond to a variety of different concerns. I say to my \ncolleague from Vermont, as long as he doesn't think this is in the \nspirit of buttering him up, I view him as a champion in human rights \nwork. I really believe this is consistent with his work. I think we \nought to have this kind of response. I thought, in order to save time, \nI would speak on this amendment. I know there are other amendments that \nare on the floor.\n  I wonder whether I might send this amendment to the desk so that we \nwill have it for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1123.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Illinois. I \nhave another amendment that I could introduce, but for now, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have several Senators on the floor \nseeking recognition. The Senator from Minnesota, of course, had the \nfloor. We are going to take a look at his amendment, which would not be \nin order for a vote right now. I listened to very much of what he had \nto say.\n  I am wondering if we could have an agreement that the Senator from \nNew Jersey be recognized, the Senator from Oregon be recognized, and \nthe Senator from Illinois be recognized next in that order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator from Vermont add the Senator from \nCalifornia?\n  Mr. LEAHY. And then the Senator from California. I see the \ndistinguished chairman is now on the floor. I am wondering if this \nmight kind of expedite things. I do not think any of these Senators \nwish to speak for any great length of time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New Jersey be \nrecognized for 5 minutes, the Senator from Oregon be recognized for 5 \nminutes, the Senator from Illinois be recognized for 5 minutes, and the \nSenator from California be recognized for 5 minutes --\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder whether or not before colleagues speak, I \ncould just send this amendment, the second amendment, to the desk so it \nis filed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And then before this begins, that the Senator from \nMinnesota be recognized to send an amendment to the desk for \nappropriate filing purposes.\n\n[[Page S7845]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1124\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is filed.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I apologize to my friend, Senator \nLeahy. I just walked onto the floor. Are the speakers here in relation \nto the Brownback amendment and the second-degree by myself and Senator \nAbraham?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We are.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous consent, the Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, yesterday the citizens of South \nFlorida watched in horror as live television cameras revealed an \nextraordinary spectacle. The hopes of freedom and the great traditions \nof America collided on the open seas with the harsh reality of the \nClinton administration's arrangements with Castro's government in \ncontrolling immigration to the United States.\n  Six Cuban refugees who fought across the Florida straits came to \nwithin yards of the coast of the United States of America. Only a few \nfeet from their destination, they leaped from the boat and attempted to \nswim to the shores of our country. They did so for the reasons that all \nof our ancestors and hundreds of thousands of other Cuban Americans \ncame to the United States--with the belief that they could find freedom \nand security.\n  It was with horror, I am certain, on their part, but also by other \nAmericans who watched this spectacle unfold as Coast Guard boats \nintercepted the swimmers. Men attempted to swim for their lives and \nwere never given lifejackets. Surrounded by Coast Guard boats that \ngenerated large wakes, imperiling the lives of those who would swim to \nshore, Coast Guard crewmen used pepper spray against some of the \nswimmers. They were then taken into custody in handcuffs. Welcome to \nAmerica.\n  It is essential that the Coast Guard, the Department of the Treasury, \nbegin an immediate inquiry to revise these procedures to find out how \nthis incident could have happened. Handcuffing refugees, using pepper \nspray, not helping those who were endangered on the high seas, \nsubjecting them to the wake of large boats, allowing them to stay in \nthe ocean for 15, 20 and, 30 minutes without assistance, no matter how \nyou feel about Castro's government or immigration, no matter how you \napproach this issue, is not the role of the U.S. Coast Guard. It is not \nthe policy of the U.S. Government. This is not how we treat refugees or \npeople who are coming to our shores for freedom.\n  It reminds us that the problems of Castro's government are not yet \naddressed. This crisis is not yet over. In the last 6 months, Amnesty \nInternational has reported that the total number of political prisoners \nin Cuba is now 350. In the last 6 months, there has been the arrest of \nfour human rights dissidents petitioning their own government to \nrecognize basic human rights. In just the last 6 months, the Cuban \ngovernment has now passed laws making it a felony, punishable by 20 \nyears in jail, to cooperate with the U.S. Government or any of its \nagencies. Things are not getting better in Castro's Cuba. They are \ngetting worse.\n  As people flee that island for freedom, they deserve more and the \npeople of the United States expect more than to have the agencies of \nthis government used to continue an oppression, not at the hands of \nCastro but to threaten the lives of these refugees at the hands of our \nown agencies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous consent, the Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1119\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will be brief. I rise to oppose the McConnell \nsecond-degree to the Silk Road amendment. I rise as a cosponsor of the \nbill.\n  We are constantly called upon in this country to pick sides among \nparties with ancient feuds. The area of the Silk Road, as defined in \nthis bill, is an area that has long been beset with communism, Islamic \nfundamentalism, and other interests which, frankly, are inimical to \nU.S. interests.\n  Section 907 picks a side. I think it is founded on the best of \nmotives but with the worst of results. At the end of the day, if we \nwant to be honest brokers in this fight, it does not help us to be \nsanctioning one party at the table.\n  This isn't about oil; this isn't about some of the interests of the \noil companies that want to develop in the Caspian; this is about being \nevenhanded; this is about getting beyond the status quo, which simply \nis not working.\n  In my view, it is appropriate to give the President the discretion to \nmake a recommendation as to whether or not this sanction should \ncontinue. If he determines that it is working, fine, leave it in place. \nIf not, I fear we will forever be caught up in picking sides on the \nSenate floor in conflicts we cannot ultimately end. I believe the U.S. \nposture in this very sensitive and important region of the world should \nbe fair to both sides.\n  There are atrocities, human rights violations, on both sides. I wish \nthere were just good guys and bad guys; unfortunately, there are plenty \nof both on both sides. In the end, I ask us to take a more evenhanded \napproach, support the Brownback bill and, ultimately, I believe, be \nmore effective in this very sensitive negotiation in trying to foster \npeace, trying to foster development, trying to foster democracy in a \npart of the world that has known little of any of that.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair recognizes \nthe Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if there is no objection, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from California, who has asked for 5 minutes, \ngo before me and that I then be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McConnell \namendment. I thank the Senator for offering his amendment because, \nfrankly, without it, a number of us will have problems supporting the \nunderlying amendment by Senator Brownback.\n  The Brownback amendment addresses a very important issue of \nrevitalizing trade in that area of the world, and the problem with it \nis that it gives the President the authority to waive section 907 of \nthe Freedom Support Act. The McConnell amendment strikes that portion \nfrom the Brownback amendment and, therefore, makes it a fine amendment. \nBut without the McConnell amendment, I am afraid we are doing some very \ngreat harm and damage to human rights and to common decency.\n  Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act was enacted to place \nrestrictions on United States government-to-government assistance to \nAzerbaijan until that country lifts its blockades of Armenia and \nNagorno-Karabakh.\n  I have very strong concerns about ending section 907, which is \nessentially what we are doing, because we know the administration's \nposition on that. Doing that would reward the Azeri Government for \ntaking no steps in lifting their blockade.\n  The blockade they have put on has prevented the transportation of \nbasic human necessities, such as food and medicine, from reaching the \nsuffering people of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. I don't believe the \nUnited States should stand by and allow the Armenian people to live \nwith a devastated economy, without a real commitment from Azerbaijan \nthat they are taking steps to end the blockade.\n  Let me be clear about section 907 and what it does not do. It is not \na sanction. In fact, the United States has normal trade relations with \nAzerbaijan. Section 907 does not prevent humanitarian aid from reaching \nAzerbaijan. It doesn't prevent the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation, the Export-Import Bank, and the Trade Development Agency \nfrom functioning in Azerbaijan.\n  The only thing section 907 requires--and that is why I don't \nunderstand why Senator Brownback wants to, in effect, repeal it--is \nthat the Azeri Government ``take demonstrable steps to cease all \nblockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.'' That is not a high \nhurdle to clear. If the Azeri Government cannot even take steps--small\n\n[[Page S7846]]\n\nsteps--to end this blockade, I believe it has no right to the \nassistance that will be provided in the underlying Brownback amendment.\n  I understand Mr. Brownback's amendment is well intentioned, and I \nenjoy working with him on many issues that affect the world. But \nbecause it would repeal section 907, I think if he were to accept \nSenator McConnell's amendment, we would have a good underlying bill.\n  In closing, I wanted to read into the Record a brief comment made by \nSenator Paul Sarbanes in his minority views that he put into the \nRecord. I serve on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I know Senator \nSarbanes believes strongly in this.\n  This is what he said:\n\n       Under current law, all Azerbaijan must do in order for \n     section 907 to be lifted is to ``take demonstrable steps to \n     cease all blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.'' \n     This is an entirely reasonable expectation, especially given \n     the basic purpose of this bill, which is to promote trade and \n     economic cooperation between the countries of the region.\n\n  He points out:\n\n       For nearly a decade, the government of Azerbaijan has \n     prevented the transport of food, fuel, medicine, and other \n     vital commodities to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, causing \n     immense suffering.\n\n  So I ask the question of my friend, Senator Brownback--in a \nrhetorical way, since he is not here--why would he want to do something \nthat would only increase the suffering? Under the McConnell amendment, \nwe cure this problem from his bill.\n  Senator Sarbanes says:\n\n       During winters, much of the Armenian population has had to \n     live without heat, electricity, or water. Schools and \n     hospitals have been unable to function, and most Armenian \n     industries have been forced to close down, crippling the \n     economy and producing widespread unemployment and poverty.\n\n  We all want to see progress in the world. We want to see trade and \njobs created. But we don't want to see more human suffering. I think if \nwe go along with the Brownback amendment, without the McConnell \namendment, we will be doing a disservice to the world.\n  I know I have a little time left. I have no further comment, and I \nyield the rest of my time to Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from California. \nI think she has it exactly right. The issue is whether, in the absence \nof a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia, the United States \nwill have completely normal relations with Azerbaijan. I would like to \nsee normal relations between our country and Azerbaijan. I would also \nlike to see normal relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. If all the \nleverage is removed in advance of an agreement, it seems to most of us \nthat it makes the agreement less likely.\n  So I commend the Senator from California. She is absolutely correct \non the merits. We hope the second-degree amendment will prevail.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, with my colleagues' indulgence, I ask \nunanimous consent that I may follow the Senator for no more than 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have a request on this side of the \naisle for 10 minutes at that point, and then right after that would be \nacceptable to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset that I agree with \nSenators McConnell and Boxer. Senator Brownback calls for normalizing \nrelations with Azerbaijan. Certainly that makes sense. We want to move \ntoward the day when we have those normal relations. But we cannot \noverlook the fact that, for over 10 years, Azerbaijan has in fact \nimposed the blockade on Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, at great \nsuffering to the people of that region.\n  It has stopped the transport of food, fuel, medicine, and other vital \ncommodities to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.\n  Our foreign policy is basically premised on the belief that if we are \ngoing to have normal relations with Azerbaijan, they have to have \nnormal relations with Armenia.\n  As Senator McConnell said, Senator Brownback has a vision for the \nfuture that we may share someday, but first we must address the \nconcerns that Senator McConnell addresses in his amendment. I support \nhim. I think it is a very sensible approach. To waive section 907 in \nthe absence of any progress toward lifting the blockade would reward \nthe Government of Azerbaijan for failing to remove it.\n  Keep in mind that even though we have this section 907 restriction, \nwe provide humanitarian and democracy-building assistance to \nAzerbaijan, and in fact the businesses of the United States do business \nthere involving a lot of international agencies. But before we really \nnormalize relations, let us demand a normalization of relations when it \ncomes to the treatment of the Armenian people.\n  I don't need to remind anyone in this Chamber of the long and sad \nhistory of the Armenian people and the genocide which they endured. \nThey have asked us to stand by them until they can resolve this \npeacefully. I think the United States is right to do so.\n  I object to the approach used by Senator Brownback and fully endorse \nthe efforts by Senator McConnell.\n\n\nfunding to send latin american students to the u.s. army school of the \n                                americas\n\n  Mr. President, while the budget caps did not allow adequate funding \nfor this bill, I want to complement Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy \non the bill they have produced within the constraints they faced. I am \nparticularly pleased that the bill includes funding for microcredit \nprograms, with the expectation that the Agency for International \nDevelopment will spend more for microcredit programs than last year. I \nam pleased that funding for the United Nations Population Fund is \nincluded in the bill. I am delighted that Foreign Military Financing \nfunds for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have been increased. These \nadditional funds will help the Baltic countries meet their Membership \nAction Plans as they aspire to join NATO.\n  This bill contains International Military Education and Training \n(IMET) funds that are used for Latin American students to attend the \nU.S. Army School of the Americas. The school is the Army's Spanish-\nlanguage training facility for Latin American military personnel, \nlocated at Fort Benning, GA. The school is a relic of the cold war with \na horrendous legacy of teaching torture and assassination. It deserves \nto be closed for what it has taught in the past, what it stands for in \nLatin American democracies today, and what its counter-insurgency \ntraining at such a tainted institution may lead to in the future.\n  I had planned to offer an amendment to delete IMET funding for the \nschool. However, I felt that my colleagues here in the Senate had not \nheard enough about the school, so I will not offer my amendment today. \nI introduced a bill, S. 873, to close the school. Our colleagues in the \nHouse have also introduced such a bill, H.R. 732, which now has 137 \ncosponsors.\n  Let me tell you why I think this school should be closed. I think you \nneed only to look at the yearbook of the School of the Americas. Let me \ntell you what you will find. It is not surprising that among the \ngraduates of the School of the Americas is the top of the list of the \nworst human rights abusers in Latin American current history. Listen as \nI read some of the graduates from the School of the Americas at Fort \nBenning, GA, an institution supported by U.S. taxpayers. These were \npeople trained at the expense of the United States to return to Central \nAmerica and lead. Listen to the people included:\n  19 Salvadoran soliders linked to the murder of 6 Jesuit priests, \ntheir housekeeper and her daughter in El Salvador in 1989;\n  48 of 69 Salvadoran military members cited in the U.N. Truth \nCommission's report on El Salvador for involvement in human rights \nviolations;\n  Former Panamanian dictator and convicted drug dealer Manuel Noriega \nand nine other Latin American military dictators;\n  El Salvador death squad leader Roberto D'Aubuisson;\n  Two of the three killers of Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador;\n  Mexican General Juan Lopez Ortiz, whose troops committed the Ocosingo \nmassacre in Chiapas in 1994;\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\n  Guatemalan Colonel Julio Alpirez, linked to the murder of U.S. \ncitizen Michael Devine in 1990 and Efrain Bamaca (husband of Jennifer \nHarbury) in 1992;\n  124 of 247--50 percent--of Colombian military officials accused of \nhuman rights violations in the 1992 work ``State Terrorism in \nColombia'', compiled by a large coalition of European and Colombian \nnon-governmental organizations;\n  Two of the three officers prosecuted by Guatemala for masterminding \nthe killing of anthropologist Myrna Mack in 1992, as well as several \nleaders of the notorious Guatemalan military intelligence unit D-2;\n  Argentinian dictator Leopoldo Galtieri, a leader of the so-called \n``dirty war,'' during which some 30,000 civilians were killed or \n``disappeared'';\n  Haitian Colonel Gambetta Hyppolite, who ordered his soldiers to fire \non a provincial electoral bureau in 1987;\n  Several Peruvian military officers linked to the July 1992 killings \nof nine students and a professor from La Cantuta University;\n  Several Honduran officers linked to a clandestine military force \nknown as Battalion 316 responsible for disappearances in the 1980's;\n  10 of the 12 officers responsible for the murder of 900 civilians in \nthe El Salvadoran village of El Mozote; and\n  Three of the five officers involved in the 1980 rape and murder of \nfour United States churchwomen in El Salvador.\n  This school is not the victim of a few isolated incidents of \nwrongdoing by its graduates. This list shows that human rights \nviolations are endemic among its graduates, with far in excess of 200 \nmurderers and other human rights violators on its past rolls.\n  Yet last week, when the commandant of the school, Col. Glenn R. \nWeidner, came to brief Senate staff on the school, he said ``it doesn't \ntake much to get on this list,'' that has been read in the Senate. I \nwould say to the colonel what it takes is murder, rape, and torture. \nAnd the list is long and convincing.\n\n  I would also say to him that these 225 graduates have been confirmed \nby the Congressional Research Service. I did not include in my bill the \nother allegations of the School of the Americas graduates that could be \nindependently confirmed. Can the school claim innocence in the actions \nof its graduates? Many do not think that is possible. For example, just \na few months ago the Guatemalan Truth Commission report faulted the \nschool's counterinsurgency training as having ``had a significant \nimpact on human rights violations during the armed conflict,'' a \nconflict that killed 200,000 people.\n\n  How, in the name of democracy, can we keep this school open?\n  I am not proposing that we hold U.S. foreign military training \nprograms accountable for all of the actions of these graduates. We know \nfrom experience that people can be brutal with or without training. But \nwhy in God's name do we continue this?\n  Colonel Weidner also said that those wanting to close the school were \nisolationists, opposed to engaging in Latin America. Nothing could be \nfurther from my point of view. The question is how we engage.\n  Let me also say to those who suggest that these comments somehow are \na reflection of criticism of the military of the United States that \nthis school should close. The Army should support its closing. I think \nthe men and women in uniform who serve this country do a wonderful job. \nBut this school has not produced the kind of graduates for which we can \ntake credit and pride. I believe it is an insult to American Army \nofficers to have their own country's reputation sullied by an \ninstitution that has been associated with horrible crimes and human \nrights abuses committed by its graduates.\n  We should remove the albatross of their association from them and \nfrom our country by closing the School of the Americas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is there an amendment pending? I \nbelieve there is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I fully support this amendment that is \nincluded in the manager's package to strike language from S. 1234, the \nforeign operations appropriations bill, which would have suspended the \navailability of fiscal year 2000 funding for the Inter-American \nFoundation until the General Accounting Office completes an \ninvestigation of alleged civil and criminal wrongdoing by employees at \nthe Foundation. I want to thank the managers of the bill and the \nchairman of the committee for their willingness to remove this \nlanguage.\n  I think it is important to explain for the record why this language \nwas included in the committee-reported bill and what led to the \namendment to strike.\n  Several months ago, the GAO contacted the Appropriations Committee \nasking permission to investigate information provided to their fraud \nhotline regarding allegations of contract and hiring regulatory abuses \nat the Foundation. GAO forwarded a report on these issues to the \ncommittee on May 20, 1999. During the course of that investigation, \nadditional anonymous allegations were made to GAO investigators by \nemployees of the Foundation, and the GAO requested permission from the \ncommittee to brief the Board of the Foundation on those allegations. \nHowever, the committee initially decided that the GAO should \ninvestigate these additional allegations, and included language in the \nbill to restrict the Foundation's funding until the investigation was \ncompleted.\n  When apprised of the language included in the bill and the \ncommittee's intention to direct GAO to investigate these additional \nallegations, I raised the issue with Chairman Stevens and asked him to \nreconsider this approach. After discussing the matter, we agreed that \nadditional information on the nature of the allegations should be \nsought in order to determine the appropriate course of action.\n  Last week, members of my staff and the Appropriations Committee staff \nmet with representatives of the General Accounting Office to discuss \ntheir findings regarding the administrative investigation which was \ncompleted on May 20, as well as the additional allegations. Based on \nthe information received at that briefing and GAO's characterization of \nthe additional allegations as administrative in nature, we determined \nthat the more appropriate way to proceed would be to accede to the \nGAO's request to brief the Board of the Foundation on these matters and \nallow the Board members to determine what further action, if any, \nshould be taken.\n  Chairman Stevens and Chairman McConnell advised me that, by referring \nthe matter to the Board, the committee would view this investigation as\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\ncomplete, and GAO would not be requested to conduct any further \ninvestigations of these matters. This amendment, therefore, removes any \nrestrictions on IAF funding as well as any language that contemplates \nfurther GAO involvement in this matter, aside from advising the Board \nof their findings and the existence of additional allegations.\n\n  Mr. President, I fully support the decision to permit the General \nAccounting Office to brief the Board of the Foundation about \nallegations of misconduct at the Foundation. I believe that this is the \nappropriate and normal course of action in this type of matter, and I \nthank Senators Stevens and McConnell for agreeing to refer this matter \nto the Foundation's Board.\n  As my colleagues know, allegations of this sort are generally \nreferred to an agency's inspector general for investigation and action, \nif necessary. Since the Foundation does not have an inspector general \nat this time, advising the Board or perhaps the Audit Committee of the \nBoard (which functions as the Foundation's Inspector General) is the \nappropriate course of action, instead of pursuing a congressionally \ndirected GAO investigation.\n  In addition, I sponsored and the Senate earlier adopted an amendment \nto S. 886, the foreign relations authorization bill, which requires the \ninspector general of the Agency for International Development to \nfunction in that capacity for the IAF, as well as the African \nDevelopment Foundation. Hopefully, this will provide IAF with the \noversight and investigatory authority to discover and deal with issues \nof this sort in the future, if necessary.\n  When our staff members were briefed by the GAO, they were advised of \nthe specific nature of these so-called ``criminal'' allegations. The \nGAO characterized the allegations as administrative in nature, stating \nthat, even if substantiated, these types of activities would very \nrarely draw criminal penalties and would instead be dealt with by a \nrequest for reimbursement or a reprimand, at most. In addition, it is \nimportant to know that most, if not all, of these allegations have \nalready been reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and their \ninvestigation found all of them to be unsubstantiated--a conclusion \nwhich the FBI addressed in a letter to the Foundation's Board Chair \nearlier this year.\n  Mr. President, I would never attempt to thwart any legitimate effort \nto uncover and eliminate fraud, unethical activities, or any type of \nmisconduct in government or government-affiliated agencies. In this \ninstance, however, I an concerned that these allegations about an \nindividual at the Inter-American Foundation were designed to accomplish \none end--the removal of that individual from effective employment at \nthe Foundation because of his very successful efforts over the past \nseveral yeas to bring accountability, order, and legitimacy to an \nagency whose programs had been fraught with waste and abuse.\n  The individual involved discovered serious deficiencies and \nimproprieties regarding the Foundation's grant-making program and the \nlack of oversight exercised by the Foundation program offers charged \nwith overseeing Foundation grant organizations and contractors \noverseas. For example, this individual found that the Foundation had \nmade grants to organizations in Ecuador involved in the kidnapping of \nU.S. citizens. This individual also took decisive action when it was \ndiscovered that the Foundation provided financial support to an \norganization in Argentina that engaged in acts of serious civil \ndisobedience, including the seizure of public buildings and the \nblockage of roadways.\n  This individual also exposed fraudulent activities of overseas \ncontractors of the Foundation, including the extortion of funds from \nFoundation grantee organizations. Finally, he established personnel \ntime and attendance policies at the Foundation to correct rampant \nabsenteeism and non-performance of duties.\n  This individual's successful efforts to make the Foundation's \nemployees and Board accountable for their actions and decisions \ninvolving U.S. taxpayer dollars have caused some of these people to \nengage in a vendetta to remove him from his position at the Foundation, \nor at least minimize his effectiveness in that post.\n  Mr. President, regardless of the outcome of the Board's review of \nthese latest retaliatory allegations against this individual, I believe \nthere should be a thorough investigation of the Board and employees of \nthe Foundation to ensure that the above-mentioned activities are no \nlonger occurring. I also believe it would be prudent to determine \nwhether improper hiring or personnel practices, misuse of government \nfunds or equipment, theft or loss of government funds or property, \nconflicts of interest, or other improprieties or mismanagement--\nallegations similar to those falsely made against the individual \ninvolved in this matter--exist anywhere in the organization. These are \nmatter that should be reviewed at the earliest opportunity by the AID \ninspector general, who will soon be serving as the inspector general \nfor the Foundation.\n  Let me serve notice that I will continue to monitor activities at the \nFoundation with respect to the handling of this matter, and I will do \neverything in my power to ensure that the matter is resolved fairly and \nin a manner consistent with the handling of similar allegations in any \nother agency of government.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for concluding the committee's \ninvolvement in this issue and referring the matter to the Foundation \nfor appropriate administrative review.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1129\n\n       On page 7, line 22, after the colon, insert the following: \n     ``Provided further, That funds made available to grantees may \n     be invested pending expenditure for project purposes when \n     authorized by the President of the Foundation: Provided \n     further, That interest earned shall be used only for the \n     purposes for which the grant was made: Provided further, That \n     this authority applies to interest earned both prior to and \n     following enactment of this provision: Provided further, That \n     notwithstanding section 505(a)(2) of the African Development \n     Foundation Act, in exceptional circumstances the board of \n     directors of the Foundation may waive the $250,000 limitation \n     contained in that section with respect to a project: Provided \n     further, That the Foundation shall provide a report of the \n     Committees on Appropriations before each time such waiver \n     authority is exercised:''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1130\n\n  (Purpose: To provide up to $5,500,000 to establish an International \n          Health Care Center at Morehouse School of Medicine)\n\n       On page 8, line 6, after the word ``AIDS'' insert the \n     following: ``and including up to $5,500,000 which may be made \n     available to establish an International Health Center at \n     Morehouse School of Medicine''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1131\n\n       On page 22, line 5, before the word ``Ukraine'' insert the \n     words ``Government of''.\n       On page 22, line 6, after ``1999'', insert the following: \n     ``, including taking effective measures to end corruption by \n     government officials''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1132\n\n       On page 22, line 15, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``Provided further, That of the funds made \n     available for Ukraine, $3,500,000 shall be made available for \n     the destruction of stockpiles of anti-personnel landmines in \n     Ukraine''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1133\n\n       On page 10, line 10, after the colon, insert the following:\n       ``Provided further, That the proportion of funds \n     appropriated under this heading that are made available for \n     biodiversity activities should be at least the same as the \n     proportion of funds that were made available for such \n     activities from funds appropriated by the Foreign Operations, \n     Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, \n     1995 (P.L. 103-306) to carry out sections 103 through 106 and \n     chapter 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961:''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nreaffirm that protecting biodiversity is a key goal of our foreign \npolicy. It is also to clarify language on page 23 of the Appropriations \nCommittee report--Report 106-81, which incorrectly refers to fiscal \nyear 1994. The year should have been 1995.\n  The United States, the birthplace of the global environmental \nmovement, has led the way in supporting efforts to protect the \nincredible variety of plants and animals around the world. Yet because \nof shrinking budgets and changing priorities in Congress and at AID, \nour efforts to preserve the Earth's biodiversity have diminished. The \nconsequences of this are profound, for ourselves and even more so for \nfuture generations. We cannot afford to neglect an area of \nenvironmental protection that so directly affects the lives of\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\nAmerican families and American industries.\n  AID's biodiversity activities include efforts to save species and \necosystems from extinction or degredation. Only 1.5 million of the \nestimated 10-50 million species have even been named and classified. \nFar fewer have been studied for their potential uses to humanity. Yet \nthe destruction of natural habitats is leading to 100 extinctions every \nsingle day. AID also promotes genetic diversity. Genes that could have \nbeen lost to environmental destruction now improve and protect crops \nall over the world, and especially here in the United States.\n  In the United States, we reap the benefits of the world's biological \ndiversity every day. Atmospheric pollution is reduced by tropical \nrainforests. Our cattle and crops are crossbred to improve their \ngenetic traits. The pharmaceutical benefits alone are amazing. Diseases \ncommon in this country are cured with medicines that come from plants \nfrom around the world. The worldwide market for drugs derived from \nplants is $40 billion. Who knows what new species will be discovered, \nleading to medicines that will benefit tomorrow's sick? No one does, \nwhich is why we cannot let a newly discovered species containing a \npossible cure for cancer, or AIDS, or even the common cold, go the way \nof the dinosaurs.\n  AID has led the way worldwide in supporting biodiversity, by working \neffectively with U.S. and foreign nongovernmental organizations, and \nforeign governments. For example, the Philippines, with its coral reefs \nand tropical forests, is one of the most biodiverse places in the \nworld. It is also one of the most threatened. But through \neffective management, AID has helped place over 1.2 million acres of \nforest land under community stewardship and away from harm. AID has \nimplemented similar projects elsewhere, working with governments to \nprotect their own valuable resources.\n\n  Despite successes such as these, our biodiversity efforts are \nthreatened. Since 1995, AID expenditures for biodiversity have \ndecreased by nearly $50 million, a nearly 50 percent reduction in just \nfour years. Much of this decline is due to the steady reduction in our \nforeign aid budget. But even from this shrinking pie, biodiversity gets \na thinner and thinner slice every year. In 1995, biodiversity spending \nwas 5.1% of development assistance expenditures. By 1996 it was down to \n4%. Then in 1998, expenditures were reduced to only 3.3%.\n  These disproportionate cuts have devastating consequences. The \nPhilippines project I just mentioned will completely run out of funding \nnext year. In Madagascar, a country that AID made one of its top \nbiodiversity priorities over a decade ago, AID cut its biodiversity \nfunding by $900,000. In some ways Madagascar was lucky, because AID had \noriginally planned to cut $1.5 million dollars. And this is a country \nthat AID says is ``Africa's most important biodiversity priority.''\n  Obviously, we have many other development assistance priorities--in \npublic health, in education, in family planning, in justice reform, to \nname a few. But we need a more balanced approach. I have spoken out \nmore times than I can count in support of more funding for foreign aid. \nForeign aid not only helps promote American interests abroad, but also \nprovides direct benefits here at home. But even given the shrinking \nfunds we devote to foreign aid, we must ensure that funding to protect \nbiodiversity does not continue to suffer disproportionate cuts. We \nshould resume the proportion of development assistance funding for \nbiodiversity to the proportion it received in 1995. That is what my \namendment would do.\n  I also want to be very clear about what we mean by ``biodiversity.'' \nWe mean ``activities designed to support the conservation and \nsustainable use of biological diversity--biomasses, ecosystems, \nspecies, or genetic diverity--by identifying needs, by designing, \nimplementing and monitoring conservation and management actions; \nthrough research and training; or through institutional strengthening, \npolicy interventions and program development.'' This is consistent with \nAID's definition of these activities.\n  Finally, we need to ensure that AID's Office of Environment and \nNatural Resources receives strong support. This office performs a vital \nfunction in the design, implementation and evaluation of conservation \nactivities. Yet funding for it has been cut steadily since 1995, from \n$25.6 million to $6.9 million in 1999.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Ukraine is a major European nation as it has the second \n     largest territory and sixth largest population of all the \n     States of Europe.\n       (2) Ukraine has important geopolitical and economic roles \n     to play within Central and Eastern Europe.\n       (3) A strong, stable, and secure Ukraine serves the \n     interests of peace and stability in all of Europe, which are \n     important national security interests of the United States.\n       (4) Ukraine is a member State of the Council of Europe, the \n     Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the \n     Central European Initiative, and the Euro-Atlantic \n     Partnership Conference, is a participant in the Partnership \n     for Peace program of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \n     and has entered into a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement \n     with the European Union.\n       (5) The Government of Ukraine has clearly articulated its \n     country's aspirations to become fully integrated into \n     European and transatlantic institutions, and, in pursuit of \n     the attainment of that aspiration, the government of Ukraine \n     has requested associate membership in the European Union with \n     the intent of eventually becoming a full member of the \n     European Union.\n       (6) It is the policy of the United States to support the \n     aspiration of Ukraine to assume its rightful place among the \n     European and transatlantic community of democratic States and \n     in European and transatlantic institutions.\n       (7) In the United States Government, the responsibility for \n     management of United States interests in Ukraine would be \n     most effectively performed by the officials who perform the \n     responsibility for management of United States interests in \n     Europe, and a designation of those officials to do so would \n     strongly underscore and most effectively support attainment \n     of the United States objective to build a Europe whole and \n     free.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of State should designate the Assistant \n     Secretary of State for European Affairs to perform, through \n     the Bureau of European Affairs of the Department of State, \n     the responsibilities of the Department of State for the \n     management of United States interests in Ukraine.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1136\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce the amount appropriated for contribution to the \n                 International Development Association)\n\n       On page 38, line 10, strike ``$785,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$776,600,000''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many people, including myself, were deeply\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\ndisappointed by the World Bank's June 24th decision to approve a \n$160,000,000 loan to fund the controversial Western Poverty Reduction \nProject.\n  We recognize the strong views about this issue and I have agreed to \naccept this amendment, but with some reluctance.\n  The Western Poverty Reduction Project has drawn criticism from \nMembers of Congress, the Clinton administration, other governments and \ninternational human rights and non-governmental organizations. A \n$40,000,000 component of this project which would fund the resettlement \nof some 58,000 poor Chinese farmers into an historically and culturally \ndistinct Tibetan and Mongolian area is the primary source of concern.\n  The $9 million cut in IDA funds which would result from the Helms \namendment is the United States contribution to this portion of the \nproject.\n  I share Senator Helms' concern that the project may put additional \npressure on Tibetans and other ethnic minorities in the region who are \nalready struggling to overcome economic and cultural marginalization \nunder Chinese rule.\n  There are also serious questions about the project's impact on the \nenvironment. It is my understanding that the Bank did not follow its \nown procedures in considering the environmental impact of this loan.\n  The United States Executive Director at the Bank voted against the \nloan and I supported that vote.\n  While many of us are not happy with the June 24th decision, the fact \nis we voted on this loan just as we have on countless other loans over \nthe years. We participated in the Board's democratic voting process, as \nestablished by the Bank's charter and agreed to by its shareholders, \njust as we always have. The United States was instrumental in \nestablishing the Bank's voting rules.\n  What made this vote different, however, is that we lost.\n  With some 18 percent of the voting power on the Board, the \noverwhelming majority of the time the view of the United States \nprevails on the World Bank's Board and at other international financial \ninstitutions. We have become accustomed to getting our way.\n  However, in the rare instances when we do not, dismissing the \nprocess, reneging on our financial obligations and walking away from \nour responsibilities is not an appropriate response. This is what this \namendment does.\n  By cutting our contribution to IDA, which provides critical \nassistance to the world's poorest countries, this amendment compromises \nthe democratic procedures at the Bank and damages United States \ncredibility. It also invites other shareholders to cut their \ncontributions to the Bank whenever they do not get their way. Taken to \nits logical conclusion, the damage to the Bank's ability to carry out \nits mission would be immense.\n  We have see how we can influence this project by simply staying \ninvolved. United States intervention and persistent international \npressure has already changed the way the Bank will proceed with this \nloan.\n  Under World Bank President James Wolfensohn's leadership, the Board \nmade the highly unusual and commendable decision to delay disbursement \nof the $40,000,000 until the Bank's independent inspection panel \nconducts a thorough review and determines whether the project meets the \nBank's environmental and resettlement standards.\n  In addition, the Chinese Government has pledged its support for the \nreview and stated that the press and government officials will have \naccess to the region. Concerns about whether the project area will be \nopen to experts unaffiliated with the Bank or the Chinese Government \nstill need to be addressed.\n  It is expected that the Western Poverty Reduction project will be \ncompleted in 2005. By approving this amendment today and reducing our \ncontribution to IDA we forfeit our leverage to influence the project \nand ensure that the Bank's environmental and resettlement standards are \nmet over the next six years.\n  Mr. President, the plight of the Tibetan people is a clear example of \nwhat occurs when the principles of democracy are consistently and \nblatantly violated. In an effort to support their struggle, this \namendment also compromises those same principles. It will weaken the \nUnited States' ability to ensure that the rights of Tibetans and other \nethnic minorities are protected as the Bank moves forward with the \nproject.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1137\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, REAP International operates a school \nlinkage program between North Dakota and the Russian Republic of \nBuryatia. In the past, this program has resulted not only in the \nestablishment of close personal relationships, but also provided \ncommunity based assistance and sustainable development to this \nimportant region of the Russian Far East. REAP International's school \nlinkage program between North Dakota and Buryatia is all the more \ncritical when one considers the setbacks that the U.S.-Russia \nrelationship has suffered in the wake of NATO's actions against Serbia. \nIn addition, the failure of the Russian economy has left many Russians \ndisillusioned, and there are those in the Russian leadership who would \ntake advantage of that disillusionment in order to reverse the free \nmarket reforms already underway in Russia. We must not let that happen. \nOne way to prevent it is to help Russian youth to understand and reap \nthe benefits of a stable, free market economy through student exchange \nprograms.\n  Student exchange programs often promote long-lasting relationships \nbetween institutions and communities. Does the Senator agree that these \nprograms also play an important role in strengthening ties between \ncountries?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. REAP International's school linkage program with \nBuryatia, Russia focuses on economic development activities, vocational \nand entrepreneurial training, and the enhancement of civic \ninstitutions. These types of activities are important in stabilizing \ncommunities in the Russian Far East. Is this type of stability not \nvital if Russia is to move ahead with economic reforms?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I concur in the Senator's assessment that stability is \na necessary prerequisite for the transition to a market economy, \nsomething we all hope Russia is able to achieve.\n  Mr. DORGAN. And would the Senator also agree that the development of \nthe Russian Far East is vital to the overall future development of \nRussia's market economy, and therefore it is critical that we support \nefforts to foster sustainable development and stability in this \nimportant region?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I certainly agree with that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Chairman for his comments and support.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1145\n\n   (Purpose: To restrict United States assistance for reconstruction \nefforts in the Balkans to United States-produced articles and services)\n\n       On page 128, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n\n  restriction on United States assistance for certain reconstruction \n                     efforts in the balkans region.\n\n       Sec.  . (a) Prohibition.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (b), none \n     of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this \n     Act for United States assistance for reconstruction efforts \n     in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or any contiguous \n     country may be used for the procurement of any article \n     produced outside the United States, the recipient country, or \n     least developed countries, or any service provided by a \n     foreign person.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply if--\n       (1) the provision of such assistance requires articles of a \n     type that are produced in and services that are available for \n     purchase in the United States, the recipient country, or \n     least developed countries, or if the cost of articles and \n     services produced in or available from the United States and \n     such other countries is significantly more expensive, \n     including the cost of transportation, than the cost from \n     other sources; or\n       (2) the President determines that the application of \n     subsection (a) will impair the ability of the United States \n     to maximize the use of United States articles and services in \n     such reconstruction efforts of other donor countries, or if \n     the President otherwise determines that subsection (a) will \n     impair United States foreign assistance objectives.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Article.--The term ``article'' means any agricultural \n     commodity, steel, communications equipment, farm machinery, \n     or petrochemical refinery equipment.\n       (2) Federal republic of yugoslavia.--The term ``Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia'' means the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and includes Kosovo.\n       (3) Foreign person.--The term ``foreign person'' means any \n     foreign national exclusive of any national of the recipient \n     country or least developed countries including any foreign \n     corporation, partnership, other legal entity, organization, \n     or association that is beneficially owned by foreign persons \n     controlled in fact by foreign persons.\n       (4) Produced.--The term ``produced'', with respect to an \n     item, includes any item mined, manufactured, made, assembled, \n     grown, or extracted.\n       (5) Service.--The term ``service'' means any engineering, \n     construction or telecommunications.\n       (6) Steel.--The term ``steel'' includes the following \n     categories of steel products: semifinished, plates, sheets \n     and strips, wire rods, wire and wire products, rail type \n     products, bars, structural shapes and units, pipes and tubes, \n     iron ore, and coke products.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I intend to support the Manager's \namendments package to the Fiscal Foreign Operations Appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2000, which includes a modified version of a bill I \nintroduced on June 10th, S.1212, the Kosovo Reconstruction Investment \nAct of 1999. I am pleased to have Senators Rick Santorum and Robert \nByrd join me as original cosponsors of this amendment.\n  I also want to thank the Chairman of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, Senator McConnell, and the Subcommittee's Ranking Member, \nSenator Leahy, for their assistance and support of this amendment.\n  While this amendment's language is a compromise, and is not as strong \nas S. 1212 which I introduced earlier this month, it is an important \nfirst step in the right direction. I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues in the coming months to help promote American taxpayers, \nworkers and key industries as the U.S. begins to spend billions of \ndollars to rebuild Kosovo and, as expected in the future, the rest of \nYugoslavia.\n  This amendment will help American workers and companies get the first \nbest shot at those Kosovo reconstruction opportunities that are being \npaid for with U.S. foreign aid funds. As a result, a large portion of \nthe American taxpayer's dollars destined for the Kosovo reconstruction \neffort will be invested in the purchase of American made goods and \nservices whenever possible.\n  This legislation will benefit both the people of Kosovo and American \nworkers. The people of Kosovo will have reconstructed homes, hospitals, \nfactories, bridges, powerplants and telecommunication systems. The \nAmerican people will benefit as a significant portion of their hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars come back to the U.S. in the form\n\n[[Page S7852]]\n\nof new orders for American made goods and services. New jobs will be \ncreated. With this legislation we can make the best out of a looming, \ncostly, and long term burden on our nation's budget.\n  This will be especially important for some of our key industries, \nsuch as agriculture and steel, that are facing hard times here at home. \nOther hard working Americans from industries like manufacturing, \nengineering, construction, high tech and telecommunications will also \nenjoy new opportunities to produce goods and services destined for \nexport overseas.\n  For example, our ranchers and farmers, many of whom are being \nseverely harmed by a combination of tough competition at home, cheap \nimports and closed markets overseas will benefit. This bill will help \nprovide them with the opportunity to strengthen their share in Europe's \nSoutheastern markets.\n  Our steel workers, many of whom are also in a tough situation, will \nbenefit as U.S. made steel is used to reconstruct, homes, hospitals, \nfactories, bridges and other necessary infrastructure. American steel \nwould also be used as American made construction equipment and tractors \nare delivered to the Balkans. American engineers, contractors and other \nservice providers will play a key role in rebuilding telecommunications \nand other necessary infrastructure projects.\n  The American taxpayers have already borne the lion's share of waging \nthe war in Kosovo. Our pilots flew the vast majority of the combat \nsorties. In addition, the Foreign Operations Supplemental \nAppropriations bill that passed last month provided $819 million for \nhumanitarian and refugee aid for Kosovo and surrounding countries. It \nhas been estimated that peace keeping operations will cost an \nadditional $3 billion in the first year alone. This is just the \nbeginning. In the future, American taxpayers will be spending tens of \nbillions of dollars more as we participate in what apparently is an \nopen-ended peacekeeping effort.\n\n  Without this legislation those countries who largely sat on the \nsidelines while we fought will be allowed to sweep in and clean up. The \nAmerican taxpayers' dollars should not be used to profit Western \nEuropean conglomerates. The American people deserve better. This Kosovo \nReconstruction Investment Amendment will help remedy this situation.\n  Yet another problem this bill would help alleviate is our exploding \ntrade deficit which is on track to an all time high of approximately \n$250 billion by the end of this year. In March of this year alone, the \nU.S. posted a record one month trade deficit of $19.7 billion.\n  Furthermore, many of the other industrialized countries that \nregularly distribute foreign aid do not do so with no strings attached. \nFor many years now, countries like Japan have also required that the \nforeign aid funds they distribute be used to buy products produced by \ntheir domestic companies.\n  The degree to which the Japanese government uses ``tied aid'' to the \nbenefit of Japanese companies and boost their exports was underscored \nby a recent quote that can be found in the June, 1999, issue of the \n``Look Japan'' magazine. When referring to Japanese efforts to help \nneighbor countries recover from the Asian economic crisis, Oshima \nKenzo, the Director of the Economic Cooperation Bureau at Japan's \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs stated:\n\n       This enormous machine of Japanese aid has barely begun to \n     move. Aid to Asian countries in crisis is something that must \n     be done on an ``all-Japan'' basis . . . The purpose of aid to \n     Asia is primarily to provide relief to Asian countries, but \n     it has a secondary aspect of reenergizing the Japanese \n     economy too, so there are many domestic hopes riding on this \n     as well.\n\n  While my original Kosovo reconstruction language in S. 1212 included \ntougher ``Buy America'' provisions, this amendment's compromise \nlanguage will allow U.S. foreign aid funds to be used to purchase goods \nand services produced in ``least-developed countries.'' This is \nsomething we can do while still serving the purpose of this amendment. \nFor example, U.S. steel workers will still have the first shot at \nproducing steel for the Kosovo reconstruction effort since countries \nsuch as Japan, South Korea and Brazil, all of whom have been taking a \nheavy toll on the U.S. steel industry here at home, most definitely are \nnot ``least developed countries.'' American telecommunications, heavy \nequipment manufacturers and a wide variety of other U.S. industries \nwill also benefit.\n  If America's Airmen, Sailors, Marines and Soldiers are good enough to \nwage a war, then America's hard working taxpayers, including steel and \nmanufacturing workers, engineers and contractors are good enough to \nhelp rebuild shattered countries. If we are called on to put the \nBalkans back together, we should do it with a fair share of goods and \nservices made in America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As I said, this is a list of managers' amendments that \nhas been cleared on both sides of the aisle:\n  McConnell-Leahy amendment to move the Iraqi provision;\n  McCain amendment to strike Inter-American Foundation language with a \nstatement;\n  Leahy-McConnell amendment on African Development Foundation \nprovision;\n  Stevens-Coverdell amendment on AIDS;\n  McConnell-Leahy on Ukaine corruption;\n  Leahy-McConnell amendment on Ukraine demining;\n  Leahy amendment on biodiversity;\n  Leahy amendment on debt restructuring;\n  Roth amendment on Ukraine;\n  Helms amendment on IDA-China;\n  Helms amendment on USAID construction notification;\n  Helms-DeWine amendment on Haiti;\n  Leahy-McConnell amendment on Russia-Iran;\n  McConnell amendment on Armenia;\n  Helms amendment on the Philippines;\n  Abraham amendment on Lebanon;\n  Thomas amendment on technical correctional reports;\n  Dorgan amendment on Russia exchanges; and\n  A Campbell amendment on Buy America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1127 through 1145), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator \nLautenberg be shown as a cosponsor of the Roth amendment on the \nUkraine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand the Senator from Illinois will be recognized. \nThen the Senator from Minnesota is going to be recognized.

Mr. President, I will speak for a few moments today \nabout an issue of great concern to me and many other Members. In the \nlast few days in Washington, there has been literally a euphoria over \nthe notion we in Washington are running large budgetary surpluses on an \nannual basis. The uncorking of champagne bottles all around town has \ntaken place on the notion that, because we are running surpluses, we \nare somehow paying down the national debt.\n  Yesterday, the New York Times had an article on page 14 entitled, \n``Clinton Sees the Possibility of Zero U.S. Debt by 2015.''\n  As I will show, this article is dead wrong. The article stated that \nthe entire national debt, which now stands at over $5.6 trillion, will \nbe paid down by the year 2015. It went on to state that the debt clock \nin New York, which is a daily tally of the Federal national debt, would \nbe down to zero by the year 2015.\n  It turns out that is dead, flat wrong. In fact, the national debt is \nnow rising. It is going to continue to rise every year of the \nPresident's 15-year projections. The total national debt by the year \n2015, as listed on that debt clock in New York, will stand at more than \n$7 trillion.\n  How can this be? We have heard from Washington that we are running \nlarge\n\n[[Page S7853]]\n\nannual budget surpluses. The President, 2 days ago, said this year we \nwill have a $98 billion surplus, and those surpluses are going to rise \neach year to the point that in the year 2004 we will have a $253 \nbillion surplus.\n  Looking at the fine print on the President's midyear report, we find \nour total gross Federal debt is still going up. It stood at $5.4 \ntrillion at the end of the last fiscal year. This year, it will rise to \n$5.6 trillion. By the year 2004, the total gross Federal debt will have \nrisen to over $6 trillion.\n\n  How can our national debt still be going up if we are running \nsurpluses in Washington? The answer to that question is, we really do \nnot have surpluses in Washington. They have a definition of surpluses \nin Washington which is far different from the average perception of \nwhat the word surplus would mean to American families or businesses. \nOne would think when you have surpluses, you would be paying down your \ndebt, not increasing it. However, in Washington, the debt is still \ngoing up, even as they say they have surpluses.\n  We know our President chooses his words very carefully. I read his \npress statements the other day. He was careful not to say we are paying \ndown the total Federal debt. He talked instead about one of the \ncomponents of the Federal debt. It turns out there are two parts to the \nFederal debt. There is debt owed to Government accounts and there is \ndebt held to the public. Both of those debts have to be paid off. At \nsome point, we have to come up with the cash to pay down those debts.\n  What President Clinton chose to do in his statements the other day \nwas ignore this part of the Federal debt and decide he would only focus \non debt held by the public. It is true he is actually going to start \ntrying to pay down the debt held by the public. Debt held by the public \nstood at $3.7 trillion at the end of last year. By the year 2004, the \nPresident will have paid it down about $700 billion to $2.9 trillion. \nIt is true by the year 2015 he will have paid this portion of the \nnational debt down to zero.\n  How is he going to pay that portion of the debt down to zero? He is \ngoing to borrow more from the Government accounts. He is going to \nborrow more from Government accounts. It turns out he will increase the \nGovernment accounts section of the national debt. Not only will he \nincrease it, he is going to quadruple debt held by these Government \naccounts. It will rise from $1.7 trillion at the end of last year to $3 \ntrillion by the year 2004. Guess what. By the year 2015, when the New \nYork Times said we would have no national debt, it turns out the debt \nin this column will be more than $7.5 trillion.\n  I have to say, if the ordinary family were to pay down their mortgage \nby running up their credit card and then realize what they were doing, \nI think they probably wouldn't feel it was cause for celebration that \nthey had just shifted the composition of their debt. Similarly, I don't \nthink there is cause yet in Washington to uncork the champagne bottles \nand pat ourselves on the back that we are paying down a portion of the \nFederal debt while we are increasing the other portion and are \nincreasing the overall debt.\n  Right now, the average family in America is responsible for $55,000 \nof that total national debt. Each family's share of the national debt \nis going to be going up in each and every year of the President's 15-\nyear projections. At the end of the 15 years, the total national debt \nwill be even higher than it is now, and each family's share of that \nnational debt will be even higher.\n  This chart shows the direction our national debt is going: It is \ncontinuing to rise. We are digging the hole deeper.\n  All this talk about surpluses in Washington should be taken with a \ngrain of salt. The surpluses they are talking about are fictitious \nsurpluses; they are accounting gimmicks. If any private business man or \nwoman used the same kind of accounting they use in Washington, they \ncould potentially wind up behind bars in a Federal penitentiary. We \nneed to change the accounting system in Washington so the public and \nthe media cannot be so easily misled.\n  I am hopeful the press throughout this Nation will point out that the \nearlier reports were flatout wrong, that the debt clock in New York \nwill not stand at zero by the year 2015, even under the President's \nprojections. Under the President's own projections of our national \ndebt, it will be higher in the year 2015 than it is now.\n  I think it is a shame Washington is misleading the American public \nabout our true financial condition. Is it not high time we end the \nhocus-pocus bookkeeping in Washington and speak the plain truth?\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the New York Times article in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 29, 1999]\n\n         Clinton Sees the Possibility of Zero U.S. Debt by 2015\n\n                          (By David E. Sanger)\n\n       Washington, June 28.--President Clinton today raised the \n     mind-bending possibility that the giant national debt clock \n     in midtown Manhattan would soon start running in reverse--and \n     that by 2015, the Government would owe no money to investors \n     around the world.\n       There is little question that Mr. Clinton described the \n     general direction of the clock correctly. Barring a stock \n     market disaster or a Japan-like recession, the Federal \n     Government's $4.5 trillion debt, the figure on the clock, \n     will begin diminishing in the next few months. That number \n     includes debt that the Government owes to itself, mostly to \n     the Social Security system.\n       The more important figure--debt that the Government owes \n     individual investors, companies and governments around the \n     world--has actually been in decline for two years. How much \n     it can be reduced in 15 years is far more problematic, \n     dependent on a huge range of economic assumptions--chiefly \n     the growth rate of the national economy--that, given the \n     inexact nature of such things, are most likely subject to \n     major revision.\n       But even if the United States could pay off all its debt in \n     the next 15 years, many economists and some Government \n     officials say that might not be as great as it sounds. \n     Although huge debts in the 1980's and early 1990's when the \n     Government ran up huge annual deficits, were a tremendous \n     drag on the economy, a bit of national debt may be a good \n     thing.\n       ``It's almost hard to imagine what this country would be \n     like debt-free,'' said Alan Sinai, the chief economist of \n     Primark Decision Systems, an economic consulting group. ``But \n     while no politician would want to admit it, the optimal debt \n     for the United States is probably not zero. What that optimal \n     level should be, though--now that's a subject for a real \n     national debate.''\n       Without question, reducing the debt creates a host of \n     advantages for the United States. As the Treasury tames its \n     appetite for borrowed money, it no longer competes with \n     homeowners looking for mortgages, for example, or companies \n     seeking to raise money. As a result, interest rates have more \n     room to fall.\n       And as the debt declines--Mr. Clinton's projections show \n     that it will fall below $3 trillion in 2005, and below $2 \n     trillion in 2009--the amount of interest the Government pays \n     each year goes down substantially, freeing up even more cash, \n     while raising the national savings rate. That, in turn, helps \n     to compensate for the free-spending ways of American \n     consumers, who in these boom times are barely saving.\n       ``That may be the biggest single advantage,'' one of Mr. \n     Clinton's senior economic advisers said toady.\n       But a debt-free United States might create a more complex, \n     and some say riskier, financial landscape worldwide.\n       For international investors, there is no safer place to put \n     money than United States Treasury bonds. When the Asian \n     economic crisis hit in 1997, and accelerated last year after \n     the collapse of the Russian economy, investors around the \n     world put their assets into United States Treasuries. These \n     investments help make the dollar the world's most popular \n     ``reserve currency,'' the money other governments hold for \n     economic security in their central banks. And they give the \n     United States subtle but significant economic clout around \n     the world.\n       If the Government stops long/term borrowing, the money that \n     becomes available may stay in the United States, invested, \n     say, in mortgages or corporate debt. But if investors do not \n     have the security of investing in United States Treasuries, \n     they may be less interested in holding their cash in dollars, \n     and that could affect the dollar's value on world markets.\n       Investors could put their money in another country's \n     treasury bonds--say those issued by the new European Central \n     Bank or the Bank of Japan. But that requires taking a bet on \n     the future of European and Japanese currencies, adding a \n     significant risk to the investment.\n       Whether any of this happens depends on a series of \n     assumptions. The chief one is the future of the American \n     economy. Mr. Clinton's projections, released today, assume \n     that the American economy will grow between 2.1 percent and \n     2.6 percent a year for the next 15 years. The Administration \n     made similar bets for the past seven years, and it was wrong \n     every time. But the surprise was pleasant: the economy \n     expanded far faster, and for far longer, than even the most \n     optimistic Government projections.\n       The risk is that future errors could be in the opposite \n     direction. That is what happened to Japan, which assumed that \n     the successes of the 1980's would extend into the\n\n[[Page S7854]]\n\n     1990's. It was the blunder of the decade, and Japan is \n     mounting a huge debt as it tries to spend its way out of \n     seven-year recession.\n       ``These are difficult projections to make for even the next \n     year or two,'' Mr. Sinai said today, ``And even more \n     difficult for beyond that.'' and the risk is accentuated \n     because most of the paydown of the debt is to occur between \n     2010 and 2015, allowing plenty of time for economic and \n     political miscalculation or happenstance.\n       On the other hand, the Government is closer to paying off \n     the debts that really matter than even Mr. Clinton indicated \n     today. While the debt clock reads $5.6 trillion, the figure \n     that kicks around the United States Treasury is less than \n     half that: $2.77 trillion, when the amount of debt held by \n     the Federal and state governments and the Federal Reserve is \n     subtracted. Under the President's projections, that debt will \n     be paid off around 2011.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If the Senator from Minnesota wishes to send it to \nthe desk we can have it accepted.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I send my modified amendment No. 1123 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1123), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 128, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following \n     new title:\n\n     TITLE--INTERNATIONAL TRAFFICKING OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN VICTIM \n                               PROTECTION\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``International Trafficking \n     of Women and Children Victim Reporting Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The worldwide trafficking of persons has a \n     disproportionate impact on women and girls and has been and \n     continues to be condemned by the international community as a \n     violation of fundamental human rights.\n       (2) The fastest growing international trafficking business \n     is the trade in women, whereby women and girls seeking a \n     better life, a good marriage, or a lucrative job abroad, \n     unexpectedly find themselves in situations of forced \n     prostitution, sweatshop labor, exploitative domestic \n     servitude, or battering and extreme cruelty.\n       (3) Trafficked women and children, girls and boys, are \n     often subjected to rape and other forms of sexual abuse by \n     their traffickers and often held as virtual prisoners by \n     their exploiters, made to work in slavery-like conditions, in \n     debt bondage without pay and against their will.\n       (4) The President, the First Lady, the Secretary of State, \n     the President's Interagency Council on Women, and the Agency \n     for International Development have all identified trafficking \n     in women as a significant problem.\n       (5) The Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing \n     Conference) called on all governments to take measures, \n     including legislative measures, to provide better protection \n     of the rights of women and girls in trafficking, to address \n     the root factors that put women and girls at risk to \n     traffickers, and to take measures to dismantle the national, \n     regional, and international networks on trafficking.\n       (6) The United Nations General Assembly, noting its concern \n     about the increasing number of women and girls who are being \n     victimized by traffickers, passed a resolution in 1998 \n     calling upon all governments to criminalize trafficking in \n     women and girls in all its forms and to penalize all those \n     offenders involved, while ensuring that the victims of these \n     practices are not penalized.\n       (7) Numerous treaties to which the United States is a party \n     address government obligations to combat trafficking, \n     including such treaties as the 1956 Supplementary Convention \n     on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions \n     and Practices Similar to Slavery, which calls for the \n     complete abolition of debt bondage and servile forms of \n     marriage, and the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labor Convention, \n     which undertakes to suppress and requires signatories not to \n     make use of any forced or compulsory labor.\n\n     SEC. __03. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to condemn and combat the \n     international crime of trafficking in women and children and \n     to assist the victims of this crime by authorizing an annual \n     report of its findings to include the identification of \n     foreign governments that tolerate or participate in \n     trafficking and fail to cooperate with international efforts \n     to prosecute perpetrators;\n\n     SEC. __04. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Trafficking.--The term ``trafficking'' means the use of \n     deception, coercion, debt bondage, the threat of force, or \n     the abuse of authority to recruit, transport within or across \n     borders, purchase, sell, transfer, receive, or harbor a \n     person for the purpose of placing or holding such person, \n     whether for pay or not, in involuntary servitude, or slavery \n     or slavery-like conditions, or in forced, bonded, or coerced \n     labor.\n       (2) Victim of trafficking.--The term ``victim of \n     trafficking'' means any person subjected to the treatment \n     described in paragraph (2).\n\n     SEC. __05. ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       Not later than March 1, 2000, the Secretary of State shall \n     submit a report to Congress describing the status of \n     international trafficking, including--\n       (1) a list of foreign states where trafficking originates, \n     passes through, or is a destination; and\n       (2) an assessment of the efforts by the governments \n     described in paragraph (1) to combat trafficking. Such an \n     assessment shall address--\n       (A) whether governmental authorities tolerate or are \n     involved in trafficking activities;\n       (B) which governmental authorities are involved in anti-\n     trafficking activities;\n       (C) what steps the government has taken toward ending the \n     participation of its officials in trafficking;\n       (D) what steps the government has taken to prosecute and \n     investigate those officials found to be involved in \n     trafficking;\n       (E) what steps the government has taken to prohibit other \n     individuals from participating in trafficking, including the \n     investigation, prosecution, and conviction of individuals \n     involved in trafficking, the criminal and civil penalties for \n     trafficking, and the efficacy of those penalties on reducing \n     or ending trafficking;\n       (F) what steps the government has taken to assist \n     trafficking victims, including efforts to prevent victims \n     from being further victimized by police, traffickers, or \n     others, grants of stays of deportation, and provision of \n     humanitarian relief, including provision of mental and \n     physical health care and shelter;\n       (G) whether the government is cooperating with governments \n     of other countries to extradite traffickers when requested;\n       (H) whether the government is assisting in international \n     investigations of transnational trafficking networks; and\n       (I) whether the government--\n       (i) refrains from prosecuting trafficking victims or \n     refrains from other discriminatory treatment towards \n     trafficking victims due to such victims having been \n     trafficked, or the nature of their work, or their having left \n     the country illegally; and\n       (ii) recognizes the rights of victims and ensures their \n     access to justice.\n       (c) Reporting Standards and Investigations.--\n       (1) Responsibility of the secretary of state.--The \n     Secretary of State shall ensure that United States missions \n     abroad maintain a consistent reporting standard and \n     thoroughly investigate reports of trafficking.\n       (2) Contacts with nongovernmental organizations.--In \n     compiling data and assessing trafficking for the Human Rights \n     Report and the Annual Report, United States mission personnel \n     shall seek out and maintain contacts with human rights and \n     other nongovernmental organizations, including receiving \n     reports and updates from such organizations, and, when \n     appropriate, investigating such reports.\n\n     SEC. __06. PROTECTION OF TRAFFICKING VICTIMS.\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1123), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent it be in order the Senator from \nRhode Island be recognized for the 5 minutes prior to my recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1118\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVermont for his graciousness in allowing me to speak. I rise today to \nexpress my opposition to the Brownback amendment which would implement \nthe Silk Road Strategy Act of 1999. I urge my colleagues to support the \nsecond-degree amendment offered by Senators McConnell, Abraham, and \nSarbanes. I am also a cosponsor of the second-degree amendment.\n  The purpose of Senator Brownback's amendment is appropriate, in the \nsense\n\n[[Page S7855]]\n\nhe wants to provide assistance to integrate the Caucasus, provide more \ncooperation and collaboration between these countries. But what we have \nseen over the last several decades, really, has been the resistance, \nparticularly by the Government of Azerbaijan and the Government of \nTurkey, to a cooperative and collaborative relationship with the \nGovernment of Armenia. That is a polite way of saying they have been \nblockading Armenia for many years.\n  In response to that blockade, we have passed, I think wisely, \nlegislation in this Congress and preceding Congresses to prevent our \ncooperation with these countries unless they lift the blockade. It has \nbeen the only real way we have been able to put leverage upon the \ngovernments of Turkey and Azerbaijan to recognize that a dialog, \ncooperation, collaboration, and regional harmony is necessary.\n  The interesting and ironic point at this juncture is that our \nstrategy seems to be working because for the first time, in the context \nof the NATO meetings here in Washington just a few weeks ago, the \nPresident of Armenia and the President of Azerbaijan had face-to-face \nmeetings.\n  Up until that time, the Azeris refused to even recognize, really, the \nGovernment of Yerevan to have a constructive dialog. Now at the point \nwhere we are making progress, where we have a dialog initiated by the \nAzeris and the Armenians, we are attempting to undercut that progress \nwith this amendment which will essentially take all the pressure off \nboth the Azeris and the Turks in terms of their relationship with \nArmenia and, in particular, the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.\n  Nagorno-Karabakh has been for generations an area of concentrated \nArmenian population but under the control of Azerbaijan. In 1988, \nNagorno-Karabakh seceded from Azerbaijan. There was warfare. \nMercifully, the warfare has ceased, but this is still a festering point \namong the three countries--Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.\n  Again, if we are to make progress on this very critical issue, the \nissue of Nagorno-Karabakh, the issue of the general relationship among \nArmenia and its neighbors, Azerbaijan and Turkey, now is not the time \nto take off the one piece of leverage, section 907, which is giving the \nAzeris an incentive to go to the table, sit down, and talk and \ncollaborate.\n  I have had the privilege and the opportunity to travel to Armenia and \nto Nagorno-Karabakh. There is a sincere willingness to seek an \nunderstanding, to seek a cooperative arrangement with the Azeris, with \nthe Turks. But that cannot happen unless there is a dialog.\n  The dialog has started, but my fear is that if we adopt this measure, \nproposed with every good intention by the Senator from Kansas, we will \nundercut the progress we have made. We will send a strong message to \nthe Azeris that they do not have to do anything, they do not have to \ntalk to the Armenians, they do not have to do anything, because they \nnow are unrestricted in terms of their type of diplomatic initiatives.\n  It will be terribly unfortunate, and it will essentially undercut the \nmotivation which I believe is compelling and moving this underlying \namendment of the Senator from Kansas forward: the notion of regional \ndialog, regional cooperation, regional collaboration.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment proposed by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, because that is the only way we are going to keep both \nthe Azeris and the Armenians at the table. We know from a long sweep of \nhistory, if two nations are talking, then there is hope. Once the \ndialog is over--and it will end if section 907 is repealed--we are \ngoing to see a much more hostile and threatening environment in the \nCaucasus, one which will not only impact our relationship but also will \nbe a threat to the stability of that region.\n  I thank and commend the Senator from Kentucky, the Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Sarbanes, Senator Abraham from Michigan, and those who \nare standing up and saying, now that we are making progress, now that \nwe finally have a dialog between the President of Azerbaijan and the \nPresident of Armenia, do not take away the motivation for that dialog; \nlet's continue to talk; let's continue to work for peace in this area.\n  I yield back any time to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island \nfor his comments. We appreciate his support on this most important \namendment. We certainly hope the Senate will approve the second-degree \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1123, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor the Senator from Minnesota to further modify his amendment, which \nwas adopted just a few minutes ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment will be so modified.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I send the modification to the desk. I thank both \nSenator Leahy and Senator McConnell for their support. This is the \nfirst time we are going to have such a report. It is going to be very \nimportant to the human rights community and the law enforcement \ncommunity. It will have a stigmatizing effect on countries involved in \nthis, and it is going to make a huge difference from the point of human \nrights.\n  The amendment (No. 1123), as further modified, is as follows:\n       On page 128, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following \n     new title:\n\n     TITLE--INTERNATIONAL TRAFFICKING OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN VICTIM \n                               PROTECTION\n\n     SEC. __01.

Mr. President, we have an adage: Where there is a will, \nthere is a way. Often that seems to embody how legislation is passed by \nthis Congress. Of course the question always is what is the will, and \nwhat is the way? We should look no further than the priority being put \non two separate pieces of legislation: S. 254, the juvenile justice \nbill, and H.R. 775, the Y2K bill. If one looks at that, one sees how \nthe will and the way work around here.\n  The Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, passed the Senate \nafter 2 weeks of open debate, after a number of votes, and after \nsignificant improvements on May 20. The Senate passed it by a strong \nbipartisan vote of 73-25.\n  On June 17, the other body passed its version of this legislation but \nchose not to take up the Senate bill and insert its language, which is \nthe standard practice. Nor has the Republican leadership in the House \nmade any effort to seek a House-Senate conference or appoint conferees.\n  When there are differences in legislation passed by each House, the \nnormal order is for House and Senate conferees to work these \ndifferences out in conference, but we cannot do that unless they \nappoint conferees.\n  The majority in the other body is taking a break even before our July \n4 recess. They are taking no steps to proceed to conference on the \njuvenile justice bill or toward the appointment of conferees. Indeed, \ndespite statements by the Speaker of the House earlier this week, the \nHouse majority leader is now reported to be planning to delay the \ncompletion of this bill for months. This delay is costing us valuable \ntime in getting this juvenile justice legislation enacted before school \nresumes this fall. This is just plain wrong.\n  Every parent in this country is concerned this summer about school \nviolence over the last two years and worried about the situation they \nwill confront this fall. Each one of us wants to do something to stop \nthis violence. There is no single cause and no single legislative \nsolution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in \nour streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. It is \nunfortunate that the majority is not moving full speed ahead to seize \nthis opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice \nlegislation.\n  We should not repeat the delays that happened in the last Congress on \nthe juvenile justice legislation. In the 105th Congress, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee reported juvenile justice legislation in July 1997, \nbut it was then left to languish for over a year until the very end of \nthat Congress. In fact, serious efforts to make improvements to this \nbill did not even occur until the last weeks of that Congress, when it \nwas too late and we ran out of time.\n  The experience of the last Congress causes me to be wary of this \ndelay in action on the juvenile justice legislation this year. I want \nto be assured that a House-Senate conference on this legislation is \nfair, full, and productive.\n  At the end of the last Congress, the majority staged what appeared to \nbe a procedural ambush to move a one-sided bill forward in a way that \nprecluded full and open debate and amendment. I certainly hope that the \ncurrent delay in action on this year's juvenile crime bill is not an \nattempt to concoct another procedure ambush.\n  We have worked hard in the Senate for a strong bipartisan juvenile \njustice bill. I will be vigilant in working to maintain this \nbipartisanship and to press for action on this important legislation. \nWe know if we have the will, there is a way.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator from Vermont yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. I \ncould not agree more with his remarks. We worked hard on this bill. We \ndeserve for it to be heard. We do not deserve--the American people do \nnot deserve--for it to be shoved under a carpet to pop out sometime \nunknown perhaps when it cannot be debated.\n  I ask the Senator this question: Does it seem unreasonable, given his \nyears of experience in the Senate--and I know we worked on criminal \njustice matters when I was in the House--does it seem unreasonable for \nus to have a goal, for the American people to sort of set the goal, or \nagree with us in the goal, that the juvenile justice bill, including \nprovisions such as closing the gun show loophole, which this body \npassed, be on the President's desk by the day school resumes, by Labor \nDay of next September? Does that seem to be a reasonable timetable and \na reasonable request for people who are interested in debating the \nissues and seeing that we do something to close the gun show loophole?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New York, it is \nreasonable to move forward on it. These are issues the American people \ncare about. They do care about the gun show loopholes on gun sales, \ncertainly after the tragedy of Columbine. They do care about a number \nof the issues that are in the juvenile justice bill. The Senate \nreflected that by passing it 73-25. This is a 3-to-1 vote in the \nSenate.\n  I say to my friend from New York, when he served in the other body, \nhe and I were on a number of conference committees together. We knew we \nwould have major criminal justice bills come in one distinct form from \nthe Senate and one distinct form from the House, but we moved quickly \nin the conferences, sometimes going all night long. In fact, I can \nremember a couple that went all night long, 2 or 3 nights in a row, to \ncomplete our work because we knew we were dealing with criminal justice \nmatters, matters about which the American people have great concern. \nBut we did it.\n\n  So I say to my friend from New York, in answer to his question, that \nthis is wrong. This is wrong that we are not moving forward to \nimmediately conference the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from New York for his concern and his \nleadership on these matters. He was one of the leaders--in fact, \noftentimes on the floor he was the leader--on these issues, including \nclosing gun loopholes. I was looking forward to, and am looking forward \nto, his expertise and his work when we do get to conference. He and I \nare ready to go to conference. I am prepared to have him in there to \nhelp me in that conference, because these are major issues.\n  But at some time or another the American people expect us to vote one \nway or the other. Some Senators will vote against our position. Some \nHouse Members will vote against our position. Some will vote for it. I \ndo not ascribe motives to them, but I say, that you either vote for or \nagainst something. You do not vote maybe. And the Congress is being \nforced to vote maybe.\n  This is a sharp contrast to the pace of action on the Y2K bill. The \nY2K bill provides special legal protections to businesses. After \nearlier action in the House on H.R. 775, the Y2K liability limitations \nbill passed the Senate on June 15, 1999. That was about 1 month after \nthe Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill.\n  On June 16, the day after Senate action on the Y2K bill, the Senate \nasked for a House-Senate conference and appointed conferees. In fact, I \nam one of them. The House responded by agreeing to the conference and \nappointed its conferees a few days later, on June 24. Then we \nimmediately went to conference. The conference met that same day, the \nsame day the House appointed its conferees.\n  After a weekend break for extensive negotiations with the White \nHouse, the conference report on the Y2K liability limitations bill was \nfiled yesterday, June 29. I expect the House and Senate will be taking \nup the conference report almost immediately, and the Y2K liability \nlimitations bill will probably see final passage this week.\n  It is interesting that this is a business-lobbied-for issue and that \nthing zips through here; it zips through here at warp speed. I can \nalmost see the legislative clerk saying: We want warp 5,\n\n[[Page S7857]]\n\nScottie. And, by golly, we are going to have it.\n  I should also note, this Y2K liability limitations bill is industry's \nsecond bite at the apple to gain protections against liability to \ncustomers and consumers. If all goes as expected, in less than a year's \ntime, big business will have successfully lobbied for the passage of \ntwo major pieces of legislation to protect themselves against any \naccountability for actions or losses their products may cause to \nconsumers.\n  Last year, I joined with Senator Hatch to introduce and pass into law \na consensus bill known as the Year 2000 Information and Readiness \nDisclosure Act. This legislation passed both the House and the Senate \nby unanimous consent on October 8, 1998. When we took this action, \nrequested last year, we acted in good faith, we acted in recognition of \nthe fears of industry, but we did it in a balanced way that continued \nto protect consumers and the rights of all Americans. The House and \nSenate accepted that unanimously, and the White House signed it.\n  Notwithstanding that bipartisan piece of legislation, notwithstanding \nthe unanimity we sought, we see this year where business fears are \nbeing reconstituted for the basis of greater and greater demands for \nspecial legal protections for potential Y2K defendants. Special \nbusiness interests have come back to Congress with new demands, and \nthere has been swift action.\n\n  But by contrast to this swift action to help business by limiting \ntheir potential liability in the Y2K bill at the expense of American \nconsumers, in contrast to jumping immediately to do whatever the \nbusiness lobby wanted, we find now that those who should be appointing \nconferees in the House are not doing that, they are dragging their feet \non moving to appoint conferees on the juvenile justice bill.\n  The juvenile justice bill is not designed as a protection to \nbusinesses that may have made mistakes in the computers they sell to \npeople. No. The juvenile justice bill is intended to make a difference \nin the lives of our children and our families. I guess children and \nfamilies do not have the power and the lobbying clout that some of \nthese major businesses do. I guess they do not have PACs. They do not \ngive major contributions. They do not go to the big fundraisers. All \nthey are, are families trying to raise their children and send them to \nschool safely; so the House majority is not going to move rapidly on a \njuvenile justice bill.\n  As Senators, as House Members, as human beings, that should have been \nour No. 1 priority. We should have brought this to conference. We \nshould have concluded it by now so that the new programs and \nprotections for schoolchildren could be in place when school resumes \nthis fall. At the rate we are going, we guarantee that children will be \ngoing back to school without the protections that three-quarters of the \nMembers of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted for; we \nguarantee that the promise we held out here in the Senate to protect \nthe children who have to go to school, to protect their families, to \nprotect this country, the promise we held out to them is a hollow \npromise, because the House of Representatives, and their leadership, \nthe Speaker and the majority leader, are saying: We're not going to get \nto this bill; we're not going to have conferees.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, for a question, or I will lose my right to the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have listened carefully to what the Senator has said. \nI must say, I am in total agreement with the Senator.\n  As I understand the parliamentary situation, rather than follow the \nusual procedure, where we have legislation that has passed the House \nand the Senate, and then we go to the conference, and then the \nconference comes back and we have an opportunity to evaluate what was \nin the conference, but then we have at least some resolution to the \nissue, this process and this parliamentary gymnastics, which the \nleadership on both sides, evidently, were a part of, effectively, as I \nunderstand what the Senator is saying, if I understand the \nparliamentary situation, basically undermines in a very significant and \nimportant way the work that was done here in the Senate in terms of \ntrying to help families deal with the problems of violence in their \ncommunities, violence in their schools, and also to deal with the law \nenforcement issue in terms of the gun show loophole.\n  I believe I am correct, am I not, in understanding what the Senator \nhas represented here this afternoon? Am I correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. The \nSenator from Massachusetts, of course, is one of those who was on the \nfloor day after day, hour after hour, helping us craft this bill and \ngetting it through. A former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he \nhas been a leader on juvenile justice issues for the better part of \nfour decades. We greatly appreciate all that he contributes each day \nand all that he contributed again this year to the Senate juvenile \njustice bill that we were able to pass with such a strong bipartisan \nmajority.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, from his experience--longer \nexperience than I have had in this body--is aware that when we have had \nthese major pieces of criminal justice or juvenile justice legislation \nor any major justice legislation, we have gone to conference and we \nhave worked out the differences. He also knows, as I do, if we refuse \nto do that, it, in effect, kills legislation--legislation that passed \nhere in a bipartisan fashion. I share the concerns that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am just wondering if the Senator could give us some \ninsight. It took us 9 days to work out an agreement with the Republican \nleadership in order to permit the Senate to consider what we know as \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights when we return from the Fourth of July \nrecess, to dispose of that. What we saw during that time was every type \nof parliamentary maneuver in order to deny the will of the Senate on \nthat particular issue.\n  Now we have, as a result of the leadership, both the majority and \nminority leadership, an opportunity to address those issues when we \nreturn.\n  It seems to me we are seeing a similar effort by the leadership to \ndeny the Senate the ability to express itself on an issue that is \naffecting children, an issue affecting violence in our schools and our \nlocal communities. Effectively, the rules of the Senate are being used \nin order to deny the Senate the reasonable chance to express itself.\n  Is that basically the bottom line, when all is said and done; we are \nseeing a parliamentary maneuver to try and effectively undermine what \nhas been the considered judgment of this body? We are being put back, \neffectively, to ground zero in terms of this issue?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. Unlike \nthe Y2K bill and other things, where there is a rush to complete \ncongressional action on it, this is something where it appears, \nespecially in the other body, that the parents and the children of this \ncountry do not have a voice. No matter what other legislative issues \nare going on, the conference could have been meeting if the House had \njust proceeded to take the normal steps needed and appointed conferees.\n  The majority leader of the House of Representatives has said they are \nnot going to appoint conferees, certainly not any time in the near \nfuture. We have been ready to go forward at any time, the members of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. But if there are not going to be \nconferees, this bill is in limbo.\n  So you had the hopes of the parents of this country, the hopes that \nthe schoolchildren had following the passage by the Senate of a good \njuvenile justice bill, that maybe we are coming to grips on at least \nsome aspects of juvenile violence. Those hopes are dashed because when \nthe matter is finally taken up by the other body, they say: Wait a \nminute, we don't have to have any votes on this.\n  I am privileged to participate in legislative action on the floor of \nthe Senate. We Senators ought to run the Senate, not a powerful lobby. \nI say the same to the other body. They ought to stand up and speak for \ntheir constituents and not become mouthpieces for a powerful lobby, but \nthat is what has happened.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I see on the floor our friend and \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, who made a gallant fight \non\n\n[[Page S7858]]\n\nthe floor of the Senate in terms of reducing the availability and the \naccessibility of guns to children in this country and also to those of \nthe criminal element. It was a hard-fought battle. The Senate expressed \nits will. That is the way this body should act.\n  Now, with a parliamentary maneuver, the leadership that was strongly \nopposed to those provisions has been basically able, at least for the \ntime being, to undermine what has been debated, discussed, and acted on \nhere in the Senate.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont for bringing this matter to our \nattention. I thank, again, the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator \nfrom California, both of whom I am sure share our frustration with this \nparliamentary maneuver.\n  I think at some time in the Senate, a body that has a very proud \ntradition of permitting people to express their judgment and to make a \ndetermination to deal with public business, at some time we are going \nto learn the lesson that you can't constantly undermine what is the \nregular order, which is the reason why this body was established; that \nis, for Senators to be able to express their will. I think we are \nseeing another way and means of corrupting the purpose that the \nFounding Fathers intended. I think it is enormously regrettable.\n\n  I assure the Senator from Vermont, we will work very closely with him \nto try to remedy this situation in any way that we can. I thank the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I totally concur with what the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts has said. He was a \nleader who worked with us to design the Senate-passed bill.\n  All of us, whether we are parents or grandparents or teachers or \npolicymakers, we are puzzling over the causes of children turning \nviolent in this country. We know that the root causes are likely \nmultifaceted. We know there is no one cause. There is no one magic \nsolution.\n  I believe the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill is a firm and \nsignificant step in the right direction. The passage of that bill \nshowed that when Senators roll up their sleeves and get to work, we can \nmake significant progress. And we did. Senators were on the floor, they \nwere in conferences in the cloakroom and off the floor. We worked \nextremely hard to come together. We had some false steps at the \nbeginning, but we finally came together when we passed a piece of \nlegislation 73 to 25.\n  That took a lot of work. We had conservatives and liberals and \nmoderates holding hands on a number of issues to make it work because \nwe cared about the children of this country. That progress does not do \nany good if the House and Senate do not come together in a conference.\n  I yield for a question to my friend from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his leadership on \nthe juvenile justice bill, all parts of it. I see the Senator from New \nJersey has come to engage also in some conversation.\n  I ask the Senator from Vermont, because when you read a book that \nsays how a bill becomes a law, it seems very simple in many ways. It \nsays a bill passes the Senate or the House. Then it goes to the second \nHouse. If it started in the House, it goes to the Senate. Then there is \na conference where the differences are ironed out. Then the bill goes \nover to the President.\n  When we passed this bill--and my friend pointed out the overwhelming \nmargin with which it was passed--the country really celebrated because \nfor the first time in a long time we passed some sensible laws.\n  The question that I have for my friend is as follows: After the \nSenate walked hand in hand, people on both sides of the aisle, to an \noverwhelming vote, with three-quarters of the Senate voting to pass \nthis juvenile justice bill, which included the Lautenberg amendment \nthat closed the gun show loopholes--we remember that it was very close; \nthe Vice President cast the tying vote--the people of this country were \nvery relieved. At least they certainly were in California. They said: \nThank goodness you are doing something relevant. They assumed we were \nmaking progress.\n  Then the bill goes over to the House, and as I remember it--and I \nwould like the Senator from Vermont to tell me if I am correct on \nthis--no sensible gun control was passed at all. Everything was killed. \nWhat remained was just the part that dealt with juvenile justice, not \nthe part that talked about sensible gun laws because they separated \nthose out.\n  If we are to have any closing of the gun show loophole that Senator \nLautenberg fought so hard for, that the Vice President came over here \nto cast the tie-breaking vote for, which says, yes, we will do \nbackground checks to make sure that felons don't get guns and people \nwith mental illness don't get guns and children don't get guns, we want \nthat, the only hope, is it not so, lies in a conference where the \nSenate bill will be presented side by side with the House bill and the \nconversation will proceed and we will come up with a bill?\n  By not appointing conferees, is my friend implying that at the moment \nit means zero progress on this whole issue of juvenile justice and \nsensible gun laws and, perhaps, if it continues long enough, when the \nkids go back to school they will have no benefit from this fine \nbill? Is that what my friend is saying--that this is another way to at \nleast temporarily kill this bill?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from California is correct. She has described \nthe bill very well, as she always does, and where we are in the \nlegislative process. She has had both a distinguished career in the \nother body and here. She understands what has happened.\n  It was not an easy thing passing the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice \nbill here in the Senate. We had a very difficult time. It evolved. But \ninterestingly enough--and I have been here 25 years--I have rarely seen \nan occasion where the American public became involved and more fully \naware of what was happening.\n  I must say, initially, much of the news media did not even cover it. \nThe American people became aware through C-SPAN and through all the \ndiscussions on the Internet and through the radio. And then, more and \nmore, they realized what was happening and what was at stake.\n  I do not know how many people are aware of this discussion we are \nhaving right now. I will guarantee you that it will be on web sites and \non the Internet, though, because the American public is concerned about \nthis.\n  The Senator from California, the Senator from New Jersey, and others, \nwill remember that as calls started coming into Senators' offices, the \ndebate started shifting. This was one of those all too rare occasions \nwhere the American public went beyond having the debate interpreted for \nthem and started watching what was actually happening in the debate and \ncontributing and participating themselves.\n  The Hatch-Leahy legislation passed because the American people were \npaying attention and because they were concerned, and votes started \nchanging, positions started changing. That is why this body came \ntogether by a 3-to-1 vote and passed the Hatch-Leahy legislation, a \ngood piece of juvenile justice legislation, because the American people \npaid attention and knew something could be done.\n  Now it has been blocked in the other body. Why? Perhaps because that \nis the only way this legislation can be stopped--it won't be stopped by \na vote in the Senate. Senators have said how they will vote. The only \nway it can be stopped is if the other body refuses to bring it up, and \nthe way they refuse to bring it up is by refusing to appoint conferees.\n  (Mr. BUNNING assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Certainly.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I know that the Senator from Vermont very much shares \nthis view, despite the fact that gun ownership is a popular thing in \nthe State of Vermont where a lot of people hunt and a lot of people \ncollect guns. But I believe it is fair to say, is it not, that in the \nState of Vermont, despite the abundant number of guns you have there, \nviolent crime is a relatively small factor? Is that the case?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from New Jersey is right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Therefore, does Vermont have laws that require review \nof applications to buy guns and require people to get permits to buy \nguns?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, other than the Federal law, the Brady law.\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Federal law. So they are in adherence, obviously, \nto the Federal law?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I wonder if the Senator is aware of the fact that we \nhad a long struggle, which the Senator from Vermont and I participated \nin, to get the Brady law into place and to try to retain the review of \napplicants to buy guns, to be continued under the national instant \ncheck system. I wonder if the Senator has seen the pieces recently \nabout the fact that the FBI, even with a 3-day business period \navailable to them, does not have enough time to control every one of \nthe decisions that is made to enable someone to buy a gun.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have seen that, and I have seen the results in some \nplaces where those who should not get guns have gotten them because \nthere has not been enough time to make the checks.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I know the Senator keeps abreast of things, \nespecially affecting justice, especially affecting juveniles. I inquire \nof the Senator as to whether or not he knows that where more than 1,700 \nguns, gun purchases, were denied to prohibited buyers, unstable felons \nand criminals have been allowed to buy guns because they were unable to \nthoroughly check the backgrounds before the guns were sold. Is the \nSenator aware of that?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. But I am aware of the fact that the Senator from New \nJersey is one of the experts on this issue. He has studied it as much \nor more than any other person in this body. If he says those are the \nnumbers, I am willing to accept them.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appreciate that. I don't know whether the Senator \nis further aware that since the Brady bill was put into place in March \nof 1994, over 400,000 illegal gun sales have been blocked--over 400,000 \nillegal gun sales have been blocked as a result of the Brady bill being \nin place.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was aware of that number. It is a very significant \nnumber.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator is aware, I am sure, that I had the \nprivilege of authoring the domestic violence prohibition for guns to be \navailable to those who had been convicted of misdemeanors, in marital \nand home disputes. Over 13,000 gun permits have been denied under the \nlaw that I authored at the end of 1996, which kept those people from \nbeing able to buy guns. I don't know if the Senator is aware of the \nextent of that number, but it is 13,000.\n  The fact of the matter is that, in conjunction with that, we know \nthat roughly 150,000 times a year a gun is put to a woman's head in \nfront of her children, or in the privacy of a discussion between the \ntwo of them, and the threat is made: I will blow your head off.\n  Is the Senator aware of the fact that there are forces at play here \nthat refuse to permit us to have sensible gun violence control? I \ndidn't say gun control; I said gun violence control.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to the Senator from New Jersey, apparently those \nforces, at least at this point, have succeeded in the other body, and \nthat is why we are not having conferees appointed and proceeding to a \nprompt conference, because they know if there were a conference and if \nthe public responds as it did during the debate on the Hatch-Leahy bill \noriginally, that conference may pass out legislation that they might \nnot like, especially as it relates to controlling gun violence. I think \nthat is one of the reasons why we have not seen that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask the Senator this question. The Senator from \nVermont has had abundant experience as a prosecutor in the law since he \nwas able to start his profession, the distinguished career in the \nSenate.\n\n  What will it take, in the Senator's mind, to finally say to the \nAmerican public that we get your message? We understand that you want \nto protect your children. And while people have the right to bear arms, \npeople have the right to bear children and send them to school hoping \nand believing that they are going to get home safely. When, I ask the \nSenator, does he think that message will get through these, I will call \nthem ``hollow halls,'' so that people will believe that they can send \ntheir children or their loved ones to the workplace or to school or to \nthe streets without being gunned down by someone who shouldn't have a \ngun?\n  Mr. LEAHY. It will only come, I say to my friend from New Jersey, \nwhen we realize that our children and our families are far more \nprecious to us than votes or campaign contributions. The Senator from \nVermont was long ago clear on that point. My wife, my children--my \nfamily--are far more important to me than any votes, any office, any \nlobbyist, any pressure, any favors, any campaign contributions, or \nanything else. I think most families in this country feel the same \nway--that the family is the most precious thing possible to them.\n  In this body we passed legislation that might protect those families. \nWe see the response on the other side of the Capitol of symbolism \ninstead of substance, of speeches or feel-good solutions. We cast the \ntough votes here. The Senator from New Jersey made sure that we did.\n  On this issue especially, can we not stand up and say our families \nare more important, our children are more important, our grandchildren \nare more important, and all of that is more important than a powerful \nlobby?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nUtah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a coauthor of the Hatch-\nLeahy-Biden-Sessions-Feinstein juvenile justice bill on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I have been very \nintrigued and interested in the remarks that have been made. I just \nwant everybody to know that I want to go to conference on this bill.\n  The Hatch-Leahy-Biden-Sessions-Feinstein bill is a very important \nbill. We all know it. We all know it is important. We all know that we \nneed to pass it this year.\n  Let me just say this: Leadership will, in my opinion, appoint \nconferees in July because I believe we have to do this.\n  I met just this week with leaders in both the House and the Senate--\nthe majority leader in the Senate and the Speaker of the House. I know \nthe intention is to appoint conferees and to have this matter resolved. \nMy hope is that we will pass a conference report before the August \nrecess.\n  No one wants this bill more than I do. It is an important bill.\n  To hear some of my colleagues speak, though, you would think that 99 \npercent of this bill is a gun control bill. I would say that a very \nsmall part of it involves guns, and the rest of it addresses in a \nserious way the very important issues we must confront regarding \njuvenile violence and juvenile justice. These are the truly critical \nparts of this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with the point that the Senator \nfrom Utah has made. There are an awful lot of things in the Senate-\npassed bill besides guns. There are some very major changes in the \nhandling of juvenile crimes, especially juvenile violent crimes, and \nmatters relating to the relationship between the Federal Government and \nState governments. There are some very significant things that should \nnot be overlooked and will be a part of the debate.\n  I was wondering if the Senator from Utah knows when the other body \nwill appoint conferees and how quickly we might appoint conferees?\n  Mr. HATCH. My feeling is that they will appoint conferees in July--\nboth leaders of the House and the Senate, the floor leaders--perhaps \nprior to the recess. My goal is to have this conference report voted on \nbefore we go out on the August recess; if not, then as soon as we can \nafter we get back, but I hope before the August recess.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I also hope, I might add--and I will not interrupt the \nSenator again--that we are able to come to a conclusion and agreement \non legislation that can be signed into law prior to the beginning of \nthe school year.\n  Mr. HATCH. It would be great if we could do that. That is my goal.\n  I thank my colleague for being willing to stand up on that point with \nme.\n  I voted against the Lautenberg amendment. I voted against it twice. \nNeither of those votes on Lautenberg\n\n[[Page S7860]]\n\nwon a majority of the Senate. But it finally passed with the tie-\nbreaking vote of Vice President Gore.\n  Still, I voted for the final bill. I have repeatedly made clear my \ndesire to pass this bill. This is not an empty exercise for me. This is \nan important bill. So there is no question about that.\n  Let me just say this: We have had a lot of crying, moaning, and \ngroaning about background checks at gun shows.\n  Let's just stop and think about it. If we had not had Brady, which \nrequired a 5-day waiting period, if we had not had this new demand for \na 3-day waiting period, we could have already had a responsible system \nin place. We spent so much time on 3- to 5-day waiting periods that we \nhaven't gotten the instant check system in place throughout the \ncountry. In other words, we haven't concentrated enough efforts on \nimplementing the one thing that will really help us to identify and \nweed out the felons and others who are disqualified to purchase guns in \nthe first place.\n\n  Some would rather concentrate their efforts on this phony waiting \nperiod issue than address the real problem of identifying those who \naren't allowed to own a firearm. The reason they would rather address \nthe phony issue of a 3-day waiting period at gun shows is because gun \nshows only take place for 3 days. If you have a 3-day delay, it means \nbasically there won't be any more gun shows.\n  What does that mean? This is pretty important stuff.\n  If you do not have the gun shows where legitimate, private sellers of \nguns can come and sell their weapons with appropriate background \nchecks, which everybody in this body is willing to do--I have led the \nfight to do it--if you do not allow that to happen, then the private \nsellers of weapons are going to go into the streets, and those guns \nwill all be sold on what will then be a much larger black market for \nguns.\n  We have that already in our society. We ought to minimize it. The \nbest way to do it is to have legitimate gun shows. There are some 4,000 \nof them in this country--legitimate gun shows where we have legitimate \nbackground checks that are done within a 24-hour period. And that will \nnever happen as long as we keep playing political games, and seeking \nthe political advantage that some people think they get by talking \nabout 1 day, 2 days, or 3 day waiting periods.\n  The key is to get an effective instant check system in place so we \nabsolutely instantly can tell whether the purchaser of this weapon is \nsomebody who is legitimately entitled to purchase the weapon.\n  Having said all of that, having made it very clear that we intend to \nhave conferees on this matter and that we intend to put this matter to \nbed, hopefully before the August recess, a lot depends on cooperation \nfrom the other side.\n  As we know, we have lost a week and a half because of delays on the \nother side because they want their legislation considered on their \nterms, regardless of how important the appropriations bills are. We \nhave had interference after interference on getting the work of the \nSenate done.\n  And as important as all of that is, I think it is important that the \nAmerican people know that the juvenile justice bill is about a lot more \nthan guns. That is a minuscule part of the bill. We are talking about \nprevention and enforcement and assistance to local and State \ngovernments.\n  S. 254, the Senate-passed bill, provides an infusion of funds to \nState and local authorities to combat juvenile crime.\n  S. 254 provides approximately $1.1 billion annually to fight juvenile \ncrime and prevent juvenile delinquency.\n  We have $500 million for a juvenile accountability incentive block \ngrant.\n  States can use this grant to implement graduated sentencing sanctions \nwhich intervene early with appropriate penalties, so that at the first \nsigns of delinquent or antisocial behavior take firm steps to get these \nkids back on the right track. They can build detention facilities for \njuvenile offenders, test juvenile offenders for drugs upon arrest, and \nrequire juvenile offenders to complete school or vocational training, \namong other reforms.\n  S. 254 provides a 25-percent earmark of the juvenile accountability \nblock grant for drug treatment, school counseling, and crime \nprevention. These are important, significant grants. They far supersede \nthis almost feckless debate about guns.\n  The Hatch-Leahy amendment provides $50 million for the States for \njuvenile judges, public defenders, and probation officers to reduce the \nbacklog of juvenile cases. That is important. The juvenile Brady \nprovision, which prohibits juveniles who commit a violent crime or \nserious drug felony as a juvenile from ever being able to buy a gun \nthereafter, is something almost everybody agrees with. We had it in the \nbill to begin with. We didn't need those on the far left who hate guns \nand who want gun control to tell us what to do in these matters.\n  There is $75 million annually to help States upgrade juvenile felony \nrecords and provide school officials access to such juvenile felony \nrecords in appropriate circumstances. This may be the most important \nreform in the bill, because it gets these records to the police and \nprosecutors and judges who need the information to appropriately deal \nwith repeat offenders.\n  There is $435 million annually to the States for programs to prevent \nkids from getting into crime. Some of these are specifically targeted \ntowards gangs in school. This is far more important than all of this \nharping about guns.\n  There is $40 million to assess the effectiveness of youth crime and \ndrug prevention efforts; a 3-year, $45 million demonstration project to \nprovide alternative education to at-risk or problem juveniles; and an \nextension of the violent crime reduction trust fund through 2005, to \nensure adequate funding for the administration of justice programs.\n  In S. 254, the Senate-passed bill takes action to empower parents, \nthe entertainment industry, and the general public to limit the \nexposure of children to violence. Specifically, this bill includes \nimportant provisions for the enforcement of industry rating systems.\n  The Hatch-Brownback amendment--and I commend my distinguished \ncolleague from Kansas for his leadership--to S. 254, which passed \noverwhelmingly, provides the entertainment industry with limited \nexemption from the antitrust laws. This provides the motion picture, \nrecording, and video game industries the freedom to develop and enforce \nvoluntary standards and enforcement mechanisms without fear of \nantitrust liability or government regulation. The Brownback-Hatch \namendment allows the appropriate industries to enter into joint \ndiscussions, consideration, and agreement to ensure retail compliance \nwith preexisting rating systems for both off-line and on-line content.\n  We have a provision regarding marketing violence to children. The \nBrownback-Hatch amendment to S. 254 directs the Justice Department and \nthe Federal Trade Commission to jointly examine the marketing practices \nof the video game, music, and motion picture industries to determine \nthe extent to which violent material is marketed to children. The FTC \nis directed to report their findings to Congress within 9 months of \nenactment. And while I am pleased that President Clinton belatedly \nendorsed this idea, I should note that the Senate passed this three \nweeks before the President said a word about it.\n  We have a National Institutes of Health study. The Brownback-Hatch \namendment to S. 254 provides $2 million in funding to the National \nInstitutes of Health to study the effects of violent entertainment on \nchildren. We know that is the cause of an awful lot of the problems.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have listened carefully to the Senator's speech in \nsupport of the juvenile justice bill. The Senator makes such a \ncompelling argument of how important this bill is, how we shouldn't \nwaste any time to move forward.\n  I ask the Senator, if that is his feeling and the feeling shared by \nMembers on his side of the aisle, why has the Republican leadership in \nthe House refused to appoint conferees?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have assurance from the House leaders they will appoint \nconferees.\n  Mr. DURBIN. They announced they will not appoint conferees until \nafter the Fourth of July.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is true. I know they have their hands full. I trust \nthe\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\nstatement of the leaders. If they do it then, that will be fine. That \nis consistent with what we have done in the past. I don't have any \nproblem with that.\n  Let me continue my remarks. The Hatch-Leahy amendment to S. 254, \nwhich passed overwhelmingly, encourages large Internet service \nproviders to offer screening/filtering software to empower parents to \nlimit access to material unsuitable for children. This amendment \nprovides that within 12 months of enactment, large Internet service \nproviders should provide the software either at no charge or at a fee \nnot exceeding the cost to them. That is a very important part of this \nbill.\n  We have an antiviolence public service campaign in this bill. The \nRepublican education amendment to S. 254 provides $25 million annually \nto the National Crime Prevention Council and community-based \norganizations for a national public service campaign to prevent \nviolence.\n  We have a provision on Internet bombmaking. The Hatch-Feinstein \namendment to S. 254 prohibits the teaching of bombmaking, including \nbombmaking instructions, on the Internet if there is reason to know the \nbomb will be used in violation of Federal law.\n  We also get tough on violent juveniles and other violent offenders. \nWe ensure that violent juveniles will be held accountable. Among other \nreforms, S. 254, with Republican amendments, contains the following: \nProject Cuff. The Hatch-Craig amendment provides $50 million to hire \nadditional Federal prosecutors to prosecute gun crimes in Federal court \nto take advantage of stiff Federal sentences.\n  We have full funding of the National Instant Check for background \nchecks for firearm purposes. That is something that had to be done. We \nhave not been concentrating on that as we should, because we keep \nplaying games on guns instead of doing what should be done.\n  We have an extension of the prohibition against juvenile possession \nof a handgun in the Youth Handgun Safety Act to semiautomatic rifles.\n  The juvenile Brady provision, which I have already mentioned, \nprohibits firearm possession by juveniles who commit violent offenses.\n  We have a bipartisan provision that requires safety locks or secure \ngun storage devices to be sold with a handgun.\n  We have a minimum of 12 years in prison for those who discharge a \nfirearm during the commission of a violent felony or drug trafficking \ncrime.\n  We have a minimum of 15 years in prison for those who injure a person \nduring the commission of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking \ncrime.\n  We have a minimum of 3 years in prison for first-time offenders and a \nminimum of 5 years in prison for repeat offenders for those who \ndistribute drugs to minors or sell drug in or near a school.\n  We have an increase in the maximum penalty for knowingly possessing, \ntransporting, or transferring stolen firearms, to 15 years in prison.\n  We have an increase in the maximum penalty to 20 years for a juvenile \nwho illegally brings a gun or ammunition to school with intent to carry \nor otherwise possess, discharge, or use the handgun or ammunition in \nthe commission of a violent felony.\n  We have an increase in penalties for illegal purchase of a firearm.\n  We have an increase in penalty for committing crimes of violence \nwhile wearing body armor.\n  We have a safe-and-secure-schools provision.\n  These are very important. One would think that everything comes down \nto the Lautenberg amendment. That amendment didn't pass overwhelmingly. \nIn fact, it didn't even have the support of a bare a majority in the \nSenate until the Vice President of the United States, as is his right, \nvoted to break the tie.\n\n\n                        Safe and Secure Schools\n\n  S. 254, with Republican amendments, will promote safe and secure \nschools, free of undue disruption and violence, so that our teachers \ncan teach and our children can learn. S. 254 includes the following:\n  Training for parents, teachers, and other interested members of the \ncommunity for the identification of--and appropriate responses to--\ntroubled and violent youth.\n  Innovative research-based delinquency and violence prevention and \nmentoring programs.\n  Assistance to state and local school districts for comprehensive \nschool security assessments.\n  Assistance to state and local school districts to purchase school \nsecurity equipment and technologies such as metal detectors, electronic \nlocks, and surveillance cameras.\n  Collaborative efforts with community-based organizations (including \nfaith-based organizations) and law-enforcement agencies to provide \neffective violence prevention and intervention programs.\n  Assistance to state and local school districts to establish and \nimplement school uniform policies.\n  Assistnce to state and local school districts to hire school resource \nofficers, including community police officers.\n  Incentives for States to detain juveniles found in possession of an \nillegal firearm for 24-hours to undergo evaluation.\n  Incentives for schools to make school discipline records available to \nall schools, whether private or public, when students transfer between \nschools.\n  Civil liability protection for teachers who discipline a violent \nstudent.\n  Resources to States and localities to create anonymous hotlines to \nreport possible acts of violence.\n  I say in closing, I have been assured we will have conferees after we \nget back from this next recess. My goal, of course, if we can and if we \nget some cooperation from the other side on the floor, is to have that \nbill up before the August recess, so we can have this bill passed and \nhopefully signed by the President before school begins this year.\n  I want to see that happen. It isn't going to happen if we keep \nplaying games on guns. There is no point kidding ourselves about it.\n  One side must not think they have a big advantage over the other on \nguns. We have to work in good faith to resolve these problems. And I \nbelieve we can. I have total confidence in my colleague, Senator Leahy \nfrom Vermont, who has worked with me assiduously on this matter. He has \nplayed a significant role.\n  Senator Biden and Senator Feinstein, also on the other side, have \nworked very hard to try to have this bill completed. I know my \ncolleague from Vermont and I will work very hard to get this bill done \nin the best way we possibly can that will bring everybody together in \nboth the House and Senate and hopefully get a bill signed by the \nPresident.\n  In any event, we intend to go forward. It is an important bill, \nprobably in some respects the most important bill in this whole session \nof Congress, when one considers the needs of our nation's children. We \nneed to address--as S. 254 does--ensuring safe schools, promoting ways \nto keep vile entertainment from our kids, preventing juvenile crime, \nand really addressing for the first time needed law enforcement with \nregard to violent juvenile crimes.\n  I think we have taken too much time on this. I know we have an \nimportant appropriations bill on the floor, so I yield the floor at \nthis time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, and my colleagues in urging the \nmajority to appoint conferees and proceed to conference on the juvenile \ncrime bill.\n  It has now been one month and four days since the Senate passed the \nViolent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation \nAct of 1999, by an overwhelming margin of 73-25. It has been nearly two \nweeks since the House of Representatives passed its counterpart bill.\n  And yet, since that time, there has been no progress at all toward \ngoing to conference on these two bills. In fact, it appears that there \nare some on the other side of the aisle who deliberately want to \nforestall or even de-rail the conference that is necessary to pass this \nvitally-needed legislation.\n  When the House passed its counterpart bill, they did something that \nis very unusual: they did not take up the Senate bill, insert the text \nof their bill, and request a conference, as is routinely done. This is \nnot the kind of thing that happens by accident. For a conference to \ntake place, both Chambers of Congress must pass the same bill.\n\n[[Page S7862]]\n\n  Because the House of Representatives did not do this, one of the two \nChambers must take up the other one's bill, pass it, and ask for a \nconference. This presents numerous opportunities for procedural \nmischief and delay by those who would rather not see any bill pass than \none containing modest gun safety provisions, such as the Senate bill.\n  Mr. President, I am very disturbed by this delay in taking the next \nstep to pass this important legislation.\n  Our nation was rocked 2 months ago by the tragic shootings at \nColumbine High School in Colorado, coming as it did in the wake of \nearlier school shootings in Jonesboro, Arkansas; West Paducah, \nKentucky; Springfield, Oregon; and elsewhere. We cannot tolerate or \nevade this shocking school violence. We should not let our children \nstart a new school year without passing this important legislation to \naddress youth violence.\n  The Senate bill is a wide, sweeping measure, which will help us to \nconfront the problem of juvenile crime. It includes a number of \nprovisions which I authored and which I have worked on for several \nyears, including:\n  A ban on importing high capacity ammunition magazines;\n  A ban on juvenile possession of assault weapons and high capacity \nammunition magazines;\n  A comprehensive package of measures to fight criminal gangs;\n  Limits on bombmaking information;\n  The James Guelff Body Armor Act, which contains reforms to take body \narmor out of the hands of criminals and put it into the hands of \npolice; and\n  Crime prevention programs.\n  It also contains other modest reforms to keep guns out of the hands \nof criminals and children, including: Requiring the same background \nchecks at gun shows which gun dealers have to preform; and requiring \nthe sale of child safety locks with handguns.\n  The Senate bill also establishes a new $700 million juvenile justice \nblock grant program for states and localities, representing a \nsignificant increase in federal aid to the states for juvenile crime \ncontrol programs, including:\n  Additional law enforcement and juvenile court personnel;\n  Juvenile detention facilities; and\n  Prevention programs to keep juveniles out of trouble to begin with.\n  Our bill encourages increased accountability for juveniles, through \nthe implementation of graduated sanctions to ensure that subsequent \noffenses are treated with increasing severity.\n  It reforms juvenile record systems, through improved record keeping \nand increased access to juvenile records by police, courts, and \nschools, so that a court or school dealing with a juvenile in \nCalifornia can know if he has committed violent offenses in Arizona; \nand extends federal sentences for juveniles who commit serious violent \nfelonies.\n  Let us not delay further in enacting these important measures. I join \nmy colleagues in urging the majority to proceed to conference and \nappoint conferees, so that we can enact this vital legislation.\n  I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been 71 days--71 days --since the \ntragic shooting at Columbine High School. There are 69 days left before \nschool children in Massachusetts and other states go back to school. It \nis time for Congress to finish the job we began last month and pass \njuvenile justice legislation. Communities across America are waiting \nfor our answer.\n  We need to provide communities with the assistance they need to \nreduce youth violence.\n  We need to help parents struggling to raise their children from birth \nthrough adolescence.\n  We need to help teachers and school officials recognize the early \nwarning signals and act before violence occurs.\n  We need to assist law enforcement officers in keeping guns away from \nchildren.\n  We need to close the gun show loophole.\n  We need to require the sale of safety locks with all firearms.\n  The Senate passed such legislation with overwhelming support last \nmonth. The House of Representatives passed its own version of this \nlegislation earlier this month. It is time to appoint House and Senate \nconferees to write the final bill and send it to the President, so that \neffective legislation is in place as soon as possible.\n  Everyday we delay, this critical problem continues to fester. \nChildren are under assault from violence and neglect--from the break-up \nof families--from the temptations of alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse--\nfrom violence in the media. These are not new problems, but they have \nbecome increasingly serious problems, and Congress cannot look the \nother way and continue to ignore them.\n  We must support youth, parents, educators, law enforcement \nauthorities, and communities. The public overwhelmingly supports more \neffective steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and \njuveniles. We cannot accept ``no'' for an answer from the National \nRifle Association. It is long past time for Congress to face up to this \nchallenge. The tragedy at Columbine High School is an urgent call to \naction to every member of Congress. Will we finally do what it takes to \nkeep children safe, or will we continue to sleepwalk through this \nworsening crisis of gun violence in our schools and our society.\n  We have a national crisis, and common sense approaches are urgently \nneeded. If we are serious about dealing with youth violence, the time \nto act is now. There is no reason why this Congress can not pass a \ncomprehensive juvenile justice bill before the August recess. The \ncitizens of this country deserve better than what Congress has given \nthem so far.\n  The lack of action is appalling and inexcusable. We cannot continue \nto whistle past the graveyards of Littleton and the many other \ncommunities scarred by juvenile gun violence in recent years. Each new \ntragedy is a fresh indictment of our failure to act responsibly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7862-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7862-S7867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--Continued\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the hour of 1 o'clock having arrived, \nall the amendments to this bill have now been filed. I, at this point, \nwill consult with Senator Leahy about how we proceed, but in all \nlikelihood we should be able to finish this bill by mid to late \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1119\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wanted to address the body on several \nof the discussion points that were raised today regarding an amendment \nI filed. I inquire first of the President, what is the pending \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is the McConnell amendment to the \namendment of the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Then I will not have to ask the pending business be \nset aside. We are still on that.\n  I wanted to address several of the issues my colleagues have raised, \nthat the negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan that are taking \nplace in the so-called Minsk Group are at a very delicate time period \nand the repeal of section 907, as addressed in the McConnell-Abraham \namendment, would upset the delicate negotiations at this point in time.\n  Frankly, it is just not true that these negotiations are at a \ndelicate point in time now and this amendment would do that. The \npresent conflict has been going on since the dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion, and a cease-fire has been in effect since 1994. The U.S. \nGovernment is one of the peace group cochairs, along with Russia and \nFrance, and they all--the U.S. Government, the Clinton administration--\nfavor repeal or waiver of section 907.\n  The amendment I put forward prevents our Government from being an \nhonest broker in the peace process. We have letters from Secretary \nAlbright and the administration on this.\n  Russia is involved, and not in a helpful way. Their handiwork in \nretaining influences in the Caucasus is only slightly less obvious than \ntheir efforts to help out in Kosovo--in some situations where they were \nnot helpful at all. Russian military troops are still based in Armenia \nand were providing military support and munitions supplies to Armenia \nduring the war with Azerbaijan.\n\n[[Page S7863]]\n\n  The argument in support of the status quo has nothing to do with the \nsensitivities of the ongoing peace talks. The last real peace \ninitiative where there was a real push was in 1997, calling for \nArmenia's withdrawal from the occupied territories in exchange for \nnormalization of trade with Azerbaijan. This was rejected by Armenia.\n  The continued status quo in Armenia's favor is nothing less than the \nArmenian Government's attempt to influence U.S. foreign policy and \npreserve an undue advantage. It really is that simple. Azerbaijan is \nthe only country in the former Soviet Union that has unilateral \nsanctions from the United States. Again, we do not lift them; we just \nprovide waiver authority for section 907.\n  So those arguments being raised by my colleagues are simply not \naccurate. Also, they talk about the issue of the blockade: Somehow \nAzerbaijan is blockading Armenia. I want to show a map on this point so \npeople can get a look, again, at the region and what this so-called \nblockade is about.\n  Here is Azerbaijan. Here is Armenia. Here is the area in dispute. \nArmenia is occupying 20 percent of the landmass of Azerbaijan. The \nUnited Nations has condemned this action by Armenia. OSCE, the group \nmuch involved in negotiation, condemns the action by Armenia.\n  You can see Armenia has outlets they can use through Iran or through \nGeorgia, which is up here. So there is not a blockade on Armenia. What \nthe so-called blockade is, and has been for a long period of time, is a \nmutual border closing caused by Armenia's continued illegal occupation \nof Azerbaijan.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will look at the map, look at the situation, \nread the U.N. resolutions, the OSCE resolutions about Armenia occupying \n20 percent of Azerbaijan, and quickly and clearly conclude that this \nblockade is really a mutual border closing caused by Armenia and its \nillegal occupation of Azerbaijan. That, plus the difficulties caused by \nArmenia's mining of some of the overland routes through the buffer zone \nsurrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, are probably some of the most serious \nlogistical obstacles in the blockade.\n  So I point these out to my colleagues, those who are saying this is a \nsensitive time. We had a cease-fire for 5 years. It is not that the \ngovernment is involved in trying to negotiate a true peace and wants \n907 to be repealed so the United States can be an honest broker in this \npeace process and not one-sided on it. The Clinton administration, and \nBush administration prior to that, opposed section 907. And the \nblockade is really not a blockade at all.\n  Mr. President, I ask at this time to set aside the pending amendment, \nSenator McConnell's amendment, so I can call up an amendment.\n  I will call up amendment No. 1170. This is an amendment I talked \nabout previously on Sudan. I would like to have that considered. I ask \nunanimous consent that we set aside the pending amendment so I can call \nup amendment No. 1170.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1170\n\n    (Purpose: To make available international disaster assistance, \n   humanitarian assistance, and development assistance in opposition-\n                       controlled areas of Sudan)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1170.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INTERNATIONAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR OPPOSITION-\n                   CONTROLLED AREAS OF SUDAN.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, of the funds \n     made available under chapter 9 of part I of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (relating to international disaster \n     assistance) for fiscal year 2000, up to $4,000,000 should be \n     made available for rehabilitation and economic recovery in \n     opposition-controlled areas of Sudan. Such funds are to be \n     used to improve economic governance, primary education, \n     agriculture, and other locally-determined priorities. Such \n     funds are to be programmed and implemented jointly by the \n     United States Agency for International Development and the \n     Department of Agriculture, and may be utilized for activities \n     which can be implemented for a period of up to two years.\n\n     SEC. __. HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR SUDANESE INDIGENOUS \n                   GROUPS.\n\n       The President, acting through the appropriate Federal \n     agencies, is authorized to provide humanitarian assistance, \n     including food, directly to the National Democratic Alliance \n     participants and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement \n     operating outside of the Operation Lifeline Sudan structure.\n\n     SEC. __. DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE FOR OPPOSITION-CONTROLLED \n                   AREAS OF SUDAN.\n\n       (a) Increase in Development Assistance.--The President, \n     acting through the United States Agency for International \n     Development, is authorized to increase substantially the \n     amount of development assistance for capacity building, \n     democracy promotion, civil administration, judiciary, and \n     infrastructure support in opposition-controlled areas of \n     Sudan.\n       (b) Quarterly Report.--The President shall submit a report \n     on a quarterly basis to the Congress on progress made in \n     carrying out subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is an amendment we have been \nnegotiating back and forth. I indicated briefly that we wanted to bring \nit up if we could not get a negotiated agreement. We are proceeding \nlater on in the day. I know the people in charge of the bill want to \nmove this amendment, so I called this amendment up to get it as the \npending business so people can discuss it.\n  I have discussed this earlier. I do not seek to take up an \nextraordinary amount of time to discuss it. It would make available \ninternational disaster assistance, humanitarian assistance, and \ndevelopment assistance in the opposition-controlled areas of the Sudan.\n  I recently led a congressional delegation to the region. The \ngovernment in Khartoum is a terrorist regime. That is according to the \nU.S. State Department. They have in their country the worst \nhumanitarian situation in the world. That is according to Brian Atwood, \nhead of USAID--the worst in the world. There were nearly 2 million \npeople killed in 10 years, over 4 million internally displaced. This is \nthrough forced, manmade famine and starvation. This is by bombing, \nindiscriminate civilian bombing by the government in Khartoum.\n  It is exporting terrorism. It has housed Osama bin Laden until 1997. \nThey house a number of terrorist groups in Khartoum. They are \nsupporting terrorism and spreading throughout the region a sort of \nmilitant terrorism--in the Congo, Eritrea, Uganda, and other places. \nThey seem to seek to be the African edge of the militant terrorism. The \npeople attempting to kill President Mubarak in Egypt were given housing \nand aid and abetting in Sudan by this government. This is a bad regime. \nThis amendment simply seeks to provide humanitarian assistance to those \nopposition-controlled areas and the opposition groups.\n  Here, again, is the list of items the government in Khartoum, the \nSudan Government, is doing today. I have talked about these. Most \nrecently, last year, 100,000 people, according to the U.S. Committee on \nRefugees, were killed by a man-induced famine, induced by the Khartoum \ngovernment. They would not let our disaster relief planes fly into the \nregion. They said no.\n  It is time we allowed aid to go to the resistance groups that are \nfighting just for dignity and for their own lives. This is a simple \namendment. It is a modification to the one we previously called up. I \ndo not know of any objection to this, and as soon as the manager of the \namendment can perhaps come to the floor, I would simply like to ask for \nthe yeas and nays on this amendment and have us vote on it because I \nthink it is a worthwhile amendment. While that is being taken care of, \nI ask unanimous consent that Senator Helms be added as a cosponsor to \nthis amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have discussed this with Senator \nFrist, who chairs the subcommittee, who also has traveled to Sudan and \nknows of the situation taking place in that region. That is why this is \nan important issue for us to take up now. This is the appropriate \nvehicle. It is\n\n[[Page S7864]]\n\nproviding aid to the southern resistance movement. Actually now it is \nnot just southern, it is all over the country.\n  We can move the vote to a later point, but I ask for the yeas and \nnays on amendment No. 1170.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second at this time.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. At the appropriate time, when we can get a sufficient \nsecond, I will be asking for the yeas and nays on this amendment so we \ncan have a vote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thomas pertaining to the introduction of S. 1305 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Brownback amendment No. 1170.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1165\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding assistance \n              provided to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be set aside and that amendment No. 1165 be called up for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Roberts, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, and Mr. Cleland, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1165.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        On page 128, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO \n                   LITHUANIA, LATVIA, AND ESTONIA.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that nothing in this Act, or \n     Senate Report No. 106-81, relating to assistance provided to \n     Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia under the Foreign Military \n     Financing Program, should be interpreted as expressing the \n     will of the Senate to accelerate membership of those nations \n     into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is \nbeing offered on behalf of myself, Senator Roberts, Senator Bob Smith, \nand Senator Max Cleland as well.\n  It is, I believe, an important amendment. It is also an amendment \nthat will be accepted. That is my expectation. We don't have a final \ndecision on that, but we hope that is the result.\n  This year's foreign operations appropriations bill designates $20 \nmillion in foreign military financing grant assistance to Lithuania, \nLatvia, and Estonia, the Baltic States. I am not concerned about the \nfact that we are designating funds for those states. I am concerned \nabout the provision because of the intent that appears to lie behind \nthe funding.\n  Let me quote from the committee report. It says in the committee \nreport:\n\n       The assistance accelerates Baltic states integration into \n     NATO and supports these democracies as they enhance military \n     capabilities and adopt NATO standards.\n\n  This amendment I have offered, with the help of the three other \nSenators I mentioned, would state that nothing in this bill concerning \nthe foreign military financing intended to support the legitimate \nsecurity needs of the Baltic States should be interpreted as also \nexpressing the intent of the Senate to accelerate the membership of \nthose countries into NATO.\n  We recently observed the 50th anniversary of NATO, welcomed three new \nmembers into the alliance: the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary. I \nvoted for the admission of those three into the alliance on this \nhistoric occasion. No other nations were admitted to the alliance, nor \nwas there a commitment made to extend an invitation to any particular \nnation to join in the future.\n  The language contained in the Senate report accompanying the bill \nsuggests that the military financing authorized in the bill would be \nfor the express purpose of accelerating the integration of those states \ninto NATO. I believe that language is premature. I believe it is ill-\nadvised at this time. Let me try to give a few indications as to why.\n  Many of my colleagues share the concern, which we have heard on the \nfloor, about the future of the NATO alliance. We, obviously, value NATO \nand its contributions to peace. We fervently intend that it continue to \nbe a force for peace in the future.\n  Recent events within the alliance have raised some concern. Despite \nthe recent military victory in Kosovo, there is some evidence that the \nalliance may not be totally healthy at this stage.\n  While the bombing campaign continued in Yugoslavia, for example, \nthere were divisions among NATO members. Those were worked through.\n  In addition, there is a major debate now underway concerning the \nequity of the burdens that different members of NATO have, both \nfinancial burdens and military burdens.\n  I am not suggesting we debate the future of NATO today, although I do \nbelieve the Senate should soon review the Strategic Concept that is \nbeing proposed to guide future NATO potential military involvements.\n  I am suggesting, however, that legislative provisions, such as the \none I have called attention to today in this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, could prematurely complicate the very difficult problems \nthe alliance is facing. I don't believe anybody here would deny that a \ndebate concerning the membership of the Baltic nations in NATO is \nlikely to be a spirited one. This bill is not the appropriate venue for \nthat debate to take place.\n  I have reviewed, by the way, the Baltic charter that was signed in \nJanuary 1998 to determine if I missed something with respect to the \nmembership of the Baltic nations in NATO. There are many affirming \nwords in the charter about cooperation between NATO and the Baltic \nnations, and there are several encouraging references with respect to \npossible future membership of those countries in the alliance. But \nthere are no words that commit NATO to offering membership or to \naccelerating their integration of those nations into the alliance.\n  The provision in the bill that would provide military assistance to \nthe Baltic nations for that specific purpose is not grounded in a \npolicy that I believe we should embrace at this time.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate amendment I offer would permit foreign \nmilitary financing to meet the security needs of the Baltic nations, \nbut it does not commit the Senate, as a result of that assistance, to \ncommit itself to approval or acceleration of the membership of the \nBaltic nations into NATO.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the amendment. I believe it is in \nour national interest and in the security interests of Europe as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the bill before us includes increased \nForeign Military Financing funding to help Estonia, Latvia, and \nLithuania improve their militaries. The Baltic countries need to \nimprove their military posture whether or not they join the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). But the fact is that they do \naspire to join NATO, and all three countries will be working to meet \ngoals in NATO's Membership Action Plans for each country.\n  My colleagues Senators Bingaman, Roberts, Bob Smith, and Cleland have \noffered an amendment that says that nothing in the bill ``should be \ninterpreted as expressing the will of the Senate to accelerate \nmembership of those nations into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n(NATO).'' However, the Senate can do nothing to invite the Baltic \ncountries or any other\n\n[[Page S7865]]\n\naspiring country to join NATO. Only NATO can invite countries to join. \nWhen they are ready to join, and if they are invited to join, the \nSenate would have to vote to approve amending the NATO treaty to accept \nfurther NATO expansion.\n  The Foreign Military Financing funding can serve to accelerate the \nBaltic countries' efforts to meet NATO criteria, but the decision to \ninvite them to join NATO remains a political one that will be made by \nNATO's nineteen member states. The Baltic states could do nothing to \nbecome NATO ready and be invited--or they could become modern-day \nSpartas and still not be asked to join NATO; that decision is up to \nNATO.\n  The Senate has already expressed its opinion in Section 2703 of the \nEuropean Security Act of 1998 that was included in last year's Omnibus \nAppropriations bill that ``It is the sense of Congress that Romania, \nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria . . . (C) upon complete \nsatisfaction of all relevant criteria should be invited to become full \nNATO members at the earliest possible date.'' In other words, the \nSenate and House of Representatives have already said that when the \nBaltic countries are ready to join NATO, they should be invited to \njoin.\n  Thus I fail to see the usefulness of the amendment offered by my \ncolleagues today. I particularly regret that the amendment has singled \nout Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia when in fact there are many NATO \naspirants, including Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Albania, \nand the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\n  The Baltic countries have made enormous strides in transforming \nthemselves into free market democracies. They have embraced civilian \ncontrol of their militaries, have participated in international \npeacekeeping, and have demonstrated their ability to operate with the \nmilitary forces of NATO countries under NATO standards, spending \nprecious resources to do so. I believe we must follow through and do \nall we can to convince our NATO allies that the Baltic states should be \ninvited.\n  The United States' position on further expansion is that NATO should \nhave an open door policy and that geography should be no barrier to \nmembership. Russia need not feel threatened by the NATO membership of \nthe three tiny Baltic states--they can do nothing to threaten the \nenormous and powerful Russian Federation. And right now Russia has no \nhostile intent toward them. But should Russia turn away from democracy, \nand if an expansionist autocrat were to come to power once again, NATO \nmembership for Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia would make a powerful \nstatement that the United States and Europe will never again accept \nbuffer-state subjugation of the Baltic states.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am greatly dismayed by and strongly \nopposed to the amendment introduced by Senator Bingaman that seeks to \nexpress the Sense of the Senate that the Baltic States of Estonia, \nLatvia and Lithuania should not receive accelerated consideration for \nmembership in NATO. This amendment most assuredly does not reflect the \nviews of this Senator, and I am certain that of many more of my \ncolleagues.\n  I fail to comprehend the purpose in singling-out these independent \nnations in this manner. It appears to this Senator, after reviewing \nboth the Foreign Appropriations bill and accompanying report, that \nthere is nothing contained in either document that should provoke the \noffering of this amendment.\n  It is my firm belief that the NATO alliance can benefit from the \ninclusion of new Central and East European nations, including the three \nBaltic states. The Baltic peoples have asked for and deserve protection \nfrom foreign invasion, and are willing to join the NATO security \nalliance to protect other European nations in need of help.\n  Future NATO membership for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is essential \nto their safety and prosperity. Security concerns will take precedence \nover continued democratic and economic reforms if the Baltics continue \nto exist, unprotected, in the shadow of an increasingly nationalistic \nRussia.\n  The United States should and must be vigilant in our efforts to \nextend NATO's reach to all democratic nations in Europe who cannot \nprotect themselves. If we leave these nations exposed to the risk of \nforeign invasion and influence, the gains made in expanding democracy \nand freedom around the world will be vulnerable to erosion. The United \nStates must continue to set an example for the world as a promoter and \nprotector of democratic freedom. As victors in the Cold War, we have \nnever had a greater opportunity than this to show democracy's enemies \nthat we have the courage and the will to stand firm against them. NATO \nexpansion is of vital importance to the future of democracy.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico can only have a \nnegative effect on the United States's efforts to expand and protect \ndemocratic development in Central and Eastern Europe. To punitively \nsingle-out these three nations as they strive to protect their right to \nindependence and freedom, following decades of Soviet domination, is \nneither constructive, nor in the interests of the United States. It is \nmy sincere hope that this language will not be included in the final \nForeign Operations Appropriations bill passed by Congress for Fiscal \nYear 2000.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is there an amendment pending now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Which amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1165, submitted by the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside temporarily so that I may introduce this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1179\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Harkin, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1179.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following new \n     section:\n\n\n                    SELF-DETERMINATION IN EAST TIMOR\n\n       Sec.   . (a) The President, Secretary of State, Secretary \n     of Defense, and the Secretary of the Treasury (acting through \n     United States executive directors to international financial \n     institutions) should immediately intensify their efforts to \n     prevail upon the Indonesian Government and military to--\n       (1) disarm and disband anti-independence militias in East \n     timor;\n       (2) grant full access to East Timor by international human \n     rights monitors, humanitarian organizations, and the press;\n       (3) allow Timorese who have been living in exile to return \n     to East Timor to campaign for and participate in the ballot; \n     and\n       (4) release all political prisoners.\n       (b) The President shall submit a report to Congress not \n     later than 15 days after passage of this Act, containing a \n     description of the Administration's efforts and his \n     assessment of efforts made by the Indonesian Government and \n     military to fulfill the steps described in paragraph (a).\n       (c) The Secretary of the Treasury shall direct the United \n     States executive directors to international financial \n     institutions to take into account the extent of efforts made \n     by the Indonesian Government and military to fulfill the \n     steps described in paragraph (a), in determining their vote \n     on any loan or financial assistance to Indonesia.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to express \nstrong support for a peaceful process of self-determination in East \nTimor.\n  The Indonesian Government has a historic opportunity to resolve a \nconflict that has been the cause of suffering and instability for 23 \nyears.\n  It has made a commitment to vote on August 21st on East Timor's \nfuture, and has recognized its responsibility to ensure that the vote \nis free and fair.\n  On May 5, when I introduced a similar resolution, I remarked on \nIndonesia's accomplishments in the past year: President Suharto \nrelinquished power; the Indonesian Government endorsed a vote on \nautonomy; and the United Nations, Portugal and Indonesia signed agreed \non the procedures for that vote.\n  There has been more progress in the past month. Democratic elections \nhave\n\n[[Page S7866]]\n\nbeen held, the first members of an international observer mission and \npolice force arrived in East Timor, and Nobel laureate Jose Romos Horta \nwas invited to return to Jakarta for the first time in 24 years.\n  A year ago few people would have predicted that a settlement of East \nTimor's future would be in sight. However, there is deep concern that \nAugust 21st is quickly approaching, and the violence in East Timor will \nmake a free and fair vote impossible.\n  In fact, the vote, initially scheduled for August 8th, was postponed \nby the United Nations until August 21st because of the violence.\n  Hundreds of civilians have been killed, injured, or disappeared in \nongoing violence by anti-independence militias armed by members of the \nIndonesian military who want to sabotage the vote.\n  Human rights monitors and humanitarian organizations continue to face \nproblems gaining access to the island, and members of the press have \nbeen threatened.\n  This amendment calls on the administration to immediately intensify \nits efforts to prevail upon the Indonesian Government to disarm and \ndisband the anti-independence militias, grant full access to \nhumanitarian organizations, and allow Timorese who have been living in \nexile to return home.\n  It directs the United State executive directors to international \nfinancial institutions to use their influence to encourage the \nIndonesian Government and military to create a stable and secure \nenvironment for the vote.\n  We should use all the resources at our disposal to convince the \nIndonesians to stop the violence. This is not only their \nresponsibility, it is in their interests. If the Indonesian military \nsucceeds in sabotaging the vote, Indonesia will face international \ncondemnation.\n  On June 11th, I and other Members of Congress wrote to World Bank \nPresident James Wolfensohn about the need for the World Bank to use its \nleverage with the Indonesian Government.\n  Mr. President, the world community has recognized the urgency of this \nsituation. An international monitoring and police presence throughout \nEast Timor is critical to creating a secure environment.\n  The administration is already helping to pay the costs of the U.N. \nmonitors and police, and they have made some progress in stemming the \nviolence.\n  But far more needs to be done. It is time for the Indonesian \nGovernment and military to do their part--to act decisively to ensure \nthat a free and fair vote can occur.\n  This amendment reinforces what others have said and what the \nIndonesian Government has already committed to do. It should be \nunanimously supported.\n  Mr. President, yesterday more than 100 anti-independence militiamen \nsurrounded a newly opened United Nation's office in the East Timorese \ntown of Maliana. Hurling rocks, the mob injured a diplomat from South \nAfrica and at least a dozen Timorese who sought refuge inside the \noffice. The U.N. building also sustained considerable damage.\n  In recent months I have spoken out about the escalating violence in \nEast Timor on numerous occasions. I am offering an amendment today \nabout the situation there.\n  The Indonesian Government and military have pledged to establish a \nsafe and secure environment prior to the August 21st ballot on East \nTimor's political status. This alarming incident is a clear example \nthat the Indonesian Government and military are not living up to their \nobligations. It is a clear example that their failure to act is having \nand will continue to have international consequences.\n  This latest attack suggests that despite the May 5th tripartite \nagreement, the presence of an international observer mission and police \nforce and recent negotiations between the opposing factions about how \nto stem the violence, the situation is continuing to deteriorate. It \ncould jeopardize the entire peace process.\n  The East Timorese have endured over 20 years of violence and \nrepression. The international community has committed its resources to \nhelping ensure that a free and fair ballot can be conducted. The United \nNations has firmly stated that it has a job to do in East Timor and it \nwill not be chased off by intimidation and harassment.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that this violent attack will sound the \nalarm to the Indonesian government and military that they have an \nhistoric opportunity to finally establish peace in East Timor and that \nthey must act immediately or it will be lost.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will soon send two amendments to the \ndesk, one by the occupant of the chair, Senator Voinovich, related to \ndesignation of Serbia as a terrorist state, and the other by Senator \nBiden, both of which have been cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1180 and 1181\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes \n     amendments numbered 1180 and 1181.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1180\n\n       To Sec. 525.--Designation of Serbia as a Terrorist State \n     add:\n       (C) This section would become null and void should the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (other than Montenegro and \n     Kosova) complete a democratic reform process that brings \n     about a newly elected government that respects the rights of \n     ethnic minorities, is committed to the rule of law and \n     respects the sovereignty of its neighbor states.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1181\n\n          (Purpose: To allocate funds for the Iraq Foundation)\n\n       On page 128, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR THE IRAQ FOUNDATION.\n\n       Of the funds made available by this Act for activities of \n     Iraqi opposition groups designated under the Iraqi Liberation \n     Act (Public Law 105-338). $250,000 shall be made available \n     for the Iraq Foundation.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two \namendments be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1180 and 1181) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1179\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, are we now back on the Leahy amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). That is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, to offer this amendment to \nencourage a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. This \namendment closely mirrors what he and I and several other Senators \nexpressed in Senate Resolution 96, and in a similar amendment to the \nState Department authorization bill. We are offering this amendment \ntoday to again highlight the significance of the process underway in \nEast Timor that will once and for all determine its political status.\n  I want to commend the members of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee \nfor including language relating to East Timor in the committee report \naccompanying this bill. I believe it is important that the Senate go on \nrecord regarding its support for the forthcoming ballot and in \ncondemnation of the violence surrounding this historic vote.\n  As we all know, Indonesian President Habibie announced on January 27 \nthat the Government of Indonesia was finally willing to seek to learn \nand respect the wishes of the people in that territory. On May 5, the \nGovernments of Indonesia and Portugal signed an\n\n[[Page S7867]]\n\nagreement to hold a United Nations- supervised ``consultation'' on \nAugust 8 to determine East Timor's future political status. This ballot \nhas since been postponed to an as yet undetermined date in late August.\n  Despite the positive step forward that the ballot represents, \nexcitement and tension over the possibility of gaining independence \nhave in recent months led to a gross deterioration of the security \nsituation. Militias, comprised of individuals determined to intimidate \nthe East Timorese people into support for continued integration with \nIndonesia and widely believed to be supported by the Indonesian \nmilitary, are responsible for a sharp increase in violence.\n  Just this week, members of a pro-Jakarta civilian militia attacked a \nUnited Nations regional headquarters in the Maliana township in East \nTimor. Several people, including a U.N. election officer, were wounded. \nThis is latest in a string of violent incidents that have been linked \nto pro-Jakarta militias. Mr. President, this kind of violence and \nintimidation cannot be tolerated, especially at this crucial time.\n  In the May 5 agreement, the Government of Indonesia agreed to take \nresponsibility for ensuring that the ballot is carried out in a fair \nand peaceful way. Unfortunately, it is unclear that they are \nimplementing this aspect of the agreement. Quite the opposite. Whether \nIndonesian troops have actually participated in some of these incidents \nor not, the authorities certainly most accept the blame for allowing, \nand in some cases encouraging, the bloody tactics of the pro-\nintegration militias. The continuation of this violence is a threat to \nthe very sanctity and legitimacy of the process that is underway. Thus, \nthe Leahy-Feingold amendment specifically calls on Jakarta to do all it \ncan to seek a peaceful process and a fair resolution to the situation \nin East Timor.\n  Mr. President, I believe the United States has a responsibility--an \nobligation--to put as much pressure as possible on the Indonesian \ngovernment to help encourage an environment conducive to a free, fair, \npeaceful ballot process for the people of East Timor. I am pleased that \nwe have taken a leadership role in offering technical, financial, and \ndiplomatic support to the recently authorized U.N. Assistance Mission \nin East Timor, known as UNAMET.\n  Mr. President, it is not in our power to guarantee the free, fair \nexercise of the rights of the people of East Timor to determine their \nfuture. It is, however, in our interest to do all that we can to work \nwith the United Nations, other concerned countries, the government of \nIndonesia and the people of East Timor to create an opportunity for a \nsuccessful ballot process. We cannot forget that the Timorese have been \nliving with violence and oppression for more than 23 years. These many \nyears have not dulled the desire of the East Timorese for freedom, or \nquieted their demands to have a role in the determination of East \nTimor's status.\n  We have to do all we can to support an environment that can produce a \nfair ballot in East Timor. Now. And throughout the rest of this \nprocess.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Vermont. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise in very strong opposition to the \namendment offered to this legislation by my colleague from Kansas, \nSenator Brownback. I am supportive of the amendment offered by the \nchairman of the subcommittee to the Brownback amendment, the second-\ndegree amendment. But I want to address the Brownback amendment for \njust a few minutes here. In the course of doing that, I will underscore \nwhy I am supportive of the chairman's amendment and why I oppose the \nBrownback amendment.\n  The Brownback amendment is similar to legislation that was considered \nby the Foreign Relations Committee in May. That bill was reported out \non a voice vote, but six members of the committee--six members--joined \nin submitting minority views in opposition to several of its major \nprovisions. It had been my expectation that if this issue were to come \nup, it would come up in the course of calling up that bill, which is on \nthe calendar, has been reported out of committee. That is the normal \nway one would expect to deal with substantive legislation.\n  What we are confronted with here is an effort to attach this \namendment to an appropriations bill. Of course, we all know the \nproblems that are connected with doing that. It slows down the \nappropriations process. You often engage in major issues of substantive \ncontent, which really ought to involve the substantive committees, and, \ninstead, it is shifted into the appropriations context. One would have \nto be naive not to appreciate that it is done on occasion, but I don't \nthink it is a good idea.\n  I must say, my view here on this matter is, in part, influenced by \nthat. In other words, it is not as though the bill that came out of \ncommittee, which we considered and debated, on which we had a vote and \non which some of us were in the minority, the bill went out, and it has \nbeen placed on the calendar. It is not as if that bill is before us--\nsubstantive legislation. Instead, what we have now is an amendment that \ntakes most of the content of that bill and seeks to add it as an \namendment to the appropriations bill.\n  This isn't an amendment that deals with numbers and figures. It is \nnot, in effect, an amendment that falls clearly within the bailiwick of \nthe appropriators. This is an amendment that really deals with a very \nimportant substantive issue of national policy. Senator Brownback \nproposes to change it, to take out of the law a provision that is now \nin the law. I think it is very important to understand that. In other \nwords, the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Kansas \nwould make a major alteration in existing law, and it would seek to do \nit, as I have indicated, in the context of considering the \nappropriations legislation.\n  I can remember a time in this body where efforts to do that alone \nwere reason enough to oppose an amendment. It was not too long ago. In \nother words,\n\n[[Page S7868]]\n\nefforts to really put in the appropriations context major changes in \nsubstantive law would be met with the contention that this should be \ndealt with by the substantive committee and ought not to be intruded \ninto the appropriations process, that we should not ``legislate on an \nappropriations bill.'' How many times have we heard that \nphrase? Particularly, it seems to me when the legislation is on the \ncalendar, it is available at an appropriate time to be considered by \nthis body, in the proper context, where we could have the major debate, \nwhich I think this provision requires with respect to the substance of \nU.S. policy.\n\n  Now, one of the things this proposed amendment does, which represents \na major shift in policy, is the impact it would have on section 907 of \nthe Freedom Support Act, which addresses the question of government-to-\ngovernment aid to Azerbaijan, so long as they maintain a blockade on \nArmenia. Section 907 precludes such aid.\n  This amendment, in effect, would remove that provision in the law. To \nthe credit of the chairman of the committee, he has offered an \namendment that would knock out that provision. If that were to prevail, \nit would significantly reduce my concerns about this amendment, \nalthough I have some other concerns, not of the same magnitude as this \none.\n  Let me address a couple of questions here. Section 907, in my \njudgment, made sense when it was enacted, and it continues to make \nsense today. To waive it in the absence of any progress toward a \nlifting of the blockade would reward the Government of Azerbaijan for \nits intransigence and remove a major incentive for good-faith \nnegotiations from one side in the conflict between Azerbaijan and \nArmenia.\n  For nearly a decade, the Government of Azerbaijan has prevented the \ntransport of food, fuel, medicine--let me repeat that--food, fuel, \nmedicine, and other vital commodities to Armenia and to Nagorno-\nKarabakh, causing immense human suffering. During winters, much of the \nArmenian population has had to live without heat, electricity, or \nwater. Schools and hospitals have been unable to function, and most \nArmenian industries have been forced to close down, crippling the \neconomy and producing widespread unemployment and poverty.\n  Think of this. Azerbaijan is imposing a blockade on Armenia --total: \nno food, no fuel, no medicines. The blockade has been particularly \ndevastating because a similar restriction is imposed by Turkey on \ntraffic to Armenia and because of the civil conflict that makes \ntransport through Georgia difficult. Since Armenia is entirely \nlandlocked, they are left with hardly any alternative. They have a \nsmall border with Iran; but, of course, that is the very outcome we do \nnot want to encourage in terms of where they turn for supplies.\n  This law was written in an effort to move the countries toward \nnegotiating a peaceful resolution of their disputes. All Azerbaijan \nmust do to get section 907 lifted is--and I quote this under existing \nlaw--``take demonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia \nand Nagorno-Karabakh.''\n  Again, they must ``take demonstrable steps to cease all blockades \nagainst Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.''\n  This is an entirely reasonable expectation, especially given the \nostensible purpose of the amendment which the Senator from Kansas has \noffered, which is ``to promote trade and commerce and economic \ncooperation between the countries of the region.''\n  He wants to promote trade and commerce amongst the countries of the \nregion, and yet Azerbaijan is maintaining this embargo, which precludes \nany such trade with Armenia.\n  The Government of Azerbaijan continues to thwart U.S. attempts to \npromote peaceful conflict resolution and regional economic integration. \nAlthough a cease-fire has been in effect in Nagorno-Karabakh since \n1994, Azerbaijan has not moved to lift the economic blockade. It is \nalso seeking to exclude Armenia from all East-West commercial \ncorridors.\n  Let me be very clear what the existing law, section 907, limits or \nretains, because this is an effort to apply in a nuance way an \nincentive, or a subtle pressure, to try to move the parties in the \nregion towards a peaceful resolution of their dispute.\n  We are not talking about commercial trade. Some people refer to this \nprovision as an ``economic sanction.'' Let's examine that.\n  The provision of the existing law, section 907, prohibits direct U.S. \nGovernment aid to Azerbaijan as long as they maintain this blockade. \nThe proposed amendment would lift that. So the aid could be given even \nthough they maintain the blockade, which, as I have indicated, I think \nwould be a terrible step, a very harmful, substantive policy decision.\n  We are not talking about commercial trade, which is usually where you \ndebate economic sanctions. In fact, the United States has perfectly \nnormal trade relationships with Azerbaijan. To the extent that U.S. \ncompanies may not be investing there, it is due to that country's \neconomic and political instability, its corruption, and to the low \nprice of oil--not due to a lack of U.S. taxpayer assistance.\n  In fact, under the existing law, Azerbaijan receives U.S. assistance. \nIt gets $24 million in economic assistance, which will bring it to a \ntotal of over $100 million since 1994. Because section 907, as it is \nnow written in the law, does not apply to the Trade and Development \nAgency, the Export-Import Bank, to OPIC, to humanitarian assistance, to \nthe foreign and commercial services, to activities to support \ndemocracy, nonproliferation, and disarmament, or aid through \nnongovernmental organizations, all of those activities can take place \nnow under existing 907.\n  So what 907 does in order to attempt to exercise a certain amount of \ninfluence in how matters progress in that area is restrict the direct \ngovernment-to-government assistance. Assistance through aid through \nnongovernmental organizations is not touched. Even some government \nassistance, if it goes to support democracy, nonproliferation, and \ndisarmament, can take place.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The distinguished Senator from Maryland has just \noutlined the ways in which 907 has been modified in many respects since \n1992 in order to further nudge Azerbaijan in the direction of getting \nthis conflict settled.\n  The Senator also pointed out that nothing yet has happened, and to \ntake away the last remaining carrot or stick, if you will, that would \nencourage the settlement of this dispute, the Senator is entirely \ncorrect, would be a very bad policy decision.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. This body has \nresponded in the past. The argument was, well, if you just give some \ncarrot, you would see some change in behavior.\n  When we first started out with 907, it was much more restrictive. \nOver the passage of time, these various exceptions have been put into \nthe law. But we have retained a more limited number of restrictions. To \nmove them now altogether--I mean the ball game is over with. Why should \nAzerbaijan be concerned to settle anything?\n  Some say, well this somehow is a sanction. What we are talking about \nhere is whether U.S. direct foreign assistance will be made available. \nForeign assistance is not an entitlement. I want to repeat that. \nForeign assistance is not an entitlement.\n  I hope people aren't going to get up on the floor and say: Well, \nsomehow there is some kind of entitlement and, therefore, Azerbaijan is \nentitled to get foreign assistance. The placing of conditions upon \nforeign aid is both reasonable and appropriate for policy as well as \nbudgetary reasons. It is a standard procedure. Conditions should not be \nconsidered sanctions. They ensure that U.S. aid serves U.S. interests.\n  I doubt seriously, if Members would stop and really focus on it, that \nthere would be any Member of this body who would suggest that we should \ngive foreign aid regardless of the recipient's policies and actions; \nthat somehow they have an entitlement claim to foreign assistance, and, \ntherefore, there can be no conditions, or no restrictions placed on it, \nand regardless of what the recipient's policies and actions are, we \nneed to provide that assistance.\n  Let me turn to Azerbaijan's performance in the peace process, because \nthere is a peace process underway. Conceivably, if Armenia was blocking \nthe\n\n[[Page S7869]]\n\npeace process and Azerbaijan was cooperating with it, one could come \nalong and say: Well, we have to make some accommodation to Azerbaijan \nbecause they are now working with the peace process.\n  It is exactly the opposite. That peace process has been stalled since \nNovember when Azerbaijan, the very country that this amendment now \nseeks to free of any limitations on American foreign assistance, when \nAzerbaijan unilaterally rejected a compromise proposal put forward by \nthe cochairs of the OSCE's so-called Minsk Group--Russia, France, and \nthe United States. The OSCE has established a Minsk Group that is \nchaired by Russia, France, and the United States as cochairs, and they \nhave been trying to develop a peace process to resolve this matter \nbetween Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Azerbaijan.\n  In November of 1998, the Minsk Group called for a common state of \nAzerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. The so-called common state approach \nwas accepted by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh as the basis for \nnegotiations among the parties in spite of the serious reservations \nwhich were held by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.\n  This is a proposal that the Minsk Group put to the parties in order \nto advance the peace process. Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, with \nconcerns, nevertheless, accepted this development as a way of going \nforward with the direct negotiations.\n  Azerbaijan summarily rejected the peace plan, threatened to overturn \nthe cease-fire, which has been in effect, and then complained about the \ndelay in finding a resolution to the conflict, and recently--from \nreliable reports--Azerbaijan has provoked a series of armed incidents \nalong the cease-fire line.\n  Furthermore, in addition to rejecting the peace plan, Azerbaijan \nobjected to Armenia's proposals to foster regional cooperation through \nopen borders and restoration of rail and road links in the Caucasus. \nArmenia's proposal was set out at the Transport Corridor Europe \nCaucasus and Asia Conference held in Azerbaijan in September of 1998, \nbut Azerbaijan refused to recognize any of these rights or obligations \ninsofar as they applied to Armenia.\n  I want to underscore not only this recalcitrance but this absolute \nrepudiation of the peace process, of this effort by the Minsk Group--\nheaded by France, Russia, and the United States, the three cochairs--to \ntry to develop a peace process to resolve this situation in the \nCaucasus. Azerbaijan has refused to participate.\n  Do not forget how the war started. After years of denying the people \nof Nagorno-Karabakh their constitutional rights and freedom, the \ngovernment of Azerbaijan undertook a massive military offensive against \nNagorno-Karabakh in the winter of 1993 to 1994. Although Azerbaijan \nlaunched the attacks, they encountered a better organized defense and \nwere forced to negotiate a cease-fire, which has been in effect since \nMay of 1994. As I indicated earlier, they threatened to overturn that \ncease-fire recently when they rejected the proposal of the Minsk Group.\n  In the face of this behavior, it is now proposed by an amendment to \nlift the remaining few limitations on direct American foreign \nassistance to Azerbaijan. Obviously, Azerbaijan wants a completely \nnormal relationship with the United States, but in a ``prod'' for them \nto rectify this situation and to give us a more stable, peaceful \nenvironment, that remains one of the prods we ought not give away.\n  The waiving of section 907 of the Freedom Support Act would reward \nthe party that has been intransigent in peace negotiations and has \nactually thwarted legitimate aspirations for democracy and justice in \nthe region.\n  I intend later to go into some detail with respect to the human \nrights practices in Azerbaijan, taken, of course, from the human rights \nreport of the Department of State, the annual report that is made on \nhuman rights conditions in various countries around the world. I know \nthere are others who want to speak, so I don't propose to do that right \nnow. If we are seriously entertaining the prospect of changing this \nlaw, lifting the remaining limitations that are provided by section \n907, obviously one of the things we must do is examine the human rights \npractices of the country that is going to be freed from these \nlimitations.\n  Let me read one paragraph from the State Department report, in lieu \nof a more complete exposition of this situation, which is what I hope \nto do later. This will give some sense of the problem.\n\n       Azerbaijan is a republic with a presidential form of \n     government. Heydar Aliyev, who assumed presidential powers \n     after the overthrow of his democratically elected predecessor \n     in 1993, was reelected in October in a controversial election \n     marred by numerous, serious irregularities, violations of the \n     election law, and lack of transparency in the vote counting \n     process at the district and national levels. President Aliyev \n     and his supporters, many from his home region of Nakhchivan, \n     continue to dominate the Government and the multiparty 125-\n     member Parliament chosen in the flawed 1995 elections. The \n     Constitution, adopted in a 1995 referendum, established a \n     system of government based on a division of powers between a \n     strong presidency, a legislature with the power to approve \n     the budget and impeach the President, and a judiciary with \n     limited independence. The judiciary does not function \n     independently of the executive branch and is corrupt and \n     inefficient.\n\n  Later the report goes on to detail numerous human rights abuses on \nthe part of the police, the ministry of internal affairs, and the \nministry of national security. As this debate progresses, I will seek \nto develop those points in order to make it clear that certainly the \nhuman rights record doesn't warrant eliminating the limitation. \nCertainly, the support of the peace process doesn't warrant what this \namendment proposes to do. Certainly, the nature of the blockade which \nthey have imposed, which goes to humanitarian goods and services as \nwell as everything else, doesn't warrant lifting the amendment.\n  The amendment, obviously, raises very difficult questions. It \nrepresents a major departure in substance in terms of our policy. I \nknow the chairman has an amendment which will knock out this provision \nas it affects section 907. I am very supportive of that. I hope that \nwill carry.\n  In any event, I am very much opposed to the amendment. I am frank to \nsay I don't think we should be dealing with this amendment on an \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have listened carefully to the Senator's comments \nwhich quite accurately lay out the sequence of events since the war in \nthe early 1990s. Can my friend from Maryland think of any incentive \nwhatsoever that Azerbaijan might have to settle this conflict if we \nrepeal section 907?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think we will have eliminated the last prod that we \nhave to try to get them to settle the war and enter into a more normal, \npeaceful trading and commercial relationship with Armenia.\n  It is an irony that this amendment, this Silk Road Act, is supposedly \nto encourage commerce and trade amongst the countries in the region but \nthat it has a repeal of 907 for one of the countries that is imposing a \nblockade on such trade and commerce with its neighbor.\n  It makes absolutely no sense. It runs counter to the announced \nobjective of the legislation and of the amendment. We have a situation \nwhere we have a cease-fire, we have a Minsk process in action. We have \na proposal submitted by the three cochairs. Azerbaijan rejected it. An \neffort is being made to revisit that, to try to move that situation \nforward.\n  I think to come in with this amendment at this time is certainly not \ngoing to help the peace process.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend from Maryland, is it not true one of \nthe things that Azerbaijan wants more than anything is a normal \nrelationship with the United States? If they can achieve that without \nnegotiation, this Senator is very pessimistic about the possibility of \never settling this conflict.\n  I have had the opportunity to visit refugee camps in both of these \ncountries. I must say to my friend from Maryland, I don't see any end \nto it. These people have been living in refugee camps now for 5 or 6 \nyears. If this conflict isn't settled some time soon, with its sense of \nhopelessness and despair, we will have children being born, growing up, \nand reaching adulthood in these refugee camps with no hope of a normal \nlife.\n  It seems to me, as the Senator from Maryland has indicated, and I \nagree\n\n[[Page S7870]]\n\nwith him totally, we ought to be doing everything we can to encourage \nthe end of this dispute--not to take steps that could well lead to an \ninevitable and lengthy process. Conceivably, this could never be \nsettled. You could have these refugee camps there 10, 20 years from \nnow, breeding hopelessness and terrorism and all the rest that we have \nseen coming out of refugee camps in other parts of the world.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. The really \ndiscouraging thing was that the Minsk people made the proposal. That is \nthe United States, France, and Russia, speaking on behalf of the OSCE. \nAnd Azerbaijan rejected participating in that process. Had Azerbaijan \naccepted it and Armenia rejected it, I can imagine people would say, \nAzerbaijan is trying to make the peace process work, Armenia is \nblocking it, and we ought to go ahead and enter into this normal \nrelationship with Azerbaijan. But that was not the case.\n  Second--I will detail it later--to some extent I am reluctant to \ndetail the human rights performance, because one does not like to come \non the floor of the Senate and go into a lengthy exposition of that \nissue. We want people to improve. When we do these human rights \nreports, we try to not, as it were, overload them. But now when you \noffer an amendment that is going to take out the last limitation we \nhave on aid, it seems to me at a minimum it warrants a very careful \nexamination of the human rights performance within Azerbaijan. I am \nfrank to tell you I think, once we undertake to do that, most Members \nare going to have increasingly growing questions about the nature of \nthis regime and about whether we should be trying now to repeal any \nlimitations on providing assistance which could serve as a way to try \nto get a better performance.\n  I have gone on for some time. I see my colleague from Michigan has \nbeen on the floor waiting patiently. I will come back, obviously, and \nrevisit this issue; particularly, if necessary, to get into this human \nrights discussion.\n  As you know, each year the State Department puts out a country report \non human rights practices. This one is for 1998. This is in accordance \nwith legislation enacted by the Congress. There is a lengthy section in \nhere on Azerbaijan, which I think Members certainly ought to have in \nmind as they consider whether we should adopt the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Kansas which repeals section 907 of existing law. I \nwant it to be very clearly understood, the amendment that has been \noffered makes a very significant change in existing law, and the \nsecond-degree amendment offered by the chairman of the committee would \ntake out the provision that is most offensive in that regard, and that \nis the proposal of the Senator from Kansas to in effect give up an open \nwaiver on section 907, thereby in effect providing for its repeal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I realize I have spoken on this a \ncouple of times, but I have heard arguments put forward that I want to \nclarify my response to so it is in the Record.\n  No. 1 is that the administration, the U.S. administration, the U.S. \nGovernment, is part of the Minsk Group. It is part of the group trying \nto negotiate a peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The Clinton \nadministration, they support my amendment. They supported it in \ncommittee this year. They supported it last year in the Congress. They \nthink this is a good idea. This is the administration that is \nnegotiating, part of the three outside members--France, Russia, and the \nUnited States--part of the overall Minsk Group, along with Azerbaijan \nand Armenia, that is negotiating this peace.\n  So if this is ill timed, maybe we ought to tell the administration \nthat, because they support my amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If you will let me finish my statement. I have \nlistened for a long period of time to the Senator from Maryland, so I \nwant to just make sure this is clear.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could just go ahead and finish my statement. You \nhave had a good chance.\n  The Clinton administration supports my position on this. They think \nit would help the United States in being an evenhanded negotiator so we \ndo not have a set of unilateral sanctions, sanctions on one of the \nparties. They think that is important. They have supported it. We have \nletters to that effect. I will submit those for the Record for all my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, we are not lifting the sanctions. We are providing the \nadministration with the same national interest waiver, the same one \nthat applies to all the former Soviet Union countries. It has in it \nrequirements that if human rights abuses are taking place, we cannot \nprovide aid from the United States. I noted in my statement I made here \nearlier, I think all these countries are having human rights issues \nbeing brought forward, including Armenia, including Azerbaijan. Those \nare things that should be taken into consideration. But we do not lift \nthe human rights requirements. All we do in this amendment is to \nprovide the administration with national interest waivers. We don't \nlift them. We provide the administration national interest waivers. \nThey can leave every sanction in and put more on if they deem it wise \nand prudent and the right thing to do.\n  They seem to me to be in the right position to consider whether or \nnot sanctions should be lifted, whether or not human rights violations \nare taking place at the hands of the Azeris, the hands of the \nArmenians. I think there are enough human rights abuses to go around in \nthis region. I think most of the reports will cite that as well. I \nthink the administration should have the authority to determine that \nand move this process forward.\n  I want to make sure it is clear to our colleagues. This is providing \nthe administration the national interest waiver. It does not lift the \nsanctions. The administration can put those in place. The \nadministration supports the position.\n  In that regard, I have a letter from the President stating support \nfor the amendment. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Sam Brownback,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sam: I congratulate you for your leadership in working \n     to strengthen ties with all the countries of the Caucasus and \n     Central Asia. The meeting you are hosting, in the context of \n     the NATO Summit, will provide an important opportunity for \n     dialogue among leaders from the region, Members of Congress, \n     representatives of my Administration, and other American \n     opinion leaders. Similarly, I share the goals reflected in \n     your bill, the Silk Road Strategy Act, and will work with you \n     to achieve them.\n       The United States has a clear stake in the success of the \n     New Independent States of the Caucasus and Central Asia. \n     These young countries have stated that they seek stability, \n     democracy, and prosperity. We have a chance to contribute to \n     their efforts if we stand with them. The United States must \n     continue to play an active and balanced role in the Caucasus \n     and Central Asia--supporting peace in Nagorno-Karabakh and \n     Abkhazia; promoting democracy and market economics through \n     our assistance programs, which should be free from \n     unproductive restrictions; and improving the security \n     environment through bilateral programs and support for NATO's \n     Partnership for Peace.\n       Your strong leadership helps underscore the bipartisan \n     nature of, and true national interest in, these issues. I \n     look forward to continuing to work with you to achieve our \n     common goals in this area.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Bill.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. People can look at that. As far as this being a \nsensitive time in the negotiations, I support peace in the region, but \nthis battle, this fight between the sides, has been going on since \n1992. We have had a ceasefire for the last 5 years. There has not been \nsignificant movement in the peace process or a significant proposal \nsince 1997. If the administration thought it was such a sensitive time, \nI think they would be here saying don't offer this amendment rather \nthan supporting my position.\n  So I hope my colleagues will look at all these issues and determine \nthe administration is probably right. This is something we should do. \nWe should put everybody on an equal footing so we can work with all the \npeople in this region, and I think that would be an important thing to \ndo.\n\n[[Page S7871]]\n\n  With that, I will be happy to yield for a question from my colleague.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I listened to my colleague with interest. First of all, \nI find it intriguing he finds himself so supportive of the \nadministration in this instance. Let me ask my colleague this question. \nDoes he know of any administration that would not want to be given, by \nthe Congress, a total waiver authority?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I don't know that I can answer that, but I know this \nadministration would appreciate that. But it is not just that. They \nalso say here the administration strongly supports passage of the Silk \nRoad Strategy Act, which may be added to the bill as an amendment. They \nappreciate the committee's continued efforts to reduce restrictions in \nsection 907 of the Freedom Support Act.\n  There is very specific and very clear support.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Absolutely. Because the Senator gives the \nadministration a blank check. No administration is going to spurn that. \nEvery administration, if you offer them a blank check, is going to take \nit. They would be fools not to. Obviously they are supportive. You are, \nin effect, giving them all the authority. The Congress made a judgment \nin this matter, and it has consistently held to that judgment over the \nyears, and I don't think Congress should go back on that judgment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reclaiming my time, I note this is the administration \nthat is negotiating peace in this region. They want peace as I want \npeace in this region. They are saying: Look, this is an appropriate \nthing to bring up at this particular time, and it will help us in \nmoving forward to peace in the region. They are in a better position to \njudge that, with all due respect to my colleague from Maryland.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Michigan was kind enough to yield me \ntime to speak. I appreciate that. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to this discussion. I \nspoke earlier on this same amendment and want to speak again.\n  I am a cosponsor with the Senator from Kentucky of the second-degree \namendment which was offered earlier today to the amendment of the \nSenator from Kansas.\n  As many of my colleagues may know, contained within S. 579 is the \nwaiver, which we have been discussing, of section 907 of the Freedom \nSupport Act. Section 907 restricts some forms of U.S. assistance to the \nGovernment of Azerbaijan until it takes demonstrable steps to cease all \nblockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The Azerbaijan blockade \nhas cut off transport of fuel, food, medicine, and other vital goods \nand commodities to these regions. This in turn has forced the United \nStates to send ongoing emergency lifesaving assistance to Armenia and, \nmore recently, Nagorno-Karabakh as well.\n  The present conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has been the \nsubject of an ongoing peace process. With the consent of the United \nStates, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, their \nMinsk Group, as we have heard, has been assigned the responsibility of \nfashioning a peace proposal satisfactory to the conflicting parties.\n  Despite serious reservations, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh have \naccepted the OSCE's recommendations. As the Senator from Maryland just \npointed out, Azerbaijan has not. In fact, they have summarily rejected \nthe compromise peace proposal. If Azerbaijan had accepted the \ncompromise plan, cowritten by the United States, direct negotiations \nwould already be underway, and this conflict may have well been on its \nway to being resolved.\n  If we vote today to abolish section 907, we, in effect, would reward \nAzerbaijan's rejection of the OSCE compromise peace proposal. We will \nhave undermined what I believe and what I think a number of my \ncolleagues who have already spoken believe to be a primary objective of \nthat proposal, which is ending Azerbaijan's ongoing blockade.\n  The comments of both the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from \nMaryland have been right on point. It could not be more self-evident \nthat if the one and only leverage we have in the peace process to bring \nan end to this blockade and to the hostile relationships is taken away, \nthere will be no incentives whatsoever.\n  It would be, in my judgment, counterproductive in the extreme to \ncreate incentives for the intransigent party to stay the course, to \nremain intransigent. This, in my judgment, will not bring lasting peace \nto the region, and I question seriously the conclusion that apparently \nthe administration has reached that somehow this administration, or any \nother, will be more effective as a negotiator if this changes.\n  There are plenty of countries that have an interest in this region \nthat do not have a provision like section 907 in place. Yet they have \nbeen no more successful in influencing Azerbaijan. The Minsk proposal \nwas rejected by Azerbaijan. I do not understand how, in effect, \nrewarding Azerbaijan for its resistance is going to change anything.\n  I want to comment on another point the Senator from Kansas made. He \nhas mentioned several times today his provision, the Silk Road Act, \nincludes a so-called national security waiver. He indicates that it \ndoes not, of course, eliminate the sanctions, it just simply allows the \nPresident to exercise the waiver which would remove those sanctions if, \nin the President's view, the circumstances allowed that. This \nprovision, as the Senator from Maryland just said, would, in effect, \ngive the President the power to repeal section 907 or to maintain it.\n\n  However, its practical effect would be to eliminate section 907. The \nadministration is on record, and very clearly on record, in supporting \nthe repeal of this principal provision of the law and has been a vocal \nsupporter of the Silk Road bill itself, as the Senator from Kansas just \nindicated.\n  The notion we are not, in effect, repealing section 907, we are \nsimply putting the President in a position to consider using a national \nsecurity waiver to repeal it, may be technically true. But as a \npractical matter, if we act today to eliminate section 907 and replace \nit with a waiver language that is suggested, we would be eliminating \nthe section 907 sanctions automatically, because I find it hard to \nbelieve the President, in light of his statements and his support, \nwould retain section 907.\n  I reiterate to my colleagues the importance of our second-degree \namendment. Irrespective of your views on the Silk Road Act, either \nsubstantively or, for that matter, as a part of the foreign operations \nappropriations bill, our amendment would be consistent with our \npolicies in this region, and it would maintain existing law with \nrespect to the Government of Azerbaijan.\n  I hope my colleagues will support Chairman McConnell and myself and \nothers who are supporting this very important amendment.\n  Also, I personally believe the treatment that has been received by \nthe people of Armenia--and this is not the only time in this century \nthat the people of Armenia have been victims of actions by military \nforces beyond their control--the treatment is simply unacceptable. I am \nnot saying there are not arguments of sympathy toward all parties in \nthis region, but the U.S. Government made the right step when we \ninstituted section 907, that we expressed an appropriate level of \nsympathy, as well as support, and appropriately so, for the people of \nArmenia. It would be a tragic mistake for us today to reverse course \nand to set in motion what, in effect, would be a repeal of section 907. \nIt will send the wrong message to the Azerbaijanis, and I believe just \nfrom a human rights point of view, it would send the wrong message with \nregard to our feelings toward the people of Armenia.\n  Actions such as that would not be evenhanded, but clearly it would be \na decisive gesture on behalf of Azerbaijan. In my judgment, when one \ntakes into account the entire historic scope of things, that is not an \nappropriate action for our country to take.\n  I urge colleagues to support our second-degree amendment, to then \nvote their conscience with regard to the Silk Road Act, both on \nsubstance as well as its inclusion in this legislation. As I indicated \nearlier, I support the efforts of the Senator from Kansas in virtually \nall other respects with regard to this effort and with regard to that \nlegislation, except for this provision.\n  Today, on behalf of myself and the others who have joined on the \nsecond-\n\n[[Page S7872]]\n\ndegree amendment, I hope we will have support. Let's not make this \ndramatic change in American foreign policy in this context. Let's send \na message to the people of Azerbaijan that we hope they will take \nseriously the negotiation of the peace process and that America remains \nfirm in its resolve to not continue or to open up these additional \nforms of aid until such time as the proposal we have already offered is \nfavorably acted on.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point, please?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Certainly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I bring to the Senator's attention a \nstatement that was adopted on April 15 of this year by 23 political \nparties in Azerbaijan that are members of the movement for electoral \nreform and democratic elections. These are the major opposition parties \nin Azerbaijan. Listen to this:\n\n       The existing Government of Azerbaijan, having usurped \n     powers as a result of a plot in 1993, created an \n     antidemocratic regime in the country, violated human rights \n     and freedoms, performed brutal repressive policies against \n     political parties and opposition forces, pursued and jailed \n     hundreds of citizens for political reasons, falsified \n     presidential elections, remained indifferent to the \n     assassination of deputies of the people, brought social \n     economic conditions of the population down to a deep \n     precipice, illegally redirected credits from foreign \n     countries for their own purposes, failed to achieve \n     significant improvements in the oil industry, created \n     conditions for the session of some already-signed oil \n     contracts, misappropriated industrial enterprises and \n     violated the labor rights of hundreds of thousands of \n     citizens, substantially destroyed the industrial potential of \n     the country, brought agriculture to a disastrous state, \n     created conditions where a selected group of individuals \n     accumulate state property in their hands but conceal it under \n     the name of reforms, raise corruption and bribery to \n     historically high levels and, thus, brought many sectors of \n     the life of the country to a state of catastrophe.\n\n  Then they talk later--I am not going to quote it all--about the cruel \npressure of the Government against the free and independent mass media, \nhow citizens were illegally arrested for participating in election \nrallies and sentenced to jail terms.\n  Imagine the courage it took to make this statement. And now the \nCongress of the United States is going to come along and repeal section \n907? What message does that send to these brave people who are \nchallenging their own authoritarian government on its practices?\n  The Senator is absolutely right. It would send absolutely the wrong \nmessage; would it not?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. It would.\n  I say to the Senator from Maryland, I obviously do not know, with \nrespect to each and every one of those issues that was raised by \nopposition parties, the full story, but I also would suspect that very \nfew of our colleagues know the full story or have examined that aspect \nof this debate.\n  It seems to me, in the absence of a fuller examination, it would \nreally be a mistake for the Members of the Senate to vote to remove, \neffectively repeal section 907 unless they know more of the background \nthat the Senator just discussed.\n  I know the Senator from Maryland plans to discuss some of the other \nissues today, but I urge colleagues who are not on the floor and maybe \nare not following this as closely to just take note of that list and \nother similar kinds of lists of concerns that have been raised and very \nserious charges that have been leveled against the government that we \nwould now, in effect, set in motion a potential plan to support. It \nseems to me this is the kind of issue that requires far greater \nscrutiny by the Members of the Senate before we would take that action.\n\n  I appreciate the Senator from Maryland raising those issues at this \ntime.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I could pick right up on the comments made by the \nSenator from Maryland and the Senator from Michigan, we are talking \nabout a major change in American foreign policy in this amendment. This \nis a very serious change in our policy toward that part of the world. \nIt is not as if, as the Senator from Maryland has pointed out and as \nthe Senator from Michigan has pointed out, the United States has no \nrelationship with Azerbaijan.\n  The administration already, without the repeal of 907, can do Export-\nImport Bank loan guarantees and support. It can do OPIC insurance and \nsupport. It can do Trade Development Agency feasibility studies and \nsupport. It can do any activities sponsored by the U.S. Foreign \nCommercial Service. It can do election and democracy support. It can do \nNunn-Lugar nonproliferation support. And last but not least, it can do \nhumanitarian support, which includes food, medicine, and related \nrelief.\n  In other words, 907 has basically been stripped down over the last \nfew years so that all of those activities between our Government and \nAzerbaijan can take place. So there is not much left of 907.\n  But as the Senators from Maryland and Michigan have pointed out, what \nis left is significant because without it there is no real reason for \nAzerbaijan to pursue the much-needed peace with Armenia that the \ncitizens of both countries richly deserve.\n  So I thank both Senator Sarbanes and Senator Abraham for their \ncontributions to this important debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have noted in my opening statement, \nand I have noted later, the human rights issues that exist throughout \nthe region. There is no doubt that they exist. I think the same \nstandards should be applied to Azerbaijan as apply to the other \ncountries in the region. And those do stay in place.\n  This is talk of a major shift in U.S. foreign policy. I, again, \nremind people that we are simply providing the President with waiver \nauthority. If he determines that human rights abuses are such that any \nof the sanctions should not be lifted, they will not be lifted. The \nadministration is given that authority. We do not lift those sanctions. \nThe President maintains that.\n  I also note, in the human rights area--because this is an area of key \nconcern, as it should be an area of key concern to everybody--we \nrecently had a coffee for the Israeli Minister of Trade and Industry, \nNatan Sharansky. That name should be familiar to some Members. He is \none of the leading human rights voices in the world. This is a person \nwho understands the connection between the U.S. position and human \nrights problems.\n  He was here specifically to support the Silk Road Strategy Act of the \nbill. He said this:\n\n       Look at the human rights situation and weigh this against \n     the importance of the threat that is facing us. It is very \n     important to engage and to continue to encourage a \n     positive process and the way to do this is to strengthen \n     the role we are playing in the region.\n\n  Strengthen the U.S. role played in the region. Sharansky is clearly a \nperson who understands the importance of tying legislation to human \nrights. He is a clear beneficiary of that having been done in the past. \nThis is one of the clearest voices in the world. That is not to deny \nthat human rights abuses have occurred. But we are not lifting the \nstandards of human rights. We are not saying that Azerbaijan has a \nlower standard than everybody else. We are saying everybody has the \nsame standard. And we provide the President the national waiver \nauthority. This does not shift U.S. policy if the President determines \nit is not in our national interest, which is the same standard we put \nto all countries.\n  I plead with my colleagues to look seriously at this because while we \ncan get down here in the weeds of some particular issues, we are \ntalking about a region of the world that the Iranians are aggressively \nplaying in now. All these Silk Road countries that I am talking about, \nthe Iranians are there. They are providing aid, they are providing \nhate, and they are trying to overturn these governments. They can say \nthat the authors of the amendment are saying: OK, let's just pull this \n907 provision out. The rest is fine.\n  Azerbaijan is a key part of this Eurasian connection of connecting \nthis region together for democracy, for a growing competitive economy \nthat can stand against the threat of the Iranians and the militant \nfundamentalists expanding in this region that is taking place now.\n  The notion that we have not looked at this enough--I bet we have had \nnearly 10 hearings in the Foreign Relations\n\n[[Page S7873]]\n\nCommittee between this Congress and last Congress on this issue. It \npassed the Foreign Relations Committee last Congress and this Congress. \nWe have looked at it and looked at it. I wish we studied most issues as \nmuch as we have studied this one. We have. This one has been around. \nPeople have looked at it. This 907 provision has been in place for a \nnumber of years and it has not helped Armenia.\n  My final point here is, I am seeking, by this, to help all the \ncountries in this region and U.S. policy. I am seeking, by this, to \nhelp Armenia as well. I realize that the people that are in opposition \non this would not see that as such. But has our past policy helped \nArmenia? Has that been of any help?\n  I talked with the Foreign Minister 3 or 4 months ago, and he talked \nabout how terrible the situation was in Armenia. And I agree, it \nprobably is. But that is suffering under the law we put in place. Let's \ntry something that can lift the whole region up and build stakeholders \nwho can say: We ought to cooperate and work together.\n  Let's try something that can work instead of this failed policy that \nis a unilateral sanction. Let's provide to the President the authority \nto be able to do that, to move that peace process forward. This is the \ntime to do that. I hope we can get to a vote here quickly.\n  I inquire of my colleague from Kentucky, I know he would like to move \nthis bill, it would seem to me that probably we have had sufficient \ntime. If there is a chance to move forward and vote, I think we are \nprobably getting to that point.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Kansas, we are going to try to \nprocess a lot of other amendments. But we have not been offered a time \nagreement on this yet.\n  I see my colleague from Maryland is on his feet. If he would like \nto----\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to ask the Senator from Kansas a question, if he \nwould yield for a question.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes. And then I would like to yield to Senator \nHutchison of Texas.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Were any other countries encompassed within your Silk \nRoad strategy that are imposing a blockade on their neighbors the way \nAzerbaijan is on Armenia?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Who?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Armenia.\n  Mr. SARBANES. On whom?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Azerbaijan. I think the Senator and I talked about \nthis earlier today. The Senator will agree that Armenia has taken about \n20 percent of the territory of Azerbaijan. The U.N. has condemned that. \nAnd what effectively you have in place is a mutual battle line that has \nexisted between those two. The U.N. has condemned this action and told \nArmenia: Let's hold this back.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Minsk group is trying to resolve that issue. The \nwar began because Azerbaijan moved into an aggressive mode. Does the \nSenator dispute that?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Would you dispute who is occupying whose territory?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let's do it step by step. Does the Senator dispute that \nAzerbaijan began the war by moving into an aggressive mode?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I don't think that would necessarily be the case. I am \nnot going to start to debate the origins of that war.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It becomes a highly relevant question, doesn't it?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I think the relevant question is how we move forward \nin this region of the world. That is the issue that we debate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The argument the Senator made about trying to move \nforward was responded to by the committee in the past with the Exim \nexception, with the OPIC exception, with the encouraging democracy \nexception, all of the provisions that provide some aid. Now the Senator \nwants to lift any limitations altogether. I think any chance of getting \nthis situation resolved will simply be gone.\n  I know the pressures that exist. The Silk Road strategy involves \ntremendous oil interests. We ought to put that out on the table, I \nguess. Someone ought to lay that out as an important consideration. But \nit ought not to result in overturning what has been an established \npolicy in the way we are trying to do it today, particularly in a \nsituation when, last fall, we thought we would be able to move this \npeace process. Had Azerbaijan participated in the peace process last \nfall, we would have been able to move forward. They refused to do so.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could reclaim my time, my \ncolleague from Texas is here and desires to address this overall issue. \nI yield to my colleague from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  I appreciate Senator Brownback giving me a little time to talk about \nthis, because I think it is a very important issue. There are a number \nof American investments being made in Azerbaijan right now. There are a \nnumber of American jobs that will be dependent on our keeping a good \nrelationship with Azerbaijan.\n  I have been able to visit Azerbaijan. I was there at the same time as \nthe distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. He knows this issue \nvery well.\n  I look at this a different way. I talked to the President of \nAzerbaijan while I was in his country and then when he visited our \ncountry to sign agreements with several American companies to do \nbusiness in his country. It is of utmost concern to him that we are \nbeginning to make investments in his country. He welcomes us. He wants \nto do business with us. Yet we have sanctions on his country because of \ninternal conflicts.\n  This is not a policy that is evenhandedly put forward by our country. \nWe do business with other countries where we don't agree with the way \nthey are treating certain people within their own country. There are \nborder disputes with other countries, but we don't put sanctions on \nthem in order to impose our will.\n  I hope Senator Brownback's amendment will pass, at least this part of \nthe amendment, because I think it is important that we send a message \nto the President of Azerbaijan and to the people of Azerbaijan that we \nwant to be partners with them, that it is an important relationship to \nthis country, and that we should continue to be able to help them work \nout this internal problem. But I don't think imposing our will on them \nis the right thing to do.\n  Senator Brownback is trying to give the President the ability to \nmaneuver in the interest of the United States. I think it is a \nreasonable request. It is a good amendment. I hope that the Senate will \nsupport it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in light of the comments of the Senator \nfrom Texas, I want to reemphasize something I said earlier. Section 907 \nis not a sanction. There is no provision currently in place that \nprevents American companies from trading or doing commerce in \nAzerbaijan. The only thing section 907 limits is it doesn't allow \nforeign assistance direct from the U.S. Government to Azerbaijan unless \nAzerbaijan--listen to this --takes demonstrable steps to cease all \nblockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. So it is an absolute \nmisrepresentation of the current situation to assert that this is a \nsanction. There are no trade sanctions. In fact, as the chairman of the \nsubcommittee indicated, there are a number of Government programs that \nare operating in Azerbaijan.\n  The only thing not now permitted is direct foreign aid. There is not \nan entitlement to foreign aid. All we have said--I think, quite \nreasonably--is that you can't get any foreign aid unless you take \ndemonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia. That is what \n907 provides.\n  Why should we give them foreign aid and allow them to continue the \nblockade? We want the blockade to cease.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Maryland makes a very good point. I \nvisited these countries. American business is there. The American oil \ncompanies are there. I do not know why the American oil companies are \nso interested in the repeal of 907 because it is certainly not \ninhibiting their ability to do business in Azerbaijan or to drill in \nthe Caspian Sea. Some of us have had an opportunity to see those \noffshore wells. I might say that the American\n\n[[Page S7874]]\n\noil industry is doing a wonderful job, very environmentally sound \ndrilling practices in the Caspian Sea. It is high time because the \nRussians committed a number of environmental atrocities both onshore \nand offshore in Azerbaijan during their decades there.\n\n  No American business I am aware of is being inhibited from doing \nbusiness in Azerbaijan by what little remains of 907. I think the \nSenator from Maryland is correct in his interpretation of what remains \nof section 907.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, not to delay this extraordinarily, \nbecause I think we should move to a vote, we have had an extended \ndebate. We have had extended hearings on this. It is time to go ahead \nand move forward to a vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We do not yet have an agreement to move to a vote on \nthis amendment. That may come later in the day. We do have a number of \namendments we hope to be able to accept momentarily. So I can inform \nthe Senate, I hope we are down to just a handful of remaining \namendments that might require rollcall votes. Obviously, the Brownback \namendment, as amended by the McConnell-Abraham amendment, is one that \nis going to require a rollcall vote. Before we get to that, we are \ngoing to dispose of a number of amendments by consent very shortly.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could just reclaim my time, I want \nto correct one assertion that this is just about oil. I hope we would \nlook at the people who live in this area of the world which is affected \nby this Silk Road Strategy Act. It is interrelated. It does all tie \ntogether to create this Eurasian corridor.\n  If you pull Azerbaijan out of it and you say, okay, we will work with \neverybody but not with them, the corridor and its work towards lifting \nall of their economies in their countries doesn't work, we are talking \na total of nearly 72 million people in this region. If you look at a \nmap of it, you need to work on this together. They have a lot of \npressure on them from various areas.\n  You really need to have this all hooked in together. We need to \nreplace 907 with a national interest waiver that the President can put, \nand then have a coherent U.S. policy so that we meet our interests in \nthe region. It is clearly to have this engaged, not fall in the hands \nof the Iranians or back to the Russians, so we can build and grow with \nthem and not force them to become militant fundamentalist countries.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just want to join in expressing real \nreservations about the Brownback proposal that effectively would \nprovide discretionary provisions to the President of the United States. \nObviously, it has been represented by a number of those who have spoken \non this issue that the U.S. does have interests in this particular part \nof the world. But it does seem to me, as someone who has followed this \nsituation closely over a number of years, for the United States now to \nbe in a position where we are seeing a significant alteration of the \nbalance of power by taking unilateral action, rather than trying to add \nto a resolution of the dispute, I think, only makes it more \ncomplicated, more difficult to try to reach some real chance for peace.\n  I think in many different parts of the world, ultimately, the people \nwho do have responsibility, authority, and power have to be willing to \ncome to the negotiating table and be prepared to make tough and \ndifficult decisions. To think that the United States, by somehow \nchanging and altering its position in terms of effectively siding with \none side in this, thinks that we can really advance the cause for peace \nin that area, I think, is shortsighted. I think it really \nmisunderstands the region and the historical and significant political \nforces at play in that region.\n  All of us see there is a different opportunity in that part of the \nworld currently. As we have seen the change in history in different \nparts of the world, whether in Northern Ireland, or perhaps even today \nin terms of the Middle East, or in other parts of the world, we have \nseen, with the change of circumstances by outside forces, progress \nmade. But for the United States now to be in a position where it moves \nunilaterally in terms of its interests, I don't feel it really advances \nthe cause of peace. There are those who have advanced different options \nabout moving this whole political process forward, who can advance the \ncountry's interest in that part of the world in a positive and \nconstructive way. But I fail to see how this change will advance that \ninterest. I don't believe it does.\n  I strongly support the position my friend and colleague, Senator \nSarbanes, has mentioned. We find out now there are indirect contacts \nthat are available and accessible. We have the private sector already \nengaged. There are indirect lines of support to Azerbaijan at the \npresent time. But for the United States now to be in a position which \neffectively would commit itself to one side in this, after all of the \nvarious situations and the current situations, I think would be \nenormously counterproductive.\n  So I certainly hope we will not take that action at this time. I \ndon't think it is warranted. It is not justified, and I think it would \nbe counterproductive in terms of the interests of the people in that \nregion. There have been initiatives for the cause of peace in that part \nof the world. The Armenians have indicated a willingness to move that \nprocess forward, and those have been rejected, as I understand it, by \nthe Azerbaijanis. For the U.S., under these circumstances, to be in a \nsituation where we could effectively--and we understand what is really \nat the bottom of this, and that is effectively coming down on one \nside--I think there fails to be a persuasive argument about trying to \nadvance this process for peace and real prosperity, and freeing that \nregion from the kinds of tensions it has faced in the past.\n  I hope when the Senate comes to deal with this issue, we will \nmaintain what I think has been a sound policy in the past and, with the \nnew initiatives out there in terms of advancing peace, try to find ways \nto move the process forward rather than interfering in these \nnegotiations by favoring one side over another.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment to the \nSilk Road Strategy Act. I support the many worthwhile provisions in the \nAct, but I oppose the waiver of Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, \nwhich was enacted by Congress in 1992. Section 907 restricts U.S. \nassistance to Azerbaijan because of Azerbaijan's continuing economic \nblockade of Armenia. This blockade has led to great suffering by the \npeople of Armenia, who have had to endure years of shortages of vital \ncommodities.\n  Azerbaijan's cut off of fuel supplies had a devastating effect on \nArmenia's industry. Factories were unable to operate, throwing tens of \nthousands of people out of work. Malnutrition increased because of the \nshortage of food. Schools and hospitals had to shut down or operate \nunder dire circumstances for only a few hours a day.\n  Over the years, the humanitarian needs have been so great in Armenia. \nThe 1988 earthquake, followed by the blockade, has resulted in \ncontinuing devastating circumstances for the people of Armenia. I can \nremember talking to doctors about the humanitarian needs of the Armenia \npeople. I worked with the Department of Defense airlifting goods \ndonated by the people of Massachusetts and other states to help \nalleviate the suffering.\n  Although conditions are somewhat better today than they were a few \nyears ago, Armenia still suffers from the effects of this blockade. It \ncontinues to obstruct Armenia's ability to import food, fuel, medicine \nand other important commodities and items.\n  Unfortunately, the Silk Road Strategy Act contains no provision \nrequiring Azerbaijan to lift this blockade as a condition of receiving \nadditional U.S. aid. It makes no sense to reward Azerbaijan while that \nnation continues this inhumane blockade. Azerbaijan already receives \n$24 million a year in indirect U.S. assistance. Current law allows the \nOverseas Private Investment Corporation and the U.S. Trade and \nDevelopment Agency to provide support to the private sector, and USAID \nis authorized to provide humanitarian aid and democracy-building \nassistance to Azerbaijan.\n  Section 907 is an important incentive for Azerbaijan to come to the \nnegotiating table to resolve the continuing controversy between \nAzerbaijan and\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\nArmenia. The amendment offered by Senator McConnell, Senator Abraham, \nand Senator Sarbanes will retain this essential lever of sanctions, and \nI urge the Senate to adopt it. Unless the waiver of Section 907 is \nremoved, it would be a serious mistake for the Senate to approve the \nSilk Road Strategy Act.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the McConnell amendment \nstriking the provision in the Brownback amendment, also called the Silk \nRoad Act, which would grant the President authority to waive Section \n907 of the Freedom Support Act. Section 907 is an important provision \nof our law which prohibits U.S. Government assistance to the Government \nof Azerbaijan until it takes ``demonstrable steps to cease all \nblockades and other offensive uses of force against Armenia and \nNagorno-Karabagh.'' For the last 10 years, the Government of Azerbaijan \nhas resisted taking such simple steps and instead has maintained its \nblockade of the transportation of food, medicine, fuel and other \nimportant items to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabagh. The Azeri blockade has \nled to great human suffering while seriously hampering economic \ndevelopment of the region. I cannot support the Silk Road Act as \noffered because by allowing for the waiver of Section 907 we would be \nremoving one of the last remaining incentives we have to induce the \nAzeris to enter into good faith negotiations over this conflict. I \nbelieve that we all have similar goals for the region which include: \neconomic development and cooperation; fostering of democratic \nprinciples; and the adherence to universally recognized human rights \nstandards. Allowing for the waiver of Section 907 runs counter to these \nimportant goals by rewarding a nation which has blockaded its \nneighbors, maintained an authoritarian government that took power in a \nnondemocratic fashion, and has a human rights record that has been \nrecognized by the U.S. State Department as ``poor.'' I urge my \ncolleagues to support the continuation of Section 907.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the amendment of the \nSenator from Kansas. This amendment gives the President authority to \nprovide assistance for the countries of the South Caucasus and Central \nAsia--that is, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The purpose of this amendment \nis to reestablish the ancient Silk Road trading route and to gain \naccess to the oil and gas resources of the region. In so doing, it has \nserious implications for Armenia and for ongoing international efforts \nto promote a solution to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan \nover Nagorno-Karabakh, because it allows the President to waive Section \n907 of the Freedom Support Act, which I originally authored. That \nlegislation prohibited aid to the Government of Azerbaijan as long as \nit maintains a blockade against Armenia.\n  One of the objectives of the Brownback amendment is to foster the \ndevelopment of regional economic cooperation. Yet, this amendment \nignores some fundamental facts on the ground. First, Armenia continues \nto be blockaded to the east by Azerbaijan and to the West by Turkey. \nSecond, Azerbaijan insists on establishing and maintaining east-west \nenergy, rail and road corridors that deliberately bypass Armenia. \nAlthough Armenia is one of the countries that could benefit from this \nbill in theory, in reality it is totally isolated by the situation on \nthe ground.\n  This bill does nothing to address these realities. There are no \nprovisions requiring that blockades be lifted or that all borders be \nopened before aid is extended. By failing to include these \nrequirements, the bill in effect legitimizes these blockades and helps \nAzerbaijan to continue to use them to marginalize Armenia and keep it \nweak.\n  The ten-year blockade of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh by the Azeri \ngovernment has cut off the transport of food, fuel, medicine and other \nvital goods. This blockade has been strengthened by Turkey, which has \nhad a similar blockade for the last six years.\n  Section 907 is not a sanction but rather an effort to use the \nleverage embodied in US aid to create a level playing field for Armenia \nand to encourage the government of Azerbaijan to take some of the basic \nsteps necessary if a peaceful resolution of the conflict is to be \nfound. Section 907, as formulated in current law, prohibits US \ngovernment economic and military assistance to the Azeri government, \nbut it permits humanitarian and democracy building aid.\n  All Azerbaijan must do to get section 907 lifted is to ``take \ndemonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-\nKarabakh.'' By allowing the President to waive Sec. 907, this bill \nlegitimizes Azerbaijan's blockade and rewards its rejection of the 1998 \nOSCE compromise peace proposal. This only complicates efforts by the \ninternational community to foster a settlement to the conflict. The \ngreatest weakness of this Brownback amendment is that it is totally \nsilent on the peace process.\n  Mr. President, I will vote against the Brownback amendment and in \nsupport of the McConnell amendment, which removes the President's \nability to waive Sec. 907.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, our foreign policy must reflect our \nvalues. That's why I oppose the Silk Roads Strategy Act amendment.\n  The sponsors of this legislation say that we should build stronger \nties with the nations of the South Caucasus and Central Asia. I agree. \nWe must promote peace, democracy and economic growth in this important \nregion. But to do this, we can't ignore basic human rights or \nfundamental American values.\n  The Silk Roads Strategy Act would enable the President to waive \nSection 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Section 907 prohibits most \ndirect American aid to Azerbaijan until it takes demonstrable steps to \ncease all blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Section 907 \nhas been modified in recent years to enable humanitarian aid and aid \nprovided by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade \nDevelopment Agency and the Export Import Bank. Yet Azerbaijan has done \nnothing to end the embargo and has been recalcitrant in the OSCE peace \nprocess.\n  American foreign aid is not an entitlement. We have a right to place \nconditions on our assistance. We have a right to demand that countries \nreceiving US aid live up to certain basic humanitarian standards.\n  For almost ten years, Azerbaijan has maintained a blockade of \nArmenia. This blockade prevents the delivery of basic human needs--\nincluding food, medicine and fuel. What does this mean for the people \nof Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh? It means terrible human suffering. It \nmeans a high infant mortality rate and poor maternal health. It means \nhunger. It means shortages of the basic needs of life--food, medicine \nand energy.\n  Senator McConnell has offered a second degree amendment that would \nmaintain Section 907. This is a reasonable approach. The McConnell \namendment would enable us to strengthen relations with the Caucasus--\nwithout compromising our values.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the McConnell \namendment--and in opposing the Silk Roads Strategy Act.\n\n\n                     silk road strategy act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I think there has been more heat than light \nevidenced by those who have attempted to characterize what the \namendment offered by Senator Brownback seeks to achieve with the \nproposed amendment or with legislation that he introduced earlier this \nyear--the so called Silk Road Strategy Act.\n  I call attention to the language of the amendment and what it seeks \nto achieve support, the bill has even more expansive language in these \nareas.\n  Let me highlight for my colleagues just a few of these goals: to \npromote and strengthen independence, sovereignty, democratic government \nand respect for human rights; to promote tolerance, pluralism, and \nunderstanding and counter racism and anti-Semitism; to assist actively \nin the resolution of regional conflicts and to facilitate the removal \nof impediments to cross-border commerce; and to help promote market \noriented principles and practices.\n  The assistance authorized by this legislation is intended to promote \nreconciliation, economic development, and broad regional cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I think we would all agree that these are appropriate \ngoals\n\n[[Page S7876]]\n\nand programs that are worthy of U.S. support.\n  There is a great deal of misunderstanding about what the bill and the \nproposed amendment will do.\n  It does not supersede the Freedom Support Act nor does it repeal \nsection 907 of the Freedom Support Act which restricts assistance to \nAzerbaijan. Rather it gives the President the ability to waive \ncontinued application of the restrictions if he determines they do not \nserve United States national interests.\n  I opposed last year's version of the Silk Road legislation because I \nbelieved it went further than was wise or necessary in superseding the \nFreedom Support Act and in the outright repeal of restrictions on \nassistance to Azerbaijan.\n  Having said that, I have made no secret of the fact that I am \nincreasingly opposed to Congressionally mandated foreign policy \nrestrictions that do not include Presidential waiver authority. I think \nthat it makes the conduct of foreign policy extremely difficult and is \nnot the most effective way to promote the goals that Congress is \nseeking in the legislation it enacts.\n  Senator Brownback has struck the right balance in the legislation \nthat is before us today. It recognizes the challenges we face in \npromoting democracy and respect for human rights in the region and it \ngives the President sufficient tools to make progress in these areas.\n  I believe it also gives an incentive for governments in the region to \nmake progress in these important areas, knowing that if they do, they \nwill improve relations with the U.S. and open the door to economic \nassistance which they need if they are to make progress to building \ndemocratic institutions in their countries.\n  For that reason I support the underlying Brownback amendment and do \nnot believe that the perfecting amendment offered by Senator McConnell \nis necessary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Kansas, (Mr. Brownback), the so-called \n``Silk Road Strategy Act.'' I certainly support the Senator's desire to \npromote peace and democracy in Central Asia and the South Caucasus \nregion, but I remain concerned about the approach this legislation \ntakes toward achieving these laudable goals.\n  In particular, I am troubled by the provision in the Silk Road \nStrategy Act which would allow the President to waive Section 907 of \nthe Freedom Support Act. Section 907 prohibits United States assistance \nto the government of Azerbaijan until it takes demonstrable steps to \nend the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh. No such steps have been taken, \nMr. President. The blockade continues, as do human rights violations \nagainst the Armenian population in the region. I am concerned that the \nwaiver of Section 907 would, in effect, reward the Azeri government for \nits refusal to end the blockade.\n  For those reasons, I opposed prior versions of the Silk Road Strategy \nAct in the Committee on Foreign Relations in the 105th and 106th \nCongresses, and I signed on to the minority views contained in the \ncommittee report both times. Those views stated, in part, that ``to \nwaive [Section 907] in the absence of any progress toward a lifting of \nthe blockade would reward the Government of Azerbaijan for its \nintransigence and remove a major incentive for good-faith negotiation \nfrom one side in the conflict.''\n  Mr. President, a decision not to provide foreign assistance to a \ngovernment is not a sanction. The United States Congress has the \nresponsibility to prohibit the provision of bilateral assistance to \ngovernments with which we have serious concern. This is not a sanction; \nrather, it is a means of making our foreign policy goals clear. Foreign \nassistance is not an entitlement. Section 907 plainly states that there \nwill be no U.S. assistance to the government of Azerbaijan until the \nblockade is lifted. Period. As my colleagues well recall, this body has \nplaced numerous conditions on bilateral assistance to a variety of \ncountries. Section 907 is a condition, not a sanction. Moreover, many \ntypes of bilateral assistance are exempt from Section 907, and U.S. \ntrade with Azerbaijan has been unaffected by this provision.\n  I will support the McConnell-Abraham second degree amendment to \nstrike the waiver authority for Section 907 from the bill, and I will \noppose the Brownback amendment in its current form. I urge my \ncolleagues to do so as well.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the 2nd degree \nAmendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky. Without the McConnell \nAmendment, I find that I must oppose the underlying Amendment offered \nby the Senator from Kansas.\n  Although I think that many of the goals and objectives of Senator \nBrownback's Amendment are worthwhile--I too believe in establishing a \npolicy of greater U.S. engagement with the countries of the Caucasus \nand Central Asia--I find that I must oppose this Amendment because it \ncontains a fatal flaw: I do not think that Congress should get rid of \nSection 907 of the Freedom Support Act, which this Amendment does, so \nlong as Azerbaijan continues its decade-long blockade of Armenia and \nKarabakh.\n  The McConnell Amendment, which retains Section 907, would fix this \nflaw.\n  Expanding Azerbaijan's eligibility for assistance from the United \nStates without seeking progress on the resolution of this issue runs \nthe risk of legitimizing precisely the sort of behavior which the \nUnited States, on the cusp of a new century, must seek to discourage.\n  Azerbaijan is already eligible for U.S. humanitarian assistance, as \nwell as funds for democracy building and many trade benefits. All that \nAzerbaijan has to do under Section 907 to be eligible for the full \nrange of U.S. assistance is to ``take demonstrable steps to cease all \nblockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.''\n  In other words, all it has to do is end hostilities, end an act of \nwar, and seek to settle this dispute peacefully. If Azerbaijan were to \ntake these simple steps there would be no need to repeal Section 907--\nits restrictions would no longer apply. Is it too much to ask another \ncountry that it end a state of war before we provide it with additional \nforeign assistance?\n  In fact, given Azerbaijan's continued unwillingness to make an effort \nto peacefully resolve this issue, gutting Section 907 rewards \nAzerbaijan for continued bad behavior, and sends a very disturbing \nmessage to others who might behave likewise. Basically we would be \nsaying that it is O.K. to attack your neighbor, impose a blockade, stop \nfood, fuel, and medicine from getting through to those in need, the \nUnited States will simply look the other way. In fact, we will do more \nthan look the other way, we will consider offering you military \nassistance. I do not think this is the sort of message we should be \nsending.\n  The nations of the region must solve their problems via direct \nnegotiations and mutual compromise, not by acts of war. When Azerbaijan \nshows a willingness to end its blockade and seeks a peaceful resolution \nof the outstanding issues with Armenia then, and only then, should the \nUnited States provide it with the sort of assistance that this \nAmendment would allow.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the McConnell \nAmendment. And, unless the McConnell Amendment, which retains Section \n907, is passed by this body, I would urge my colleagues to join me in \nopposition to the underlying Brownback Amendment.\n\n\n                         Silk Road Strategy Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Brownback's \namendment to the FY 2000 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, the \naptly named ``Silk Road Strategy Act.'' This act puts in place a much-\nneeded strategy toward a much-overlooked part of the world, a part of \nthe world that the U.S. would ignore at considerable risk.\n  I commend my colleague from Kansas for the extraordinary effort he \nhas committed to shaping this policy and drafting this legislation. \nSenator Brownback has spent several years studying this region, \ntraveling through it, meeting with political leaders and economic \ndecision makers and discussing his thoughts with the Administration. \nThe fruits of this in-depth research and commitment are evident in this \namendment.\n  I also thank my colleague for working with me to include language in \nthis bill that strengthens the U.S. policy of opening these markets and \nraising\n\n[[Page S7877]]\n\nthese countries' level of economic cooperation with the United States \nthrough bilateral investment treaties.\n  As the senior Senator from Utah, I am very fortunate to represent a \nState with many far-sighted international commercial ventures, and the \nlanguage I proposed, which Senator Brownback has thoughtfully accepted, \nsupports those interests by requiring the Secretary of State to report \nannually on the progress that is being made in negotiating investment \ntreaties with nations of the region. I believe this measure will, for \nthe time being, be sufficient to monitor progress in these important \nnegotiations and will alert these nations to the serious concerns that \nthe U.S. Congress has in protecting U.S. investments abroad. U.S. \ncompanies investing in this region should have the protections of \nbilateral investment agreements.\n  This is entirely consistent with the strategy of the ``Silk Road \nAct,'' which is posited on the accurate belief that increased U.S. \nparticipation in this region is fundamental to their development and \nour interests.\n  The economic component is only one part of the strategy of this \namendment. By promoting infrastructure development, democratic \npolitical reforms, sovereignty, independence, and conflict resolution, \nthe Brownback proposal will contribute to political stability and \nprogress as well.\n  Last fall, during a visit to the region, I went to the Republic of \nGeorgia and renewed an acquaintance with Edouard Shevardnadze. An \nartful negotiator as foreign minister in the last years of the Soviet \nUnion, President Shevardnadze returned to has native Georgia, which \nbecame independent as a result of the demise of the Soviet Union. As \nPresident of Georgia, Edouard Shevardnadze has been a stalwart promoter \nof democracy and an open economy, and he has done so under very, very \ndifficult circumstances.\n  Close to one-quarter of his nation's territory is not under central \ngovernment control. Russian soldiers remain stationed on some of that \nterritory, against the will of the Georgian government. President \nShevardnadze has twice narrowly avoided assassination--one of his \nassassins freely resides in Russia today. In my discussions with \nPresident Shevardnadze, we discussed the need for increased U.S. \nattention to this region and increased participation by U.S. commercial \ninterests. This ``Silk Road Strategy Act'' promotes these goals.\n  The region of the world that this act addresses remains rife with \ninternal conflicts, cross-border incursions, and--perhaps most \ndisturbing--continued challenges by radical Islamic interests, \nsupported in many cases by the extremists in Iran. If these conflicts \nsucceed in destabilizing the region, millions of people recently freed \nfrom nearly a century of communist totalitarianism will be denied their \neconomic and political progress, nations surrounding the region will be \ndrawn into wider conflicts, and international markets will be affected.\n  Further, and most importantly, if this region slips toward \ninstability, I am deeply concerned that the U.S. will see the Central \nAsian and Caucasus States become the source of many future conflicts. \nSome of these conflicts could have troubling transnational consequences \nthat directly affect us, such as the spread of terrorism and \ninternational crime.\n  I commend Senator Brownback for this valuable legislation, which \nmakes a solid and important step in refocusing U.S. interests to a part \nof the world that is important to us now, and will be even more \nimportant in the future.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \namendment and the preservation of Section 907 of the Freedom Support \nAct. It is important that we maintain our commitment to the Armenian \npeople.\n  One of the greatest foreign policy priorities in the post-Cold War \nworld is to assist former Communist countries in making the difficult \ntransition to democracy. The fall of the Soviet Union was not the final \nvictory of the Cold War. That will come only when all of these former \nadversaries embrace liberty, free markets, and the rule of law. Senator \nBrownback's underlying amendment has the potential to further economic \nand political progress in the Caucasus and Caspian Sea regions. In its \ncurrent form, however, it severely weakens one of Congress' central \nachievements of the post-Cold War era.\n  The 102nd Congress in 1992, passed the Freedom Support Act. This bill \nacknowledged that we can help countries make the transition to \ndemocracy both with the carrot of economic aid and the stick of \nwithholding such assistance. It included a provision, Section 907, \nwhich mandated that Azerbaijan will not receive any direct economic aid \nuntil it ceases the blockade of neighboring Armenia and the Armenian \nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Even still, the United States has \nsupported the Azeri people with over $180 million in humanitarian \nassistance through NGOs since 1992. The Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill itself also allows OPIC and TDA activities in \nAzerbaijan which we approved last year.\n  The Azeri blockade of Armenia and of Karabakh is a direct result of \nthe dispute between the two countries over the status of Karabakh. This \nis the longest-running ethnic conflict in the former Soviet Union. So \nfar, the human cost has been 35,000 lives and 1.4 million refugees. \nOutside of the conflict, the brutality of the Azeri blockade has been \nequally devastating for Armenia. As a land-locked country where only 17 \npercent of the land is arable, its ties to the outside world are its \nlifeline. Humanitarian assistance cannot get to Armenia, which is still \ntrying to rebuild from the devastating earthquake of a decade ago. In \nKarabakh, the blockade has produced a critical shortage of medical \nequipment.\n  True regional cooperation is unrealistic as long as this conflict \ncontinues. By passing the underlying amendment in its current form, we \nare virtually guaranteeing that the OSCE peace process will fail. \nArmenia will have little incentive to participate in the future, and \nAzerbaijan will receive the message that its rejection of any future \npeace proposals is acceptable. I support Senator Brownback's attempts \nto promote an East-West axis in the region, and I believe it is \ncritical that we encourage these former republics to look westward. By \nallowing the blockade to endure, however, we are leaving Armenia with \nonly North-South options. If our intent is to truly improve the quality \nof life in the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea, we must make a positive \nimpact on the Caucasus without undermining our commitment to the \nArmenian people. I urge my colleagues to support the McConnell-Abraham \namendment and allow Section 907 to remain in place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7877-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  VISIT TO THE SENATE BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT, \n                         MOHAMMED HOSNI MUBARAK\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Their work demonstrates the \n     significant impact that USAID support of a U.S. non-\n     governmental organization (NGO) program can have on the key \n     U.S. foreign policy priorities of promoting broad-based, \n     stable economic growth and open, market-oriented economies in \n     transitioning economies. By drawing upon the skills and \n     voluntary spirit of U.S. businessmen and women to introduce \n     companies, CDC furthers the goals of the Freedom of Support \n     Act (NIS) and Support for Eastern European Democracy (SEED), \n     forging positive, lasting connections between the U.S. and \n     these countries. The Committee endorses CDC's very cost-\n     effective programs and believes they should be supported and \n     expanded not only in the former Soviet Union and Eastern \n     Europe, but in transitioning and developing economiecs \n     throughout the world.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1146\n\n (Purpose: To provide substitute language relating to restrictions on \n assistance to countries providing sanctuary to indicted war criminals)\n\n       Beginning on page 100, strike line 11 and all that follows \n     through line 13 on page 107 and insert the following:\n\n\n RESTRICTIONS ON ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES, ENTITIES, AND COMMUNITIES IN \n  THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA PROVIDING SANCTUARY TO PUBLICLY INDICTED WAR \n                               CRIMINALS\n\n       Sec.  567.

Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Leahy for including my amendment No. 1146 in the \nmanagers' package.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to ensure U.S. aid \ndoes not go to countries or regions or communities in the former \nYugoslavia which continue to harbor indicted war criminals.\n  This amendment would improve language we adopted last year with a \nclearer provision covering all of the former Yugoslavia.\n  Mr. President, we have seen terrible atrocities committed in Croatia, \nin Bosnia, and most recently in Kosovo.\n  The International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia has \npublicly indicted 89 persons for war crimes, crimes against humanity, \nand genocide. There are almost certainly more indictments which remain \nsealed. Ongoing investigations in Bosnia and now in Kosovo will surely \nlead to more indictments.\n  However, the justice of the War Crimes Tribunal relies on the \ngovernments of countries in the region to apprehend indicted war \ncriminals and transfer them to The Hague to stand trial.\n  Because the Republika Srpska authorities failed to fulfill their \nresponsibilities, United States and other NATO armed forces in the \nUnited Nations-authorized peacekeeping force in Bosnia have arrested 7 \nwar criminals. However, 36 publicly indicted war criminals remain at \nlarge.\n  Mr. President, our aid programs provide important leverage to \nmotivate governments in the former Yugoslavia to stop harboring war \ncriminals and start arresting them.\n  United States policy linking aid to cooperation with the war crimes \ntribunal is clear.\n  Indeed, a few years ago, Secretary Albright said the following in her \nremarks at the Tribunal:\n\n       . . . The United States has made full cooperation with the \n     War Crimes Tribunal, especially the transfer of indictees to \n     The Hague, a prerequisite for U.S. assistance, our support \n     for assistance by others, and our backing for membership in \n     international institutions.\n\n  Unfortunately, the administration has resisted putting this policy \ninto practice. Indeed, Secretary Albright has issued broad waivers of \nthe provision included in the fiscal year 1998 and 1999 appropriations \nbills. The United States now provides aid to the city of Prijedor which \nhosts no fewer than 8 indicted war criminals.\n  Just this month Secretary Albright signed another waiver to provide \n$10 million in budget support to the Republika Srpska Government--the \nvery Government which includes the Bosnian Serb police force which \nshould be carrying out arrest warrants and is not.\n  Mr. President, ever more atrocities committed by Serbian police and \nparamilitary forces in Kosovo are coming to light: executions, torture, \nrape, burning of homes, expulsions on a massive scale.\n  We must now send a strong signal that we are determined to see the \nperpetrators of these crimes face justice. We must end our support for \nso-called moderates in Republika Srpska until and unless they fulfill \ntheir obligations to arrest war criminals and cooperate with the War \nCrimes Tribunal.\n  The Amendment I am offering today clearly states the policy of the \nUnited States ``to use bilateral and multilateral assistance to promote \npeace and respect for internationally recognized human rights by \nencouraging countries, entities, and communities in the territory of \nthe former Yugoslavia,'' among other things ``by apprehending publicly \nindicted war criminals and transferring custody of those individuals to \nthe Tribunal to stand trial.''\n  The amendment sets out mechanisms to ensure that U.S. and \nmultilateral aid will go to areas like the Bosnian Federation, where no \nwar criminals remain at large, while prohibiting aid to authorities and \nareas that harbor war criminals.\n  Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to join me in this effort \nto ensure that the perpetrators of horrible crimes in Croatia, Bosnia, \nand Kosovo will ultimately face justice.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1150\n\n     (Purpose: Providing assistance to promote democracy in Serbia)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenator Burns and Senator DeWine, to offer an amendment to the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations bill. This amendment would provide $10 \nmillion to the State Department Bureau of International Law Enforcement \nAffairs\n\n[[Page S7880]]\n\nfor mycoherbicide research and development to be used for narcotic crop \neradication. The appropriations bill, as it currently stands, provides \nno funding for this important tool in our war against illegal drugs.\n  Many of my colleagues and I view this mycoherbicide technology as a \npromising new tool that will reduce the cultivation and supply of \nnarcotic crops, and thereby increasing our capacity to combat illegal \ndrugs. I have been briefed on the mycoherbicide technology and \nunderstand that it is a naturally occurring plant pathogen that can be \nintroduced into an area to control a target plant species. The program \nis also environmentally friendly--it posses no threat to humans or \nanimals, other crops, or water supply and replaces the use of harmful \nchemicals. In addition, the program is a cost effective tool in our war \non drugs. The mycoherbicides will remain in the soil for an extended \nperiod of time, for up to 40 years, and costs a fraction of the $2.65 \nbillion we spend on other supply reduction methods.\n  I remind my colleagues that Congress has recognized the importance of \nthis technology and its ability to eradicate deadly crops when it \nendorsed the program last year in the Western Hemisphere Drug \nElimination Act. The program was funded in the amount of $23 million \nfor fiscal year 1999. I strongly urge my colleagues to continue their \nsupport for this program by passing this amendment and supporting the \ncontinued development of the mycoherbicide program.\n  Mr. President, as illegal drugs continue to cross our borders and \nthreaten the welfare of American citizens, this program is a top \npriority that can significantly reduce the production of narcotics \ncrops. We know that elimination of illicit crops is the best way of \npreventing deadly drugs from reaching our streets and destroying untold \nlives and communities. I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Burns, \nSenator DeWine and me in support of this amendment and in support of \nthis important program.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss yet again one of \nthe key problems I have been addressing, as a U.S. Senator, over the \nlast four years. The problem is the inflow of illegal drugs into \nAmerica. I have heard it said that if we eliminate demand, if we \naddress the domestic side of drug abuse, we really don't have to worry \nabout illegal narcotics producers and importers, because they would \nthen have no market for their drugs.\n  Mr. President, this argument makes sense on a superficial level, but \nit does not reflect reality. I have been, throughout my career as a \nlocal, state and Federal elected official, a strong supporter of \ndomestic efforts to reduce drug demand. But I have always believed--and \ncontinue to believe--that we need a balanced program to attack the drug \nproblem on all fronts. We need to invest not only in domestic demand \nreduction and law enforcement programs, but also in international \nprograms to increase interdiction and reduce production of illegal \nnarcotics. We need to do our best to stop drugs from ever reaching our \nborders.\n  Mr. President, for nearly a year, I have expressed my belief that \nthis Administration is not doing its best to address this problem. \nLittle seems to have changed in one year.\n  Before this Administration took office, almost one-third of our \ncounter narcotics resources were committed to stopping drugs outside \nour borders. Today, that figure is less than 14 percent. Although \noverall funding for counter narcotics programs has increased \ndramatically in the last decade, from $4.5 billion to $17.8 billion, \nstatistics show an increase in drug use among our youngest citizens. I \nam disturbed by how easily and how cheaply illegal drugs can be \npurchased. I am disturbed that the Administration is not taking \nseriously the initiatives Congress passed last year as part of the \nbipartisan Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act.\n  Mr. President, President's Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2000 \nprovided ZERO funding for any of the initiatives in that Act. In fact, \nthe President's overall anti-drug budget for next year is $100 million \nless than what Congress provided in 1999. The Coast Guard received no \nfunding to acquire additional ships and planes to stop drug trafficking \nin the Caribbean; the Drug Enforcement Administration received ZERO \nfunding for new agents; the US Customs Service received ZERO funding to \nacquire maritime/air assets, and ZERO increases for inspectors.\n  In addition, the Administration has also ignored other key \ninitiatives sought by Congress, including mycoherbicide research and \ndevelopment, and eradication and alternative crop development \nassistance to our Latin American neighbors, particularly, Colombia and \nBolivia. I very much appreciate the efforts of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Foreign Operations in working with me on these issues. \nThey have done a remarkable job to incorporate a key anti-drug \ninitiative that was not sought by the President.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, I commend the managers of the bill for \naccepting the amendment offered by the Senator from Montana, Senator \nBurns, to fund the mycoherbicide program which we began funding last \nyear under the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. Mycoherbicide \ntechnology is a new and promising eradication technique for coca, \npoppy, and marijuana. The concept is to employ a natural disease that \nonly attacks a specific narcotics plant without harming neighboring \nvegetation. Mycoherbicides can be applied through aerial spraying and \nwill remain in the soil to prevent future growth of the narcotics crops \nin that area. Mr. President, this has the potential to be a very cost-\neffective and low-risk way to drastically reduce drug production at its \nsource. We must pursue this technology and fund the additional research \nand testing necessary to bring about a deployable product as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, let me now turn to the subject of eradication and \nalternative crop development assistance to Colombia and Bolivia. I am \nparticularly concerned about the lack of resources made available by \nthis Administration for what I consider to be our most urgent foreign \nassistance project--counter narcotics funding. I fear that we are \nsending a signal abroad that the United States is not entirely serious \nabout the fight against drugs.\n  The report language accompanying this bill makes special mention of \nthe progress made in the drug fight by the Government of Bolivia, and I \nwant to add my voice to the committee report as well. Since coming to \npower in August of 1997, the Government of President Hugo Banzer and \nVice President Jorge Quiroga has undertaken an ambitious plan to remove \nBolivia from the illegal narcotics trade by the time they leave office \nin 2002.\n  Mr. President, many, myself included, were skeptical that this goal \ncould be reached in the time allotted. Now, nearly two years into their \n``Dignity Plan,'' the Bolivian Government has shown that this goal can \nbe reached. Since taking office, the Banzer Government has successfully \nreduced Bolivia's cocaine production potential by a remarkable 40 \npercent. This has been accomplished by an effective eradication program \nand an aggressive and successful program of interdiction and control of \nthe chemical precursors which go into cocaine production.\n  The Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill makes mention of Bolivia's \nsuccess, and its financial needs. I am deeply concerned that we are not \nproviding sufficient support to the historic effort of the Bolivian \nGovernment. They have moved tens of thousands of farmers out of the \nillegal coca fields and it is absolutely imperative that we help to \nprovide viable commercial alternatives for these farmers and their \nfamilies. It would be a great tragedy to be within sight of a major \nvictory in the drug war and to lose it for want of resources. The \nanticipated level of funding in this Bill falls far short of what is \nrequired to finish the job in Bolivia in the next two years.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with the Senator from \nAlaska, Senator Stevens, the Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, \nand the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, to help Bolivia and other \ncountries in their fight against drugs. We will work with the \nappropriators during conference to provide the highest possible level \nof funding for this effort. This is a key investment in the future \nsafety of our own streets--and it will bring us closer to the drug-free \nAmerica our children deserve.\n\n[[Page S7881]]\n\n                           amendment no. 1158\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill at the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.   .

(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Since the development of antibiotics in the 1950s, \n     tuberculosis has been largely controlled in the United States \n     and the Western World.\n       (2) Due to societal factors, including growing urban decay, \n     inadequate health care systems, persistent poverty, \n     overcrowding, and malnutrition, as well as medical factors, \n     including the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the emergence of multi-\n     drug resistant strains of tuberculosis, tuberculosis has \n     again become a leading and growing cause of adult deaths in \n     the developing world.\n       (3) According to the World Health Organization--\n       (A) in 1998, about 1,860,000 people worldwide died of \n     tuberculosis-related illnesses;\n       (B) one-third of the world's total population is infected \n     with tuberculosis; and\n       (C) tuberculosis is the world's leading killer of women \n     between 15 and 44 years old and is a leading cause of \n     children becoming orphans.\n       (4) Because of the ease of transmission of tuberculosis, \n     its international persistence and growth pose a direct public \n     health threat to those nations that had previously largely \n     controlled the disease. This is complicated in the United \n     States by the growth of the homeless population, the rate of \n     incarceration, international travel, immigration, and HIV/\n     AIDS.\n       (5) With nearly 40 percent of the tuberculosis cases in the \n     United States attributable to foreign-born persons, \n     tuberculosis will never be eliminated in the United States \n     until it is controlled abroad.\n       (6) The means exist to control tuberculosis through \n     screening, diagnosis, treatment, patient compliance, \n     monitoring, and ongoing review of outcomes.\n       (7) Efforts to control tuberculosis are complicated by \n     several barriers, including--\n       (A) the labor intensive and lengthy process involved in \n     screening, detecting, and treating the disease;\n       (B) a lack of funding, trainer personnel, and medicine in \n     virtually every nation with a high rate of the disease; and\n       (C) the unique circumstances in each country, which \n     requires the development and implementation of country-\n     specific programs.\n       (8) Eliminating the barriers to the international control \n     of tuberculosis through a well-structured, comprehensive, and \n     coordinated worldwide effort would be a significant step in \n     dealing with the increasing public health problem posed by \n     the disease.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that if the total allocation for this Act is higher than the \n     level passed by the Senate, a top priority for the additional \n     funds should be to increase the funding to combat infectious \n     diseases, especially tuberculosis.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1163\n\n (Purpose: Supporting an international conference to achieve a durable \n                  political settlement in the Balkans)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AN INTERNATIONAL \n                   CONFERENCE ON THE BALKANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and its allies in the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) conducted large-scale military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (2) At the conclusion of 78 days of these hostilities, the \n     United States and its NATO allies suspended military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia based \n     upon credible assurances by the latter that it would fulfill \n     the following conditions as laid down by the so called Group \n     of Eight (G-8):\n       (A) An immediate and verifiable end of violence and \n     repression in Kosovo.\n       (B) Staged withdrawal of all Yugoslav military, police, and \n     paramilitary forces from Kosovo.\n       (C) Deployment in Kosovo of effective international and \n     security presences, endorsed and adopted by the United \n     Nations Security Council, and capable of guaranteeing the \n     achievement of the agreed objectives.\n       (D) Establishment of an interim administration for Kosovo, \n     to be decided by the United Nations Security Council which \n     will seek to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life \n     for all inhabitants in Kosovo.\n       (E) Provision for the safe and free return of all refugees \n     and displaced persons from Kosovo and an unimpeded access to \n     Kosovo by humanitarian aid organizations.\n       (3) These objectives appear to have been fulfilled, or to \n     be in the process of being fulfilled, which has led the \n     United States and its NATO allies to terminate military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (4) The G-8 also called for a comprehensive approach to the \n     economic development and stabilization of the crisis region, \n     and the European Union has announced plans for $1,500,000,000 \n     over the next 3 years for the reconstruction of Kosovo, for \n     the convening in July of an international donors' conference \n     for Kosovo aid, and for subsequent provision of \n     reconstruction aid to the other countries in the region \n     affected by the recent hostilities followed by reconstruction \n     aid directed at the Balkans region as a whole.\n       (5) The United States and some of its NATO allies oppose \n     the provision of any aid, other than limited humanitarian \n     assistance, to Serbia until Yugoslav President Slobodan \n     Milosevic is out of office.\n       (6) The policy of providing reconstruction aid to Kosovo \n     and other countries in the region affected by the recent \n     hostilities while withholding such aid for Serbia presents a \n     number of practical problems, including the absence in Kosovo \n     of financial and other institutions independent of \n     Yugoslavia, the difficulty in drawing clear and enforceable \n     distinctions between humanitarian and reconstruction \n     assistance, and the difficulty in reconstructing Montenegro \n     in the absence of similar efforts in Serbia.\n       (7) In any case, the achievement of effective and durable \n     economic reconstruction and revitalization in the countries \n     of the Balkans is unlikely until a political settlement is \n     reached as to the final status of Kosovo and Yugoslavia.\n       (8) The G-8 proposed a political process towards the \n     establishment of an interim political framework agreement for \n     a substantial self-government for Kosovo, taking into full \n     account the final Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-\n     Government in Kosovo, also known as the Rambouillet Accords, \n     and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity \n     of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other countries \n     of the region, and the demilitarization of the UCK (Kosovo \n     Liberation Army).\n       (9) The G-8 proposal contains no guidance as to a final \n     political settlement for Kosovo and Yugoslavia, while the \n     original position of the United States and the other \n     participants in the so-called Contact Group on this matter, \n     as reflected in the Rambouillet Accords, called for the \n     convening of an international conference, after 3 years, to \n     determine a mechanism for a final settlement of Kosovo status \n     based on the will of the people, opinions of relevant \n     authorities, each Party's efforts regarding the \n     implementation of the agreement and the provisions of the \n     Helsinki Final Act.\n       (10) The current position of the United States and its NATO \n     allies as to the final status of Kosovo and Yugoslavia calls \n     for an autonomous, multiethnic, democratic Kosovo which would \n     remain as part of Serbia, and such an outcome is not \n     supported by any of the Parties directly involved, including \n     the governments of Yugoslavia and Serbia, representatives of \n     the Kosovar Albanians, and the people of Yugoslavia, Serbia \n     and Kosovo.\n       (11) There has been no final political settlement in \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the Armed Forces of the United \n     States, its NATO allies, and other non-Balkan nations have \n     been enforcing an uneasy peace since 1996, at a cost to the \n     United States alone of over $10,000,000,000, with no clear \n     end in sight to such enforcement.\n       (12) The trend throughout the Balkans since 1990 has been \n     in the direction of ethnically based particularism, as \n     exemplified by the 1991 declarations of independence from \n     Yugoslavia by Slovenia and Croatia, and the country in the \n     Balkans which currently comes the closest to the goal of a \n     democratic government which respects the human rights of its \n     citizens is the nation of Slovenia, which was the first \n     portion of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to \n     secede and is also the nation in the region with the greatest \n     ethnic homogeneity, with a population which is 91 percent \n     Slovene.\n       (13) The boundaries of the various national and sub-\n     national divisions in the Balkans have been altered \n     repeatedly throughout history, and international conferences \n     have frequently played the decisive role in fixing such \n     boundaries in the modern era, including the Berlin Congress \n     of 1878, the London Conference of 1913, and the Paris Peace \n     Conference of 1919.\n       (14) The development of an effective exit strategy for the \n     withdrawal from the Balkans of foreign military forces, \n     including the armed forces of the United States, its NATO\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n\n     allies, Russia, and any other nation from outside the Balkans \n     which has such forces in the Balkans is in the best interests \n     of all such nations.\n       (15) The ultimate withdrawal of foreign military forces, \n     accompanied by the establishment of durable and peaceful \n     relations among all of the nations and peoples of the Balkans \n     is in the best interests of those nations and peoples.\n       (16) An effective exit strategy for the withdrawal from the \n     Balkans of foreign military forces is contingent upon the \n     achievement of a lasting political settlement for the region, \n     and that only such a settlement, acceptable to all parties \n     involved, can ensure the fundamental goals of the United \n     States of peace, stability, and human rights in the Balkans;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should call immediately for the \n     convening of an international conference on the Balkans, \n     under the auspices of the United Nations, and based upon the \n     principles of the Rambouillet Accords for a final settlement \n     of Kosovo status, namely that such a settlement should be \n     based on the will of the people, opinions of relevant \n     authorities, each Party's efforts regarding the \n     implementation of the agreement and the provisions of the \n     Helsinki Final Act;\n       (2) the international conference on the Balkans should also \n     be empowered to seek a final settlement for Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina based on the same principles as specified for \n     Kosovo in the Rambouillet Accords; and\n       (3) in order to produce a lasting political settlement in \n     the Balkans acceptable to all parties, which can lead to the \n     departure from the Balkans in timely fashion of all foreign \n     military forces, including those of the United States, the \n     international conference should have the authority to \n     consider any and all of the following: political boundaries; \n     humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for all nations in \n     the Balkans; stationing of United Nations peacekeeping forces \n     along international boundaries; security arrangements and \n     guarantees for all of the nations of the Balkans; and \n     tangible, enforceable and verifiable human rights guarantees \n     for the individuals and peoples of the Balkans.\n

(a) The President shall continue and expand \n     efforts through the United Nations and other international \n     fora, including the Wassenaar Arrangement, to limit arms \n     transfers worldwide. The President shall take the necessary \n     steps to begin multilateral negotiations within 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, for the purpose \n     of establishing a permanent multilateral regime to govern the \n     transfer of conventional arms, particularly transfers to \n     countries:\n       (1) that engage in persistent violations of human rights, \n     engage in acts of armed aggression in violation of \n     international law, and do not fully participate in the United \n     Nations Register of Conventional Arms; and\n       (2) in regions in which arms transfers would exacerbate \n     regional arms races or international tensions that present a \n     danger to international peace and stability.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--(1) Not later than 6 months after \n     the commencement of the negotiations under subsection (a), \n     and not later than the end of every 6-month period thereafter \n     until an agreement described in subsection (a) is concluded, \n     the President shall report to the appropriate committees of \n     the Congress on the progress made during these negotiations.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today calls on \nthe President to begin multilateral negotiations for the purpose of \nestablishing a permanent multilateral regime to govern the transfer of \nconventional arms to countries that engage in persistent violations of \nhuman rights, engage in acts of armed aggression, do not fully \nparticipate in the United Nations Register of Conventional, and \ncountries in regions in which arms transfers would exacerbate regional \narms races or international tensions.\n  As the United States and its allies work to expand the community of \ndemocratic nations and prevent the spread of violence and ethnic \nconflict, we must give higher priority to consideration of how \nconventional arms transfers may work to undermine these important \nobjectives. It is simply not in our interest to allow weapons to flow \nfreely into countries who abuse the rights of their citizens or who are \nengaged in conflict or destabilizing arms races.\n  International restraint in arms exports is important to U.S. national \nsecurity interests, as well as for the furtherance of democracy and \nhuman rights. The June 1996 ``Report of the Presidential Advisory Board \non Arms Proliferation Policy'' concluded that U.S. and international \nsecurity are threatened by the proliferation of advanced conventional \nweapons. According to the Report, ``The world struggles today with the \nimplications of advanced conventional weapons. It will in the future be \nconfronted with yet another generation of weapons, whose destructive \npower, size, cost, and availability can raise many more problems even \nthan their predecessors today. These challenges will require a new \nculture among nations, one that accepts increased responsibility for \ncontrol and restraint, despite short-term economic and political \nfactors pulling in other directions.'' An international Code of Conduct \nis a step toward that new culture.\n  The United States is far-and-away the world's biggest arms merchant, \nand we must lead the way for the rest of the world in addressing this \nissue. But we cannot do it alone. A unilateral decision by the United \nStates to limit conventional arms transfers would be an important \nsignal of our commitment to this issue, but it would not stop the flow \nof weapons into the countries about whom we are most concerned. We \nshould be under no illusion about the ability or willingness of other \narms-producing nations to rush in and fill any gap we might create. \nThis amendment will require the President to expand international \nefforts to curb worldwide arms sales through the United Nations and \nother fora, such as the Wassenaar Agreement, and to report to the \nCongress on progress made during these negotiations.\n  The United States should lead the way to establishing a multilateral \nregime to prevent nations that ignore the rights of their citizens or \nbully their neighbors from obtaining the weapons that support these \nnefarious activities. This legislation can be the vehicle to accomplish \nthis important objective. I thank the managers of this bill for \naccepting my amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1168\n\n               Purpose: To restrict U.S. aid to Cambodia\n\n       On page 13, strike lines 2 through the colon on line 14, \n     and insert in lieu the following:\n  ``None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be made available \nfor activities or programs for the Central Government of Cambodia until \nthe Secretary of State determines and reports to the Committee on \nAppropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations that the \nGovernment of Cambodia has established a tribunal consistent with the \nrequirements of international law and justice including the \nparticipation of international jurists and prosecutors for the trial of \nthose who committed genocide or crimes against humanity and that the \nGovernment of Cambodia is making significant progress in establishing \nan independent and accountable judicial system, a professional military \nsubordinate to civilian control, and a neutral and accountable police \nforce:''\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the pending bill prohibits the \nAdministration from providing aid to the central government of Cambodia \npending certification by the Secretary of State that Cambodia has held \nfree and fair elections, that the Central Election Commission was \ncomprised of representatives from all parties, and that the Cambodian \ngovernment has established an international panel of jurists to try \nindividuals who have committed genocide against the Cambodian people.\n  I share the Committee's view that aid can be a source of leverage in \ndealing with the new Cambodian government, and I agree that we should \nuse our aid to encourage the Cambodian government to establish a \ncredible, internationally acceptable genocide tribunal. However, I do \nnot believe that the conditions in the bill provide us with effective \nleverage because they are outdated and irrelevant to the realities on \nthe ground in Cambodia today.\n  All of us who are involved with Cambodia recognize full well that the \nelections held last July in Cambodia were a mixed bag at best. The \nprocess leading up to the elections had flaws. The elections themselves \nwere quite successful in terms of large voter turnout, lack of \nintimidation, international monitoring, and lack of violence. But they \nwere less than perfect.\n  Cambodians know this, but they have moved on. They have formed a new \ncoalition government with what appears to be a workable power sharing \narrangement between the two major parties. They have an effective \nopposition party. The Khmer Rouge is no longer a military or political \nplayer, looming as a threat to the new government. The climate of \npolitical intimidation and violence that has so often characterized \nCambodia is no longer prevalent.\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\nThe new Cambodian government has put forth a policy platform which, if \nimplemented, would enable Cambodia to make real strides toward the \nestablishment of democratic institutions and processes.\n  In light of these realities, it makes no sense to put restrictions on \nour aid that simply cut off the aid and prevent us from using US aid as \nan incentive to move the Cambodian government to deal with the serious \nproblems that are on the table now--building an independent judiciary, \nreforming the military and the policy so that they are professional, \nneutral and accountable, providing health care and schooling, and \ntackling the overwhelming problem of poverty.\n  The amendment that I am offering with Senator McCain replaces the \nconditions in the bill with new conditions designed to promote the \nbuilding of democratic institutions and to encourage the Cambodian \ngovernment to establish a tribunal consistent with the requirements of \ninternational law and justice to try those guilty of genocide and \ncrimes against humanity.\n  Specifically, this amendment prohibits aid to the central government \npending a certification by the Secretary of State that Cambodia is \nmaking significant progress in establishing an independent and \naccountable judicial system, a professional military subordinate to \ncivilian control, and a neutral and accountable police force. The \namendment also requires the Secretary to certify that the Cambodian \ngovernment has established a tribunal consistent with the requirements \nof international law and justice and including the participation of \ninternational jurists and prosecutors for the trial of those who \ncommitted genocide or crimes against humanity.\n  Let me say a word about the condition related to the tribunal. When I \nwas in Cambodia in April, I had extensive discussions with Prime \nMinister Hun Sen, National Assembly Chairman Prince Ranarridh, King \nSihanouk, and others about the issues related to the constitution of a \ngenocide tribunal. While the Prime Minister insisted that the tribunal \nbe in Cambodia, he agreed with my proposal that international judges, \nprosecutors and investigators actively participate in the process. He \nalso indicated that he would support changes in Cambodian law to allow \nthese individuals to actively operate within the Cambodian judicial \nsystem. Prince Ranariddh and King Sihanouk also were supportive of this \nconcept.\n  I believe that this kind of tribunal, with meaningful international \nparticipation, could provide a credible and accountable process, \nconsistent with international law and standards, for trying those who \ncommitted genocide and crimes against humanity. The carrot of US aid \ncan serve as an important incentive for the Cambodian government to \nfollow through on this process.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a good amendment and I thank the \nmanagers for accepting it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to join with Senator Kerry in \noffering an amendment to the foreign operations appropriations bill \nthat would replace language currently in the bill pertaining to \nCambodia with language that I firmly believe will prove far more \nproductive in accomplishing our goals in that strife-torn nation. The \namendment would replace the current prohibition on assistance pending \nunrealistic and counterproductive certifications with attainable goals \nconsistent with the positive developments that have occurred in \nCambodia since its elections last July.\n  Few countries in the entire world have experienced the scale of \nsuffering since the Second World War that was inflicted upon the people \nof Cambodia between 1975 and 1979. A phrase that has become a part of \nour normal lexicon in discussions of tragedies of great proportion in \nforeign countries originated in descriptions of the killing fields of \nCambodia. What transpired in that country during the rule of the Khmer \nRouge defies comprehension. It is a history, however, that must not be \nforgotten.\n  After decades of struggling with political events in Cambodia, we \nhave an opportunity to finally help it move in a positive direction. We \nhave an opportunity to help the people of that beautiful nation to \nbegin to put their painful past behind them, and to join the community \nof nations in good standing. We cannot accomplish that objective, \nhowever, with the language currently in the bill before us today. That \nlanguage prohibits all direct U.S. assistance to the central government \nof Cambodia until the Secretary of State certifies that the July 1998 \nelections were free and fair, with emphasis on the period leading up to \nelection day.\n  Few would argue that numerous irregularities occurred in the months \nleading up to the election of July 26, 1998. I wish that had not been \nthe case. But those irregularities took place, and we cannot change the \npast. The question, however, becomes where we go from here. The \nelection itself was, by and large, a free and fair election, and it is \nunlikely that the pre-election irregularities fundamentally altered its \noutcome. Since the election, the main competing factions have agreed at \nan amicable arrangement, and Cambodia today stands its best chance of \nmaking significant political and economic progress. A U.S. role, which \nis currently limited to support of nongovernmental organizations \nanyway, can be instrumental in facilitating greater levels of \nliberalization. The Central Government of Cambodia shows every sign of \nwanting to move in that direction. That is why the language in this \nbill is so troubling. It fails to account for a far more positive \npolitical atmosphere in Cambodia than has existed in decades.\n  We can help Cambodia to move forward, or we can stand aside and see \nan opportunity to act productively in Southeast Asia squandered. I am \nunder no illusions about the scale of problems that continue to plague \nthat troubled nation. The government of Phnom Penh must move forward on \nthe issue of establishing an international tribunal for the prosecution \nof Khmer Rouge officials, it must continue to address pressing issues \nlike deforestation, and it must carry out needed political and economic \nreforms. But we must not let an important opportunity to help such \nreforms move forward by restricting aid unless the State Department \ncertifies to something all parties know cannot be certified. We can \npredicate our policy toward Cambodia on the past, or we can remember \nthe past but look to the future. The Kerry-McCain amendment provides an \nopportunity to do the latter. I urge its support.\n\n\n                             Amendment 1173\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following section:\n\n     SEC.  . EXPANDED THREAT REDUCTION INITIATIVE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the programs contained \n     in the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative are vital to the \n     national security of the United States and that funding for \n     those programs should be restored in conference to the levels \n     requested in the President's budget.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Amendment 1174\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.  . Sense of the Senate Regarding U.S. Commitments \n     Under the U.S.-North Korean Agreed Framework.--It is the \n     Sense of the Senate that, as long as North Korea meets its \n     obligations under the U.S.-North Korean nuclear Agreed \n     Framework of 1994, the U.S. should meet its commitments under \n     the Agreed Framework, including required deliveries of heavy \n     fuel oil to North Korea and support of the Korean Peninsula \n     Energy Development Organization (KEDO).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the foreign operations \nappropriations bill being considered by the Senate. There is one area \nof this bill that I believe deserves particular attention, and that is \nthe series of provisions relating to U.S. funding for the Korean \nPeninsula Energy Development Organization, or KEDO. This is the \norganization that is implementing certain provisions of the U.S.-North \nKorean nuclear Agreed Framework of 1994. U.S. funds for KEDO pay for \nthe heavy fuel oil that the U.S. is committed to provide to North Korea \nin exchange for its agreement to freeze and eventually dismantle its \nplutonium production program that could be used for nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, that Agreed Framework is working in our national \nsecurity interests now. Under that agreement, North Korea has frozen \nits plutonium production facilities and canned almost all of the spent \nnuclear reactor fuel from its graphite-moderated reactor in Yongbyon, \nall under the watchful eye of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \npersonnel and monitoring instruments.\n  As recent Secretaries of Defense and Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff\n\n[[Page S7884]]\n\nhave repeatedly and consistently testified to Congress, it is clearly \nin our security interest that North Korea not produced any more \nplutonium and that its spend reactor fuel be canned and removed from \nNorth Korea. In addition, it is important for North Korea to account \nfor all its past plutonium production to the satisfaction of the IAEA. \nIf, and only if, North Korea satisfies all those requirements of the \nAgreed Framework, then KEDO, will provide two lightwater nuclear power \nproduction reactors to North Korea, with South Korea and Japan paying \nthe overwhelming majority of the cost of those reactors.\n  The U.S. is required to provide heavy fuel oil to North Korea on an \nagreed schedule, and we have had a spotty record so far, largely \nbecause of Congressional funding reductions and restrictions. But we \nhave managed to deliver the required oil, albeit sometimes late.\n  This bill would reduce the Administration's funding request for heavy \nfuel oil from $55 million to $40 million dollars, a decrease of $15 \nmillion. This reduction would prevent the U.S. from purchasing and \ndelivering the required heavy fuel oil to North Korea. In my view, what \nwould be a serious mistake.\n  If we do not provide the required heavy fuel oil under the Agreed \nFramework, we would be failing to meet our commitments under the Agreed \nFramework. This would provide North Korea with a ready-made excuse to \nwithdraw from or violate the Agreed Framework, something we should all \nrecognize would be contrary to our national interests and bad for U.S. \nsecurity.\n  As long as North Korea meets its obligations under the Agreed \nFramework, we should meet our commitments and obligations under the \nAgreed Framework, including providing the funds necessary to deliver \nall the required heavy fuel oil to North Korea.\n  Mr. President, this bill also places unnecessary and unworkable \nrestrictions on the obligation of the $40 million that is provided for \nKEDO. These are contained in certifications required before the funds \ncan be obligated. Two of these certifications go beyond the terms of \nthe Agreed Framework and would make it very hard for the U.S. to \nprovide funds to KEDO, unless the President uses a waiver.\n  I believe it is important that we work in good faith to keep North \nKorea in compliance with its obligations under the Agreed Framework, \nand that includes our obligation to provide the necessary funds to \ndeliver the required heavy fuel oil to North Korea.\n  When the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee \nmembers met recently with Former Defense Secretary William Perry, the \nPresident's Special Advisor on North Korea, one of my colleagues asked \nDr. Perry what Congress could do to help move North Korea in a more \npeaceful and cooperative direction. Dr. Perry indicated that the most \nimportant Congressional action would be to provide full funding for \nKEDO. I believe Dr. Perry is correct.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons I offer an amendment to the bill \nthat states the sense of the Senate that, ``as long as North Korea \nmeets its obligations under the U.S.-North Korean nuclear Agreed \nFramework of 1994, the U.S. should meet its commitments under the \nAgreed Framework, including required deliveries of heavy fuel oil to \nNorth Korea and support of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development \nOrganization (KEDO).''\n  This amendment puts the Senate on record as stating its view that the \nUnited States should meet its commitments under the Agreed Framework, \nincluding the heavy fuel oil and KEDO commitments.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment improves the bill and makes \nit clear that the Senate wants the U.S. to uphold its end of the Agreed \nFramework, and I hope that the bill's provisions relating to KEDO can \nbe modified in conference and that the Administration's requested \nfunding will be restored in conference, to reflect the view of the \nSenate as expressed in my amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1175\n\n              (Purpose: To provide Tibetan refugee relief)\n\n       On page 17, line 10, before the period insert the \n     following:\n       ``That of the amounts appropriated under this heading, $1.5 \n     million shall be made available to Habitat for Humanity \n     International for the purchase of 14 acres of land on behalf \n     of Tibetan refugees living in northern India, and the \n     construction of multi-unit development.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould provide Habitat for Humanity $1.5 million for construction of a \nmulti-unit development for Tibetan refugees living in Northern India.\n  These refugees were forcibly driven from their homes by the Chinese \ncommunists. They are living in the Dehradun area and are among the \npoorest people on earth. They are without citizenship rights and cannot \nown land. As such, they exist as squatters in burned out homes and \nshacks remaining after the Hindu-Moslem conflicts of a few years ago. \nThe conditions are deplorable; soaking wet in the monsoon season and \nfreezing in the winter.\n  Many Americans are aware of the plight of these Tibetan refugees and \nhave started taking actions to help them. The Dalai Lama is a full \npartner in this project and has put the full weight of his friends and \ngovernment behind this.\n  This money will fund a plan to purchase 14 acres of land on behalf of \nthe Tibetans and provide for the construction of a multi-unit \ndevelopment for 160 of the poorest families. An American architect has \nvolunteered his time to visit the site, direct the preliminary \nclearing, and draw the plans for the village.\n  General Mick Kicklighter, U.S. Army, Ret., serves as President of \nHabitat for Humanity International and will oversee the direction of \nresources for this project. The President of the Arundel County, \nMaryland, Habitat for Humanity affiliate is working to lay out detailed \nbuilding time and cost management for the village. The property has \nbeen obtained, building permits secured and the land has been cleared \nby the hand effort of the refugees.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and the cosponsors to this amendment \nto support funding in the amount of $1.5 million to directed to Habitat \nfor Humanity International for completion of this project. The creation \nof this village with U.S. assistance will serve as a model for the \ninternational aid community. I firmly believe that the impact of this \nmodest sum will be felt globally.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1176\n\n       On page 33, line 6, before the colon, insert the following: \n     ``, of which no less than $1,000,000 shall be available for \n     the Defense Institute of International Studies to enhance its \n     mission, functioning and performance by providing for its \n     fixed costs of operation''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1177\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that:\n       The Senate finds, that: The proposed programs under the \n     Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative (ETRI) are critical and \n     essential to preserving U.S. national security.\n       The Department of State programs under the ETRI be funded \n     at or near the full request of $250 million in the Foreign \n     Operations Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2000 prior to \n     final passage.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. These amendments have been cleared on both sides, and \nI ask they be considered and agreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1125, 1146, 1150, 1151, 1158, 1162, 1163, 1167, \n1168, and 1173 through 1177) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 1159 and 1170 through 1172, En Bloc, as modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I send the following modifications to amendments that \nare at the desk:\n  No. 1159, Senator Landrieu on orphans; No. 1170, Senator Brownback, \nthe Sudan; No. 1171, Senator DeWine on Colombia; and No. 1172, Senator \nReid on Iraq.\n  The amendment (No. 1170), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INTERNATIONAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR OPPOSITION-\n                   CONTROLLED AREAS OF SUDAN.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, of the funds \n     made available under chapter 9 of part I of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (relating to international disaster \n     assistance) for fiscal year 2000, up to $4,000,000\n\n[[Page S7885]]\n\n     should be made available for rehabilitation and economic \n     recovery in opposition-controlled areas of Sudan. Such funds \n     are to be used to improve economic governance, primary \n     education, agriculture, and other locally-determined \n     priorities. Such funds are to be programmed and implemented \n     jointly by the United States Agency for International \n     Development and the Department of Agriculture, and may be \n     utilized for activities which can be implemented for a period \n     of up to two years.\n\n     SEC. __. HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR SUDANESE INDIGENOUS \n                   GROUPS.\n\n       The President, acting through the appropriate Federal \n     agencies, is authorized to provide humanitarian assistance, \n     including food, directly to the National Democratic Alliance \n     participants and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement \n     operating outside of the Operation Lifeline Sudan structure.\n\n     SEC. __. DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE FOR OPPOSITION-CONTROLLED \n                   AREAS OF SUDAN.\n\n       (a) Increase in Development Assistance.--The President, \n     acting through the United States Agency for International \n     Development, is authorized to increase substantially the \n     amount of development assistance for capacity building, \n     democracy promotion, civil administration, judiciary, and \n     infrastructure support in opposition-controlled areas of \n     Sudan.\n       (b) Quarterly Report.--The President shall submit a report \n     on a quarterly basis to the Congress on progress made in \n     carrying out subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment that \nhas been cleared, I understand, by both sides. I would like to submit \ninto the Record a clarification regarding the distribution of \nhumanitarian assistance, including food, directly to the National \nDemocratic Alliance participants operating outside of the Operation \nLifeline Sudan structure. Namely, the intent and expectation of the \nSenate through this language is for the Sudanese People's Liberation \nMovement to be a recipient as a leading member participant in the \nNational Democratic Alliance.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is important to view this amendment in \nthe greater context of the current humanitarian situation in southern \nSudan.\n  The situation is dire, to say the least: the famine of last year took \nthe lives of hundreds of thousands as flights of relief were banned by \nKhartoum from large areas outside their control, an act which triggered \nfamine and starvation. The regime in Khartoum is allowed to halt U.N. \nrelief flights at will because of the terms of the 1989 agreement which \nestablish Operation Lifeline Sudan--the U.N. relief organization. As I \nnoted in an op-ed in The Washington Post on July 19, 1998, the \n``practice starves combatants and noncombatants alike and compromises \nthe integrity and effectiveness of relief groups desperately trying to \nfend off famine.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that op-ed be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 19, 1998]\n\n                Sudan's Merciless War on Its Own People\n\n                            (By Bill Frist)\n\n       When the United Nations World Food Program announced last \n     week that up to 2.6 million people in southern Sudan are in \n     imminent danger of starvation, the news was received with \n     surprising nonchalance. Such news is becoming almost routine \n     from misery-plagued East Africa, but what is unfolding in \n     southern Sudan is at least the fourth widespread, large-scale \n     humanitarian disaster in the region in the past 15 years.\n       In all cases, the United States' record is not one of \n     success. Ethiopia in 1984, a disastrous military involvement \n     in Somalia in 1993 and shameful neglect in Rwanda in 1994 \n     have left the public bitter toward the prospect of yet more \n     involvement. But again, as famine hovers over the region, we \n     face a disconcertingly similar quandary on the nature of our \n     response.\n       In January I worked in southern Sudan as a medical \n     missionary, and I have seen firsthand the terrible effects of \n     the continuing civil war and how that war came to help create \n     this situation. As a United States senator, however, I fear \n     that by failing to make necessary changes in our response, \n     American policy toward Sudan may be a contributing factor in \n     the horrendous prospect of widespread starvation.\n       The radical Islamic regime in Khartoum is unmatched in its \n     barbarity toward the sub-Saharan or ``black African'' \n     Christians of the country's South. It is largely responsible \n     for creating this impending disaster through a concerted and \n     sustained war on its own people, in which calculated \n     starvation, bombing of hospitals, slavery and the killing of \n     innocent women and children are standard procedure.\n       Our policy toward Khartoum looks tough on paper, but it has \n     yet to pose a serious challenge to the Islamic dictatorship. \n     Neither has our wavering and inconsistent commitment to \n     sanctions affected its behavior or its ability to finance the \n     war.\n       Khartoum is set to gain billions of dollars in oil revenues \n     from fields it is preparing to exploit in areas of rebel \n     activity. The U.S. sanctions prohibit any American \n     investment, but recent evidence indicates that enforcement is \n     lax. Additionally, relief groups operating there report that \n     new weapons are flowing in as part of a deal with one of the \n     partners--a government-owned petroleum company in China.\n       It is our policy toward southern Sudan that is of more \n     immediate importance to the potential humanitarian disaster. \n     From my own experience operating in areas where U.S. \n     government relief is rarely distributed, I fear that both \n     unilaterally and as a member of the United Nations, the \n     United States unnecessarily restricts our own policy in odd \n     deference to the regime in Khartoum.\n       In southern Sudan our humanitarian relief contributions to \n     the starving are largely funneled through nongovernmental \n     relief organizations that participate in Operation Lifeline \n     Sudan. All of our contributions to the United Nations efforts \n     are distributed through this flawed deal.\n       In this political arrangement the Khartoum regime has veto \n     power over all decisions as to where food can be sent. That \n     which is needed in the areas outside their control is often \n     used as an instrument of war, with Khartoum routinely denying \n     permission for a flight to land in an area of rebel activity, \n     especially during times when international attention lacks \n     its current focus. This practice starves combatants and \n     noncombatants alike and compromises the integrity \n     and effectiveness of relief groups desperately trying to \n     fend off famine.\n       Despite associated risks, some relief groups operate \n     successfully outside the arrangement's umbrella, getting good \n     and medicine to areas that the regime in Khartoum would \n     rather see starve. Out of concern that the Khartoum regime \n     would be provoked into prohibiting all relief deliveries \n     under the scheme, the U.S. Agency for International \n     Development and its Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance do \n     not regularly funnel famine relief through outside \n     organizations, and thus our relief supplies are only \n     selectively distributed--a decision that unnecessarily abets \n     Khartoum's agenda.\n       The U.S. policy in Sudan does not seek an immediate rebel \n     victory and the fragmenting of Sudan that could follow. \n     Because the splintered rebel groups could not provide a \n     functioning government or civil society at this time, that \n     policy cannot be thrown out wholesale. Yet our failure to \n     separate this policy from the action necessary to save these \n     people from starvation result in absurdity.\n       Thus even while generously increasing the amount of aid, \n     for political reasons we seek the permission of the ``host \n     government'' in Khartoum to distribute it and feed the very \n     people they are attempting to kill through starvation and \n     war. A second reason for this posture is, presumably, a fear \n     that even modest, calculated food aid would allow the rebels \n     to mobilize instead of foraging for their families--a factor \n     that could turn the outcome on the battlefield in their \n     favor.\n       The prospect of widespread starvation in southern Sudan \n     does not necessitate that the United States seek a quick \n     solution on the battlefield. Military victory and an end to \n     hostilities are not a substitute for food. However, the \n     administration should make an immediate and necessary \n     distinction between the policy principle and the humanitarian \n     challenge. It should articulate a response without political \n     limitations, which, frankly, are trivial in comparison to the \n     human lives at stake, and it should press the United Nations \n     to do the same.\n       We can no longer afford to dance around the issues of \n     sovereignty and political principles while restraining our \n     response to a looming disaster that Khartoum helped create. \n     Such academic debates and diplomatic concerns are for the \n     well fed, but offer no solace to the starving.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. The Government of Sudan continues to prosecute the war \nagainst the south, including the bombing of hospitals and churches, and \na campaign of terror, including slavery. Nearly 2 million have died \nsince 1983, with over 4 million displaced from their homes.\n  In January of last year, I worked in southern Sudan as a medical \nmissionary, in areas outside of government control, and in \n``hospitals'' and clinics where I treated people who had never seen a \ndoctor. What I saw was the product of an indiscriminate and savage war.\n  Since that time I have worked with other Senators, relief \norganizations, and the administration in trying to make our \nhumanitarian policy as effective as it possibly can be. It must be a \npolicy which does more than meet the immediate food needs of those who \nhover on the brink of starvation. It must be a policy which seeks to \neliminate the root causes. The inability of the populations in areas \noutside of the control of the Government of Sudan to protect themselves \nis at the root of\n\n[[Page S7886]]\n\ntheir vulnerability to starvation and famine.\n  That is not a politically or logistically easy task. It does not have \na single solution which can simply be enacted. It requires that we \nconstantly push the policy to adapt and become more effective, rather \nthan simply become an amount for which we simply write a check each \nfiscal year. This amendment does not represent the solution to the root \ncauses of the human tragedy in Sudan, but it is one critical piece \nwhich we must consider.\n  The authorization in this amendment will open this issue and place it \nat the top of the list of issues which we continue to work through with \nthe administration. That process of Congress and the administration \njointly working on a more effective Sudan policy has had its moments of \ndisagreement, but it has been largely productive and one where our \nshared goals have never been compromised.\n  Additionally, it is worth noting that, beyond the traditional \nchiefdoms, the groups designated in this amendment are really the only \norganizations functioning in areas outside of the control of the \ngovernment of Sudan. As a consequence, these are the only organizations \nwhich are defending these populations against the heinous attacks by \nthe Government of Sudan and, increasingly, by irregular or paramilitary \norganizations sponsored by Khartoum--including slaving parties.\n  The more than 1 million dollars' worth of relief distributed in Sudan \non a daily basis is done so in such a way that it is purposefully \nsteered away from combatants. From the relief organizations' view \npoint, that is essential to maintain some level of insulation from the \npolitical aspects of the war. They see themselves as strictly \nhumanitarian organizations.\n  However, from a practical standpoint, that practice has an \nunintended, but not surprising consequence. Because the members of the \nresistance groups have to eat too--for they suffer from starvation as \nmuch as women and children--they regularly divert food donations to \ntheir own use.\n  Possibly more important than that is the effect on these \norganizations themselves and their ability to provide protection for \nthe populations they defend. Because their food supply is erratic and \ndependent on diversions of other aid, they are often forced to \ndemobilize to either collect food on their own, to steal food, or to \nleave to plant their crops. The practical effect of that is that they \ncannot stay mobilized and cannot provide any reliable or cohesive \ndefense.\n  It is important to remember then that this amendment should not be \nseen as a reward to the resistance groups. Yet I remind my colleagues \nthat they are the only line of defense between those people and the \nregime in Khartoum which seeks to subdue or exterminate them in a \nsustained effort of low-level ethnic cleansing.\n  The timing of presenting this authority to the President is \ncritically important. The government of Sudan is poised to begin \nreceiving billions of dollars in hard currency from the sale of newly \nexploited oil in contested areas. The regime in Khartoum has repeatedly \nand publically said their intention is to convert that hard currency \nstraight into an renewed effort to subdue or eradicate the people in \nareas outside their control. The ability of the resistance groups to \nstay mobilized and coherent is arguably more important now than since \nthe beginning of the war. A predictable supply of food is the key to \nrealizing that defense. Again, more so than the weapons Khartoum is \npurchasing or receiving from the outside world, it is food which most \ndevastating.\n  Besides the obvious human cost of an ineffective defense against \nKhartoum and their proxies, is the potential cost to the renewed effort \nto bring the combatants into an effective peace process. As I noted in \na further piece in The Washington Post, we must use all available tools \nto bring the combatants to the table.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 9, 1999]\n\n                      An End to the Sudan Tragedy\n\n                            (By Bill Frist)\n\n       The Post's May 7 editorial ``Sudan: The Unending War'' \n     brought to light two critical points about that barbaric war \n     of ``ethnic cleansing.'' One is that our actions in Kosovo \n     emphasize our failure to act in the much larger war in Sudan. \n     Without Kosovo, the war in Sudan would continue in obscurity. \n     The other is that it is time for the United States to \n     redouble its efforts toward bringing the war to a conclusion. \n     As bad as the situation has become and intractable as the \n     conflict may seem, we may have a small chance for peace.\n       But the United States must redouble its efforts \n     strategically with a realistic understanding of our strengths \n     and limitations. What may seem like minor differences among \n     our options actually can represent fundamental differences \n     between success and failure. The appointment of a special \n     envoy may bring needed attention and diplomatic weight to \n     that effort, but it would represent neither a clear \n     understanding of our limitations nor a strategy that can \n     maximize our effectiveness.\n       A strategy that does so requires three basic steps in the \n     coming months:\n       We must recognize the conflict for what it is: a calculated \n     and sustained effort by the regime in Khartoum to subdue, \n     eradicate or forcibly convert to Islam large segments of \n     their own population. The fact that it is not exclusively a \n     Muslim against Christian or Arab against black African war \n     must not distract us from its barbarity. Even without a clear \n     ``good guy,'' the war is indiscriminate and patently evil. As \n     the editorial pointed out, it already has claimed more lives \n     than the wars in Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya and Somalia \n     combined.\n       We must conduct our relief operations so they address the \n     roots of the humanitarian disaster, not just the symptoms. We \n     must continue to change our operations so they do not \n     inadvertently abet the agenda of Khartoum by allowing the \n     government to use our food donations as a weapon--as it dose \n     with its calculated denial of access to relief flights that \n     carry out contributions through the United Nations.\n       We also must change the nature of our generous \n     contributions, moving away from simply food, literally \n     falling from the sky into starving villages, to one where we \n     seek to help establish the most basic civil and economic \n     institutions in the areas outside the government's control. \n     It is the near absence of those institutions in some areas \n     that prevents the Sudanese from sustaining themselves. I plan \n     to introduce legislation that will address those \n     shortcomings, both in our own programs and in the United \n     Nations. Congress can urge the president to continue \n     implementing those changes, but we also must be prepared to \n     support him fully as he does.\n       We must work harder to reinvigorate the existing \n     multilateral peace process and bring significant pressure to \n     bear on the warring parties and supporters to come to the \n     peace table. Khartoum uses seductive diversions--\n     ``confessions'' of war-weariness and other hints that a \n     ``breakthrough'' is at hand--to avoid a process in which it \n     would actually have to produce results.\n       The rebels continue to be fractious on their endgame. A \n     strong peace process based on an airtight list of principles \n     and measures of success can encourage both to deliver \n     tangible results. A special envoy alone, secret ``diplomatic \n     missions'' or any other effort that does not bring the \n     combatants and their supporters to the table cannot provide \n     three essential elements: the elimination of a scapegoat for \n     a failed process, sustained pressure on all parties to show \n     progress and a healthy dose of embarrassment for the world \n     regarding the situation.\n       The tragedy of Sudan has been perpetuated by shameful, \n     worldwide neglect and a stunning lack of resolve. Until \n     Khartoum succeeds in its goal of ethnic cleansing, the war \n     will never go away on its own. Short of military intervention \n     or comprehensive U.N. sanctions, for which there is no \n     political will, a coherent, cooperative and realistic \n     strategy offers the best chance for progress--albeit 16 years \n     late.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. The most important tool to bring them to the table is to \ncontinue to highlight the fact that neither side will win this war \noutright on the battlefield. If Khartoum believes they can not win the \nwar on the battlefield because of their new found source of hard \ncurrency, they have absolutely no reason to come to the table and work \nfor real peace. Short of military intervention on our own, the best way \nwe can disabuse them of that notion and continue to press them to \ncommit to a peace process is to clearly eliminate the greatest \nweaknesses which they will exploit. The greatest weakness is not so \nmuch the southern Sudanese's vulnerability to attack, but their \ninability to defend. That inability is not caused by a lack of \nweaponry, but a lack of calories.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Over the last decade, 35,000 \n     Colombians have been killed.\n       (6) The FARC and ELN are the two main guerrilla groups \n     which have waged the longest-running anti-government \n     insurgency in Latin America.\n       (7) The Colombian rebels have a combined strength of 10,00 \n     to 20,000 full-time guerrillas; they have initiated armed \n     action in nearly 700 of the country's 1073 municipalities, \n     and control or influence roughly 60 percent of rural Colombia \n     including a demilitarized zone using their armed stranglehold \n     to abuse Colombian citizens.\n       (8) Although the Colombian Army has 122,000 soldiers, there \n     are roughly only 20,000 soldiers available for offensive \n     combat operations.\n       (9) Colombia faces the threat of the armed paramilitaries, \n     5,000 strong, who are constantly driving a wedge in the peace \n     process by their insistence in participating in the peace \n     talks.\n       (10) More than 75 percent of the world's cocaine HCL and 75 \n     percent of the heroin seized in the northeast United States \n     is of Colombian origin.\n       (11) The conflicts in Colombia are creating spillovers to \n     the border countries of Venezuela, Panama and Equador: \n     Venezuela has sent 30,000 troops to its border the Ecuador is \n     sending 10,000 troops to its border.\n       (12) Venezuela is our number one supplier of oil.\n       (13) By the end of 1999, all U.S. military troops will have \n     departed from Panama, leaving the Panama Canal unprotected.\n       (14) In 1998, two-way trade between the United States and \n     Colombia was more than $11 billion, making the United States \n     Colombia's number one trading partner and Colombia the fifth \n     largest market for U.S. exports in the region.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should recognize the crisis in \n     Colombia and play a more pro-active role in its resolution;\n       (2) the United States should mobilize the international \n     community to pro-actively engaged in resolving Colombian \n     wars; and\n       (3) pledge or political support to help Colombia with the \n     peace process.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                    amendment no. 1172, as modified\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President and the \n     Secretary of State should--\n       (1) raise the need for accountability of Saddam Hussein and \n     several key members of his regime at the International \n     Criminal Court Preparatory Commission, which will meet in New \n     York on July 26, 1999, through August 13, 1999;\n       (2) continue to push for the creation of a commission under \n     the auspices of the United Nations to establish an \n     international record of the criminal culpability of Saddam \n     Hussein and other Iraqi officials;\n       (3) continue to push for the United Nations to form an \n     international criminal tribunal for the purpose of indicting, \n     prosecuting, and imprisoning Saddam Hussein and any other \n     Iraqi officials who may be found responsible for crimes \n     against humanity, genocide, and other violations of \n     international humanitarian law; and\n       (4) upon the creation of a commission and international \n     criminal tribunal, take steps necessary, including the \n     reprogramming of funds, to ensure United States support for \n     efforts to bring Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials to \n     justice.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I believe the Senator would like to renew his request for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I renew the request on the second-degree amendment, Mr. \nPresident. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont for his \nsecond-degree proposal. We will take a very short amount of time. It is \nnot our intention to spend a great deal of time on this particular \nproposal. We have proposed the pending amendments because we believe \nthe time has come to lift the very archaic, counterproductive, and ill-\nconceived ban on Americans traveling to Cuba. Not only does this ban \nhinder rather than help our effort to spread democracy, it \nunnecessarily abridges the rights of ordinary Americans.\n  The United States was founded on the principles of liberty and \nfreedom. Yet when it comes to Cuba, our Government abridges these \nrights with no greater rationale than political and rhetorical gain.\n  Cuba lies just 90 miles from America's shore. Yet those 90 miles of \nwater might as well be an entire ocean. We have made a land ripe for \nAmerican influence forbidden territory. In doing so, we have enabled \nFidel Castro's regime to hold onto power longer and contributed to the \ncontinued oppression of the Cuban people.\n  Surely we do not ban travel to Cuba out of concern for the safety of \nAmericans who might visit that island nation. Today Americans are free \nto travel to Iran, Sudan, Burma, Yugoslavia, North Korea--but not to \nCuba. You can fly to North Korea; you can fly to Iran; you can travel \nfreely. Yet it seems to me if you can go to those countries, you ought \nnot be denied the right to go to Cuba. If the Cubans want to stop \nAmericans from visiting that country, that ought to be their business. \nBut to say to an American citizen that you can travel to Iran, where \nthey held hostages for months on end, to North Korea, which has \ndeclared us to be an enemy of theirs completely, but not to travel 90 \nmiles off our shore to Cuba I think is a mistake.\n  To this day, some Iranian politicians believe the United States to be \n``the Great Satan.'' We hear it all the time. Just two decades ago, \nIran occupied our Embassy and took innocent American diplomats hostage. \nTo this day, protesters in Tehran burn the American flag with the \nencouragement of the members of their Government. Those few Americans \nwho venture into such inhospitable surroundings often find themselves \npelted by rocks and accosted by the public.\n  Similarly, we do not ban travel to Sudan, a nation we attacked with \ncruise missiles last summer for its support of terrorism; to Burma, a \nnation with one of the most oppressive regimes in the world today; to \nNorth Korea, whose soldiers have peered at American servicemen through \ngun sights for decades; or Syria, which has one of the most egregious \nhuman rights records and is one of the foremost sponsors of terrorism.\n  I can go to Iran, but I cannot go to Cuba. There is an inconsistency \nhere that I think we ought to undo. We ban travel to Cuba, a nation \nwhich is neither at war with the United States nor a sponsor of \nterrorism. I fail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic \nvalues and ideals will foster the transition to democracy in that \ncountry.\n  I fail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values \nand from the influence of Americans when they go to that country to \nhelp bring about the change we all seek serves our own interests.\n  Before I go on, let me be perfectly clear: I strongly support \neffective measures to bring democratic values and rule to all people, \nincluding Cuba. No one, certainly not Cubans, should have to live under \na dictator's fist. Cubans cannot travel freely to the United States. \nThat is because Fidel Castro does not allow them to do so. Those of us \nwho watched our television screens last night and saw those Cubans \ntrying to escape the dictatorial regime in Cuba, picked up by Cuban \nboats were horrified by that kind of activity.\n  Because Fidel Castro does not permit Cubans to leave Cuba and come to \nthis country is not justification for adopting a similar principle in \nthis country\n\n[[Page S7889]]\n\nthat says Americans cannot travel freely. We have a Bill of Rights. We \nhave fundamental rights that we embrace as American citizens. Travel is \none of them. If other countries want to prohibit us from going there, \nthen that is their business. But for us to say that citizens of \nConnecticut or Alabama cannot go where they like is not the kind of \nrestraint we ought to put on people.\n  If I can travel to North Korea, if I can travel to the Sudan, if I \ncan travel to Iran, I do not understand the justification for saying I \ncannot travel to Cuba. I happen to believe that by allowing Americans \nto travel there, we can begin to have the influence in Cuba that can \nbegin to change the demographics politically to make a difference in \nbringing about the change we all seek in that country.\n  Today, every single country in the Western Hemisphere is a democracy, \nwith one exception: Cuba. American influence through person-to-person \nand cultural exchanges was a prime factor in this evolution from a \nhemisphere ruled predominantly by authoritarian or military regimes to \none where democracy is the rule, with one exception: Cuba.\n  Our policy toward Cuba blocks these exchanges and prevents the United \nStates from using our most potent weapon in our effort to combat \ntotalitarian regimes, and that is our own people. They are the best \nambassadors we have.\n  Most totalitarian regimes bar Americans from coming into their \ncountries for the very reasons I just mentioned. They are afraid the \ngospel of freedom will motivate their citizens to overthrow dictators, \nas they have done in dozens of nations over the last half century. \nIsn't it ironic that when it comes to Cuba we do the dictator's bidding \nfor him in a sense? Cuba does not have to worry about spreading \ndemocracy. Our own Government stops us from doing so.\n  The current state of regulations governing who can and cannot travel \nto Cuba is a complex and subjective morass. My colleague, Senator \nLeahy, has first-hand experience in attempting to navigate the sea of \nbureaucracy.\n  When he attempted to travel to Cuba earlier this year with his wife \nMarcelle, he discovered that while his travel was exempt from certain \nlicensing requirements, his wife's travel was not. Ultimately, she was \nable to accompany her husband after applying for a license based on her \nwork as a registered nurse.\n  The fact is, the entire process is a farce and everyone knows it. \nOther couples, not a U.S. Senator and his wife, would probably not fare \nas well in gaining a license to travel to Cuba.\n\n  Let me review for my colleagues who may travel to Cuba under current \nGovernment regulations and under what circumstances. The following \ncategories of people may travel to Cuba without applying to the \nTreasury Department for a specific license to travel. They are deemed \nto be authorized to travel under so-called general license: Government \nofficials, regularly employed journalists, professional researchers who \nare ``full time professionals who travel to Cuba to conduct \nprofessional research in their professional areas,'' Cuban Americans \nwho have relatives in Cuba who are ill but only once a year they can go \nback.\n  There are other categories of individuals who theoretically are \neligible to travel to Cuba as well, but they must apply for a license \nfrom the Department of the Treasury and prove they fit a category in \nwhich travel to Cuba is permissible.\n  What are these categories?\n  One, freelance journalists, provided they can prove they are \njournalists; they must also submit their itinerary for the proposed \nresearch.\n  Two, Cuban Americans who are unfortunate enough to have more than one \nhumanitarian emergency in a 12-month period and therefore cannot travel \nunder a general license.\n  Three, students and faculty from U.S. academic institutions that are \naccredited by an appropriate national or regional educational \naccrediting association who are participating in a ``structural \neducation program.''\n  Four, members of U.S. religious organizations.\n  Five, individuals participating in public performances, clinics, \nworkshops, athletic and other competitions and exhibitions.\n  Just because you think you may fall into one of the above enumerated \ncategories does not necessarily mean you will actually be licensed by \nthe U.S. Government to travel to Cuba.\n  Who decides whether a researcher's work is legitimate? Who decides \nwhether a freelance journalist is really conducting journalistic \nactivities? Who decides whether or not a professor or student is \nparticipating in a ``structured educational program''? Who decides \nwhether a religious person is really going to conduct religious \nactivities?\n  I will tell you who does. Some Government bureaucrats are making \nthose decisions about those personal rights of American citizens.\n  It is truly unsettling, to put it mildly, when you think about it, \nand probably unconstitutional at its core. It is a real intrusion on \nthe fundamental rights of American citizens.\n  It also says something about what we as a Government think about our \nown people. Do we really believe that a journalist, a Government \nofficial, a Senator, a Congressman, a baseball player, a ballerina, a \ncollege professor or minister are somehow superior to other citizens \nwho do not fall into those categories; that only these categories of \npeople are ``good examples'' for the Cuban people to observe in order \nto understand American values?\n  I do not think so. I find such a notion insulting. There is no better \nway to communicate America's values and ideals than by unleashing \naverage American men and women to demonstrate by daily living what our \ngreat country stands for and the contrasts between what we stand for \nand what exists in Cuba today.\n  I do not believe there was ever a sensible rationale for restricting \nAmericans' right to travel to Cuba. With the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion and an end to the cold war, I do not think an excuse remains \ntoday to ban this kind of travel.\n\n  This argument that dollars and tourism will be used to prop up the \nregime is specious. The regime seems to have survived 38 years despite \nthe Draconian U.S. embargo during that entire period. The notion that \nallowing Americans to spend a few dollars in Cuba is somehow going to \ngive major aid and comfort to the Cuban regime is without basis, in my \nview.\n  This spring, we got a taste of what people-to-people exchanges \nbetween the United States and Cuba might mean when the Baltimore \nOrioles and the Cuban National Team played a home-and-home series. The \ngame brought players from two nations with the greatest love of \nbaseball together for the first time in generations. It is time to \nbring the fans together. It is time to let Americans and Cubans meet in \nthe baseball stands and on the streets of Havana.\n  Political rhetoric is not sufficient reason to abridge the freedoms \nof American citizens. Nor is it sufficient reason to stand by a law \nwhich counteracts one of the basic premises of American foreign policy; \nnamely, the spread of democracy. The time has come to allow Americans--\naverage Americans--to travel freely to Cuba. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Again, I make this point to my colleagues: There are no restrictions \non you if you want to travel to the Communist Government of North \nKorea, to the Communist Government of the People's Republic of China, \nto the Communist Government of Vietnam, to the terrorist-supported \nGovernment of Iran, or to travel to the Sudan. This is a completely \nuneven standard we are applying in order to satisfy some political \nrhetoric.\n  If you really want to create some change in Cuba, then unleash the \nflood of U.S. citizens going down there and talking to average Cubans \non the streets of Havana and Santiago and the small communities. Give \nthe 11 million people in Cuba a chance to interface and interact with \nAmerican citizens. If Fidel Castro wants to say, ``No, you can't come \nhere,'' let him say that, but let not us do his bidding by saying to \naverage citizens: You cannot go there. That is a denial, in my view, of \na fundamental right and freedom, unless there is an overriding national \ninterest which would preclude and prohibit American citizens from \ntraveling to a given country. That case has not been\n\n[[Page S7890]]\n\nmade. It cannot be made when it comes to Cuba.\n  Senator Leahy and I urge the adoption of this amendment to begin to \ncreate the change we all want to see on this island nation 90 miles off \nour shore.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished senior Senator from \nConnecticut has stated the arguments so very well. Like he, I have \ntraveled to Cuba. I visited Cuba 3 months ago with the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed.\n  We were able to go there because we are U.S. Government officials. If \nwe had been private citizens, as the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut has said, we would have had some problems.\n  My friend from Connecticut mentioned the problems that my wife \nMarcelle faced when she went to Cuba. He and I have discussed that \nbecause of the absurdity of it.\n  My wife Marcelle has accompanied me on many foreign trips. We have \ngone abroad representing our country, at the request of the Senate, at \nthe request of the President; and sometimes we have traveled on our own \njust to visit friends abroad.\n  So we did not think there was much of a difference that time. Our \npassports were in order. We were going to a Caribbean country, having \ntraveled in that area often, so we didn't need any special shots or \nanything.\n  We were about to go. But a few days before we were to leave --this is \nwhat the Senator from Connecticut referenced--we received a call from \nthe State Department saying they were not sure they could approve my \nwife's travel to Cuba.\n  I cannot speak for other Senators, but I suspect that most Senators \nwould react the same way I did if they were told that a State \nDepartment bureaucrat had the authority to prevent their spouse or \ntheir children from traveling with them to a country with which we are \nnot at war and which, according to the Defense Department, and \npractically every other American, poses no threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  At first I thought it was a joke. They said no. My wife is not a \nGovernment official. She is not a journalist. They did not think she \ncould go. She is, and has been, a practicing, registered nurse \nthroughout her professional life. In the end, she was able to join me \nbecause an American nurses association asked her to report on an aspect \nof current health in Cuba, and she agreed to report back to them.\n  Actually she has visited, with me, other parts of the world where we \nhave used the Leahy War Victims Fund or where we have gone to visit \nlandmine victims or looked at health care. I have always relied on her \nknowledge and expertise and did on this trip.\n  But I thought, how many Senators realize that if they wanted to take \ntheir spouse or their children with them to Cuba, they could be \nprevented from doing so by U.S. authorities. They can take them \nanywhere else in the world, any other country that would allow them in, \nbut here it is not that the other country would not allow them in. Our \ncountry is saying: We're not going to allow you to leave if that is \nwhere you're going.\n  The authors who put that law together knew the blanket prohibition on \ntravel by American citizens would be unconstitutional, so they came up \nwith a nifty way to avoid that problem while still having the same \nresult. They said: Well, Americans could travel to Cuba; they just \ncannot spend any money there.\n  Think of it. You can go to Cuba but you can't stay anywhere if it is \ngoing to cost you money to stay; you can't eat anything if it is going \nto cost you money for the food; you can't take a cab, or anything, from \nthe airport if it is going to cost you money.\n  Well, come on. Almost a decade has passed since the collapse of the \nformer Soviet Union. But even before that Americans went there. Now \nthey freely travel to Russia by the thousands every year, as they did \nbefore the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n  Eight years have passed since the Russians cut their $3 billion \nsubsidy a year to Cuba, and we now give hundreds of millions of dollars \nin aid to Russia, even though that was our great enemy during the cold \nwar.\n  Americans, as the Senator from Connecticut has said, can travel to \nNorth Korea. There are no restrictions on the right of Americans to \ntravel there or to spend money there.\n  I ask a question of my colleagues: Which country poses a greater \nthreat to the United States or world stability? North Korea or Cuba? I \nthink the answer, especially if you watch the news at all, is North \nKorea, for it is in South Korea where we have tens of thousands of U.S. \ntroops poised to defend it.\n  Americans can travel to Iran, a country that is in total, gross \nviolation of all international law. They took over our embassy, held \nour diplomats hostage, broke every single possible international law \nthere was--they still hold our property that they confiscated from us--\nbut we can travel freely there; we can spend money there.\n  The same goes for Sudan. These are countries that are on our own \nterrorist list, but we can travel there.\n  Americans travel to China and Vietnam, countries that have had \nabysmal human rights records. We not only travel there, we actively \npromote American investment there.\n  So our Cuban policy is hypocritical, inconsistent, self-defeating, \nand contrary to our values--to give it the benefit of the doubt. We are \na nation that prides itself on our tradition of encouraging the free \nflow of people and ideas. It is simply impossible to make a rational \nargument that Americans should be able to travel freely to North Korea \nor Iran but not to Cuba. You cannot make that argument.\n  I cannot believe that Members of Congress want the State Department \nor the Treasury Department deciding where their family members or \nconstituents can travel, unless we are at war or there is a national \nemergency to justify it. But that is what is happening.\n  So because it is happening, it should not be surprising to anybody in \nthis Chamber that the law is being violated by tens of thousands of \nAmericans who are traveling to Cuba every year, and almost none of them \nare prosecuted. I kept running into people on the streets of Havana \nfrom the United States. I said: Do you have licenses or anything? No. \nWe just came down.\n  I know people from my own State who drive an hour's drive away to \nMontreal and then fly to Cuba; people who go to the Hemingway Marina in \ntheir boats and then spend time in Cuba.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Certainly.\n  Mr. DODD. I think it is an important point you are making. But I \nthink in almost every single case, what these citizens are doing is \nflying through Canada or Cancun and in a sense violating the law; they \nare acting illegally.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right.\n  Mr. DODD. So in a sense we are promoting, by this particular \nprovision in our existing law, illegal travel.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And also promoting a complete disrespect for our laws \nbecause everybody knows they are not going to be prosecuted. It is a \nridiculous thing. Why have this significant law on the books and then \nnot prosecute it? Yet if it was being prosecuted, maybe we would hear \nmore of a hue and cry to change it.\n  It is demeaning to the American people. It is damaging to the rule of \nlaw. We have been stuck with this absurd policy for years, even though \nalmost everybody knows--and most say privately--that it makes \nabsolutely no sense. It is beneath the dignity of a great country.\n  But I also say it not only helps strengthen Fidel Castro's grip on \nAmerica, it has a huge advantage for our European competitors who are \nbuilding relationships and establishing a base for future investment in \na post-Castro Cuba.\n  When the Castro era ends is anybody's guess. I was a student in law \nschool here in Washington shortly after the Bay of Pigs. I remember \npeople talking: It will be any minute now--any minute now--Castro is \nout.\n  Well, I graduated in 1964, 35 years ago, and he is still there. \nPresident Castro is not a democratic leader; he is not going to become \none. But maybe it is time we start pursuing a policy that is in our \ninterest, not in a lobbyist's interest or somebody else's interest. I \nshould be clear about this amendment. It does not--I repeat and \nunderscore\n\n[[Page S7891]]\n\nthat--lift the U.S. embargo. It is narrowly worded so it does not do \nthat. It permits travelers to go there but to carry only their personal \nbelongings. We are not opening up a floodgate for imports to Cuba.\n\n  It limits the value of what Americans can bring home from Cuba to the \ncurrent amount that we Government officials could bring back. That is \n$100. You are not going to start a huge trade in Cuban goods of \nwhatever sort for $100, especially some of the more popular Cuban \ngoods.\n  It reaffirms the President's authority to prohibit travel in times of \nwar, armed hostilities, or if there is imminent danger to the health or \nsafety of Americans.\n  Those who oppose this amendment, who want to prevent Americans from \ntraveling to Cuba, will argue that spending dollars there helps prop up \nthe Castro government. To some extent that is true, because the Cuban \nGovernment does run the economy. It also runs the schools, the \nhospitals, maintains roads. As is the U.S. Government, it is \nresponsible for a full range of social services. Any money that goes \ninto the Cuban economy supports the programs that support ordinary \nCubans.\n  There is a black market in Cuba because no one can survive on their \nmeager Government salary. So the income from tourism also fuels that \ninformal sector and goes in the pockets of ordinary Cubans.\n  It is also worth mentioning that while the average Cuban cannot \nsurvive on his or her Government salary, you do not see the kind of \nabject poverty in Cuba that is so common elsewhere in Latin America. In \nBrazil, Panama, Mexico, or Peru, all countries we support openly, there \nare children searching through garbage in the street for scraps of food \nnext to gleaming highrise hotels with limousines lined up outside.\n  In Cuba, with the exception of a tiny elite consisting of the \nPresident and his friends, everyone is poor. They do have access to \nsome basics: A literacy rate of 95 percent; their life expectancy is \nabout the same as that of Americans, even though the health system is \nfocused on preventive care.\n  The point is that while there are obviously parts of the Cuban \neconomy we would prefer not to support, as there is in North Korea, \nwhere we are sending aid, or China or Sudan or any country the \ngovernment of which we disagree, much of the Cuban Government's budget \nbenefits ordinary Cubans. So when opponents of this amendment argue \nthat we cannot let Americans travel to Cuba because the money they \nspend there will prop up Castro, remember what they are not saying: The \nsame dollars also help the Cuban people.\n  We are not going to weaken President Castro's grip on power by \nkeeping Americans from traveling to Cuba. History has proven that. He \nis as firmly in control now as he was 40 years ago. So let us put a \nlittle sense into our relationship with Cuba. Let's have a little more \nfaith in the power of ideas.\n  I would rather have U.S. citizens down there speaking about democracy \nthan to have the only voice being the Government's voice speaking about \nour embargo. Let's have the courage to admit the cold war is over, but \nlet's also get the State Department out of the business of telling our \nspouses and our children and our constituents where they can travel and \nspend their own money, especially in a tiny country where most \npeople are too poor to own an extra pair of shoes or clothes, a country \nthat poses no security threat to us.\n\n  This amendment will do far more to win the hearts and minds of the \nCuban people than the shortsighted approach of those who continue to \npretend that nothing has changed since 1959.\n  I am not one who supports the nondemocratic actions of the Castro \ngovernment. I have spoken very critically both here and in Cuba, of the \ntrials and arrests of those who dared to speak out for a different \ngovernment. But I was struck over and over again by Cubans of all walks \nof life basically saying, what are we afraid of? Do we deny our people, \nU.S. citizens, the ability to travel in other countries around the \nworld? When I say no, we don't stop them from going to Iran, North \nKorea, China, Russia, Sudan, elsewhere, countries that are even on our \nterrorist list, but we do here, they shake their heads in disbelief--\nthis in a country where, during the baseball game down there, when the \nUnited States flag was carried out on to the baseball field, the Cubans \nstood and cheered. We ought to think about that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand the remarks the Senators \nhave made. It has been suggested earlier that we have had an absurd \npolicy for years and that Cuba is not a real threat to us, certainly \nnot as much of a threat as North Korea. I suggest if that is so--and it \ncertainly has not been so for very long; I suggest Cuba could in the \nfuture be a threat to the United States--it is because we stood up to \nthem. We contained them. We basically defeated them and stopped them \nwhen they had a systematic determination to subvert the Western \nHemisphere and even sent troops into Africa on behalf of Russia, when \nthere was a Soviet Union to subvert Africa for totalitarian communism.\n  That is what it was about. We have done some things that I think were \nnecessary and have preserved democracy for this hemisphere. It is \nsomething we ought to be proud of.\n  As for Castro, it is time for him to retire. It is time for him to \ngive it up. It is time for him to put his people above his own personal \naggrandizement and lust for power. If he cares about his people, he \nought to give it up. He can go to North Korea, if he wants to go to a \nCommunist nation.\n  I don't have any sympathy for the man. I do not know why people want \nto go to Cuba. All the time: I want to go to Cuba, go to Cuba. Well, I \nwould suggest maybe Honduras. Those people have suffered terrifically. \nThere are people in Haiti we could help. I do not know why everybody \nwants to help a nation that is oppressing its people so much.\n  Be that as it may, there are provisions now for people to gain \nexemptions, if they have a just cause to do so, to go to Cuba. Those \nwho have a legitimate reason can find a way to go there, as the Senator \nnoted. I think we have an appropriate policy. I will oppose changing \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, a case has been made that Americans \ncannot travel to Cuba. Indeed, the facts reveal that Americans travel \nto Cuba by the thousands. The policy that this Congress has endorsed, \nPresident Reagan, President Bush, and President Clinton have supported.\n  There has been a calculated policy of American contacts in travel to \nCuba. Today American students, journalists, people with archeological \ninterests, cultural interests, travel to Cuba by the thousands. Cuban \nAmericans travel to visit family members who have problems, medical \nemergencies, by the thousands. The restriction of the U.S. Government \nis not about travel.\n  We are using travel as a weapon to help convince the Cuban people to \nput pressure on the Cuban Government, support for democracy, free \nmarkets, that their contact with Americans is helpful in changing the \npolitics of the repression of Cuba. Restrictions in travel is not about \ndenying Americans the right to go to Cuba. It is about denying Fidel \nCastro the economic benefits of American tourism. Travel that enhances \nknowledge, causes political difficulties, we not only allow but we have \nencouraged.\n  Travel that simply provides Fidel Castro with millions of dollars to \nsupport his regime, his military, his security forces, we are denying, \nand appropriately so. Nor is it a static policy.\n  On January 9 of this year, President Clinton revised the policy \nagain, for the second time in 2 years, to add new remittances by \nAmerican citizens to Cuba, so that people can send money and support \ntheir families at appropriate levels that are humanitarian, to help \nwith medical or food emergencies but not so much that it would allow \nFidel Castro to profit by it. President Clinton has allowed charter \npassenger flights to cities other than Havana for the first time, and \nthe measure permits direct mail service to Cuba. The measure also \nauthorizes the sale of food and agricultural inputs to independent \nnongovernment entities.\n  New regulations for all of this were issued on May 10--flights, new \nauthority for travel, food and medicine--as\n\n[[Page S7892]]\n\npart of a calculated policy to always test Castro: When you are ready \nto talk about democracy, to respect human rights, American policy will \nbegin to change. Several days after President Clinton announced these \nnew initiatives, the Cuban Government responded and Castro announced \nthat it constituted a policy of ``aggression.'' Once again, as \nPresident Carter found, as did Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton, \nevery time you make an act of concession--in this case, a legitimate \nconcession--to test Fidel Castro to see whether he is interested in a \nbilateral relationship, we are denounced for redressing the Cuban \nnation by disallowing travel.\n  My colleagues offer an amendment now to remove these restrictions and \nopen travel and allow Fidel Castro to get the full economic benefit of \nmillions, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars worth of travel.\n  What kind of regime is it that they will be visiting? If Castro is to \nreceive the benefit of our tourist dollars, what is it he would be \ndoing with this money? It is worth taking a look at Cuba, not of 1961 \nwhen the cold war brought us to sanctions, but the Cuba of 1999. It is \nsuggested by my friend and colleague from Vermont that the cold war is \nover, implying that perhaps we have no argument with this regime.\n  Our argument with Cuba is about more than the cold war. It is about \nall the things that have always motivated the United States: human \nrights, human decency, the nature of the regime itself. Our argument \nwith Fidel Castro is not over. The causes of that argument still \nendure.\n  While the United States has been seeking to ease sanctions, look at \nthe record in the last 24 months in response to our review and change \nof policy. In February, Fidel Castro criminalized all forms of \ncooperation or participation in any prodemocracy efforts--not a fine, \nnot an arrest, but 20 years in jail if you participate in a \nprodemocracy effort. This is the Cuba you will be visiting. He imposes \na 30-year jail term on anybody who cooperates with an agency of the \nU.S. Government. That includes Radio Marti, distribution of food or \nmedicine by a government agency, or anyone acting on behalf of anyone \nassociating with this Government.\n  On March 1, the law was tested. Four prominent human rights \ndissidents were tried in secrecy for their criticism of the Communist \nParty of Cuba. International diplomats who traveled to Cuba to witness \nthe trial were barred from attending any of the proceedings. After \nbeing held without charges for 1 year--no foreign press, no foreign \nvisitors, no diplomats, held in secrecy for 1 year--they were found \nguilty and sentenced for up to 5 years in jail. This is the Cuba of \n1999.\n  Amnesty International, in its recent report, concludes that there are \nnow 350 political prisoners in Cuba. Ten unarmed civilians, in the \nmeantime, have been shot by Cuban security officials on the streets of \nHavana.\n  I do not ask the Senate to do anything it has not done before. Just \non March 25, the Senate voted 98-0, stating that the United States \nshould make all efforts to criticize Cuba and condemn its human rights \nrecord. What is the price of this conduct? They hold hundreds of \npolitical prisoners, people are shot in the streets, people are held in \nsecret trials, and our response is: Let's go for a visit. Let's go see \nhow they are doing and have a good meal in Havana. No. My colleague is \nright. There is no cold war, but there is a great deal at issue that \nthis country cares a great deal about.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. People have been shot in the streets in China, and held in \nprisons in China, and tortured and executed in China; are we allowed to \ngo and visit there without having to get a license from our country to \ndo so?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Let me, in my time, answer the Senator's question \nwith a question. Do you believe that travel restrictions on China would \nchange Chinese policy?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I don't think it would change the policy any more than it \nwould change the policy with Cuba.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. That is where we agree.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have a further question.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I will answer the question first and continue my \nremarks. I don't think travel restrictions on China would change \nChinese policy. I oppose those restrictions. I do believe travel \nrestrictions on Cuba will change Cuban policy. That is why I support \nthem. I do believe that continued international resolve--for the first \ntime, the Senator's amendment would weaken America's policy. We have \ngotten Europeans and Latins so outraged by the jailing of these \ndissidents and these secret trials that European and Latin nations that \nhave voted against us for 20 years have joined with us this year in \nEurope in voting to condemn the Cuban Government. Just as they are \njoining the fight for human rights, the United States would abandon it.\n  There is one other thing that is important. I will finish making my \ncase and I will be glad to yield. There is one other change. This isn't \njust about what Cuba does internally anymore. This is also about what \nthey are doing to our country. The government that you would have us \nnow visit, in lifting these restrictions, is a Cuba that has crossed a \nvery important threshold.\n  Just this last year, indicted by the government of Cuba on May 7, \nwere 14 Cubans captured in Miami. Let me suggest to you the nature of \nthat indictment to see whether it makes an impression on the Senator \nand see whether or not he thinks this is an appropriate time to ease \nrestrictions on travel to Cuba. The indictment of Cuban agents in Miami \nlast fall was for attempting to penetrate the U.S. Southern Command and \nplanning ``terrorist acts against U.S. military installations.'' The \nindictment was further revised to include 2 of the 14 with conspiracy \nto murder 4 American citizens by shooting down their aircraft over the \nStraits of Florida.\n  Let me suggest that I, as all of my colleagues, am prepared to \nrespond to initiatives from Havana. The day there are elections, the \nday there are open trials, the day there is a free press, the day they \nrespond to a request for extradition of people who murder American \ncitizens, I will join you with my colleagues on that day on this floor \nmatching the Cuban Government 2-to-1, 3-to-1, 1 of their initiatives to \n3 of ours, 10 of ours, or 20 of ours. We will meet them 95 percent of \nthe way down the field.\n  But, my friends, to ask this Senate to respond to the record of the \nlast year of jailing dissidents, secret trials, shooting people on the \nstreets, the indictment of 14 Cuban agents penetrating the United \nStates military installations to commit terrorist acts against the \nUnited States, and the indictment of Cubans for murdering American \ncitizens--this, my colleagues, would not appear to me to be the best \ntime to suggest that it is time to forgive and forget, and have \nthousands--maybe tens of thousands--of Americans visit Cuba to rescue \nthe Cuban economy from its current position of collapse, and provide \nFidel Castro with the revenue to strengthen his regime.\n  These sanctions are having an effect. Fidel Castro has had to reduce \nhis military by one-half. He cannot afford to keep them in uniform. The \nsecret police have been reduced by nearly a third in their size. We are \ncausing the collapse of the Communist Party of Cuba--not in a timely \nway, not as I would like it to be, but it is having an impact.\n  Why, given this record of indictments and terrorism and murder \nagainst American citizens, would we choose this moment?\n  Those in the world who have been the most critical of our policy--the \nHoly Father in the Vatican, who led an initiative himself to ease \nrestrictions on Cuba, has now joined the chorus of those. Fidel Castro \nbroke his promise about priests. The Holy Father appealed to him not to \nproceed with these jail terms, and he did it anyway. The Vatican is now \njoining the criticism.\n  The states of Latin America for the first time are voting against his \nhuman rights record. And we in the United States who led this effort \nfor all of these years are about to change sides.\n  This Senate has been resolute on this issue in the past.\n  I will join with my friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, I hope \nin a motion to table this amendment.\n  I think the debate has been worthwhile.\n\n[[Page S7893]]\n\n  My friend from Connecticut and my friend from Vermont have made it \nvery clear to the Cuban Government that we are ready, willing, and able \nto change our policy if they change theirs. But I believe the motion to \ntable is the right way to proceed in the Senate at the moment.\n  I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let's be clear where we are. My friend from \nNew Jersey speaks of the trial of the dissidents. Many who have spoken \non the floor were critical of that.\n  I sat 10 feet across the table from Fidel Castro and strongly and \nharshly criticized the trial of the dissidents. I went to visit each of \ntheir families and strongly and harshly criticized that trial and spoke \nalso on the floor. With my reputation on free speech issues, I would be \nthe last person to yield to anybody on the question of criticism of \nthose who try cases against dissidents and those who spoke out against \nthe Government.\n\n  I was very pleased to see our European allies speak out about it. But \nI note for the Record that while they spoke out on that, not one of \nthose European allies that the Senator from New Jersey says now come \nover to our side--not one of those countries--has put limits on the \ntravel of their people to Cuba as we have--not one.\n  The United States, the most powerful, wealthiest nation on Earth, \nlimits its population in traveling only to this country.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Jersey said quite correctly that \nwe limited travel of our people to China. It might not make much \ndifference in what they did. I suspect it made some, but probably not \nmuch. I say that it probably wouldn't make any more difference in that \nGovernment than it does in the Government of Cuba. But we see a huge \nmarket there, so we are not going to do that anyway.\n  I suggest that during the cold war the fact was that we encouraged \ntravel to places like the Soviet Union and China, and we got a \ndiversity of views. Our thoughts and our views were heard more and \nmore, not as much as we would like but more and more.\n  The Holy Father spoke out, as did most of us in this body, about the \ntrial of the dissidents. But I point out that the Holy Father has never \nwithdrawn his very strong criticism of the United States.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. May I reclaim my time for the moment? I yielded to \nthe Senator----\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thought the Senator had yielded the floor.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Please conclude.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is my mistake. I assumed the Senator had yielded the \nfloor.\n  One last thing: We indicted, and we are using our criminal justice \nsystem to try, Cuban spies, just as we have Russian spies, Chinese \nspies, Japanese spies, Israeli spies, and spies from even our NATO \nallies. We have done that. We have not broken our relationships with \nany one of those countries when we have done that, and some of the \nthings some of those countries have done to us have been very serious \ncrimes, indeed.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I recognize that. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Let me further present the case, in case the Senator misunderstood \nme, that this is not a case that Cuba spied against the United States. \nThat we expect. This is a case where the President of the United \nStates, in my judgment, rightfully sought to ease restrictions on \ntravel to Cuba and did so in allowing charter flights, the expansion of \nflights throughout Cuba, the easing of restrictions on travel to Cuba, \nand the response that he received is that we now have 14 Cubans under \nindictment, not for responding but for attempting to infiltrate an \nAmerican military installation and committing a terrorist act.\n  What I want the Senator from Vermont to do is put himself in the \nposition of Fidel Castro. The United States makes concessions to allow \ngreater travel, which we have now done twice in 24 months. The Cuban \nGovernment attacks those concessions with acts of aggression and \nattempts to commit terrorist acts against the United States. The human \nrights situation further deteriorates. People are jailed. Contact with \nthe U.S. Government is criminalized. And now this Senate returns not in \noutrage but says, Mr. President, we don't think you went far enough; \nlet's go further and further and liberalize trade.\n\n  That is my concern, recognizing how this will be seen in Havana.\n  I agree with the Senator's analysis. The United States allows travel \nto many places. But the Senator has to concede to me that travel has \noften been an effective tool in altering international conduct.\n  This country participated in prohibiting flights to Libya after it \nshot down the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland. We prohibited \nflights. After a period of 10 years, the Libyan Government relented and \nallowed extradition to an international court those who are responsible \nfor the act. I don't ask anything with regard to the victims of \nLockerbie that we are not asking now of those in the Cuban Government.\n  What is the difference? How do you look at the families of the young \nmen shot down over the Straits of Florida and murdered by the Cuban \nGovernment, and tell them, well, we will overlook this, though we will \nresolve it with Libya?\n  When Americans have been in jeopardy, whether it was in Iran, or in \nLibya, or years ago in Vietnam, when they were arresting people and \nputting them in concentration camps, we prohibited travel. I suggest to \nthe Senator that that prohibition is still an effective mechanism of \npolicy.\n  In any case, I yield the floor to allow my friend from Connecticut to \nspeak.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with Senator McConnell on a motion to \ntable. This is the wrong judgment with the wrong signal at the wrong \nmoment--not undermining the historic American policy, but it is \nundermining the policy of the Clinton administration which has been \nwell calibrated and very well defined.\n  This is not a partisan matter. It is bipartisan against the \nleadership of the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate led by \nSenator Helms and by President Clinton. It counters both policies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, if I may, I will not take much \ntime, because my colleague from Florida wants to be heard, as well as \nothers.\n  Let me say to my friend and colleague from New Jersey, I admire his \nrhetorical skills immensely. He made a valiant effort to shift the \nargument and debate implying we are doing a favor, this is somehow a \ngreat act of generosity and kindness, that those who are proposing \nlifting a restraint on travel to Cuba are trying to help out Fidel \nCastro.\n  It is a good, clever argument. I hope it is not a persuasive \nargument.\n  We are talking here not about what we are trying to do to help Fidel \nCastro but a right that American citizens ought to have to travel \nfreely.\n  My colleague from New Jersey and others have pointed out the \ndastardly deeds that go on in Cuba. I don't disagree at all. I am \noutraged by it and condemn it.\n  I point out, if that is the basis upon which we restrict Americans to \ntravel freely, we would have bans on travel all over the world. It goes \non every day. We don't say to a single American citizen: You can't \ntravel to the People's Republic of China. Every day, that government \nabuses its own people far more egregiously than occurs in Cuba. We see \nit in Vietnam, Sudan, Yugoslavia, Iran, North Korea. Is there any more \noppressive government on the face of this Earth than the Republic of \nNorth Korea? Yet any citizen in this country tomorrow or tonight can \nget on a plane and fly there without having to get permission from the \nState Department or the Treasury.\n  My point is, we are applying a standard that is not being applied \nequally or fairly. I subscribe to the notion that by opening up access \nyou begin to create change. I argue that in Poland, Hungary, and \nCzechoslovakia it was the access and the interchange between citizens \nof the free world and those countries which helped create the kind of \nchange that caused communism in those nations to fall. It wasn't \nisolation that did it; it was contact that did it.\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\n  I have watched for 40 years a policy in Cuba that has not produced \nthe change that the Senator from North Carolina and I both want. We \ndisagree how to get there, but I agree with the conclusion he seeks. I \nbelieve he agrees with the conclusion I seek.\n  Why don't we try a different tactic? What is the point of further \nisolation after 40 years if there is no change? If I can say to a \ncitizen of my State: You can fly to the North Korea, you can fly to the \nPeople's Republic of China, you can fly to Iran--countries that have \ndone far worse than the incidents that have occurred in Cuba, far more \negregious--we have understood we don't deny citizens of our own country \nthe right to travel.\n  Let Fidel Castro shut the door and say to my constituents: You can't \ncome to my country. I don't want to sit in the Senate and do his \nbidding. I don't think I ought to be saying to the citizens of New \nJersey, North Carolina, or Florida that you can't travel there. Let \nthem say that.\n  To tell Cuban Americans: You can go back to your country once a year, \nand if someone is sick, apply for an application, a license, and maybe \nwe will let you go see your family, maybe we will let you go, that is \nnot my view of the way we ought to be conducting our foreign policy.\n  This is about American rights. We provide in the Leahy amendment that \nunless we are involved in a state of war, hostilities, or public health \nreasons or good reasons why the Government may restrain the travel of \nits citizens--we are not in that condition here.\n\n  If you want to create change in Cuba, let good, honest, average \nAmerican citizens interface with these people. They are the best \nambassadors in the world. They do more good on an hourly basis on \nbehalf of our country than all the diplomats combined. Give them a \nchance to make that difference and go to the country 90 miles off our \nshore.\n  I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts 1 minute for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may yield for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. I congratulate my colleague on his leadership with respect \nto this. In the years that the Senator served on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, in all those years with the visits of Lech Walesa, the \nvisits of Vaclav Havel, and we have all shared wonderful moments with \nleaders of countries where the curtain fell--I think I recall each of \nthose leaders saying it was the ability of people to come in during the \ntime things were shut, to share with them the sense of what was \nhappening elsewhere, the possibilities, bringing information, to bring \nthem hope; that, indeed, was one of the great sustaining values and \nempowerments that brought them ultimately to the point of sharing the \nfreedom that we have.\n  I wonder if the Senator wouldn't agree that it is almost totally \ncontradictory with a Stalinist, tight police structure. In fact, by not \nhaving intercourse with other people elsewhere--the discussion, the \nmovement of people, the discourse, the exchange of ideas that comes \nwith it--you are, in fact, empowering the capacity of that secrecy and \nof that closed society to keep the hammer down on people, and that \nflies directly contrary to all of the experience we have learned from \nthose wonderful visits we have had.\n  Mr. DODD. I say in response to my colleague from Massachusetts, he \nmakes an excellent point. I think the observation he has drawn is \ncorrect. No one can grant with any certainty whether or not we will \ncreate change overnight.\n  I look down the list of the people who can get licenses to go to \nCuba. Members of Congress can; journalists can; people who are involved \nin some cultural exchanges. Ballerinas can go through a licensing \nprocess to get there.\n  I like the idea that an average citizen in my State, in \nMassachusetts, in Florida, can go into Cuba and walk those streets, \ntalk to people in the marketplaces, and share with them what we stand \nfor as a nation. Every time we have allowed that to occur, we have \ncreated change--maybe not in the People's Republic of China. We did in \nPoland. We did in Czechoslovakia. We did in Hungary. We did throughout \nthe Soviet bloc when we had a constant flow of people; that opening up, \nthat engagement, that creates change.\n  It seems to me after 38 years of saying no one can go there, this \nmight be worth trying. Then Fidel Castro can say: I'm not going to \nallow these people in.\n  Let him be the one who shuts the door to U.S. citizens traveling \nthere. Let us not deny our own citizens the right to try and make a \ndifference, if that is what they want to do, without going through some \nbureaucratic licensing process. Even the wife of a distinguished \ncolleague had to go through this process, as a registered nurse, to \nqualify under the regulations. The spouse of a Senator. She can go to \nNorth Korea, China, abusive governments, but she cannot go 90 miles off \nthe shore with her husband, a Senator. If that woman were not the wife \nof a Senator, she would have been denied that license. We all know \nthat.\n  I bet there are nurses all across this country who might go to Cuba \nand make a difference through their engagement in conversation, \ninterfacing with the people of that country, and to begin to create the \nkind of change we seek.\n  It is absurd. As my colleague from Massachusetts has suggested by his \nquestion, it is absurd. We are 185 days away from the millennium and we \nsit in this Chamber and tell American citizens that because we \ndisagree, strongly disagree, with the Government of Cuba, we are going \nto deny them the right to travel there and put it in the same basket as \nIraq and Libya.\n  That doesn't make sense.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask my colleague if, in fact, by denying that exchange, \nthose people the right to travel and connect with relatives and others \nwithin the country, if we don't provide Fidel Castro with the \nselectivity and greater capacity to restrict what information they get, \nwhen they get it, how they get it, and if, in fact, we aren't playing \nright into his capacity to keep a stranglehold--which is the very thing \nwe are trying to undo.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, again, my colleague from Massachusetts makes \nan excellent point. When you restrict the ability of average citizens \nto travel, you then restrict the ability of information exchanges about \nwhat is going on around the world to actually reach the average citizen \nin the streets. It can make a difference. So in a sense you empower Mr. \nCastro and those who support him by giving them the ability to restrain \nthe amount of information people in the streets ought to be able to get \nabout what is going on in the rest of the world. As a matter of fact, \nwe become a coconspirator, if you will, in sustaining this man in \npower, in my view. But by opening up this process, given the examples \nwe can cite--there are concrete examples all over the world where, when \nwe allowed that travel and that contact to occur, we have made a \ndifference; we created change. The only place there has been no change \nthat I know of is in Cuba, and it is the only place where we have not \nchanged our policy.\n  There seems to be some logic in that argument. If you want to follow \nother examples, and those who argue against this resolution who \nsimultaneously argue they want Castro to go, it seems to me our best \nformulation is to give this a chance to see if we cannot create the \nkind of change the Senator from Massachusetts and I strongly support. I \nthank him for his questions. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know this is spirited debate but we \nneed to wrap up a couple of items. Let me notify the Senate, before \nreturning to the debate on this amendment, we are just about to \ncompletion. So let me ask unanimous consent the Dodd-Leahy amendments \nbe temporarily laid aside. We will come back to them in just a moment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, could I ask a question? I \ninquire, I ask the Senator, where we are with respect to the Brownback \namendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Brownback amendment is yet to be disposed of. \nThere are a couple of amendments upon which we are going to have to \nhave rollcall votes. I would like to proceed, if I may.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I can ask, will there be time to speak to that \namendment?\n\n[[Page S7895]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We are trying to wrap the bill up. I would very much \nlike the Senator from Massachusetts to say a few words on that \namendment, knowing full well where he stands. But if he will just \nsuspend for a minute and let us wrap up a few housekeeping items here?\n  Mr. KERRY. Fine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1165\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I understand there is a Bingaman amendment still at \nthe desk that has now been cleared on both sides. I ask unanimous \nconsent we return to the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment is agreed \nto.\n  The amendment (No. 1165) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have an amendment by the Senate \nmajority leader that has been cleared on both sides.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1183\n\n      (Purpose: To require annual reports on arms sales to Taiwan)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1183.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . CONSULTATIONS ON ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN.\n\n       Consistent with the intent of Congress expressed in the \n     enactment of section (3)(b) of the Taiwan Relations Act the \n     Secretary of State shall consult with the appropriate \n     committees and leadership of Congress to devise a mechanism \n     to provide for congressional input prior to making any \n     determination on the nature of quantity of defense articles \n     and services to be made available to Taiwan.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment that \nwould require that the Congress be notified in a timely fashion of any \nreport or list submitted by the Taiwanese Government for the potential \npurchase or other acquisition of any defense article or defense \nservice.\n  This amendment would remedy a long-festering situation whereby the \nCongress has ceded virtually all decisionmaking authority to the \nexecutive branch with respect to arms sales to Taiwan. This situation \nis contrary to the letter and spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act of \n1979, which established that arms sales decisions regarding Taiwan must \nbe made jointly between the legislative and executive branches of \ngovernment.\n  Specifically, the relevant sections of Public Law 96-8, the ``Taiwan \nRelations Act'' of April 10, 1979, are as follows: Section 3(a) states, \n``. . . the United States will make available to Taiwan such defense \narticles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to \nenable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.'' And \nSection 3(b) states, ``The President and the Congress shall determine \nthe nature and quantity of such defense articles and services based \nsolely upon their judgment of the needs of Taiwan, in accordance with \nprocedures established by law. Such determination of Taiwan's defense \nneeds shall include review by United States military authorities in \nconnection with recommendations to the President and the Congress.''\n  When Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, it was in \nresponse to the Carter administration's abrupt efforts to curtail long-\nstanding defense ties between Washington and Taipei. At the time of the \nadoption of the Taiwan Relations Act, Congress wanted to make clear \nthat the enduring ties between the American people and the people of \nTaiwan included a clear and sustained commitment to ensuring that the \npeople of Taiwan had the means to defend themselves. Taiwan's ability \nto maintain a credible deterrent, qualitatively superior to that of the \nmainland's forces across the narrow Taiwan Strait, has been crucial in \nkeeping peace in East Asia.\n  The central tenet of the Taiwan Relations Act was stated very clearly \nin section 3, namely, that the President and Congress together would \ndetermine what Taiwan required for its legitimate self defense without \nregard to pressures imposed by any third party nation. This provision \nwas written in the law to ensure that executive branch officials would \nnot become excessively concerned with the protestations of the PRC \nwhenever the United States proposed to provide Taiwan defense articles \nand services needed for Taiwan's self-defense. Unique among laws \ngoverning United States defense ties with other nations, the Taiwan \nRelations Act explicitly requires in law that Congress and President \ntogether decide what Taiwan's military defenses require.\n  The first year after the TRA's enactment, this provision was sorely \ntested when the executive branch failed to inform Congress fully and \ncurrently on what Taiwan needed for its defense. The Foreign Relations \nCommittee under the leadership of Senator Frank Church lambasted \nexecutive branch officials. Together with Senator Glenn, Senator \nJavits, and others, Chairman Church insisted that the administration \nprovide full details on those weapon systems Taiwan had requested.\n  This practice of involving Congress in reviewing procurement \ndecisions--as required by law--lapsed since that time. In recent years, \nthe executive branch has met with representatives of Taiwan in secret \nand has refused to share with Congress the complete list of those \ndefense articles and services requested formally or informally by \nTaiwan.\n  In this regard, on May 11 of this year I wrote to Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright requesting a copy of the list of defense articles \nand services sought by Taiwan in the most recent round of annual arms \nprocurement talks. Those talks ended on April 21. I received a reply to \nmy letter on May 21, signed by Assistant Secretary of State for \nLegislative Affairs Barbara Larkin. Mrs. Larkin's reply asserted that \nthe Department would only provide information on ``the systems for \nwhich we [the Administration] have given Taiwan a positive response.''\n  In other words, the State Department refused my legitimate request to \nbe informed in writing of Taiwan's request for potential purchase or \nother acquisition of defense articles and services. Frankly, I was \nshocked and dismayed by this response, especially given the fact the \nmost recent round of talks had already been concluded and given the \nclear intent of Section 3 of the Taiwan Relations Act. Instead, Mrs. \nLarkin's letter provided information only on those portions of Taiwan's \nrequest that the administration unilaterally had decided to approve.\n  I understand that a similar, written request by the chairman of the \nHouse International Relations Committee Representative Benjamin Gilman, \nand others, have received the same unsatisfactory response from the \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, the current situation is intolerable and must be \nchanged. The law of the land requires that Congress be involved in \ndecisions regarding Taiwan's legitimate defense needs. The President \nand future administrations should know that the American people's \nrepresentatives in Congress will meet our obligations under the law to \nbe involved in this decisionmaking process.\n  Toward this end, my amendment requires that Taiwan's procurement \nrequest be furnished, on an appropriate basis and in a timely fashion, \nto the appropriate committees of Congress. I believe this is a \nnecessary step in ensuring that there is a meaningful dialogue between \nthe legislative and executive branches of government and that the \ndecisionmaking process regarding what Taiwan legitimately needs for its \nself defense, proceeds on a basis that is fully consistent with the \nletter and spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1183) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask Senator Mack be added as a \ncosponsor to amendment No. 1136.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the following amendments will not be \noffered. They are at the desk. They will not be offered: amendment No. \n1121 by Senator Thomas; amendment No. 1122, amendment No. 1152, and \namendment No. 1153, all three by Senator Ashcroft; amendment No. 1154 \nby Senator Craig; amendment No. 1148 by Senator Grassley; amendment No. \n1164 by Senator Cleland.\n  I ask unanimous consent those amendments no longer be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Those \namendments will not be proposed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are down to a precious few.\n  What we are considering doing is propounding an agreement, and I am \ngoing to go on and propound it even though I know there may be some \nobjection, but to give a sense of what the roadmap here is to \ncompletion. We believe we are down to the amendment we have been \ndiscussing all day, the Brownback amendment, as second-degreed by \nmyself and Senator Abraham regarding section 907, and the amendment we \nare in the process of debating, the Leahy-Dodd amendment with regard to \ntravel restrictions to Cuba. And final passage. That is where I believe \nwe are at this moment--with the need to wrap up the debate on the Dodd-\nLeahy amendment, the need to give Senator Kerry an opportunity to speak \non the 907 issue and Senator Torricelli an opportunity to speak to the \n907 issue.\n  Mr. DODD. I would also like to be heard on 907.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Also, Senator Dodd on the 907 issue and Senator \nBingaman for a couple of minutes on Cuba.\n  That is about where we are. Senator Graham, obviously, is going to \nspeak on the Cuba issue as well.\n  At that point we should be able to move ahead. Does my colleague from \nVermont think we should go ahead and propound this unanimous consent \nagreement or go on with the debate and just move on through it?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Florida on the \nfloor. I was wondering about how much time does he think he will need?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will need 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That will make it impossible to get the unanimous consent \nagreement that might get us out of here at a decent hour.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGraham of Florida be allowed 15 minutes to speak to the Dodd-Leahy \namendment; Senator Bingaman, 3 minutes on the Cuba amendment; Senator \nKerry, 5 minutes on the 907 amendment; Senator Torricelli on the 907 \namendment, 5 minutes; Senator Dodd, 2 minutes on the 907 amendment; \nSenator Brownback, 3 minutes to wrap up on 907; myself 3 minutes to \nyield on 907.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland would have an objection on a time agreement. Maybe we should \nstart on our debate and urge people to be as brief as we can because I \nstill think we could and should vote on all these.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The objection of the Senator from Maryland is to the \nBrownback amendment, I gather?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Why don't we proceed to complete debate on the Dodd-\nLeahy matter and see if we can dispose of that? Let's proceed on it.\n  Mr. DODD. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1157\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want all to know that there is no \ndisagreement with the objectives, the end goals being sought by the \nadvocates of this amendment and those of us who oppose it. I believe we \nare all Americans of good conscience and we seek for the Cuban people \nwhat we seek for ourselves. We seek a nation that lives with the \nfreedoms associated with democracy. We seek a nation that respects the \nbasic human rights of its people. We seek a nation which will encourage \nan economy that offers hope to the people of Cuba.\n  We have had a long association with Cuba. It is an association which \nruns almost to the first Spanish exploration of our two nations. We \nwere a major participant in the freedom of Cuba in 1898. In fact, we \nhad celebrations within the last few months of our participation in the \nindependence of Cuba.\n  So our goals for those people, our feeling for the people of Cuba, is \na shared one. The question is, What is the appropriate course of U.S. \npolicy to achieve those goals? I believe, as with every other question \nof what U.S. foreign policy should be, it should be a mixture of a \nconsideration of our national interests and a consideration of the \nuniversal values for which America has stood since those words in the \nDeclaration of Independence that declared that we saw that all men--not \njust American men, not just men, but women--that all persons had \ncertain inalienable rights. Those have been an important factor in our \nrelationships with other peoples of other nations.\n  On the specific issue of the use of travel restrictions as a part of \nthat U.S. foreign policy, Senator Torricelli has talked about the way \nin which travel restrictions were imposed on Libya and the fact that \nthose restrictions had certain objectives and have had certain \nconsequences.\n  The Presiding Officer and I have been interested in the issue of \nLebanon for a long time. The United States had travel restrictions on \nAmericans visiting Lebanon. The purpose of those travel restrictions \nwas to encourage changes that would create a greater sense of security. \nWhile there are still tense days, as we have seen in the very recent \npast, it is now considered appropriate to allow Americans to begin \nagain to visit Lebanon.\n  We have used travel restrictions as a means of achieving goals that \nwere considered to be important to the United States in the past.\n  Yes, we are using a restriction on travel to Cuba as part of the \nlarger, comprehensive restriction on relationships with the Government \nof Cuba while we attempt to achieve increased contacts with the people \nof Cuba.\n  There is an assumption that if the United States does not open up its \ntravel restrictions, the Cuban people are going to walk down sidewalks \nthat are barren of foreign travelers and the Cuban people will not have \ncontact with the outside world. In fact, almost 100,000 Americans \nvisited Cuba last year under the various provisions of our existing \nlaw. In addition to that, some of the major nations of the world, \nnations with which we have the closest relationship, such as Spain and \nCanada, have an open policy, in terms of travel to Cuba, for their \ncitizens.\n  When you ask Spaniards or Canadians, what effect has your open policy \ntowards Cuba had? what effect have the relationships you have had in \nthese instances for decades with the Castro regime had? have you seen a \nchange in the commitment to democracy? have you seen, as a result of \nyour openness towards Cuba, a greater degree of respect for human \nrights? the answer is a sad no. These democracies, these nations which \nshare our values and which have taken the course of action that is \nbeing advocated by the proponents of this amendment, have seen no \neffect in achieving the goals we share for Cuba--democracy, human \nrights, and an open economy.\n  What gives us reason to believe that adopting an unconsidered, \nundebated--other than the words we speak this afternoon--major change \nin our policy toward Cuba would have any different result? Recent \nevents, in fact, are to the contrary.\n  In January of last year, 1998, a significant, what many hoped would \nbe a historic, turning point event occurred in Cuba. The Pope visited \nthat island. Many hoped, prayed, believed that it would lead to \nfundamental change in Cuba.\n  We reinforced the momentum of the papal visit by a number of \ninitiatives towards Cuba. On March 20, 1998, just a few weeks after the \nPope had departed, in an attempt to build goodwill towards Cuba, \nPresident Clinton announced the resumption of licensing for direct \nhumanitarian flights to Cuba.\n  The President announced the resumption of cash remittances to Cuba.\n  The President asked for the development of licensing procedures to\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n\nstreamline and expedite the commercial sale of medicine, medical \nsupplies, and medical equipment to Cuba.\n  Continuing in that vein, on January 9 of this year the President \nauthorized additional steps to reach out to the Cuban people. The new \nmeasures expanded remittances by allowing any United States citizens, \nnot just family members, to send limited funds to the people of Cuba. \nThe President expanded people-to-people contacts. The President allowed \ncharter passenger flights to cities other than Havana and to initiate \nfrom cities other than Miami.\n\n  The measures also permitted an effort to establish direct mail \nservice to Cuba. The measures also authorized the sale of food and \nagricultural inputs to independent, nongovernmental entities, including \nreligious groups, family restaurants, and farmers.\n  All of those are initiatives which the United States has taken since \nJanuary of 1998 in hopes that it would result in a reciprocal response \nof some loosening of the police state that is Cuba today.\n  What happened to all of those initiatives the United States took? \nWhat happened to the initiatives that were hoped to flow from the papal \nvisit?\n  The Cuban Government responded to our United States initiatives by \ncalling these actions acts of aggression. That is what the Cuban \nGovernment labeled the opening of additional flights, of direct mail, \nof allowing greater remittances to the people of Cuba. Fidel Castro \ncalled all of those actions acts of aggression.\n  What did Fidel Castro do in the context of the visit by the Pope? \nAlmost exactly a year after the Pope departed Cuba, the Cuban \nGovernment passed a new security law. That law criminalized any form of \ncooperation or participation in prodemocracy efforts. That law imposed \npenalties ranging from 20 to 30 years for those who were found to be \ncooperating with the U.S. Government. Those are the responses of Fidel \nCastro to the papal visit.\n  On March 1, four prominent human rights dissidents were tried in \nsecrecy for their peaceful criticism of the Communist Party. Diplomats \nwere barred from attendance at the trial. These four human rights and \nprodemocracy dissidents were held for over 1 year without charges. They \nwere found guilty. They were sentenced to jail terms, for advocating \nhuman rights and democracy, of 3\\1/2\\ to 5 years.\n  This did not happen 40 years ago. This happened in March of 1999. The \nCuban Government ignored calls from the Vatican and the international \ncommunity for release. Canada, the European Union, and several Latin \nAmerican countries criticized the Cuban Government and stated their \nintention to reassess their relationship with the Government. The King \nof Spain had a scheduled visit to Cuba which he has deferred, in large \npart because of the treatment of these four dissidents.\n  Cuba's human rights record in 1999 reflects a continued policy of \nrepression, a policy which has been recognized not just by the United \nStates, not just by the people of Cuba who suffer under the yoke of \noppression, but by the international community.\n  In its annual report on human rights, which was released earlier this \nyear, Amnesty International states that at least 350 political \nprisoners remained imprisoned in Cuban cells in 1998. Amnesty \nInternational reports that 10 unarmed civilians were shot, executed by \nCuban authorities, in 1998.\n  As we know, the Senate passed a resolution by a vote of 98-0 on March \n25 of this year stating that the United States would make all efforts \nnecessary to pass a resolution criticizing Cuba for its human rights \nrecords before the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. We were very \npleased when the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, with \nsupport of nations which just in the last 2 years had opposed such a \nresolution, passed a resolution on April 23 condemning Cuba for its \nhuman rights abuses.\n  Finally, the State Department country report on human rights \npractices detailed the same human rights abuses as last year and the \nyear before.\n  We have made an effort to reach out to Cuba. We have made an effort \nto send a signal that we were looking for some reciprocity, some \ndemonstration of a wavering in the steel-hard police state which has \nbeen Cuba for 40 years.\n  One is hard pressed to see even the faintest breeze of a positive \nresponse to our efforts. The examples of human rights violations in all \nof these reports are numerous, brutal, and startling. Human rights \nactivists are beaten in their homes. People are arbitrarily detained \nand arrested. Political prisoners are denied food and medicine brought \nby their own families. Children are made to stand in the rain chanting \nslogans against democracy.\n  In the United States, on May 7 of this year, the U.S. Government \nrevised indictments against 14 Cuban spies captured in Miami last fall \nwhile attempting to penetrate the U.S. Southern Command, the United \nStates Naval Air Station at Boca Chica Key near Key West, and planning \nterrorist acts against military installations. The revised indictments \nalso charge 2 of the 14 with conspiracy to commit murder in the 1996 \nshoot down of the Brothers to the Rescue fliers.\n  It is at this point that I must become personal. I know the families \nof the four fliers who were shot down over international waters, now we \nknow, at the direct command of the highest officials of the Cuban \nGovernment. If homicide is defined as the intentional taking of a human \nlife, four acts of homicide occurred over the Straits of Florida \nagainst three U.S. citizens and one U.S. resident.\n  This is the nature of the response that Fidel Castro has given to the \nefforts by the Pope, by the international community, and by the United \nStates to try to ask, to plead for some relief for the people of Cuba.\n  As these examples show, as the continuing reign of repression flows \nfrom week to week, from day to day in Cuba this is not the time for \nlifting any of the sanctions on Cuba. This is the time for us to hold \nthe line on our policy, to continue to reach out to the people of Cuba \nin hopes that someday they will breathe the free air of democracy but \nto give no quarter to the oppressive Government of Fidel Castro.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I congratulate the Senator from Florida on his \nstatement and his extraordinary leadership on this issue through the \nyears and simply inquire of him, through this decade, American policy \ntowards Cuba has largely been defined by the Cuban Democracy Act that \nthe Senator from Florida joined with me in writing, the Helms-Burton \nAct that the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate, \nSenator Helms, wrote, and now under the leadership of President \nClinton.\n  This amendment would largely undermine the policies outlined in that \nlegislation and by President Clinton. Indeed, the President recently \nhas redefined his own policy of travel towards Cuba. But by a sweep of \nthe pen, that bipartisan policy that the Senators and the President of \nthe United States have written would largely be undermined, in my \nestimation.\n  Is that the Senator's conclusion?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That would certainly be one of the consequences. Another \nconsequence, I say to my friend and colleague, would be that we would \nsend a signal to Fidel Castro that we are prepared to do virtually \nanything without expecting anything in response; that the same thing \nthat has happened to the Canadians, the Spaniards, to other European \nand Latin American countries--attempts to reach out to Castro, which \nare rebuffed in terms of those things that are most important to the \npeople of Cuba--that now we would become complicitous in that same \nprocess of unrequited love.\n\n  The last thing we have to play, the last policy option that is \navailable to us as we try to influence Castro is exactly the embargo \nwhich, by this casual act tonight, we are being asked to begin to \ndismantle.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If the Senator would continue to yield, I think what \nis important about your statement is you recognize this policy isn't \nabout travel; it is about money. It is about giving Fidel Castro \nmillions of dollars of American tourist money to support his regime, \nhis dictatorship, his armed forces, his security forces. That is what \nwe are denying.\n  But the frustration that the Senator from Florida may have--and you \nprobably know more about the Cuban economic experience and the travel \nexperience than anyone in this institution by virtue of your \nconstituency--and to\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\nrely upon your expertise for a moment, it is my understanding, contrary \nto what the Senate may be led to believe today, that when tourists go \nto Cuba from European countries, they are put into tourist compounds. \nCubans are not allowed to visit those hotels. They cannot talk to \npeople in those hotels. So the notion that hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican tourists are going to walk the streets of Cuba and democratize \nthe island, spread the message of human rights--in fact, the average \nCuban cannot get inside those compounds. They are walled off.\n  The Senator knows more about this, by far, than I do, but is that not \nthe story of many of these beach-front hotels?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is the story. Unfortunately, the people who those \ntourists will come in contact with will be the virtual serfs of the \nCastro regime because the hotels are required to purchase their \nemployees through the Cuban Government, not by direct negotiation with \nthe individual or through some organization representing those \nindividuals. So by that walled-off enclave in which they are enjoying \nthemselves, on an island of prosperity in a sea of despair--which is \nCuba today --they are contributing to the maintenance of a system of \neconomic slavery that virtually has left the face of the Earth for the \npast century and a half.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. A final question. And I am very pleased the \ndistinguished minority whip, Senator Reid of Nevada, is going to join \nwith us on a motion to table.\n  But before I yield back, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts left a very \nappealing notion of the example of President Havel, that this exchange \nof visiting and talking to people about democratic ideas would somehow \nchange the Cuban political reality.\n  Again, you know more about this than I do. It is my impression that \nunder Cuban law, as Fidel Castro has now changed the law, if a would-be \nHavel walked up, in Havana, to an American tourist and talked to that \ntourist about democracy, he would be rewarded--not with information, a \ngrowth of knowledge--but he would go to jail because talking about \ndemocracy in Cuba to an American tourist will guarantee one thing--you \nwill be arrested, you will be indicted, and you will go to jail.\n  Is that the reality of what a conversation about democracy with an \nAmerican tourist is?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. And under the law which I alluded to, which was \npassed just in February of this year, that Cuban citizen who was found \nto be engaging in that friendly discussion about democracy and the \ngraces that liberty brings to the human spirit will be subject to \nspending 20 to 30 years, without his freedom, in a Cuban cell precisely \nbecause he engaged in that conversation.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Just very quickly, I want to raise the point--I do not know if my \ncolleagues from New Jersey and Florida have been to Cuba at all \nrecently.\n  Has my colleague traveled to Cuba in the last several years?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Other than Guantanamo, I have not been to Cuba.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate that. Just as a point of reference, I spent a \nweek in Cuba in December, in fact, all over the area, all over Havana, \nand Varadero as well for a day. I point out to my colleague that I saw \nAmericans all over the streets of Havana. The idea you are confined to \nVaradero Beach is just not the case. There are people literally \neverywhere, right in the marketplaces, in the streets, in the \nrestaurants, places they could go. The idea that you are restricted \nonly to go to Varadero Beach is not the case.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Cubans are restricted.\n  Mr. DODD. To Cuban Americans who want to travel to Cuba--many do--\nthis is, in a sense, saying you can only go back to the country of your \nbirth once during a year, unless you have a sick relative, and then you \nhave to apply to some bureaucrat in the Treasury Department to go down \nand see your family. That is wrong.\n  But the idea that Cuban Americans would be restricted to Varadero \nBeach is just not the case. You can talk with Cuban Americans who have \nbeen back to Cuba. They are not restrained on where they can travel in \nCuba.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think the point the Senator from New Jersey was raising \nin his question to me was that for many of those Europeans, Latin \nAmericans, and Americans who go to Cuba, the nature of the hotel \narrangements in which they live does not lend itself to the sort of \ninterplay that, for instance, some of us experienced in places such as \nPrague and Budapest prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n  It also is the case that Cuban citizens who, in those rare instances, \nmight have an opportunity to relate with an American, since February of \nthis year, face the prospect of being charged with a criminal act of \ncollaborating with a United States citizen and face the prospect of \nspending 20 to 30 years in a 17th century cell.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator allow me to respond to the point? \nWill the Senator allow me to respond?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The point is, Americans clearly do in Cuba have the \nfreedom to leave the hotels and wander around the island. As Senator \nGraham has pointed out, nearly 100,000 Americans went to Cuba last \nyear. So this is not a question that many Americans cannot go. It has \nsimply been the Clinton administration's view to restrict the number so \nas not to give Castro great financial rewards. One hundred thousand \nAmericans go.\n  The point I was making with Senator Graham was not to give people the \nillusion that Americans in a hotel on the beaches near Havana are going \nto receive Cuban visitors. The average Cuban is not allowed on the \nhotel grounds on these compounds. This is not going to be people \nvisiting President Havel in his office. They are not allowed to go \nthere. They can't spend money there. They can't be guests there. They \nare foreign compounds. You might as well be on a beach somewhere on a \ndesert island in the Pacific. They are restricted.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida for yielding.\n  Mr. DODD. As someone who has been there and spent the time and \nwandered without restraint and had conversations with people--I had a \nlong conversation, as someone who speaks the language, speaks Spanish; \nI was able to have lengthy conversations with people. I wasn't being \nfollowed around. I had long discussions with people in marketplaces \nwhere they were highly critical of the Cuban Government.\n  I had a lengthy discussion with a family down there about their \nobjections and opposition to Fidel Castro with a group of people \naround. In my personal experience and that of others, just on the point \nof 100,000 U.S. citizens going, most of them are going illegally. It is \nnot as if they have licenses to go. We all know what they do. They go \nto Montreal or Quebec or Cancun, and then they go in, because they \ndon't stamp their visas. You can meet them all in the airports down \nthere.\n\n  We are making them illegal, illegal activities of U.S. citizens. That \nis not something we ought to be condoning. But this isn't licenses they \nreceive; this is because they are using other means to go down and \nspend time there. But this is not permissible, visa-stamped approved \ntravel by these people.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I just make the point to the Senator that, having spoken \nwith a lot of people who have gone down there and made some of those \ntrips, the families aren't restricted in that way. They meet with \nrelations. They tell people what is going on in the United States. They \ntalk about their feelings about Fidel Castro.\n  What is amazing about this debate, what is absolutely stupefying, is \nthat what the Senators seem to be defending is completely contrary now \nto the experience since 1959. We went through the whole 1960s, went \nthrough the Bay of Pigs, went through the 1970s. We went through the \nheight of the Reagan opposition to the Iron Curtain and through all of \nthe changes in Russia, the former Soviet Union, the former east bloc \ncountries. We have seen the dynamics of that change.\n  The one place where our policy remains the same as it has throughout \nall of those years is the place where\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\nthere has been the least change. One of the reasons they had the power \nto shoot down those four planes is that there is no movement in the \nrelationship, because they are as isolated.\n  If you look at the experience of Cubans, restricted, who go back to \nCuba to visit their families, limited by the United States of America \nto one visit a year with their own family, you find that they are the \nones saying to us today, we would like to have the right to travel to \nvisit our families as frequently as we can. I am confident that the \nsame kinds of changes that swept over the rest of the world will sweep \nover that tiny island.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will conclude by saying that I ask those who think the \nUnited States changing its policy towards Cuba will have these \nmiraculous effects in terms of breaking waves of freedom to the people \nthat will crush what is an East German police state today--I only ask \nthem to tell us what is the evidence, based on the outreach which has \nbeen made by countries such as Canada and Spain and European and Latin \nAmerican countries, which largely share our values, which have been for \n40 years in a continuous relationship with Cuba?\n  I think the answer to the question is, there are no such evidences \nthat that outreach has had a positive effect on Cuba. We are dealing \nwith a sui generis anachronism in Cuba. That degree of singularity \nrequires the kind of singularity of foreign policy that we are \ndirecting towards it, with our hopes that soon the people of Cuba will \nbe released from that hold and that our policy will have contributed to \nthat release and will help to establish a basis for a transition to a \nCuba that will be respectful of its people and with which the United \nStates can have normal and peaceful and prosperous relationships.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator like an answer to the question?\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I oppose this travel amendment in the \nstrongest possible terms. This is the wrong language at the wrong time. \nIt represents a fundamental change in our Cuba policy--a change without \nproper consideration.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has not considered this language; in \nfact, nobody has seen this language until it was introduced this \nafternoon. We should not rush this language through.\n  We should not do this. This is a half-baked approach, which makes for \nweak policy; it is not a mature effort to craft serious policy.\n  Fidel responds to our positive gestures with arrests, oppression, and \ncrackdown. This effort is misguided and must be tabled.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to table the underlying Dodd \namendment No. 1157, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that immediately following this rollcall vote about to begin, \nthe Senate immediately proceed to executive session and vote en bloc on \nthe confirmation of the following nominations on the Executive \nCalendar: Nos. 104 through 108. I further ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately following the vote, the President be notified of the \nSenate's action and the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I also ask unanimous consent that it now be in order to ask \nfor the yeas and nays on the nominations en bloc.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't have any objection, but I ask \nunanimous consent that the majority leader may proceed in this way. A \ntabling motion has been made, and there is no debate on a tabling \nmotion.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \ndo this, even though the vote has been ordered on the tabling \namendment, so that we can have this vote in this sequence. It is to \nhave a vote on the confirmation of five judicial nominations.

On this vote, the ayes are 94, the nays are 4. \nThe Senate does hereby advise and consent to the nominations of Keith \nB. Ellison of Texas, Gary Allen Feess of California, Stefan R. \nUnderhill of Connecticut, W. Allen Pepper, Jr. of Mississippi, and \nKaren E. Schreier of South Dakota.\n  The President will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am encouraged that the Senate confirmed \nfive of the judicial nominees from the 45 pending before us. I am glad \nthat the District Courts in Mississippi, South Dakota, Texas, \nConnecticut, and California will soon have additional judicial \nresources. I only wish that were true for the 69 other vacancies around \nthe country.\n  In particular, I look forward to the Committee finally approving the \nnomination of Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals this \nweek and would ask the Majority Leader to take up that long-delayed \nnomination with the same expedition that is being. Fully one-quarter of \nthe active judgeships authorized for that Court remain vacant, as they \nhave been for several years. The Judicial Conference recently requested \nthat Ninth Circuit judgeships be increased in light of its workload by \nan additional five judges. That means that while Ms. Berzon's \nnomination has been pending, and five other nominations are pending to \nthe Ninth Circuit, that Court has been forced to struggle through its \nextraordinary workload with 12 fewer judges than it needs.\n  Marsha Berzon is an outstanding nominee. By all accounts, she is an \nexceptional lawyer with extensive appellate experience, including a \nnumber of cases heard by the Supreme Court. She has the strong support \nof both California Senators and a well-qualified rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  She was initially nominated in January 1998, almost 17 months ago. \nShe participated in an extensive two-part confirmation hearing before \nthe Committee back on July 30, 1998. Thereafter she received a number \nof sets of written questions from a number of Senators and responded in \nAugust. A second round of written questions was sent and she responded \nby the middle of September. Despite the efforts of Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Specter and myself to have her considered by \nthe Committee, she was not included on an agenda and not voted on \nduring all of 1998. Her nomination was returned to the President \nwithout action by this Committee or the Senate in late October.\n  This year the President renominated Ms. Berzon in January. She \nparticipated in her second confirmation hearing two weeks ago, was sent \nadditional sets of written questions, responded and got and answered \nanother question. I do not know why these questions were not asked last \nyear. I do hope that the Committee will vote to report her nomination \nto the Senate on Thursday and that the Senate will finally, at long \nlast, take the opportunity to confirm her to the federal bench.\n  The saga of this brilliant lawyer and good person is a long one, but \nit is not an isolated story. Hers is not even the longest pending \nnomination. That distinction belongs to Judge Richard Paez who was \ninitially nominated in January 1996--over three and one half years \nago--favorably reported by this Committee last year but not voted upon \nby the Senate. He was renominated in January, as well. His nomination \nis in limbo before the Senate Judiciary Committee, more than three \nyears after this fine Hispanic judge was first nominated by the \nPresident.\n  In addition, there is the nomination of Justice Ronnie L. White to \nthe federal court in Missouri, a nomination I spoke to the Senate about \nearlier this week. This past weekend marked the 2-year anniversary of \nthe nomination of this outstanding jurist to what is now a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of \nMissouri. He is currently a member of the Missouri Supreme Court.\n  He was nominated by President Clinton in June of 1997, 2 years ago. \nIt took 11 months before the Senate would even allow him to have a \nconfirmation hearing. His nomination was then reported favorably on a \n13 to 3 vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 21, 1998. \nSenators Hatch, Thurmond, Grassley, Specter, Kyl, and DeWine were the \nRepublican members of the Committee who voted for him along with the \nDemocratic members. Senators Ashcroft, Abraham and Sessions voted \nagainst him.\n\n[[Page S7901]]\n\n  Even though he had been voted out overwhelmingly, he sat on the \ncalendar, and the nomination was returned to the President after 16 \nmonths with no action.\n  The President has again renominated him. I have called again upon the \nSenate Judiciary Committee to act on this qualified nomination. Justice \nWhite deserves better than benign neglect. The people in Missouri \ndeserve a fully qualified and fully staffed Federal bench.\n  Justice White has one of the finest records--and the experience and \nstanding--of any lawyer that has come before the Judiciary Committee. \nHe has served in the Missouri legislature, the office of the city \ncounselor for the City of St. Louis, and he was a judge in the Missouri \nCourt of Appeals for the Eastern District of Missouri before his \ncurrent service as the first African American ever to serve on the \nMissouri Supreme Court.\n\n  Having been voted out of Committee by a 4-1 margin, having waited for \n2 years, this distinguished African American at least deserves a vote, \nup or down. Senators can stand up and say they will vote for or against \nhim, but let this man have his vote.\n  Twenty-four months after being nominated and after being renominated \nfive months ago, the nomination remains pending without action before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. People like Justice Ronnie L. White \ndeserve to have their nominations treated with dignity and dispatch. \nTwenty-four months is far too long to have to wait for Senate action.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in his \nYear-End Report in 1997: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a \nconsiderable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final \nfloor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, \nwell under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.'' He went on to note: \n``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular \nnominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up \nor vote him down.''\n  For the last several years I have been urging the Judiciary Committee \nand the Senate to proceed to consider and confirm judicial nominees \nmore promptly and without the years of delay that now accompany so many \nnominations. I hope the Committee will not delay any longer in \nreporting the nomination of Justice Ronnie L. White to the United \nStates District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and that the \nSenate will finally act on the nomination of this fine African-American \njurist.\n  In explaining why he chose to withdraw from consideration after \nwaiting 15 months for Senate consideration, another minority nominee, \nJorge Rangel, wrote to the President and explained:\n  ``Our judicial system depends on men and women of good will who agree \nto serve when asked to do so. But public service asks too much when \nthose of us who answer the call to service are subjected to a \nconfirmation process dominated by interminable delays and inaction. \nPatience has its virtues, but it also has its limits''.\n  Justice White has been exceedingly patient. He remains one of the 10 \nlongest-pending judicial nominations before the Senate, along with \nJudge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon.\n  Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the \nSenate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its \nunprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees since the 104th \nCongress, the Senate is shirking its duty. That is wrong and should \nend.\n  As the Senate recesses for the Independence Day holiday, I am glad to \nsee that the Senate is taking a few small steps toward responsible \naction by confirming five qualified District Court nominees. I will \ncontinue to work to see that the scores of remaining nominees be \ntreated fairly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7901-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ASSISTANCE UNDER THE \n                   CAMP DAVID ACCORDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Egypt and Israel together negotiated the Camp David \n     Accords, an historic breakthrough in beginning the process of \n     bringing peace to the Middle East.\n       (2) As part of the Camp David Accords, a concept was \n     reached regarding the ratio of United States foreign \n     assistance between Egypt and Israel, a formula which has been \n     followed since the signing of the Accords.\n       (3) The United States is reducing economic assistance to \n     Egypt and Israel, with the agreement of those nations.\n       (4) The United States is committed to maintaining \n     proportionality between Egypt and Israel in United States \n     foreign assistance programs.\n       (5) Egypt has consistently fulfilled an historic role of \n     peacemaker in the context of the Arab-Israeli disputes.\n       (6) The recent elections in Israel offer fresh hope of \n     resolving the remaining issues of dispute in the region.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should provide Egypt access to an \n     interest bearing account as part of the United States foreign \n     assistance program pursuant to the principles of \n     proportionality which underlie the Camp David Accords.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my views on foreign assistance are well \nknown. I don't like it. I understand there are circumstances in which \nthe United States needs to extend a helping hand to other nations \nfacing political and economic strains that we thankfully do not have to \nendure. I simply think that the United States spends too much of its \ncitizens' hard-earned tax dollars overseas, and that is why I \ntraditionally vote against the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill.\n  My reluctance to send U.S. tax dollars overseas leads me to \nscrutinize closely those programs that we do fund. One of the largest \nrecipients of U.S. foreign assistance is the Middle East, and in \nparticular Israel, and to a lesser extent, Egypt. These nations are our \nstrongest allies in a troubled region, and I firmly believe that \nmaintaining a strong relationship with them is in the best strategic \ninterests of the United States. We cannot forget that it was Egypt and \nIsrael that negotiated the Camp David Accords, an historic breakthrough \nin the efforts to\n\n[[Page S7902]]\n\nbring peace to the Middle East. As part of the Camp David Accords, a \nconcept was reached regarding the ratio of United States foreign \nassistance between Egypt and Israel. This formula has been followed \nsince the signing of the Accords.\n  I have believed for many years that the United States is spending too \nmuch on foreign assistance to Egypt and Israel. I have tried in the \npast, to no avail, to reduce the level of assistance being sent to \nIsrael. I am pleased that the United States has finally embarked on a \nprogram of reducing economic assistance to both nations, with the \nagreement of those nations. However, maintaining proportionality \nbetween Egypt and Israel as the level of foreign assistance is reduced \nis vitally important, and never more so than now, when the recent \nelections in Israel offer fresh hope of restarting the peace process.\n  Unfortunately, the mechanism by which United States foreign \nassistance is currently being provided to Egypt and Israel has resulted \nin an imbalance to that program in that Israel has the unique advantage \nof having immediate access to an interest bearing account while Egypt \nhas not been accorded the same treatment. This, I believe, is a \nprocedure which can be interpreted as a departure from the standard of \nfairness that is central to United States assistance under the Camp \nDavid Accords.\n  Mr. President, this is an injustice that should be corrected. \nSpeaking frankly, it is my opinion that neither Israel nor Egypt should \nbe earning interest on United States foreign assistance. But, under the \nprinciples of parity that underlie the Camp David Accords, both nations \nshould receive the same treatment. Egypt and Israel are pivotal allies \nin the Middle East, and the United States should accord them equal \ntreatment in disbursing its foreign assistance.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1185\n\n (Purpose: Regarding availability of United States assistance for the \n                          Palestian Authority)\n\n       Strike section 577, and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 577.

Mr. President, the Senate is now considering S. 1234, \nthe foreign operations and export financing appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2000.\n  The Senate bill provides $12.7 billion in budget authority and $4.7 \nbillion in new outlays to operate the programs of the Department of \nState, Export and Military Assistance, Bilateral and Multilateral \nEconomic Assistance, and Related Agencies for Fiscal Year 2000.\n  When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $12.7 billion in budget \nauthority and $13.2 billion in outlays for fiscal year 2000.\n  The subcommittee is below its Section 302(B) allocation for budget \nauthority and outlays.\n  I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nS. 1234, FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS, 2000--SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 2000, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    General             Man-\n                                    purpose   Crime    datory     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority...............   12,700   .......       44    12,744\n  Outlays........................   13,139   .......       44    13,183\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...............   12,701   .......       44    12,745\n  Outlays........................   13,150   .......       44    13,194\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority...............   13,266   .......       45    13,311\n  Outlays........................   12,740   .......       45    12,785\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority...............   14,070   .......       44    14,114\n  Outlays........................   14,104   .......       44    14,148\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...............  ........  .......       44   ........\n  Outlays........................    8,456   .......       44   ........\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...............

Mr. President, I rise to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues an issue which I believe is of importance in the FY 2000 \nForeign Operations Appropriations bill: U.S. assistance to Egypt. \nBefore I begin, however, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee for their expert and sound guidance on this bill. They \ndeserve our commendation for working with such tight 302(b) \nallocations.\n  Egypt is a country that many in the Senate hold in high regard. Egypt \nis a dependable and steady ally in the Middle East. This year marks the \ntwentieth anniversary of peace between Israel and Egypt, a peace which \nhas served and continues to serve as a benchmark of the end of \nhostilities between Arabs and Israelis. Since peace between Egypt and \nIsrael was established in 1979, Congress has recognized that in \nAmerica's relations with these two allies that fair treatment of both \nIsrael and Egypt in the provision of foreign assistance is a key \nfeature in preserving peace and stability in the region.\n  The administration requested as part of its FY 2000 budget that a \nportion of Egypt's military assistance held in reserve to pay for the \npotential termination of contracts accrue interest. This proposal, \nknown as an interest bearing account (IBA), would allow interest to \naccrue on approximately $470 million in the termination liability \naccount for Egypt. Israel's military assistance has been treated in \nthis way for some time, treatment that I and many others here support. \nThe net impact of granting Egypt this treatment would be about $20 \nmillion in interest to Egypt, without any additional cost or outlay by \nthe U.S. taxpayer.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I support the administration's request \nfor an IBA for Egypt, and I feel very strongly that Egypt should have \nthe\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\nsame terms as Israel. The Department of State has made a commitment to \nEgypt on this issue, and I think it is important that this commitment \nbe kept.\n  Despite our support for an IBA, the Congressional Budget Office has \ntold us that the IBA would be scored as a $470 million outlay--despite \nthe fact that it actually costs nothing--and would thus break the \nSenate's tight outlay ceiling for this bill. Although support for an \nIBA for Egypt is strong--I am confident that on the merits an Amendment \nproposing an IBA would have the support of the vast majority of my \ncolleagues--the Senate is confined at this time in our actions by \nbudgetary pressures.\n  I am hopeful that we might still be able to resolve this scoring \nissue and perhaps address the question of an IBA for Egypt in \nConference.\n  Again, I thank the subcommittee chairman and ranking member for their \nwork on this bill. I look forward to continuing to work with them on \nthis issue.\n\n\n  bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement and the state \n                               department\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nStevens, McConnell, Coverdell, DeWine, and I may enter into a colloquy \non funding for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law \nEnforcement and the State Department.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I say to Senator Stevens, Senators Coverdell, DeWine, \nand I have afforded an amendment No. 1148 to the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill regarding increased funding for the State \nDepartment's counterdrug efforts.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am aware of the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As the Senator knows, we have been working on this bill \nand on others to ensure adequate funding for our Nation's counter \nnarcotics efforts. And I appreciate the committee's past support in \nthis regard. I am aware that we face tough budget decisions and we need \nto balance many program needs within a balanced budget.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have had to make a lot of tough decisions in this \nbill while trying to ensure that we meet the needs of many critical \nprograms. I know that Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy and the \nsubcommittee have worked shared to be fair, and they have had to make \ntough choices.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate their efforts. Our amendment asks for more \nfunding for INL, although it is still below the President's request. \nSenators Coverdell, DeWine, and I have worked with the committee in the \npast on this issue. It is my understanding that the House is working to \nprovide a higher level.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I believe that is the case but the House has not yet \nmade a final decision on appropriation levels for the State \nDepartment's counter narcotics programs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If there is a difference between the House and Senate \nlevels, that will mean that the final appropriation levels will be \nconferencable, is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is the case.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is my understanding that if the numbers in House and \nSenate bills are different that it is your intention to work during the \nconference to ensure that we see a higher level of funding for this \nprogram?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. I will work on trying to see a higher \nlevel of funding. But let me point out that there is a difference \nbetween the House and Senate allocation levels and that we will have a \nlot of reconciling to do.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I ask the distinguished Senator from Alaska if that \neffort will preclude increased funding for INL?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It does not preclude it, and I will work to ensure that \nwe try to get more funding.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I know that Senator Grassley and Senator DeWine share \nmy concern that we ensure that our international counter drug programs \nhere and elsewhere receive the support they need to keep drugs off our \nstreets and out of our homes. We had a press conference today on just \nhis point. We have been fighting a battle the last few years to raise \nthe visibility of the need for serious counter drug efforts and the \nneed to fund those adequately. The State Department program is an \nimportant part of that effort.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I might add something to the comments of my \ndistinguished colleague from Georgia. Last year, the Congress added \nsignificant new money into our international and interdiction efforts. \nThis was in part a down payment on the Western Hemisphere Drug \nElimination Act, that I introduced in the 105th Congress. It is \nimportant that we ensure that the effort begun then is sustained. \nHaving seen first hand the positive benefits of this program in this \nregion. I strongly believe that increased funding for INL should be \nstrongly considered in conference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I share the Senators' concerns for the need for \nsustained and adequate funding.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I too share this concern. The Foreign Operations bill \nis an effort to address that concern and the many other programs that \nneed attention in our foreign policy.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is my understanding that every effort will be made \nin conference to ensure that there will be increased funding for the \nState Department's counter narcotics programs. If that is the case, \nthen I am prepared to withdraw my amendment and I thank Senator Stevens \nand Senator McConnell for their consideration in this matter.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I join Senator Grassley in thanking the committee.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I also thank the committee.\n\n\n                             imf gold sale\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the distinguished Senator from Kentucky yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. As the chairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations \nSubcommittee, is the Senator aware of a proposal by the Administration \nto support the sale of some ten million ounces of gold by the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) from its gold reserves in order to \nprovide debt relief for countries under the Heavily Indebted Poor \nCountries Initiative (HIPC)?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I am aware of this proposal. Let me say to the \nSenator from Colorado that the proposal to have the IMF sell its gold \nin order to provide debt relief to the HIPC nations is a matter of \nsignificant concern to me.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I share the chairman's concern. The sale of IMF gold \nwould have the effect of depressing gold prices well beyond the twenty \nyear low to which the price of gold has already plunged. As I think the \nSenator from Kentucky well knows, a further drop in the price of gold \nwill not only hurt American industry but cost thousands of U.S. workers \ntheir jobs. Equally important, falling gold prices will directly impact \n36 of the 41 nations that are slated to benefit from the HIPC program. \nThis is because those 36 nations are in fact gold producers, and their \neconomies would suffer to such a degree that the damage done to their \neconomies resulting from depressed gold prices would be greater than \nany debt relief they might receive. Does the Senator agree with that \nanalysis?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Colorado is exactly right. \nConsidering the fact that barely 40 percent of the interest to be \nderived from the investment of the proceeds from the sale of the IMF \ngold would actually be available to the HIPC nations for debt relief, \nit seems to me that this amounts to a cruel hoax. Of particular concern \nto me is the fact that the sale of the IMF gold would reduce gold \nprices to such an extent that the harm done to HIPC nations' economies \nwill likely exceed any benefit from this debt relief effort. I believe \nthe issue of debt relief for the HIPC nations is important and must be \ndealt with, but such a program must be designed to reduce the economic \nburden on these countries not compound them.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask the chairman, is it the case that in order for this \nproposed IMF gold sale to go forward, that the Congress must \nspecifically authorize the U.S. representative to the IMF to cast a \nvote in favor of such a sale?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Colorado is exactly correct. Existing \nlaw 22 U.S.C. 286c specifically requires Congress, by law, to authorize \nsuch action. I would point out to the Senator,\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\nas I am sure he is already aware, that absent an act of Congress, the \nstatute makes it clear that neither the President nor any person or \nagency acting on behalf of the United States can vote to approve the \nsale of IMF gold.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the chairman for that clarification. Would it be \nfair to conclude, I say to my friend from Kentucky, that you are not in \na position to support legislation that would seek to have this Congress \nauthorize U.S. approval of the sale of IMF gold?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Colorado is absolutely correct. For \nthe reasons I have outlined, I believe the proposal to sell IMF gold as \npart of the HIPC Initiative is misguided and just plain bad policy. I \ncould not support legislation authorizing such a sale as part of this \nor any bill. And, I will say to the distinguished Senator from \nColorado, that when I take this bill to conference with the House, we \nwill include a Statement of Manager's language that will reiterate that \nthe sale of IMF gold cannot go forward unless we in Congress \nspecifically provide authorization.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern \nabout the proposed reduction of funding for the Peace Corps in this \nforeign operations appropriations bill--a reduction that is contrary to \nthe will of Congress as expressed by the overwhelming, bipartisan \nsupport for the Peace Corps Reauthorization Act, which passed \nunanimously this session in both Houses of Congress.\n  I am mindful of the constraints imposed by the lower allocations to \nthe appropriators. But Congress has spoken affirmatively on the issue \nof increased funding for the Peace Corps. The authorizing committee \nand, then, this body, supported the bill by unanimous consent. A few \nmonths earlier, the House passed the measure by a vote of 326-90. \nPresident Clinton immediately signed the bill in May.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the authorizing committee for the Peace \nCorps, I worked with the committees' ranking Member and former Peace \nCorps Volunteer, Senator Dodd, to sponsor the Peace Corps Act. The Act \nauthorizes a 12 percent increase for Fiscal Year 2000 and is part of a \nmultiyear plan to enable the Peace Corps to reach its goal of 10,000 \nVolunteers by 2003. Reaching this mark has been a long-standing goal of \nCongress--a goal set into law in 1985.\n  Despite the consistent endorsement of the growth plan, the \nAppropriations Committee has recommended a $50 million reduction in \nfunding from the authorized amount (and $20 million less than the Peace \nCorps current budget of $240 million). This appropriation is ill-\nadvised. If enacted, it would deny the Peace Corps the opportunity to \nreach its goal of 10,000 Volunteers serving abroad. And, even worse, it \nwould force the Agency to cut the current level of Volunteers by over \n1,000 (That is, from 6,700 to 5,700) Volunteers).\n  I recognize the constraints under which the Peace Corps and all \nfederal programs must operate. For that reason, I have been a close \nobserver of the Peace Corps activities, as has Senator Dodd, in \nexercising our oversight responsibilities. I remain confident that the \nPeace Corps remains the best foreign assistance program of its kind, \nand that it has systems in place to continue fielding Volunteers \nresponsibly and efficiently. Part of the genius of the Peace Corps is \nits ability to use a relatively small amount of money to do big things. \nEven if the Peace Corps received full funding at $270 million, the \namount would be about 1 percent of our foreign aid budget.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Peace Corps is well prepared to \nbegin implementation of the multi-year plan. I urge the appropriators \nto join the Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and in \nboth Houses who have overwhelmingly endorsed this worthy goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7905-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7905-S7911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           U.S.-HAITI POLICY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have a long standing interest in Haiti. \nI have made seven trips to this island nation in the past four years. I \nhave spoken often about the developments in that country here on the \nSenate floor. I am here today because I am extremely concerned about \nthe tumultuous conditions in Haiti. And, I feel the United States must \nunderstand the immediacy and vast importance of the present situation \nin order to act in an appropriate way.\n  Mr. President, the serious political and financial circumstances \nleave Haiti at a crossroads. In order to survive, Haiti must act \ndecisively, and the global community must respond accordingly.\n  It is of vital importance that Haiti holds Parliamentary elections \nthis year, and that we respond with our technical and security \nresources to support and strengthen this process. In addition, the U.S. \nGovernments' policy on limiting financial assistance, which in the past \nI have whole heartedly embraced and which has been effective, should \nnow be re-thought.\n  Haiti has a heritage of political turmoil and unrest. To understand \nthe present situation, one must first comprehend the series of events \nin the two years which have led to this unfortunate circumstance.\n  The seriously flawed April 6, 1997 elections, which attracted less \nthan 5 percent of the Haitian electorate, provoked the resignation in \nJune 1997 of Prime Minister Rosney Smarth. For twenty months, a \npolitical deadlock existed between President Rene Preval and the \nmajority party in Parliament over the contested April 1997 elections \nand over President Preval's nominee for Prime Minister, Jacques Edouard \nAlexis. The political crisis virtually paralyzed the government and \ndelayed millions of dollars in international aid to Haiti.\n  Mr. President, in January of this year, Haiti's drawn out crisis took \na very troubling turn when President Preval announced that the Haitian \nNational Assembly's term had expired and that he would proceed to \ninstall a government by ``executive order.'' What happened in essence, \nof course, was that President Preval chose to ignore Haiti's Parliament \nand rule by decree. Tragically, President Preval effectively disbanded \nthe Parliament and stripped them of their power.\n  Even though Prime Minister Alexis was approved by both Houses before \nthe Parliament was dissolved, the new Prime Minister does not yet have \nany authority to govern because his cabinet has not been approved by \nthe Parliament. And since there is no functioning Parliament, there can \nbe no confirmation of the Prime Minister's cabinet. We have gone from a \nlong period without a Prime Minister in Haiti to a period now without a \ngoverning Parliament.\n  While the political crisis in Haiti deepens, there has been some \nprogress made. In March of this year, President Preval and the \nopposition political parties agreed on a Provisional Electoral Council, \ncharge with establishing fair and equal elections. And the Council has \nbeen effective. Specifically, the Council recently made a brave and \nbold move by announcing the annulment of the April 1997 elections. Mr. \nPresident, I applaud this recent action. We need to support this recent \noverture and take it to the next level. We must urge the Haitians to \nhave parliamentary elections.\n  We know that the present political vacuum must be filled with a \ncredible government or else, we may risk it being filled by a de facto \ndictatorship. The global community has the responsibility to take \naction now.\n  First, the Haitians must have Parliamentary elections before the end \nof this year. A balance of power is fundamental to an effective \ndemocracy. The election of a new Parliament prior to Presidential \nelections in December 2000, begins establishing this foundational \nbalance, which is in the best interest of Haiti.\n  The United States and the international community have the ability \nand resources to help in two specific ways, through technical \nassistance and security reinforcement. In order to ensure that the \nHaitians hold free, fair, open, and credible elections , the United \nStates, in partnership with the international community, must leverage \nall available assets in a coordinated effort to support the election \nprocess.\n  The United States should provide resources in support of the election \nprocess to include the encouragement of political coalition building. \nThe technical assistance can be coordinated by the other countries who \nare involved in Haiti that can also provide substantial financial help.\n  In addition to the technical assistance, Haiti's security must be\n\n[[Page S7906]]\n\nstrengthened in order for the elections to be held in a safe \nenvironment. We must increase support to the Haitian National Police. \nIn addition, provisions should be made so that United Nations Civilian \nPolice--known as the CIVPOL--can continue it's important mission \nthrough this election period. There should also be a large and \nsignificant presence of international observers during the six to eight \nweeks prior of the elections. These basic actions taken quickly and \nwith authority will demonstrate that the United States is committed to \ndemocracy in Haiti.\n  Second, we need to re-assess U.S. policy on financial assistance to \nHaiti.\n  For the past several years, the U.S. Government has conditioned \nassistance to the Haiti due to the Haitian Government's ineptness. \nWhile the United States has tried to help Haiti sustain democracy, \nunfortunately, the Haitian Government has lacked political will. The \nHaitian Government has not taken action to resolve a number of \nextrajudicial and political killings in Haiti and there have been \nnumerous human rights violations. The Government has also been \nextremely slow in privatization of its government owned enterprises, \nand it has not been accountable in maintaining government institutions \nthrough their constitutional and electoral processes.\n  Let me be clear when I say that the objective in our conditioning of \nassistance to Haiti was to urge the Haitian Government to take the \nnecessary steps to overcome these concerns and challenges. Our \nconditioning of assistance has produced some positive change in Haiti. \nWith the upcoming Parliamentarian elections in Haiti, however, it is \nimportant that we provide flexibility in our assistance to assure that \nthese very important and needed elections are transparent.\n  Today, Mr. President, I am suggesting that the U.S. Government focus \nits appropriation policy on accountability. While the Congress is not \nlosing the opportunity to review and perform oversight of our \nappropriated funds to Haiti, this new language sets congressional \npriorities. Specifically, the top areas include: First, aggressive \naction to support the institution of the Haitian National Police; \nsecond, steps to ensure that any elections undertaken in Haiti with \nU.S. assistance are full, free, fair and transparent; third, a program \ndesigned to develop the indigenous human rights monitoring capacity; \nfourth, steps to facilitate the continued privatization of state-owned \nenterprises; and fifth, a sustained agriculture development program.\n  We have also incorporated reporting requirement language so that the \nAdministration can give U.S. a detailed assessment of each benchmark. \nThis new language was drafted by several Senators including myself and \nSenators Helms, Dodd, and Graham.\n  The ideological and financial crossway that is before Haiti is of \nnational and global importance. The U.S. national interest is served by \na stable, democratic, prospering Haiti that cooperates with U.S. \ncounter-drug efforts. We can help ensure this end through our technical \nand physical support of immediate Parliamentary elections and through \nlifting the limitations on financial assistance. Our Nation's eyes have \nbeen so focused across the Atlantic that I fear we may have forgotten \nour responsibility in our own hemisphere. But, now is the time to act \nin order that democracy may take her proper place in this hemisphere.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for \ntheir work on this legislation. This is not an easy bill.\n  I certainly commend their efforts to keep this bill within the budget \ncaps. I regret that in trying to balance our many important priorities, \ninternational affairs spending may have suffered disproportionately.\n  Mr. President, national security can not be viewed solely through a \ndefense lens, but also must comprise all the critical preventive \nmeasures offered through an active foreign affairs program. This means \ncontinuing to fight the spread of disease and drugs, providing adequate \nnutrition for children and families, and pursuing U.S. goals in arms \nreduction. We also should continue to make our full contributions to \nthe multilateral institutions, in particular the United Nations, on \nwhich the United States relies.\n  I will, however, support this legislation.\n  However, I do wish to comment on one area of funding in particular \nwhich has suffered cuts in this legislation, and that is international \npeacekeeping. This bill appropriates funds for America's voluntary \npeacekeeping activities, which includes such things as our \ncontributions to the Israel-Lebanon Monitoring Group, to the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and to the \nMultinational Force and Observers (MFO) in the Middle East. The \nvoluntary peacekeeping account also funds our contributions to \nimportant peacekeeping initiatives in Africa, including through an \nAfrica regional fund and through the Africa Crisis Response Initiative.\n  But Mr. President, this bill would cut the voluntary peacekeeping \naccount by $50 million off the President's request; that's 40% below \nthe request. While the bill would support a slight increase from last \nyear's appropriation for this account, I am afraid that this level is \ninadequate to support our peacekeeping efforts in Africa.\n  This voluntary peacekeeping fund is designed to support peacekeeping \nefforts other than assessed missions by the United Nations, which are \nfunded separately through an account in another appropriations bill. \nThe account funded in this bill is designed to try to anticipate needs \nin the peacekeeping arena, but also to be flexible and prepared to deal \nwith unanticipated contingencies.\n  This morning, the chairman of the Subcommittee, the distinguished \ngentleman from Kentucky, made the assertion that the administration's \nrequest regarding peacekeeping was, in his words, ``redundant,'' \nbecause there is more than one account that provides funds for \npeacekeeping in Africa.\n  But, Mr. President, I would respectfully disagree with this \ncharacterization and note that the requirements for peacekeeping in \nAfrica are such that a distinct account may be required.\n  At a recent hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, Chairman \nFrist and I heard testimony regarding the conflict raging in Central \nAfrica, in which there are currently as many as nine countries \ninvolved. These wars don't get much press attention in the United \nStates, but it is likely that more people are dying there right now \nthan we have seen killed in Kosovo in recent months and in a number of \nother well publicized conflicts outside Africa.\n  Mr. President, it is easy to make generalizations about the causes of \nconflict in Africa, but I think its roots are not well understood.\n  At that hearing, I posed some important questions which I would like \nto repeat here on the floor.\n  First, what is the basis for U.S. policy in Africa? Is it to support \ndemocracy and respect for human rights? Is it to avoid genocide? Is it \nto encourage stability and economic development? These are some of the \nthings I hear administration officials saying, but sometimes I am not \nsure our actions are consistent with these lofty goals. For example, \nsome would question how the United States government hopes to prevent \ngenocide, when it is often hesitant to condemn atrocities that fall \nshort of genocide. Some also question our commitment to preventing \ngenocide in the future when our government has so far declined to \nexamine in any detail our own weak response during the 1994 crisis.\n  Second, if there were to be another ``genocide''--assuming there is \nconsensus as to the meaning of that word--what steps is the United \nStates prepared to take to stop it? Is NATO going to start launching \nair strikes against the offending powers? We all know that is \nunrealistic, yet the crisis in Kosovo is causing a lot of people--\nincluding Members of Congress and including myself--to ask: ``Why \nKosovo and not Rwanda?'' Why is it that the United States can spend \nbillions of dollars trying to stop ethnic cleansing in one place, but \nyet wouldn't even use the word ``genocide'' in the Rwanda case until \ntwo months after the killing started, and thousands had been killed?\n\n  The distinguished chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, \nthe Senator from Kentucky, also noted the Committee's intent to have \nSerbia designated as a terrorist state, which is mandated in the \nlegislation. I support this designation, and I agree with my colleague \nthat it is hard to understand\n\n[[Page S7907]]\n\nthe difference, as he said this morning on the floor, ``between thugs \nblowing up a village with a car bomb or thugs shelling and burning a \nvillage to the ground. The intent and impact are the same. In both \ninstances, innocent civilians are the targets and the victims.''\n  Mr. President, this is precisely my point. Only I would make this \npoint with respect to Africa and say this: I do not understand the \ndifference between the terror and violence that is going on in Sierra \nLeone and what is going on in Kosovo! In both instances, innocent \ncivilians are the targets and the victims. Yet the bill before us today \nprovides millions of dollars to support peacekeeping and other \nactivities for Kosovo, and barely anything for similar activities in \nAfrica.\n  I do not understand how the decision to intervene in Kosovo fits in \nwith an overall post-Cold War American foreign policy strategy. \nObviously, the tragedies and the horrors that have been perpetrated in \nKosovo demand a response and that response must include a role for the \nUnited States. But as the world's only superpower, I do not believe the \nUnited States is able to act effectively only in Europe or only in our \nown region. We have shown our ability to project overwhelming power \nthroughout the world. Is an accident of geography sufficient to allow \ninaction in Africa, while Kosovo requires a huge commitment? This \nquestion needs to be answered not so much for me but for the American \npeople, and to some extent for the people of Africa. They do not \nunderstand, and I do not understand, why one tragedy demands our \nattention and our action, and another one simply does not.\n  Mr. President, my point here is that, given the overwhelming response \nto the events in the Balkans, the very least we can do in response to \nconflict in Africa is to support regional peacekeeping efforts, as well \nas do all we can on the preventive side.\n  The United States has been a significant contributor to existing \nregional efforts such as the actions of the Economic Community of West \nAfrican States, or ECOWAS, and its peacekeeping force, ECOMOG in both \nLiberia and in the ongoing conflict in Sierra Leone. There is no doubt \nthat ECOMOG has had its share of problems, but nevertheless, it is \nsolely through the efforts of this regional peacekeeping force that \nthere is even the hope of a peaceful resolution in the Sierra Leone \nsituation.\n  Mr. President, we can never truly anticipate the extent of needs such \nas this, and I would hope we could allow the administration some \nflexibility in this account. We should ensure the availability of \nfunding to provide resources to support what I hope will be a peace \nagreement in Sierra Leone and maybe a cease-fire agreement in the \nconflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. If these positive developments \ntake place, the United States should be poised to provide some support. \nThis is no time to send a signal that we are not concerned with these \ncrises.\n  Finally, just a quick word about the two Africa-related portions of \nthis voluntary account. As I understand his remarks, the Senator from \nKentucky believes it is ``redundant'' to have both an Africa Regional \nfund and monies for the Africa Crisis Response Initiative. But in my \nview, these two funds serve two separate purposes. The first, the \nAfrica regional fund, represents our traditional peacekeeping \nfunctions. This is the account that has been used to provide logistical \nassistance to ECOMOG in both the Liberia and Sierra Leone cases. The \nother, the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI), is different. ACRI \nseeks to assist African militaries to build their own capacities to \nconduct peacekeeping operations. It is hoped that countries which now \nreceive training under ACRI would agree to participate in future \npeacekeeping operations. In this regard, ACRI represents a forward-\nleaning approach; call it ``preventive diplomacy.''\n  Mr. President, ACRI has been in operation for just a short while and \ncan still be considered in its early stage. Most of the militaries that \nhave received training through ACRI have been trained at the company \nor, in a few cases, battalion levels, but an important aspect of the \nprogram is also to conduct brigade level training. As envisioned, the \nbrigade level training is key to the whole ACRI program because it \nwould expand joint training exercises between and among participating \ncountries and would help ensure interoperability between and among the \nforces of contributing nations.\n  Mr. President, just as the ACRI program is getting underway, I do not \nthink we should be cutting support for it. Our efforts to build \npeacekeeping capacity in Africa will fail if we can not assist in \npreparing our partners to actually participate and conduct peacekeeping \noperations.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I believe the voluntary peacekeeping \naccount represents an important part of our international affairs \nfunding, and of America's ability to lead in the world, and I am \nconcerned that the cuts to this account will have an inordinate impact \non Africa.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG Mr. President, I rise today first of all to thank and \ncommend the Chairman and the ranking member of the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Subcommittee for their efforts to develop a bill to meet \npriority foreign affairs needs within the limits of the subcommittee \nallocation.\n  Mr. President, the Budget Resolution did not allocate sufficient \nresources for Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Operations Subcommittee \nfrankly did not receive a sufficient allocation to maintain America's \nworld leadership role We need to recognize that neither isolationism \nnor limited engagement is an option if we want to maintain America's \nsecurity and prosperity.\n  We need to realize that we cannot conduct effective foreign policy \nsolely by having a strong military In fact, by limiting funding for \nother tools of diplomacy we increase our reliance on threats and use of \nmilitary force.\n  This bill fails to fulfill the President's request in numerous areas.\n  I am deeply concerned that the Wye aid package for Israel, the \nPalestinians, and Jordan requested by the President has not been fully \nfunded The fact that it could not be accommodated within the \nsubcommittee allocation without drastically cutting important programs \naround the world merely reinforces my previous point.\n  In the near future, we are going to have to step up to the \nresponsibility of funding aid to help implement the Wye River \nMemorandum I hope the Chairman will agree that we will need to find a \nway to fund this aid outside the confines of this bill This is a small \nprice to pay for continued and renewed efforts to achieve a lasting \npeace in the Middle East.\n  The bill does not include the $60 million I sought for tuberculosis \nprevention programs We need much stronger programs to combat \ntuberculosis now Tuberculosis kills more people worldwide than AIDS and \nmalaria combined, yet receives substantially fewer aid dollars.\n  TB is spread easily and each active case leads to many more, so \nconcerted global action to bring TB under control, now estimated to \nrequire $1 billion, becomes more expensive the longer we wait We need \nto find more resources to begin to confront the challenge of TB this \nyear.\n  I hope we will also be able to find an additional $20 million for the \nUnited Nations Development Program UNDP has made great strides in \ncutting costs and improving coordination among UN agencies in the field \nto more effectively deliver essential assistance and promote \nsustainable economic development.\n  Unfortunately, we're penalizing the poor in many countries by \nfollowing the Administration's lead and failing to restore funding for \nUNDP to $100 million.\n  I am also concerned that the bill significantly underfunds debt \nrelief for the poorest countries.\n  Funding for the Peace Corps is reduced from the requested level, when \nit should have been increased to make progress toward the President's \ngoal of fielding ten thousand Peace Corps Volunteers.\n  Even counter terrorism programs have not been adequately funded.\n  Having raised these concerns, let me reiterate my commendation to the \nsubcommittee Chairman and Ranking Member for making a real effort to \nachieve a balanced bill while remaining within an allocation nearly $2 \nbillion below the President's request.\n  I would also like to thank the subcommittee chairman and ranking \nmember for including many important programs. In particular, Seeds of \nPeace contributes to reconciliation in the\n\n[[Page S7908]]\n\nMiddle East by bringing together young people from throughout the \nregion, including Israelis and Palestinians and other Arabs.\n  Carelift International, which is largely funded by the private \nsector, improves health care in transition and developing countries at \nlow cost by sharing refurbished American medical equipment.\n  Senator McConnell has also put some real dollars behind the rhetoric \nsupporting regional integration in Southeast Europe. We need to aid the \nKosovars to rebuild their shattered lives and help the countries and \npeoples of this troubled region to overcome their differences and their \nhistory and truly become a part of the new Europe.\n  I do hope we will be able to restore funding requested by the \nAdministration for regional programs under the SEED Act, including \nprograms to combat trans-national crime.\n  I am not offering amendments to increase allocations to unfunded or \nunderfunded programs because I think it would be very difficult to do \nso without reducing funding for other priorities.\n  I voted for this bill in the subcommittee and committee because I \nthink Senators McConnell and Leahy have done a good job with the \nlimited resources available to them. I will likely vote for the bill in \nthe Senate as well, but not without deep reservations about the overall \nfunding level and priorities which have not been funded adequately.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, United States national security and \neconomic well-being is closely tied to our ability to formulate and \nexecute foreign policies that both protect our interests and reflect \nour ideals. It is the responsibility of the Congress to pass \nlegislation on foreign policy consistent with those interests and \nideals. We may differ about the means, but we seldom disagree about the \ngoal: political stability and economic prosperity in every region of \nthe globe. Sometimes we employ political and economic sanctions in \npursuit of our objectives; sometimes we resort to the use of military \nforce. These responsibilities are considerable, and they are real. And \nwe owe it to the American public to handle them responsibly.\n  I do not wish to exaggerate the implications of the questionable \nspending that is included in the bill before us. Clearly, the wasteful \nand unnecessary spending provisions, as well as the numerous earmarks, \nthreaten neither our national interest nor our economic well-being. \nThey do, however, detract from the integrity of the process by which \nthe federal budget is put together, and they do undermine our \ncredibility with the public. The net result is to diminish our ability \nto contribute substantially to this nation's national security and \neconomic policies. Frivolous items placed in major spending bills for \nparochial or personal reasons is a serious disservice to the \ninstitution to which we belong, and to the public that we serve.\n  It is for this reason that is so discouraging to read the foreign \noperations appropriations bill and find that, once again, it includes \n$5 million to establish an International Law Enforcement Academy in \nRoswell, New Mexico. To see that provision once again placed in the \nbill is to reaffirm the notion that fiscal prudence and operational \nrequirements are alien concepts to some members of this body. \nSimilarly, language in the report accompanying the bill recommending \nthat the Agency for International Development spend as much as \nnecessary on such worthwhile projects as research on pond dynamics \nstrikes me as representing a seriously misplaced sense of priorities. \nAnd should we really be earmarking more than $1 million in additional \nfunds so that a Minnesota job training program can shift its dependence \nto private sector funding? In a foreign aid bill? I have to question \nthe wisdom of provisions like these.\n  Mr. President, as United States military forces take up positions in \nKosovo while others continue their peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia and \nsoldiers serve unaccompanied hardship tours on the demilitarized zone \nof the Korean peninsula, what kind of message are we sending about our \nrole in the foreign policy process when we pass a bill that directs the \nAgency for International Development to study and, almost certainly, \nfund research on protea germplasm in South Africa? With all the \nproblems around the world demanding our attention, do we really need to \nfocus on the future welfare of the Waboom tree? I think not. And, of \ncourse, the bill provides the usual absurd amount--specified as ``at \nleast'' $4 million--for that oldie but goodie, the International \nFertilizer Center in Alabama. I have to believe, Mr. President, that if \nthe Department of State or the Agency for International Development \nagreed with the need to spend so much annually out of the foreign \noperations budget for research on fertilizer, it would probably include \nsuch an item in its budget request.\n  Israel and Hawaii collaborating on research regarding the \ncompetitiveness of the tropical fish and plant global market sounds \ncontrived, but I'll allow for the possibility that there's more to that \nprogram than meets the eye. When viewed alongside the report's language \n``urging'' AID to allocate $500,000 for the Pacific International \nCenter for High Technology Research, a pattern begins to form, but I \nwon't elaborate further.\n  As usual, the foreign operations appropriations bill includes a long \nlist of earmarks for specific American universities, the very kind of \nbudgeting that ensures the American taxpayers get the least value for \ntheir dollar. A competitive process wherein funding is allocated \naccording to which project, if any, is the most meritorious is a \npreferred process for allocating financial resources, but this bill \ngoes far in the opposite direction. As a leader in the effort at \ndeveloping normal economic relations with Vietnam, I applaud projects \ndesigned to facilitate the establishment of a market economy in that \ncountry; whether Boise State University deserves a $3 million earmark \nto establish a business school there, however, strains credulity.\n  There is much that is good in this bill in terms of genuine efforts \nat improving health care in less developed countries. I continue to be \ntroubled, however, by the Committee's tendency to specify precisely \nwhich organizations it believes should be the recipient of foreign aid \ndollars. That is a practice that deserves closer scrutiny than \nheretofore has been the case. I would like to think that such \ndeterminations are solely merit based following a competitive process \nand that parochial considerations play no part. Skepticism, though, is \nwarranted.\n  In closing, I am a strong supporter of maintaining an active U.S. \nrole in global affairs. United States foreign aid programs are an \nessential instrument of our national security policy. Even with the \nvast number of troubling items in this bill, I will support its \npassage. But I would be remiss in my responsibilities were I to ignore \nwhat I firmly believe is an imprudent budgeting process that has a \nself-defeating tendency to squander foreign aid dollars that we can \nill-afford to waste.

Mr. President, the foreign operations appropriation bill \nis a crucial bill. It is integral to all of our assistance programs \noverseas. The bill's importance to American foreign policy cannot be \nover emphasized. This bill provides funding for development aid to poor \ncountries, funds to combat terrorism and proliferation of nuclear \nweapons overseas, and monies for all of the multilateral financial \ninstitutions which lend to needy countries.\n  As I see it, the bill before the Senate has two major problems. \nFirst, the bill as a whole is significantly under-funded. The amount \ndedicated to our nation's foreign operations is almost $2 billion below \nthe President's request for funding.\n  I understand that some of this is due to the caps placed on \nexpenditures as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997; however, we in \nthe Senate cannot hide behind that piece of legislation every time we \nwant an excuse for why the administration's appropriations requests are \nunder funded. I am not saying that this is not a legitimate reason for \nnot granting the President's entire request, but $2 billion is an \nenormous shortfall.\n  In addition to inadequate funding overall, there are particular \nprograms and foreign policy initiatives which are either funded at a \nlevel which is drastically reduced from the President's request, or \nwhich have not been funded at all.\n  Mr. President, the administration in its statement of policy with \nrespect to this bill has clearly stated that ``A bill funded at this \nlevel would be grossly inadequate to maintain America's leadership \naround the world. It would inevitably require severe reductions from \npreviously enacted levels for programs managed by the Departments of \nState and Treasury, the Agency for International Development and other \nagencies.''\n  The statement quite clearly states that if the significant funding \nand language problems in this bill as reported are not resolved that \n``the President's senior advisors have no choice but to recommend that \nhe veto the bill.''\n  I wish to speak to several very important aspects of this bill that \nmust be addressed in conference. First, the bill fails to provide the \n$500 million requested by the President to support the Middle East Wye \nRiver Agreement.\n  Second, it fails to fund the administration's Expanded Threat \nReduction Initiative, so important to our ability to reduce the \nproliferation threat and continue the elimination of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Third, this bill imposes new onerous conditions on U.S. funding for \nthe 1994 Agreed Framework, the cornerstone of our North Korea policy.\n\n[[Page S7910]]\n\n  I also have very strong concerns with respect to two provisions in \nthe bill relating to Kosovo and our ongoing relationship with Russia.\n  Unfortunately, by withholding critical support for Jordan, Israel, \nand the Palestinian Authority, this bill would have us renege on the \ncommitments that made the Wye River agreement possible. The leaders of \nJordan, the Palestinian Authority, and Israel have taken great risks \nfor peace. We pledged to stand with them as they took these risks.\n  In the months ahead, we will undoubtedly be called upon to play a \nlead role in the peace talks. But by refusing to fund one penny of the \nPresident's request for the Wye River agreement, this bill calls into \nquestion our commitment to Middle East peace just as there is renewed \nhope for accelerated progress.\n  Some may argue that the Middle East gets enough assistance as it is. \nRelative to other accounts that may be true, but the levels of \nassistance to the Middle East are a reflection of the strategic and \nmoral issues at stake.\n  The funds requested by the administration are in keeping with our \ncommitment to Israel's security. They will help wage battle in \nPalestinian areas against the greatest enemy of peace--namely, the \npoverty and despair that provides a fertile breeding ground for \nextremism. They will help bolster Jordan--a close ally whose peace with \nIsrael should serve as a model for others in the region.\n  I am convinced that the sums requested by the administration to \nsupport peace pale in comparison to the costs we would incur if \nconflict and turmoil returned to the Middle East.\n  One of the most disturbing elements of this bill is its failure to \nfund the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative that helps reduce the \nthreat of weapons of mass destruction. Technically the cuts are to the \nlarger budget lines for aid to the Newly Independent States and for \nNonproliferation and related programs. But report language calls the \nfunding of Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative programs ``ill \nadvised,'' and they will bear the brunt of these cuts.\n  Weapons of mass destruction dwarf the other threats to our national \nsecurity. If we fail to help Russian experts find nonmilitary \nemployment, we may foster Iran's nuclear weapons, or Iraq's biological \nweapons, or Libyan missiles. Even a single use of such weapons against \nthe United States, U.S. forces, or our allies would be a terrible \ntragedy--especially if we failed to prevent it.\n  The failure to fund the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiatives means \nno funds--not even the levels appropriated last year--for helping \nRussian biological weapons experts find new careers. This is a vital \nprogram that has enabled biological weapons experts to resist offers \nfrom Iran and other rogue states. We should be expanding this program, \nrather than cutting it.\n  The Threat Reduction cut means no funds for the International Science \nand Technology Centers in Russia and Ukraine that have helped over \n24,000 former weapons scientists since 1994. The Science Center program \nhas been very successful. It has been praised for its tight management, \nunder board chairman Ron Lehman, a former official in Republican \nadministrations whom we all know to be a true patriot. Science Center \nsupport for Russian scientists is exempt from Russian taxes. We should \nbe expanding this program, too, rather than cutting it.\n  The Threat Reduction cut means no funds--not even last year's \nlevels--for the Civilian Research and Development Foundation, which \ngives vital training to Russian former weapons scientists who are \ntrying to form viable businesses. We tell Russian weapons experts to \nadapt to a market economy. But they will never achieve that, if we \ndon't give them the training. And if they fail, they will be ripe for \nthe plucking by rogue states who would buy their weapons expertise.\n  The Threat Reduction cut means no funds--not even last year's \nlevels--to assist customs officials in Russia and the rest of the \nformer Soviet Union. The customs officials whom we assist are our most \nreliable allies in stopping the flow of nuclear and weapons of mass \ndestruction materials.\n  For example, it was customs officials in Azerbaijan who stopped a \nshipment of specialty steel to Iran that would have been used for \nmissiles. This bill also contains only $5 million--out of $15 million \nrequested--for world-wide assistance to customs services. This is the \nprogram that aids border control agencies in the Baltic states, where \nwe have seen Russian nuclear smuggling efforts in the past. It makes no \nsense to provide only $5 million for this vital function.\n  These cuts even wipe out the border security assistance to Georgia \nthat Senator McConnell instituted last year.\n  The Threat Reduction cut means no funds to assist in removing Russian \ntroops from Moldova--a longstanding objective of the United States and \nof the Congress. Do we suddenly want the Russian troops to stay longer \nin a country that does not want them? Do we no longer care whether this \nexacerbates ethnic conflict in Moldova?\n  The Foreign Operations Subcommittee made these cuts without \nprejudice. But it makes no sense to let us guard our national security \nonly by cutting important programs to support democracy, free media, \nand the rule of law in the former Soviet Union.\n  I am very pleased that the managers have accepted a sense of the \nSenate amendment I offered urging that the Threat Reduction funds be \nrestored in conference to the level requested by the President.\n  I urge the managers of this bill to do their utmost to achieve this, \nand I wish them complete success in that important effort.\n  On the eve of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's visit to \nWashington, and just as former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry is \ncompleting his comprehensive Korea policy review, this bill places the \nAgreed Framework in grave jeopardy.\n  The bill not only provides inadequate funding for heavy fuel oil \ndeliveries to North Korea--deliveries the United States is obligated to \narrange under the 1994 Agreed Framework--it also effectively prevents \nthe appropriated funds from being expended by requiring the President \nto certify the uncertifiable with respect to North Korea's conduct.\n  Under existing law, the President must already certify that North \nKorea is in full compliance with the Agreed Framework and its \nconfidential minute in order to expend monies appropriated for heavy \nfuel oil deliveries to the North. This a reasonable requirement. But if \nthe North is fulfilling its side of the bargain, we should fulfill ours \nrather than dream up new requirements on the North.\n  Do we have other serious concerns about North Korea, in addition to \nits nuclear ambitions? Of course we do. But these other concerns--\nmissile development and export, narcotics trafficking, armed \nprovocations along the DMZ--cannot be addressed successfully if we \nabandon the Agreed Framework.\n  For all of its imperfections, the Agreed Framework has served our \nnational interest well, reducing the risk of war and capping the \nNorth's ability to produce fissile material for nuclear bombs. Five \nyears ago, North Korea was on the verge of withdrawing from the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty and acquiring the capacity to build dozens of \nnuclear weapons every year. Today, with the Agreed Framework intact, \nthe North's nuclear facilities stand idle.\n  The spent fuel from its research reactor has been canned and placed \nunder round-the-clock monitoring by the International Atomic Energy \nAgency. The Agreed Framework has also given us unprecedented access to \nNorth Korea, even to sensitive military sites, as demonstrated by the \nrecent successful U.S. visit to the Kumchangni undergound facility.\n  These are not insignificant accomplishments, and we should think \ntwice before we risk turning back the clock.\n  By underfunding the Korean Energy Development Organization and \nunilaterally imposing new obligations on North Korea, this bill could \nprecipitate a crisis on the Peninsula and distance us from our key \nally, South Korea.\n  In addition, I have two serious problems with sections of the bill \nrelating to Kosovo. First, $20 million shall be available ``for \ntraining and equipping a Kosova security force.'' Mr. President, this \nlanguage conveys the impression that we want to train something like a \nnational guard or an army. In the real world, most people would see \nthis as our training and equipping a KLA Army.\n\n[[Page S7911]]\n\n  U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999), which gives \ninternational sanction to KFOR, is not specific about the future status \nof Kosovo. Any future Kosovo national guard or army presupposes an \nindependent Kosovo.\n  Aside from that being counter to United States policy, it is \ncompletely irrelevant to this bill. For the duration of fiscal year \n2000, security in Kosovo will be guaranteed by the heavily armed, NATO-\nled KFOR. There is absolutely no need for any kind of an indigenous \n``security force'' other than a civilian police force.\n  The final legislation should make it crystal-clear that the \nappropriation will be used to train and equip a police force, not an \narmy.\n  My second Kosovo-related objection concerns the requirement that the \nSecretary of State certify that the Russians have not established a \n``separate zone of operational control'' and are ``fully integrated \nunder NATO unified command and control arrangements.''\n  This requirement has been overtaken by events. The Military-Technical \nAgreement between NATO and Russia found a formula to include Russian \npeacekeepers in KFOR. This formula has been accepted by our government, \nby all other 18 NATO members, and by the United Nations.\n  I have no doubt that Secretary Albright could broadly construe words \nlike ``operational control'' and ``fully integrated'' and thereby make \nthe required certification.\n  But what would we get by retaining this language and forcing her to \ndo so? I'll tell my colleagues. We would be gratuitously sticking our \nfinger in the Russians' eye at the precise moment we are trying to \ninvolve them in KFOR and in the entire reconstruction effort in Kosovo.\n  To sanitize a phrase used by an esteemed former President of the \nUnited States, I would rather have the Russians inside our tent looking \nout, than outside our tent looking in.\n  I would like to remind my friend Senator McConnell that when the two \nof us recently appeared on the Sunday Fox Television News talk-show he \nsaid with regard to the Russians in Kosovo--and I quote; ``I don't know \nthat we need to threaten foreign assistance.''\n  Apparently he has changed his mind. I agreed with Senator McConnell \nthat day on television. I wish he had held to his position.\n  It is important that these problems be addressed in conference, and \nthat a way be found to increase the overall funding levels.\n  At this time I will reluctantly vote to send this legislation to \nconference. However, I reserve the right to vote against it should \nthese problems not be addressed in the final conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. President, I commend first the occupant of the Chair for an \nextraordinarily effective debate on the issue that dominated today's \ndiscussion in the foreign operations appropriations bill. I think the \nSenator from Kansas did an outstanding job.\n  I also want to thank my staff. Robin Cleveland has done work on \nforeign policy matters for some 15 years now, and I thank Robin for, as \nusual, outstanding work; and Billy Piper, with whom I have worked 5 or \n6 years, has done an absolutely superb job; and his assistant, Jon \nMeek, from my personal staff; as well as Jennifer Chartrand, a new \nmember of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. All of those folks \nare on the majority side; and of course Tim Rieser and Cara Thanassi \nfrom the minority staff, with whom we always enjoy working, and Steve \nCortese and Jay Kimmitt from the full committee.\n  I say to my friend, Pat Leahy, I enjoy our annual collaboration on \nthis bill, and I look forward to working with the Senator in \nconference.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky for the alacrity with which he moved this bill. Those who \nhave reached that level of knowledge know we Senators are \nconstitutional impediments to our staffs.\n  I compliment Robin Cleveland, who has worked so hard at trying to \nbalance the competing interests of so many Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle, as well as Billy Piper and Jennifer Chartrand; and on my \nside, the indefatigable Tim Rieser, a man who has not slept since it \nwas announced we might go to this bill a month or so ago. He has, \nagain, maintained the remarkable Rieser filing cabinet, which is \nprimarily in his head, knowing all the ins and outs of this bill and \nhandling it so well.\n  He was ably assisted by Cara Thanassi. Ms. Thanassi began a few years \nago on our staff. She has grown enormously in talent and ability and \nwas absolutely essential in this work.\n  In working with the Senator from Kentucky, we have tried to \naccommodate each other on issues, even though on some issues we \nobviously have a different philosophy. We have respected each other and \naccommodated each other and tried to make sure a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation came through. I think the resulting vote today shows that \nbipartisanship on foreign policy was maintained.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7911-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7911-S7912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO AMBASSADOR JIM SASSER\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Ambassador \nJames Sasser, our former colleague from Tennessee, who served in this \nbody as a distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He is \nreturning from his post in the People's Republic of China where he has \nbeen the U.S. Ambassador since 1995. He has done an outstanding job \nduring a challenging period in our relations with China.\n  Having had the honor to serve with Jim for 18 years in the Senate, I \nknow him to be a man of great insight, intellect, and integrity, a \nhighly respected public servant. While he served in the Senate, his \ninterests and work covered a broad range of domestic and foreign policy \nissues. As Senate Budget Committee chairman, his keen grasp of \nfinancial and budgeting issues enabled him to handle that assignment \nwith tremendous skill under very difficult circumstances. Jim \nconstantly showed great resolve in addressing measures to reduce our \ndeficit. He was instrumental in helping lead our country on to a path \nwhich is reflected in today's budget surplus.\n  This dedication and commitment has characterized Jim's lifetime \ndevotion to our country. His interests in public service began long \nbefore he was elected to the Senate. Jim's father, a public servant \nhimself, instilled in Jim the principles of public service at an early\n\n[[Page S7912]]\n\nage. He served as a role model for Jim and set him on a course which he \nhas followed with great distinction.\n  Throughout his career, Jim Sasser has demonstrated, both in spirit \nand in deed, his adherence to the ideals most important to this Nation. \nHe is a shining example of how much one individual can contribute to \nour Nation's well-being. Jim's leadership has always been highly \nregarded and broadly respected.\n  Throughout his tenure as Ambassador to China, Jim has been confronted \nwith many difficult aspects of the relationship. Jim's work has \nemphasized the importance of keeping the lines of communication open by \nregularizing our contacts with the current Chinese leadership and \nensuring that we remain engaged in our bilateral relationship. Jim's \nlongstanding commitment to the promotion of democratic principles and \nvalues has played an important role in helping shape his service to our \ncountry.\n  Jim Sasser has done a terrific job as our Ambassador to China, and I \nwish him well in all his future endeavors.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nesteemed former colleague, Ambassador Jim Sasser. He will soon be \nstepping down from his post as the longest serving American Ambassador \nto China. But it does not seem long ago that he and I were working \ntogether on the Budget Committee where he served as the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee. In fact, as we talk today of the great state \nof the economy, it should be former Senator Sasser that we thank for \nhaving the leadership to push through the deficit reduction package \nthat has led to today's unprecedented economic growth and prosperity. \nAs a former Budget Committee Chairman myself, it was with great pride \nthat I worked side-by-side with the former Senator in the Budget \nCommittee because I understood the great challenges that the job \nentailed. He did a superb job in his duties here in the Senate, and it \nis with the same dedication and fairness that he represented this \nnation so admirably in his post as the U.S. Ambassador to China.\n  I still remember vividly the front page of the newspaper a few months \nago which showed Ambassador Sasser looking through the shattered window \nof the American Embassy. Suffice to say that Ambassador Sasser has \nserved during some very difficult times in China-U.S. relations. Few \nrelationships are as difficult to define and put in perspective and I \nthink that Ambassador Sasser would agree that there is still much work \nto be done. But during his tenure, Ambassador Sasser was able to build \nconsensus and to find common ground between the two nations that has \nallowed the relationship to prosper. Ambassador Sasser should be \ncommended for his dedication as a gifted emissary between the world's \nlargest developed country and the world's largest developing country. \nHe has served the United States admirably and I commend him for his \ndutiful service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7912-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7912-S7914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate \nCalendar No. 169, the fiscal year 2000 Treasury and general government \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will report the bill \nby title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1282) making appropriations for the Treasury \n     Department, the United States Postal Service, the Executive \n     office of the President, and certain Independent Agencies, \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                         privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask unanimous consent the following individuals have \nfloor privileges for the duration of the consideration of S. 1282, the \nTreasury and government appropriations bill for the fiscal year 2000: \nTammy Perrin, Lula Edwards, Dylan Pressman, and Liz Blevins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am now pleased to lay before the \nSenate the committee recommendation for the Treasury Department, the \nPostal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and various \nindependent agencies. The bill was crafted by the Subcommittee on \nTreasury and General Government and contains a total of $27,737,971,000 \nin new budget authority. Of that, $14,533,811,000 is for mandatory \naccounts.\n  The committee recommendation is within the 302(b) allocations and \nstrikes a delicate balance between congressional priorities, \nadministration initiatives, and agency requirements. This would not \nhave been possible without the hard work and cooperation of the new \nranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Dorgan, and his staff.\n  This bill consists of mostly salaries and expenses accounts and the \nmajority of the increases for agencies is to simply allow them to \nmaintain current levels. There are very few new initiatives in this \nbill.\n  Title I provides a total of $12,213,529,000 for the Department of the \nTreasury. This is $162,601,000 less than the administration request. \nThe committee has again placed a priority on Treasury's law enforcement \nneeds as well as support for efforts by State and local law \nenforcement.\n  Here are a few highlights from Title I:\n  $312,400,000 to the Customs Service to retain 5,000 current Customs \nemployees since the user fee proposed by the administration has not \nbeen enacted.\n  Emphasis on the need for the Gang Resistance Education and Training \nprogram--called GREAT--by including $3 million more than the \nadministration request for grants to State and local law enforcement.\n  Expansion of the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative into 10 \nadditional cities, bringing the total to 37 cities. This will allow ATF \nto track and prosecute those who supply guns to our youth.\n  Funding for the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy to allow AFT \nto more comprehensively investigate NICS denials in order to make sure \nthat felons do not possess guns.\n  Full funding to the IRS for customer service training and to \nimplement the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998.\n  Title II provides $93,436,000 for the United States Postal Service, \nand continues to require free mailing for overseas voters and the blind \nas well as six-day delivery, and prohibit the closing or consolidation \nof small and rural post offices.\n  Title III recommends a total of $553,128,000 for the Executive Office \nof the President, $86,370,000 less than the administration request. \nThis includes the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, the Federal drug control programs, and \nfunding for the national anti-drug media campaign.\n  Of special note, the committee:\n  Recommends establishing a separate account for the Counterdrug \nTechnology Assessment Center, and has provided $31,100,000 for that \nprogram to transfer much needed technology to State and local law \nenforcement.\n\n  Provides $188,277,000 for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \nprogram which will allow continuation of existing HIDTA programs at \ntheir current levels. These programs highly acclaimed by local law \nenforcement.\n  Recommends a total of $145,500,000 for the national anti-drug media \ncampaign.\n  Title IV is independent agencies such as the Federal Election \nCommission, the General Services Administration, and the National \nArchives, as well as agencies involved in Federal employment such as \nthe Federal Labor Relations Authority, the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard, the Office of Government Ethics, the Office of Special Counsel, \nand the Office of Personnel Management. Also included in this title are \nmandatory accounts to provide for Federal retirees, health benefits, \nand life insurance. The committee recommends a total of $14,877,878,000 \nfor this title.\n  For the third year in a row, the administration has not requested \nfunding for courthouse construction. Unfortunately, due to the very \nlimited funding available to the committee, we have not included any \nnew courthouse construction projects in this bill.\n  In order to stay within our 302(b) allocations, the subcommittee was \nforced\n\n[[Page S7913]]\n\nto make very difficult decisions, as were all Appropriations \nsubcommittees. As a result, this bill is very tightly crafted to allow \nthe agencies to continue their vital work. Very few new initiatives \nwere recommended and we were not able to accommodate all of our \ncolleagues' requests due to funding constraints. I remind my colleagues \nthat any funding amendments must be offset and, frankly, there is very \nlittle fat in this bill. If amendments are offered, we would ask the \nsponsor to identify the accounts we should be reducing to accomplish \ntheir goal.\n  Finally, I would like to again thank the ranking member, Senator \nDorgan, for his hard work and support. This bill would not have been \npossible without his assistance, and that of his staff Barbara Retzlaff \nand Elizabeth Blevins. I also thank my staff: Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin \nand Lula Edwards for their tireless and invaluable work on this bill. \nThis bill has been a collaborative effort and it deserves the support \nof the Senate.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in light of the hour and especially in \nlight of the statement made by my colleague from Colorado, the chairman \nof this subcommittee, I will be mercifully brief. But I do want to say \nthis bill, the fiscal year 2000 Treasury and general government bill, \nis one that we have worked hard to bring to the floor of the Senate in \na manner that we think is fair and relates to the limits that were \nimposed upon us. The chairman and I believe the allocation level, \nobviously, could have been greater in order to allow us to have \nprovided some additional funding to some areas of the bill, but we are \nrestricted by budget rules and by the allocation that was given us.\n  I would like to say working with Chairman Campbell has been a \npleasure. He is easy to work with. His staff, Pat Raymond, Tammy \nPerrin, and Lula Edwards have worked hard to ensure this bill has been \nwell crafted, as has been the work of Barbara Retzlaff and Chip \nWaldren, who have been working with me on this legislation.\n  Senator Campbell has described the major highlights of this bill, so \nI will not repeat that at this hour of the evening, but I do want to \naddress a couple of brief issues.\n  One, the issue of courthouse construction. Members of the \nsubcommittee are well aware of the judiciary's continuing need to have \nsome court space available to conduct their business and to move cases \nto settlement. We know that. Regrettably, there was not enough money in \nthe allocation to this subcommittee to provide for courthouse \nconstruction. The President did not request courthouse construction nor \nwas it funded in this bill. Budgetary constraints were the major factor \nwith respect to that but not the only factor. Another reason we believe \nit would be somewhat precipitous to approve funding for the design and \nconstruction of many new courthouses prior to the AOC's completion of \nits comprehensive review of judiciary space is we think that review \nought to be done first.\n  The committee was pleased to receive the Administrative Office of the \nCourt's May 28 letter confirming the award of a contract to a \nconsulting firm to analyze and evaluate the judiciary's long-range \nplanning process, their courthouse design guidelines, their program \npolicies and practices, and the funding mechanisms and \nresponsibilities. But the committee is concerned that the completion \ndate for that report will be well after the date by which the \nadministration must complete action on their 2001 fiscal year budget \nrequest. We anticipate having that report before we would complete \naction on fiscal year 2001 budget decisions and appropriations \ndecisions here in the Congress. I believe that is important because we \nhave received information which indicates that 11 of the 16 courthouses \nfor which the AOC requested funding in the year 2000 deviated from the \nJudicial Conference of the United States Court Design Guide.\n  For example, magistrate and bankruptcy courtrooms were increased from \n1,800 usable square feet to 2,400 usable square feet, a 33-percent \nincrease. Total courthouse circulation space increased from 20 percent \nto 30 percent. Individual courtrooms were routinely being provided for \nindividual senior district judges for more than 10 years, and the list \ngoes on.\n  I believe some of those excesses in the construction program resulted \nin some of the past funding delays. None of us believe a funding \nmoratorium is the best way to maintain an important Federal asset \nprogram, so I hope the construction review will be completed and we can \nproceed in the future with a construction program.\n  Second, I want to discuss very briefly the issue of the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. \nThat is a long way of talking about the media campaign that has been \ngoing on in this country on the issue of drugs. This is the third year \nof that funding, funding of over one-half of a billion dollars that has \nbeen provided for this initiative.\n  I would like to say I support this initiative. I think the power of \nadvertising is well recognized. Appropriate advertising and advertising \nthat is well done dealing with a message to our young people in this \ncountry, ``do not take drugs,'' is an appropriate way to send that \nmessage.\n  I worked with the subcommittee to ensure that adequate funds were \nprovided this year for that campaign to be effective. I do not believe \nthat halfway through the campaign it is time to dilute the message.\n  I know there will perhaps be an amendment offered dealing with \nalcohol. No one is more concerned about the issue of alcohol \nconsumption, drunk driving, and alcohol abuse in this country than I. \nBut I do not want to dilute what we are doing on the antidrug campaign \nwith this alcohol issue at this point. There are other venues, other \nways, other programs with which we can confront the drunk driving and \nalcohol abuse issue, and we will.\n  This year we were not able to fully fund the television campaign \ndealing with the antidrug message. We have had to cut that some. We \nwould have liked to have funded all of these issues in a manner that \nfully funds the budget request, but we did not have the money to do \nthat. There simply were not the available resources to accomplish that. \nWe have been forced to make certain cuts.\n  My hope is perhaps some of these can be in conference, perhaps some \nadditional budget allocation will be made available as we proceed \nthrough this process.\n  Again, the work done by Senator Campbell, his staff, and our staff \nhas produced a good piece of legislation. I hope we can move through it \nrather quickly tomorrow and preserve the bulk of what we have done to \nfund these very important programs.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 1189, 1190, And 1191\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, we have just concluded the foreign \noperations bill, and I congratulate Senator McConnell, Senator Leahy, \nand others who have worked so very diligently on this difficult and \ntough bill. Contained in the bill we just passed, among other things, \nwas a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. This sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution was proposed and offered by myself and by my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Coverdell. It deals with the situation in Colombia and \nthe United States relationship to that troubled country.\n  I want to talk this evening about that sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nand about the situation in Colombia.\n  For the past several months, United States foreign policy has really \nbeen dominated by the crisis in Kosovo. Certainly we have to continue \nto work with the NATO alliance and Russia to help bring the Albanian \nKosovars back to their homeland and to bring a stable peace to the \nregion. But tonight I want to discuss another compelling and very \nserious foreign policy crisis that is taking place right in our own \nhemisphere.\n  Like Kosovo, it is a crisis that has displaced hundreds of thousands \nof people, more than 800,000 since 1995, and instead of a small \nprovince being ethnically cleansed by its own government, this \ndemocratic country is fighting multiple conflicts--a war against two \nthreatening and competing guerrilla groups, a war against paramilitary \norganizations, and, finally, a war against drug lords who traffic in \ndeadly cocaine and in heroin.\n  I am, of course, talking about the four wars that are taking place \ntonight in Colombia. While a 19-nation NATO alliance struggles to \nprevent the disintegration of a small province, the disintegration of \nan entire nation is going practically unnoticed by our own Government \nin Washington. The decade-long struggle in the Balkans is being \nduplicated in Colombia, which is fracturing into politically and \nsocially unstable ministates and is posing a significant threat to our \nown hemisphere. Colombia is shaping up to be the Balkan problem of the \nAmericas.\n  More than 35,000 Colombians have been killed in the last decade. More \nthan 308,000 Colombians were internally displaced in 1998 alone. In \nKosovo, 230,000 people were displaced during this same period of time \nbefore NATO took action. And like the Albanian Kosovars, Colombians are \nfleeing their country today in large numbers. More than 2,000 crossed \ninto Venezuela in a matter of a few days recently. A Miami Herald \narticle recently reported a growing number of Colombians leaving for \nsouth Florida.\n  Our Nation has a clear national interest in the future of the \nstability of our neighbor to the south, Colombia. In 1998, legitimate \ntwo-way trade between the United States and Colombia was more than $11 \nbillion, making the United States Colombia's No. 1 trading partner, and \nColombia is our fifth-largest trading partner in the region.\n  In spite of this mutually beneficial partnership, the United States \nsimply has not devoted the level of time nor resources nor attention \nneeded to assist this important democratic partner as it struggles with \ndrug problems, with violent criminal and paramilitary organizations, \nand guerrilla insurgents. In fact, in December 1998, a White House \nofficial told the Washington Post that Colombia, quote, ``poses a \ngreater immediate threat to us than Bosnia did, yet it receives almost \nno attention.''\n\n  Attention is needed--now more than ever. According to the State \nDepartment, Colombia is the third most dangerous country in the world \nin terms of political violence, and accounts for 34 percent of all \nterrorist acts committed worldwide. The Colombian National Police \nreported that Colombian rebels carried out 1,726 terrorist strikes in \n1998--that's 12 percent more than in the previous year.\n  Kidnapping is also a significant problem. Approximately 2,609 people \nwere kidnapped in 1998, and there have been 513 reported kidnappings in \nthe first three months of this year. Guerrillas are responsible for a \nhigh percentage of these incidents.\n  The wholesale acts of violence that have infected this country are \nsymptoms of four wars that are going on in Colombia. Any single one of \nthem would pose a significant threat to any country. Together, these \nwars represent a threat beyond the borders of Colombia. Let me describe \nthem in detail.\n  For more than three decades, the guerrilla groups known as Colombian \nRevolutionary Armed Forces--the FARC--and the National Liberation \nArmy--the ELN--have waged the longest-running anti-government \ninsurgency in Latin America.\n  Determining the size of these guerrilla organizations is an inexact \nscience. Most open sources range their combat strength from about \n10,000 to 20,000 full-time guerrillas. However, irregular militias, \npart-time guerrillas, and political sympathizers also play a role that \nis hard to quantify.\n  The insurgents have their own armament capabilities and are \nmanufacturing high-quality improvised mortars. Organized crime links \nalso have long been suspected. The Chief of the Colombian National \nPolice, General Jose Serrano, has reported in the past that the FARC \nhas completed guns-and-cash-for-drugs deals with organized crime groups \nin Russia, Ukraine, Chechnya and Uzbekistan. A Colombian army study \nrecently stated that the two main leftist guerrilla groups had raised \nat least $5.3 billion from 1991 to 1998 from the drug trade, \nabductions, and extortions to fund their long-running uprising against \nthe state.\n  According to the State Department's 1998 Human Rights Report, the \nFARC and ELN, along with other, smaller groups, initiated armed action \nin nearly 700 of the country's 1073 municipalities, and control or \ninfluence 60 percent of rural Colombia. Although these\n\n[[Page S7915]]\n\ngroups have had no history of major urban operations, a number of \nrecent guerrilla-sponsored hostage takings recently have taken place.\n  Colombian President Pastrana is trying to make peace at all costs \nwith FARC rebels, who have little incentive to agree to any peace deal. \nThroughout these negotiations, the FARC has continued to assault and \nkill dozens of Colombian military and police.\n  The current prospects for peace are dismal. If Pastrana were to \naccept the demands of the FARC and ELN for political and territorial \nautonomy, he would have to splinter his country into Balkan-type \nfactions. The effects of this would be increased paramilitary violence \nand increased regional instability.\n  In fact, one of the FARC conditions already agreed to by President \nPastrana was the creation of a temporary, demilitarized zone the size \nof Switzerland. All Colombian Armed Forces and Police were ordered out \nof the area. Despite this enormous concession on the part of the \nColombian government, the FARC has not agreed to any cease-fire and has \nmade no concessions. In fact, they made it clear to the Colombian \nGovernment that they should expect continued guerrilla operations and \nattacks.\n  ``Farclandia'' is the name some local residents have given to this \nodd state-within-a-state. The area has over 90,000 residents. Despite \nits creation as a temporary demilitarized zone, the FARC appear to be \ncementing control and taking steps to ensure that expulsion from the \nzone would be extremely difficult, particularly if the talks break \ndown.\n  According to the Catholic Bishop residing in the DMZ area, residents \nare required to feed the FARC, which is simply a form of taxation. The \nFARC has attempted to expel a Catholic priest for being an ``enemy of \npeace.'' The priest argued the FARC is violating human rights, usurping \nthe locally elected government, interfering with economic activity, \nimposing labor duty, and recruiting minors, teenagers, and married men. \nThe bottom line is that FARC fighters are using their armed \nstranglehold on the zone to abuse Colombian citizens.\n  In April, FARC leaders asked Pastrana to extend rebel control over \nanother zone in southern Colombia--approximately 7,600 square miles--\nthat is allegedly the home to some of the most concentrated cocaine-\nproduction facilities in the world. The Pastrana Government agreed to \nplace the request on the negotiating table. While the additional zone \nwas not approved, Pastrana agreed to allow FARC rebels to have \ncontinued control over the DMZ. This is the second time, since November \n1998, that President Pastrana has extended the DMZ to the FARC during \nthe talks.\n  This decision provoked outrage within Colombian military ranks, \nparticularly since military officers had been humiliated by the \ncreation of the original zone. That earlier decision required the \nwithdrawal of hundreds of police and army troops. By the end of May, \nColombian Defense Minister Ricardo Lloreda announced his resignation.\n  Following his announcement, dozens of military officers resigned in \nsolidarity with Lloreda. Of the total of 30 Colombian army generals, \nreports indicate that between 10 and 17 resigned in solidarity with \nLloreda. With the exception of Lloreda's resignation, Pastrana did not \naccept any other resignations. However, as a result of this mass \nprotest, Pastrana agreed that the FARC zone would be demilitarized for \nonly six more months and that a retired general would be included in \nthe negotiating team for the talks.\n  In another important development, the Colombian Congress too is \nbeginning to express its doubt in the peace process. Earlier this \nmonth, the Congress rejected a bill that would have given Pastrana \nsweeping powers to grant political concessions--including an amnesty \nfor convicted guerrillas.\n  Lloreda's resignation was truly unfortunate. I met Defense Minister \nLloreda in Colombia last November. Lloreda, described by his peers as \nsomeone who could help bring about needed reform in the military, was \njust beginning to gain some ground. He had already begun rebuilding the \narmy, a difficult task given its record of human rights violations. In \nfact, he had forced the resignation of Colombian military officers \nsuspected of human rights violations and had others arrested.\n\n  Lloreda had also lifted the morale among the military, having \nsuffered significant defeats by the FARC forces. According to the \nEconomist magazine, the defense budget has doubled this year to $1.2 \nbillion. In March, the army even managed a successful offensive, which \nleft 50 guerrillas dead.\n  The resignation, however, threw Pastrana's 10-month-old government \ninto crisis and placed the future of the nation's fragile process in \ndoubt. It has also left open important questions about the future of \nthe Colombian military.\n  Mr. President, Colombian military operational mobility is widely \nacknowledged to be a shortcoming. Colombia is a very large country. One \nof their departments is as large as the nation of El Salvador. In \nfighting an insurgency, the state has to defend many critical areas, \nbut also has to have the capability to mass and economize forces to \nattack guerrilla formations when they present themselves. Colombia's \narmy has barely 40 helicopters for a territory the size of Texas and \nMexico combined. El Salvador, 1/50th the size of Colombia, had 80--\ntwice as many--during its civil war.\n  Although the Army has 122,000 soldiers, most of them are 1-year \nconscripts. Approximately 35-40% are high school graduates not assigned \nto combat duties by law. At any time, about 30% are undergoing basic \ntraining. A large portion of the remaining force (50-60%) is assigned \nto static defense of key economic or isolated municipal outposts. That \nleaves approximately 20,000 soldiers remaining for offensive combat \noperations. These are the veterans or volunteers that constitute--apart \nfrom the officer corps-- the only true repository of combat experience \nin their army. Now consider that the active guerrilla combatants alone \nnumber between 11,000 and 20,000. You do the math. It doesn't look \ngood. It is conceivably a one to one ``fighting'' ratio. How can a \nmilitary, with limited resources, fight two guerrilla movements which \nhave virtually unlimited resources from drug trafficking, kidnappings, \nextortion and arms trafficking?\n  The Colombian Army has already suffered a string of military defeats. \nIn 1998, the Colombian Armed Forces suffered three major blows in \nMarch, August, and November. In fact, the FARC executed one of its \nmajor blows against the military just as President Pastrana was meeting \nwith FARC leaders on the peace talks.\n  The FARC currently holds over 300 military and police POW's. And \naccording to Jane's Intelligence Review, Colombian guerrillas killed \n445 soldiers during 1998. If you include Colombian National Police, the \nfigure would rise to 600. The CNP too has experienced significant \nlosses. Over 4,000 policemen have been killed in Colombia in the past \ndecade.\n  As if the FARC weren't enough of a problem, let me complicate this \nsituation further by discussing the war with the ELN. The ELN has been \nenvious of the attention the FARC has been getting, particularly at the \nnegotiating table. As a result, the ELN has resorted to a series of \nrecent hostage takings. Shortly after Pastrana and the FARC announced \nin April that formal negotiations would take place in the summer, the \nELN hijacked a Colombian commercial airliner in mid-April, kidnapping \n41 passengers and crew.\n\n  Then, shortly after Defense Minister Lloreda's resignation, about 30 \nELN guerrillas invaded a church service in an upper-class neighborhood \nin Cali and abducted over 140 worshipers. In response, the Government \ndeployed more than 3,000 soldiers and policemen to locate them. While \nsome hostages have been released from the hijacking and church \nincidents, approximately 50 are still being held including two \nAmericans.\n  I have outlined, Mr. President, the two main guerrilla groups which \nare a significant threat to Colombia. Unfortunately, however, I have \nnot yet spoken of another ongoing war which poses an additional and \nsubstantial threat--the Colombian paramilitaries. In fact, the \nColombian paramilitaries are also seeking a role at the negotiations \ntable.\n  The Colombian paramilitaries are an umbrella organization of about \n5,000 armed combatants. Their mission has\n\n[[Page S7916]]\n\nbeen to counter the grip of leftist guerrillas. Carlos Castano, the \npowerful leader of the paramilitary umbrella organization United Self-\nDefense Groups of Colombia, has been quoted defending the strategy of \nkilling villagers who are guerrilla supporters and sympathizers.\n  The paramilitaries are funded by wealthy landowners and, in some \ncases, cocaine traffickers. They exercised increasing influence during \n1998, extending their presence into areas previously under guerrilla \ncontrol.\n  The presence of paramilitary groups have driven a wedge in the peace \ntalks because the FARC leadership refuses to negotiate until the \ngovernment effectively clamps down on the right wing gunmen. The \nproblem is that the government also has a problem in trying to control \nthe paramilitaries.\n  In an attempt to become a player at the negotiating table, Castano's \norganization kidnapped a Colombian Senator last month. In fact, Castano \nsaid shortly after the abduction that his aim was to gain political \nrecognition and a place at the negotiating table for his movement. The \nSenator was freed after being held for two weeks. The Senator later \ncommented that Pastrana should eventually include Colombia's \nparamilitary forces in negotiations to end the 35 year civil war. Since \nthe leftist rebels vehemently oppose their participation in the peace \ntalks, prospects for the peace negotiations are complicated even \nfurther.\n  Before I talk about the increasing drug threat from Colombia, let me \nspend a few minutes on the general violence in Colombia.\n  According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Colombia \nled the world in kidnappings in 1998, and may be the most likely place \nin the world to be abducted. The country averages five people a day \nsnatched by guerrillas or other criminals. Guerrillas from the FAR, ELN \nand the smaller Popular Liberation Army accounted for approximately \n1,600 kidnappings of the 2,609 reported in 1998.\n  A report issued by the Colombian Government's anti-kidnapping office \nin May calculated that at least 4,925 people have been abducted since \nJanuary 1996, with the largest total coming in 1998. The problem with \nthis statistic is that many families and businesses prefer to deal \ndirectly with kidnappers and not report abductions to the police. \nHence, this figure is only the official one. It is understandably \ndifficult to count how many kidnappings truly occur in Colombia.\n\n  Imagine, if you will, living in a country where you can't send your \nchild on school field trip; where you can't decide to go out of Bogota \nfor the weekend to visit relatives in a nearby city. In fact, the \nsituation is so grave that you think twice about going to the grocery \nstore or even to a movie.\n  A recent New York Times article described the lives of Colombians and \nthe precautions they must take on a daily basis. The article stated \nthat Colombians are refusing to fly on any airplane that is not a jet. \nThey cite the example of ELN hijacking of a prop plane. The Colombian \nquoted in the article commented that it is almost impossible for \nguerrillas to take over a big jet and make it land at some little \nairstrip out in the jungle.\n  In the week before Easter, a traditional vacation time throughout \nLatin America, travel within Colombia was down 40% over last year, \naccording to a Colombian civic group. With increasing regularity, the \nfive million residents of Bogota are canceling trips to towns that are \nbarely a two hour drive away, while traffic on highways to the \nCaribbean coast has also dropped significantly.\n  Kidnapping is such a significant threat that a Colombian government \nstudy made public estimates that the country's three main guerrilla \ngroups have obtained more than $1.2 billion in kidnapping ransoms in \nrecent years.\n  Mr. President, the situation in Colombia has gotten so bad that the \nState Department recently issued a warning, advising Americans to not \ntravel to Colombia. You see, Colombians are not the only targets in \ntheir country. There have been U.S. casualties as well.\n  In late 1997, the State Department added the FARC to its list of \nterrorist organizations.\n  In January 1999, guerrillas announced that all U.S. military and law \nenforcement personnel in Colombia would be considered legitimate \ntargets to be killed or captured. In late February, the FARC viciously \nmurdered three U.S. human rights workers. This horrific execution met \nwith no reaction from the Clinton Administration. A resolution was \nrecently introduced in the House, calling on the Colombian government \nto pursue the killers, members of the FARC and extradite them to the \nU.S.\n  Colombian terrorists continue to target Americans, kidnapping over a \ndozen U.S. citizens in 1999 so far--this is double the total amount for \n1998. The 1998 State Department Terrorism Report also suggests that \nterrorists also continued to bomb U.S. commercial interests, such as \noil pipelines and small businesses.\n  There has also been much concern that the civil war in Colombia could \nspill over into neighboring countries--including Venezuela, where \nPresident Chavez is alleged to have had contacts in the past with the \nELN. A spill-over into Venezuela would be disastrous for the United \nStates, given that Venezuela is our number one--let me repeat this--\nnumber one supplier of foreign oil. The situation is so grave that \nVenezuela has sent 30,000 troops to the border with Colombia.\n  There has been a recent exodus of Colombians into Venezuela. In a two \nday period recently, over 2,000 Colombians began their exodus to \nVenezuela after death squads massacred about 80 people near a border \ntown. Many of the Colombians were said to be coca farmers.\n  At first, Venezuelan President Chavez said Venezuela was prepared to \noffer the Colombians temporary refuge until they could return safely to \ntheir homes. However, only one day after the recent cross-over began, \nVenezuela had already started repatriating Colombians back to Colombia. \nAnd within a few days, all Colombians have been repatriated.\n  Colombian-Venezuelan relations have been tense. For example, while \nChavez has agreed to play a role in the negotiations, in mid-May Chavez \nannounced he was seeking a direct meeting with FARC commander Manuel \nMarulanda. In fact, two months earlier, he angered President Pastrana \nby suggesting that the FARC's armed struggle was legitimate and \ndeclaring that Venezuela remained ``neutral'' in the conflict.\n  There has also been some concern of a spillover of the conflict into \nEcuador, another nation bordering Colombia. In fact, Ecuadoran \ngovernment officials indicate that rebel forces have crossed over to \ntheir nation, primarily for rest and relaxation. With the end of its \nborder dispute with Peru, Ecuador is in the process of relocating \n10,000 troops to the Colombian border. In addition, Ecuadoran \nintelligence has reportedly periodically taken down some guerrilla \nsupply routes.\n  Colombia also borders Panama, which should be of significant concern \nto our nation. It is a known fact that Colombian rebels have been \ninfiltrating the Darien province in Panama for quite some time in \nsearch of supplies.\n  In late May, hundreds of Panamanians fled their homes near the border \nwith Colombia, fearing a violent clash between Colombian guerrillas and \nparamilitary bounty hunters. Witnesses claim that there were about 500 \nFARC rebels in Panama.\n  Mr. President, this rebel crossing is occurring just 250 miles \nsoutheast of the Panama Canal. And let me remind you that U.S. military \nforces are departing from Panama.\n  The United States should be extremely concerned. The departure of \nU.S. forces could encourage Colombian rebel groups to become more \nactive in the deep, inaccessible rainforests of Panama's Darien region. \nAnd while Panama has increased a border police force to 1,500, they are \nno match to the Colombian rebels. Panama has no military, and our total \nU.S. troop presence is scheduled to depart Panama by the end of this \nyear. We just closed down operations out of Howard Air Force Base in \nMay, and we are about to turn over the Panama Canal and remaining \nmilitary facilities at the end of this century.\n  Mr. President, while the United States is complying with the Panama \nCanal Treaties, in terms of giving Panama the Canal at the end of this \nyear, the treaties state that the United\n\n[[Page S7917]]\n\nStates has the continued responsibility to protect and defend the \nPanama Canal. And the duration of this treaty is indefinite. In the \nevent that something happens to the Panama Canal, just a few hundred \nmiles from Colombia, how would the United States respond then?\n  I have spent most of my time talking about the worsening civil strife \nin Colombia. But I cannot end this speech without talking about the \nfinal war in Colombia. It's the war Americans probably have heard the \nmost about--the war prompted by the fact that Colombia is the world's \nmost important cocaine producer and a leading producer of heroin.\n  According to our State Department, over 75% of the world's cocaine \nHCL is processed in Colombia. 1998 marked the third consecutive year of \nsignificant increase in Colombia coca crop size; recent statistics \nindicate that about 75% of the heroin seized in the northeast United \nStates is of Colombian origin. Colombian heroin is so pure--roughly 80% \nto 90%--that in 1998, the number of heroin overdose cases in the United \nStates went up significantly. In fact, in 1998, the number of heroin \noverdoses in Orlando surpassed the number of homicides.\n  Drug trafficking is profitable, and provides the FARC with the \nlargest share of its income. Sixty percent of FARC fronts are involved \nin the drug trade. About 30% of ELN war fronts are likewise engaged in \ndrug trafficking. This includes extortion/taxation of coca fields and \nyields, precursor chemicals and security of labs and clandestine air \nstrips. The insurgents control the southern rural terrain of Colombia \nwhere the largest density of cocaine fields and production is found.\n  Mr. President, I have outlined a deteriorating situation in Colombia. \nI have spoken to you about Colombia's ongoing and escalating four wars. \nThese are significant issues that have a direct impact on our \nhemisphere and our Nation. The future of Colombia as a unified country, \nand the stability of an entire hemisphere is at risk. The sad reality \nis that our country is not yet making an adequate response to this \ncrucial foreign policy challenge. We are simply not paying attention, \nnor are we adequately responding.\n  U.S. leadership in this Colombian crisis is needed. This is no time \nto keep our backs turned. Continued inattention will only contribute to \ncontinued instability. Like Kosovo, the U.S. should mobilize the \ninternational community to play a role in resolving the Colombian \nconflict. Certainly we should pledge our support to the democratically \nelected Government. We should also be ready to provide other types of \nsupport such as training, equipment, and professional development to \nhelp Colombia overcome these threats to democracy and freedom.\n\n  Finally, we must continue to work to disrupt and dismantle the drug \ntrafficking organizations and to reduce their financial control of \nantidemocratic elements in Colombia.\n  We are doing some things in Colombia. I had the opportunity to see \nthose myself when I traveled there a few months ago. But we simply have \nto do more. We have to become more engaged.\n  I remember President Ronald Reagan's profound wisdom in negotiating \nfrom a position of strength in his efforts to strengthen our military. \nThis strategic vision led to the crumbling ultimately of our \nadversaries. Unfortunately, this dynamic has not yet taken hold in \nColombia.\n  Because of the Colombian Government's weakness, no incentive appears \nto exist for its multiple adversaries to respect and to adhere to any \nagreements. Their only incentive is to extract further concessions from \nthe Government and to further attempt to weaken the Colombian \nGovernment.\n  Before I close, let me quote a passage from a report in Time \nmagazine. I quote:\n\n       The six members of the presidential peace commission did \n     not know where they were headed when their Bell 212 \n     helicopter took off from Bogota at dawn. The pilot had been \n     given the top-secret coordinates minutes before takeoff, but \n     not even he was sure of the destination. Suddenly, the flag \n     of the FARC, the oldest, largest and bloodiest of the \n     country's numerous anti-government guerrilla groups, was \n     sighted in the jungle below. This time, however, the flag \n     signified the making of history, not war. In a small clearing \n     in the Alto de la Mesa rain forest, FARC guerrillas and the \n     government's representatives met to sign a momentous eleven-\n     point cease-fire agreement.\n  While this article seems to depict the present situation in Colombia \nin terms of peace talks, the fact is that it does not. The main reason \nis that there has not yet been a cease-fire agreement as a result of \nthis latest round of talks.\n  Let me repeat that. There has not yet, to this day, been a cease-fire \nagreement as a result of this latest round of talks.\n  The article I quoted appeared in Time magazine's issue dated April \n16, 1984.\n  In April 1984, the then-Colombian President triumphantly announced on \nnational television his Government's formal acceptance of that pact \nwith the FARC guerrillas. He thought that he had negotiated an end to \nthe guerrilla conflict with the FARC leadership.\n  Let me note that there have been numerous other accounts by other \nColombian Presidents throughout the years to negotiate a resolution to \nthe guerrilla wars in Colombia. Each time the peace talks have failed, \nand each time the guerrilla groups have been further strengthened.\n  While the current President of Colombia is negotiating with the very \nsame FARC leader, a few things have changed over the last 15 years. \nBack in 1984, the Time article reported that the FARC consisted of \n2,050 guerrillas backed by an additional 5,000 people in ``civil \ndefense cadres'' spread mainly throughout the countryside. But today \nthe FARC has about 10,000 to 15,000 active combatants--quite a change.\n  In 1994, the ELN had roughly 200 men and the Popular Liberation Army \nhad about 275. The ELN today has between 5,000 and 7,000 troops.\n  It is simply amazing to me what a difference 15 years has made in \nColombia, a difference, unfortunately and tragically, for the worse. We \nhave gone from seeing Colombia's combat-ready guerrilla number in the \n2,000 range--2,000 is what it was--to a situation today where there is \nlikely a guerrilla combatant rebel for every Colombian military \ncombatant person available, a 1-to-1 ratio.\n  My question to this Congress and to this administration is, How can \nwe expect Colombia to overcome these multiple wars? The rebel personnel \nresources have significantly increased since the mid-1980s and are one \nof the main reasons behind this rise in the alliance between the \nguerrillas and the drug traffickers.\n  This strategic alliance, in which each party benefits from the \nother's involvement, makes it very clear that it is extremely difficult \nto separate the drug war from guerrilla and paramilitary wars. That is \nwhy the United States must play a role to help Colombia overcome all of \nits wars--not just the drug dealers. We must understand that our drug \nconsumption only further exacerbates the Colombian crisis. And we must \nbe involved in helping them resolve the four wars I have described.\n  In the 1980s, the United States made a major investment in the \nstruggle for democracy and human rights in Latin America. We pretty \nmuch succeeded. We basically went from a situation a generation or two \nago where half the countries were democratic to a situation today where \nevery country save one is democratic, or is at least moving rapidly \ntowards democracy. We have succeeded.\n  But if we want Latin America to continue to evolve into a stable and \npeaceful trading partner and a friend of the United States, we will \nhave to make a more serious commitment to Colombia. No one wants to see \nColombia devolve into a criminal narcostate. But unless we act soon in \npartnership with the democratically elected Government of Colombia, \nunless we act soon to reverse this democratic death spiral, it is only \na matter of time before Colombia ceases to exist as a sovereign nation \nwith democratic principles.\n  President Ronald Reagan showed profound wisdom in leading this \nhemisphere toward democracy and toward free markets. We must do all we \ncan to make sure that this positive tide is not rolled back for our \nneighbors to the south.\n  I thank the Chair for his indulgence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7917-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7917-S7918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF DR. KENT WYATT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to Dr. Kent Wyatt who \nis\n\n[[Page S7918]]\n\nretiring today after serving as the President of Delta State University \nfor the past 24 years. During his tenure at Delta State, Dr. Wyatt has \nrepeatedly been recognized as one of America's premier higher education \nadministrators.\n  Kent was born in Berea, Kentucky and later moved to Cleveland, \nMississippi. He earned an undergraduate degree in education from Delta \nState and a Masters degree in education from the University of Southern \nMississippi. Kent topped off his formal education at the University of \nMississippi where he received a Doctorate in Education.\n  After completing his doctoral studies at Ole Miss, Kent commenced his \nteaching career back home in Cleveland, Mississippi where he served as \na mathematics teacher, a coach, and then as a principal for the School \nDistrict. Kent soon followed in his father's footsteps, Forest E. \nWyatt, who served as a teacher and the head football coach at Delta \nState University.\n  In 1964, Kent's alma mater, Delta State University, hired him as its \nAlumni Secretary. But, he quickly shifted over to the university's \nmanagement. Recognizing his leadership and vision, Kent was named Delta \nState's fifth President in 1975 after serving six years as assistant to \nthe president.\n  During the last quarter century, Kent has amassed an impressive \nrecord. He continuously emulated ``quality without compromise.'' As a \nresult of his stewardship, Delta State's faculty has grown from 202 to \n328, with all academic programs receiving national accreditation, and \n18 new facilities were built. Since 1975, Delta State's enrollment has \ngrown by 32%. Equally astounding, Kent increased the university's \nfinancial assets by a factor of ten since 1975. A most impressive \nrecord for Dr. Wyatt and Delta State University.\n  Kent's peers in Mississippi and across the nation have repeatedly \ndrawn on his academic leadership. For example, Kent recently served on \nthe Search Committee for the Executive Director of the National \nCollegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and on the NCAA's President's \nCommission.\n  Running a large university would challenge many, but Kent also \nmanaged to serve those off campus too. Kent also served his community \nfor over three decades. He was the President of the Cleveland Lions \nClub as well as the President of the Chamber of Commerce. He also \nserved on the boards of the United Way, Mississippi Economic Council, \nGrenada Banking System, Union Planters Bank of Northwest Mississippi, \nand the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Kent currently serves as \na Deacon at the First Baptist Church.\n  Kent's wife Janice, their children Tara and Elizabeth, as well as \ntheir grandchildren Kent Wyatt Mounger and Collins Hartfield Mounger, \nhave good reasons to be proud of his many accomplishments.\n  As Congress addresses the many challenges facing higher education in \nAmerica today, my colleagues and I can benefit from the many \ncontributions Kent has made in Cleveland, Mississippi. Not only has he \nbeen an inspiration to the more than 15,000 college students who passed \nthrough the halls of Delta State during his tenure, Kent has helped to \nmold the future leaders of this great country.\n  Kent and Janice have chosen to stay in Bolivar County. While he will \nbe missed at Delta State, the town of Cleveland, the County of Bolivar, \nthe State of Mississippi, and Mississippi's Congressional delegation \nare thankful that Kent, a true Delta State Statesman, has chosen to \nremain in his hometown to serve as a continuing inspiration for public \nservice at its best.\n  Mr. President, I want to express to Kent my heartfelt appreciation \nfor everything he has done for his community, our state, and the \nnation. I am hopeful that Kent and Janice will enjoy the next important \nphase of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7918-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7918-S7919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMEMORATION OF U.N. TORTURE VICTIM SUPPORT DAY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this past Saturday was the 2nd annual \nU.N. International Day in Support of Torture Victims and Survivors. The \npractice of torture is one of the most serious human rights abuses of \nour time. According to Amnesty International, torture conducted by \ngovernment security forces, or that is condoned by other government \nofficials occurs in at least 120 countries today. We need look no \nfarther than today's headlines about Turkey, Iraq, Kosovo, China and \nEthiopia to know that we will be dealing with the problems that torture \nvictims face for many years.\n  We can and must do more to stop such horrific acts of torture, and to \ntreat its victims. Focusing on treatment and rehabilitation for torture \nsurvivors is one of the best ways we can manifest our concern for human \nrights worldwide. As our recent intervention in Kosovo to stop a \nhumanitarian crisis demonstrates, both the United States and the \ninternational community have become aware of the need to prevent these \nhuman rights abuses and to punish the perpetrators when abuses take \nplace. Yet, too often we have failed to address the needs of the \nvictims after their rights have been violated. The treatment of torture \nvictims must be a central focus of our efforts to promote human rights.\n  This commitment to protect human rights is one shared by many around \nthe world. In 1984 the U.N. approved the United Nations Convention \nAgainst Torture. The U.S. Senate ratified it in April of 1994. And just \nlast year the Congress enacted the Torture Victims Relief Act which \nauthorizes funds for treatment services for victims of torture in the \nUnited States and abroad. I was pleased to learn that last week the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations recommended that the funds \nauthorized by the act be appropriated in full in the foreign operations \nappropriations bill. Under this recommendation, AID will provide $7.5 \nmillion to support foreign treatment centers and the U.S. will \ncontribute $3 million to the U.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of \nTorture. I hope this recommendation makes it through to the final bill \nwhich goes to the President. While these are significant achievements, \nwe must focus on what more needs to be done.\n  In many countries torture is routinely employed in police stations to \ncoerce confessions or obtain information. Detainees are subjected to \nboth physical and mental abuse. Methods include beatings with sticks \nand whips; kicking with boots; electric shocks; and suspension from one \nor both arms. Victims are also threatened, insulted and humiliated. In \nsome cases, particularly those involving women, victims are stripped, \nexposed to verbal and sexual abuse. Medical treatment is often \nwithheld, sometimes resulting in death.\n  The purpose of torture is intimidation and the total destruction of \nan individual's character. Torture impacts on humanity in profound \nways. The shattering of lives, dispersing of families, and destruction \nof communities all result from this politically-motivated form of \nviolence. The destruction of people's humanity, cultures, and \ntraditions are often the result for both the torturer and the victim of \ntorture.\n  Treating torture victims must be a much more central focus of our \nefforts as we work to promote human rights worldwide. Without active \nprograms of healing and recovery, torture survivors often suffer \ncontinued physical pain, depression and anxiety, intense and incessant \nnightmares, guilt and self loathing. They often report an inability to \nconcentrate or remember. The severity of trauma makes it difficult to \nhold down a job, study for a new profession, or acquire other skills \nneeded for successful adjustment into society.\n\n  Friday morning I met with Sister Dianna Ortiz and several other \ntorture survivors courageous enough to share their stories. They \nrelated to me horrific tales of family displacement, sexual abuse, and \nmental and physical humiliation. Mr. Feltavu Ebba, a survivor from \nEthiopia told me his horrific tale of torture he received solely based \non his ethnic identification. He said:\n\n       I was locked up in a room 4 meters by 4 meters with more \n     than 50 other prisoners. I was not allowed to see my family \n     and relatives for the first six years.\n\n  Needless to say, the damage done to his relationship with his \nchildren can never be repaired. Also, every minute of his existence in \nprison was wrought with emotional and physical pain. He said:\n\n       Again after three years of prison in 1982 I was physically \n     and mentally tortured for a week . . . This time by dipping \n     me head-\n\n[[Page S7919]]\n\n     down in a barrel filled with cold, dirty water and beating \n     under my feet with interwoven electrical wire.\n\n  Another survivor, Monica Feria, told me of her torture in Peru. \nRather than attempt to speak on her behalf, I will let her words speak \nfor themselves.\n\n       We ran for our lives through the ducts that took us to \n     another prison where the male prisoners accused of belonging \n     to the Shining Path were kept. On the way many of us were \n     shot. While crawling I saw bodies that had been blown up, \n     arms, heads, and blood. Everything was covered with that \n     horrible colour of burnt black. As I crawled avoiding the \n     bullets I felt under me dead bodies still warm. The horror . \n     . .\n\n  This is only a fraction of the horrific episodes relayed to me by \nthese courageous survivors. Just last week the New York Times quoted \nthe Human Rights Watch organization as being distressed at the \ncontinued prevalence of torture worldwide.\n  In Minnesota, we began to think about the problem of torture and act \non it, over ten years ago. The Center for Victims of Torture in \nMinneapolis is the only fully-staffed torture treatment facility in the \ncountry and was one of the first in the world; there are now over 200 \ncenters worldwide. The center offers outpatient services which can \ninclude medical treatment, psychotherapy and help gaining economic and \nlegal stability. Its advocacy work also helps to inform people about \nthe problem of torture and the lingering effects it has on victims, and \nways to combat torture worldwide. The Center has treated or provided \nservices to hundreds of people over the last ten years.\n  Some of the often shrill public rhetoric these days seems to argue \nthat we as a nation can no longer afford to remain engaged with the \nworld, or to assist the poor, the elderly, the feeble, refugees, those \nseeking asylum--those most in need of aid who are right here in our \nmidst. The Center for Victims of Torture stands as a repudiation of \nthat idea. Its mission is to rescue and rehabilitate people who have \nbeen crushed by torture, and it has been accomplishing that mission \nadmirably over the last ten years. It is a light of hope in the lives \nof those who have for so long seen only darkness, a darkness brought on \nby the brutal hand of the torturer.\n  I would like to thank the distinguished human rights leaders who have \nhelped me in this fight, including those at the Center for Torture \nVictims in Minneapolis and others such as Sister Ortiz, the Torture \nAbolition and Survivors Support Committee (TASSC), the Congressional \nHuman Rights Caucus, and those in the human rights community here in \nWashington and in Minnesota. Without their energy and skills as \nadvocates for tough U.S. laws which promote respect for \ninternationally-recognized human rights worldwide, the cause of human \nrights here in the U.S. would be seriously diminished. I salute them \ntoday. We recommit ourselves to the aid of torture survivors, and to \nbuilding a world in which torture is relegated to the dark past, and in \nwhich torture treatment programs are made obsolete.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7919-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7919-S7921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE MISSING, EXPLOITED, AND RUNAWAY CHILDREN PROTECTION ACT OF 1999 S. \n                                  249\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I had planned to be giving a statement on \nfinal passage of the ``Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children \nProtection Act of 1999.'' Unfortunately, I cannot do this, because just \nas there was last year, there continues to be a hold up on passing this \nimportant legislation. We could and should have passed this legislation \nlast year. We could and should pass this legislation today.\n  Last year we missed that opportunity when the Republican majority in \nboth Houses of Congress played partisan games and tried to use this \nnoncontroversial authorization bill as a vehicle to insist on \nconferencing a much-criticized Republican juvenile justice bill. That \nprocedural gimmick cost us valuable time to get this legislation \nenacted.\n  The majority was roundly criticized. The Washington Post went so far \nas to call the Republican Majority's short-circuit conference tactic \n``faintly absurd.'' The San Francisco Chronicle used even stronger \nterms, calling it ``sneaky maneuvering and Byzantine procedural \nmoves.'' The Philadelphia Inquirer's reaction to this tactic was: \n``Shame on the House. And shame on the Senate if it approves this bill \nas is, without debate.'' The New York Times labeled this maneuver a \n``stealth assault on juvenile justice.''\n  By contrast to last year, at least in the Senate, procedural ambushes \non juvenile justice legislation have been eschewed and we were given \nthe opportunity last month to have full and fair debate. After \nsignificant improvements through amendments, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile \njustice bill passed the Senate on May 20, 1999 by a strong bipartisan \nvote.\n  Similarly, I am pleased that the Leahy-Hatch substitute to this bill, \nthe Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999, \noverwhelmingly passed the Senate on April 19. In late May, the House of \nRepresentatives followed suit.\n  The House, however, inserted new language, not included in the \nSenate-passed bill. This new language includes two studies and language \nregarding the ``consolidated review of applications\" for grants under \nthe Runaway and Homeless Youth Act.\n  The first study mandates the Secretary of HHS to examine the percent \nof runaways who leave home because of sexual abuse. The study is not \nfunded and sets an unreasonable time frame. The second instructs the \nSecretary of Education to commission a $2.1 million study by the \nNational Academy of Sciences on the antecedents of school violence in \nurban, suburban, and rural schools, including the incidents of school \nviolence that occurred in Pearl, Mississippi; Paducah, Kentucky; \nJonesboro, Arkansas; Springfield, Oregon; Edinboro, Pennsylvania; \nFayetteville, Tennessee; Littleton, Colorado; and Conyers, Georgia. The \nstudy must include the impact of cultural influences and exposure to \nthe media, video games, and the Internet.\n  It is my understanding that this school violence study was slipped \ninto the legislation after the House committee reported the bill. In \nessence this bill seeks to mandate funding from the Department of \nEducation, although this authorizing legislation, and sets an \nunreasonable time frame for a thoughtful study to be conducted. I do \nnot support such efforts to bypass the consideration of the \nAppropriations Committees.\n  The juvenile violence study inserted into S. 249 also duplicates \nnumerous studies in, S. 254, the Senate-passed juvenile justice bill. \nThe studies in S. 254 include:\n  Study of Marketing Practices of Motion Picture, Recording, and Video/\nPersonal Computer Game Industries. The Federal Trade Commission and the \nDepartment of Justice are directed to study the extent of the \nentertainment industry's marketing of unsuitable materials to minors \nand the industry's enforcement of the current rating systems.\n  Study. This section instructs the Comptroller General to conduct a \nstudy on (1) the incidents of school-based violence; (2) impediments to \ncombating school-based violence; (3) promising initiatives for \naddressing school-based violence; and (4) crisis preparedness of school \npersonnel and law enforcement officials.\n  School Violence Research. This section instructs the Attorney General \nto establish a research center that will serve as a clearinghouse for \nschool violence research at the National Center for Rural Law \nEnforcement in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n  National Commission on Character Development. This section creates a \nNational Commission on Character Development to study and make \nrecommendations with respect to the impact of cultural influences on \ndeveloping and instilling character in America's youth.\n  Study of Marketing Practices of the Firearms Industry. This section \ndirects the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General to \nconduct a study of the marketing practices of the firearms industry to \ndetermine the extent to which the firearms industry advertises its \nproducts to juveniles.\n  National Media Campaign Against Violence. This section creates a $25 \nmillion national media campaign targeted to parents and youth to reduce \nand prevent violence by young Americans. The campaign will be operated \nby the National Crime Prevention Council with the consultation of \nnational, statewide or community-based youth organizations.\n\n[[Page S7920]]\n\n  Behavioral and Social Science Research on Youth Violence. This \nsection authorizes the National Institutes of Health, acting through \nthe Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, to conduct a \ncomprehensive study on the causes and prevention of youth violence.\n  National Youth Violence Commission. This subtitle establishes a \nCommission composed of 16 members to conduct a comprehensive factual \nstudy of incidents of youth violence in order to determine the root \ncauses of such violence by studying the involvement of teachers and \nschool administrators, trends in family relationships, alienation of \nyouth from the families and peer groups, availability of firearms to \nyouth, impact of youth violence on youth, effects on youth of \ndepictions of violence in the media, and the availability of \ninformation regarding the construction of weapons. The Commission will \nmake recommendations to the President and Congress to address the \ncauses of youth violence and reduce incidents of youth violence in the \nform of a report which shall be submitted no later than 1 year after \nthe date on which the Commission first meets.\n  The youth violence study inserted into S. 249 by the House also \nduplicates ongoing efforts by President Clinton. In August 1998, the \nDepartments of Justice and Education released ``Early Warning, Timely \nResponse: A Guide to Safe Schools.'' This guide provides schools and \ncommunities with information on how to identify the early warning signs \nand take action steps to prevent and respond to school violence. Every \nschool in the nation received a copy of the guide.\n  In October 1998 at the White House Conference the President released \nthe first Annual Report on School Safety. The report includes an \nanalysis of all existing national school crime data and an overview of \nstate and local crime reporting; examples of schools and strategies \nthat are successfully reducing school violence, drug use and class \ndisruption; actions that parents can take locally to combat school \ncrime; and resources available to schools and communities to help \ncreate safe, disciplined and drug-free schools.\n  On April 1, 1999, a new Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative was \nannounced by Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of Education \nRichard Riley and Surgeon General David Satcher, M.D., to provide 50 \ncommunities with up to $3 million per year for three years to link \nexisting and new services and activities into a comprehensive \ncommunity-wide approach to violence prevention and healthy child \ndevelopment. It is based on evidence that a comprehensive, integrated \ncommunity-wide approach is an effective way to promote healthy \nchildhood development and address the problems of school violence and \ndrug abuse.\n  On June 1, 1999 the President directed the Federal Trade Commission \nand the Department of Justice to conduct a joint study of the marketing \npractices of entertainment industries to determine whether these \nindustries are marketing to children violent and other material that is \nrated for adults.\n  There are many more studies and activities I could list, but I think \nmy point has been made.\n  I regret that the House has again, as in the last Congress, has taken \na clean bill and chosen to add extraneous matters. Rather than allow \nthis tactic to delay passage of this already long-delayed and much-\nneeded authorization for a number of worthwhile programs, I will not \ninsist that the House amendment be stricken at this time. I will look \nto reconsider it in the course of the conference on the S. 254, the \nHatch-Leahy juvenile crime legislation.\n  The other language inserted by the House that causes me concern is \nthe ``consolidated review of grant application.'' In the Leahy-Hatch \nSenate bill we were careful to make clear the continuation of current \nlaw governing the minimum grants available for small States under Basic \nCenter grants program.\n  My concern about the consolidation language, however, has been abated \nafter I received assurances from Secretary Shalala that small States \nwill in no way be disadvantaged from receiving funding at current \nlevels or above. If small States, like Vermont, effectively compete for \nnational competitive grants programs, that is to their additional \nbenefit and will not reduce the small State minimums in important \nprograms like the Basic Center grants program.\n  In order to address my concern, on May 26, I sent a letter to \nSecretary Shalala asking that the Department guarantee that the House \nbill, like the Senate bill, preserves the current funding mechanism \nunder the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. On June 7, through Secretary \nShalala's Assistant Secretary for Legislation, Rich Tarplin, I received \nsuch assurance and with that, I am pleased to be working to expedite \nthe enactment of this legislation.\n  I thank Secretary Shalala and Assistant Secretary Rich Tarplin for \nmaking explicit that small States like Vermont will not be \ndisadvantaged by the language added by the House. In addition, I thank \nBarbara Clark, of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for \nLegislation, for her tireless work over too many years to see through \nthe reauthorization of these programs. I hope all of our efforts are \nrewarded with passage of S. 249 as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of my letter to Secretary Shalala \nand the response that I received be included in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am also disappointed that the House chose \nto scale back the authorization of these program from five years as \npassed by the Senate to four years.\n  The bottom line, however, is that the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act \nand the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children have gone \nwithout authorization for too long. We should pass this legislation \nwithout further delay.\n  I have been able to clear this bill on my side of the aisle. \nUnfortunately, the Republicans have not been able to do the same and \nare, once again, holding up enactment of this legislation. The holdup \non passage of this already long-delayed and much needed authorization \nfor a number of worthwhile programs to provide assistance to at risk \nchildren and their families must be put to an end.\n  The Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999 \nauthorizes a variety of critical programs for our nation's most at risk \nchildren and youth--those who are missing or have been exploited and \nthose who have run away or been forced from home or are homeless. The \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children provides extremely \nworthwhile and effective assistance to children and families facing \ncrises across the U.S. and around the world. In 1998, the National \nCenter helped law enforcement officers locate over 5,000 missing \nchildren. They also handled 132,357 telephone calls to their hotline, \nwhich included calls to report a missing child, to request information \nor assistance and to provide leads on missing or potentially exploited \nchildren. This figure includes 10,904 reported leads or sightings of \nmissing children, an increase of 25 percent over such leads in 1997.\n  Since 1984, the National Center has helped investigate more than 80 \ncases involving Vermont children who have been reported missing. They \nhave had extraordinary success in resolving these cases, some of which \nhave taken several years and have involved out of state or \ninternational negotiations. I want to thank Ernie Allen and all of the \ndedicated employees and volunteers associated with the National Center \nfor their help in these matters.\n  The National Center serves a critical role as a clearinghouse of \nresources and information for both family members and law enforcement \nofficers. They have developed a network of hotels and restaurants which \nprovides free services to parents in search of their children and have \nalso developed extensive training programs. The National Center has \ntrained 728 sheriffs and police chiefs from across the U.S. in recent \nyears, including police chiefs from Dover, Hartford, Brattleboro and \nWinooski, Vermont, as well as members of the Vermont State Police. They \nhave trained an additional 150,000 other officers in child sexual \nexploitation and the detection of missing children since 1984.\n  The National Center is also a leader in reducing the number of infant \nabductions by educating nurses, security staffs and hospitals. A \nseminar held in Vermont, trained 250 nurses and security personnel, \nshould provide greater\n\n[[Page S7921]]\n\npeace of mind to new parents in my home State.\n  Most recently, they have expanded their role in combating the sexual \nexploitation of children by going on-line. Last year, they launched \ntheir ``CyberTipline'' which allows Internet users to report suspicious \nactivities linked to the Internet, including child pornography and the \npotential enticement of children on-line. In the second half of 1998, \nthey received over 4,000 leads from the CyberTipline which resulted in \nnumerous arrests. I applaud the ongoing work of the Center and hope \nthat we will promptly pass this bill so that they can proceed with \ntheir important activities with fewer funding concerns.\n  The National Center established an international division some time \nago and has been working to fulfil the Hague Convention on the Civil \nAspects of International Child Abduction. Last year the National Center \nheld a conference on international concerns with child abductions and \ninternational custody battles between separated parents from different \ncountries.\n  The other important piece of this legislation is the reauthorization \nof the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act which distributes funding to \nlocal community programs on the front lines assisting the approximately \n1.3 million children and youth each year who are homeless or have left \nor been forced from their families for a variety of reasons. Those who \nprovide services pursuant to these programs and those who are the \nbeneficiaries of those services are far too important to be left \nhanging. In a Congress in which the budget and appropriations processes \nhave given way to short-lived spending authority, they all deserve the \nreassurance of reauthorization and a commitment to funding. Only then \nwill our State youth service bureaus and other shelter and service \nproviders be able plan, design and implement the local programs \nnecessary to make the goals of the Act a reality.\n  In 1974, Congress passed the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act as Title \nIII of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The \ninclusion of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act in this legislation \nrecognized that young people who were effectively homeless were in need \nof shelter, guidance and supervision, rather than punishment, and \nshould be united with their families wherever possible.\n  Since 1974, the programs that make up the Runaway and Homeless Youth \nAct have evolved to meet the complex problems faced by our young \npeople, their families and our communities. Over the last decade, as a \nnation, we have witnessed an increase in teen pregnancy rates, drug and \nalcohol abuse beginning as early as grade school, child physical and \nsexual abuse, and a soaring youth suicide rate.\n  Since 1989, the transitional living program has been part of the \nRunaway and Homeless Youth Act. This program, which was developed by my \nformer colleague Senator Simon, has filled a gap in the needs of older \nyouth to help them make the transition to independent living \nsituations.\n  The majority of these program in Vermont are run by the Vermont \nCoalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth. The Vermont Coalition is a \ncommunity-based network comprised of member programs that provide \ncrisis response, emergency shelter, counseling, and other services to \ntroubled youth throughout Vermont counties.\n  The programs we are seeking to reauthorize include those directed at \nyoung people who have had some kind of alcohol or other drug problem. \nThe isolation in rural areas can lead to serious substance abuse \nproblems. It is difficult to reach young people in rural areas and it \nis difficult for them to find the services they need. In Vermont, these \ndrug abuse prevention programs provide essential outreach services.\n  Service providers are being challenged as never before with an \nincreasingly complex set of problems affecting young people and their \nfamilies. Now is not the time to abandon them. There is consensus among \nservices providers that young people seeking services and their \nfamilies are increasingly more troubled--as evidenced by reports of \nfamily violence, substance abuse and the effects of an array of \neconomic pressures. These services may well be the key to breaking \nthrough the isolation of street youth, their mistrust of adults, and \ntheir reluctance to get involved with public or private providers.\n  The programs embodied in S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway \nChildren Protection Act, are important and should not once again be \nheld hostage to the controversial debate on juvenile crime.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 1999.\n     Hon. Donna Shalala,\n     Secretary of Health and Human Services,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Secretary Shalala: I am pleased that we are close to \n     enactment of S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway \n     Children Protection Act of 1999, which will reauthorize \n     programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) and \n     authorize funding for the National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children. The Senate passed the Leahy-Hatch \n     substitute to S. 249 on April 19, by unanimous consent. \n     Yesterday, the House passed its version of this legislation.\n       I am concerned about language inserted into the bill during \n     House consideration upon which the Senate was not consulted. \n     That language provides for a ``consolidated review of \n     applications'' of RHYA grants. Before agreeing to the new \n     language, I need to be assured that this could in no way be \n     construed as consolidating any of the RHYA programs under a \n     single formula allocation.\n       As you know, under the RHYA, each year each State is \n     awarded at a minimum $100,000 for housing and crisis services \n     under the Basic Center grant program. Effective community-\n     based programs around the country can also apply directly for \n     the funding available for the Transitional Living Program and \n     the Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach grants.\n       I hope that you can clarify that the new language inserted \n     by House will do noting to collapse the distinct programs \n     authorized under the RHYA. These programs are very important \n     and I would like to see the legislation passed without \n     further delay.\n       I have been working since 1996 to enact this reauthorizing \n     legislation. I worked to have the Senate pass this \n     legislation during the last Congress and again earlier this \n     year. With your assurance that Vermont and other small states \n     will not be disadvantaged by the language inserted by the \n     House in competing for national grant funding, I will seek to \n     expedite enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Health &\n\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 1999.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Leahy: You have asked us to consider the \n     impact of certain language recently inserted into the House \n     version of S. 249, the ``Missing, Exploited, and Runaway \n     Children Act of 1999''. Specifically, you have asked us to \n     consider whether proposed section 385, Consolidated Review of \n     Applications, will adversely affect the eligibility of small \n     States to receive Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) \n     funding above the minimum grant allotment of the RHYA Basic \n     Center Grant program.\n       I am advised by General Counsel that currently the \n     Secretary has wide statutory discretion to prescribe the \n     procedures which will be used in awarding various grants \n     under the RHYA. The Secretary presently exercises this \n     discretion by choosing to include in a consolidated grant \n     announcement several discrete funding opportunities with \n     distinct application requirements. After studying the \n     pertinent language in S. 249, General Counsel has concluded \n     that the proposed legislation provides for a similar level of \n     discretion with respect to procedures to be used for various \n     grant awards under the RHYA. Therefore, since the proposed \n     legislation does not require the Secretary to change in any \n     way her current procedures for awarding RHYA grants, it will \n     not require the Secretary to commingle the current separate \n     and discrete RHYA funding opportunities so as to adversely \n     affect the eligibility of small States to receive RHYA \n     funding above the minimum grant allotment of the RHYA Basic \n     Center grant program.\n       I hope this information is helpful to you as you proceed \n     with final consideration of S. 249. The Department deeply \n     appreciates all your efforts to reauthorize the Runaway and \n     Homeless Youth Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard J. Tarplin,\n     Assistant Secretary for Legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7921-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7921-S7923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AN EFFORT TO RAISE THE CAFE STANDARDS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue of \ncritical importance to the families in my State. Throughout Michigan, \nmen and women are working hard every day to produce the cars that make \nour economy and our Nation move. They and their families depend on the \njobs produced by our automobile manufacturing industry, just as the \nrest of us can depend on the cars they produce.\n\n[[Page S7922]]\n\n  But those jobs in Michigan's economy are jeopardized by efforts to \nincrease the standards for Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE. I \nhave come to the floor today because I want to make certain that my \ncolleagues are aware of the extremely serious impact of increased CAFE \nstandards, not just on Michigan but on every State in the Union. I also \npoint out that these punitive measures will be ineffective and fly in \nthe face of ongoing efforts on the part of our automakers to increase \nfuel economy, efforts that promise to produce fruit in the very near \nfuture.\n  The Federal Government currently mandates that auto manufacturers \nmandate a fuel economy of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 20.7 miles \nper gallon for sports utility vehicles and light trucks.\n  Since 1995, Congress has wisely refused to allow the Federal \nbureaucracy to unilaterally increase these standards. We have \nrecognized that it is our duty as legislators to make policy in this \nimportant area of economic and environmental concern.\n  Now, however, I understand that a number of colleagues are calling \nfor an end to this congressional authority. They are calling on the \nadministration to unilaterally increase CAFE requirements for sports \nutility vehicles and light trucks to 27.5 miles per gallon.\n  This action is misguided. It will hurt the working families of \nMichigan. It will undermine American competitiveness. I want to put the \nSenate on notice that I will use every legislative means at my disposal \nto see that it does not happen.\n  CAFE requirements costs jobs with few tangible positive affects. It \nreally is that simple.\n  Let me explain what I mean.\n  To meet increased CAFE requirements, SUVs and light trucks would have \nto be dramatically reengineered. Auto makers would be forced to \nimplement and design radically new engine and autobody changes. Such \nchanges would be enormously challenging, and would be reflected in \ndecreased power and carrying capacity, coupled with an increase in \nprice. The result would be a less desirable automobile. It would spell \nthe doom of the line vehicles which are largely responsible for the \nresurgence and continued success of American automobile industry.\n  Of course, this is precisely the goal of CAFE advocates: reduced \npublic demand and consumption of this line of vehicle, but it is an \nunwise course.\n  A government engineered campaign to steer the public away from the \nsport utility market, one which the U.S. producers dominate, will also \nbe of enormous benefit to overseas competitors.\n  The fact is, the U.S. dominates the light truck market because sky-\nhigh gasoline prices in countries such as Japan have forced foreign \nauto makers to make smaller, lighter cars.\n  This matters because CAFE requirements are averaged over a producers \nentire fleet of vehicles. Since the Japanese auto producers produce \nrelatively few light truck models, these producers will have to make no \nchanges in vehicle capacity or production in order to meet U.S. CAFE \nrequirements.\n  Thus, foreign producers would avoid the cost and challenge of \nmodifying their fleet fuel economy averages. And that means the \ngovernment, not the market, will have placed an uneven burden on \nAmerican workers.\n  Consumers also suffer when their choices are narrowed. And auto \nmakers and their employees suffer when they are forced to make cars the \npublic simply does not want.\n  In a statement before the Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, Dr. Marina Whitman of General Motors notes that in \n1982: ``we were forced to close two assembly plants which had been \nfully converted to produce our new, highly fuel-efficient compact and \nmid-size cars. The cost of these conversions was $130 million, but the \nplants were closed because demand for those cars did not develop during \na period of sharply declining gasoline prices.''\n  This story could be repeated for every major American automaker, Mr. \nPresident. And the effects on our overall economy have been \ndevastating.\n  During this time of economic prosperity, it is easy for some people \nto forget the massive dislocation of workers which occurred during the \n1970's and 1980's.\n  But we should keep in mind, not only the thousands of jobs in the \nauto manufacturing industry that were lost during this period, but also \nthe massive impact this downturn in a key industry had on our economy \nas a whole.\n  The story of plant closings were devastating for domestic automakers \nback in the 1970s and 1980s.\n  It is unfortunately the case, sometimes when we are in a period of \neconomic prosperity, as we are now, it is easy to forget the massive \ndislocation of workers which did occur back at that time.\n  We should keep in mind not only the thousands of jobs in the auto \nmanufacturing industry that were lost during that period, but also the \nmassive impact that downturn in a key industry had on our economy.\n  The American auto industry accounts for one in seven U.S. jobs. \nSteel, transportation, electronics, literally dozens of industries \nemploying thousands upon thousands of Americans depend on the health of \nour auto industry.\n  If we do again to our auto industry what was done to it during the \n1970's and 1980's, we will quickly see our current prosperity turn to \nan era of significant unemployment, in my judgment.\n  Mr. President, the last thing our economy and our people need is a \nrepeat of those hard times.\n  Our automakers simply cannot afford to pay the fines imposed on them \nif they fail to reach CAFE standards, or to build cars that Americans \nwill not buy. In either case the real victims are American workers and \nconsumers.\n  Nor should we forget, Mr. President, that American automakers are \ninvesting almost $1 billion every year in research to develop more fuel \nefficient vehicles.\n  Indeed, we do not need to turn to the punitive, disruptive methods of \nCAFE standards to increase fuel economy for American vehicles. \nEspecially since domestic manufacturers have increased passenger car \nfuel economy 108 percent and light truck fuel economy almost 60 percent \nsince the mid-1970s.\n  And more progress will soon be realized. Since 1993, the Partnership \nfor a New Generation of Vehicles has brought together government \nagencies and the auto industry to conduct joint research--research that \nis making significant progress and will bridge the gap to real world \napplications after 2000.\n  By enhancing research cooperation, PNGV will help our auto industry \ndevelop vehicles that are more easily recyclable, have lower emissions, \nand can achieve up to triple the fuel efficiency of today's midsize \nfamily sedans. All this while producing cars that retain performance, \nutility, safety and economy.\n  By next year, Mr. President, technologies developed in the PNGV \nprogram will be incorporated into concept vehicles. These vehicles will \nhelp the auto industry determine their functional benefits, develop \nproduction infrastructure and determine commercial viability.\n  By 2004 we will have production-feasible prototypes that can be \nbrought to mass production within 3-5 years.\n  Direct-injection engines, new forms of fuel cells, lithium batteries, \nnew polymers, and many other technological developments are now in the \nworks. They are in the works thanks to a strategy that places \ncooperation over punitive government mandates.\n  We have made solid progress, Mr. President. Progress toward making \nvehicles that achieve greater fuel economy without sacrificing the \nqualities consumers demand.\n  And we should remember, Mr. President, that we can remain competitive \nand retain American jobs only if people will actually buy the vehicles \nour industry produces.\n  Cooperation will produce the results we need. New punitive mandates \nwill produce an economic downside none of us want to see.\n  Again, I will use every legislative means at my disposal as a U.S. \nSenator to stop bills or amendments to increase CAFE standards. I urge \nmy colleagues to reject this misguided attempt to increase the \ndestructive CAFE requirements.\n  As the son of a man would worked as a UAW member on the line for \nabout 20 years of his life, and the son-in-law of a man who did it for \n39 years in the State of Michigan, my family understands, as do \nthousands of other families in our State, exactly what happens\n\n[[Page S7923]]\n\nwhen people stop buying American-made cars. People in our State and \npeople in other States start to lose their jobs.\n  We don't want that to happen. We can achieve the twin goals of \nkeeping people at work and producing more fuel-efficient vehicles if we \ncontinue the course that has been working. The development, the \nresearch, the technology, which the Federal Government has participated \nin is going to produce the success we want. We can do it without \ngovernment-imposed mandates of people losing their jobs.\n  This Senator plans to fight in every way he can to make sure that is \nthe course we follow.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7923-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7923-S7924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO GENERAL CHARLES C. KRULAK, USMC\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a truly \ndistinguished officer, gentleman, and patriot: General Charles C. \nKrulak, Commandant, United States Marine Corps. I do so, with humility \nand respect, on behalf of the six members of the Senate who served in \nthe Marine Corps. Although today marks the end of his remarkable \nuniformed career, his legacy will live on throughout the Corps' history \nas a ``guide-on'' for future marines.\n  Today also marks the first time in 70 years that a Krulak will not be \nprivileged to be in the ranks of the United States Marine Corps. \nGeneral Krulak's father, General V.H. ``Brute'' Krulak, himself a \nlegendary officer, served with distinction in three wars ultimately \nachieving the rank of Lieutenant General. All three of General \n``Brute'' Krulak's sons graduated from the United States Naval Academy, \nbut it was his son Charles, or Chuck, that followed very closely in his \nfather's foot steps.\n  Mr. President, during the past four years, I have had the distinct \nhonor and pleasure of working very closely with General Chuck Krulak. I \nfirst met General Krulak during an inspection tour in Vietnam where, as \na young Captain, he had been wounded and was being evacuated. We later \nreminisced about that moment, which bonded us together forever, during \nhis first courtesy call to me as the new Commandant of the Marine \nCorps. Today at the Change of Command, fittingly held on the historic \ngrounds of the 8th and I Marine Corps Barracks, General Krulak, during \nhis final address, recognized Congress, as did his father, that it was \nthe Congress that created the Marine Corps and then saved the Marine \nCorps when its very existence was threatened by a former President, so \nmany years ago. He then proclaimed that Congress will always preserve \nthe Corps. He is correct!\n  I believe General Krulak embodies the very core values that reflect \nthe Marine Corps' deepest convictions: Honor, Courage, and Commitment. \nAfter 35 years of service, he remains passionate about his Marine Corps \nand his marines. In a farewell address to the Corps, General Krulak \narticulated his respect and understanding of the selflessness and pride \nof the many Marines he had known throughout his life. He spoke of the \nethos of the corps and Touchstones of Valor and Values. Mr. President, \nI submit General Krulak's farewell address to the Corps in the record \nof the proceedings of the Senate as part of my tribute today.\n  I urge my colleagues to read his address and think about the young \nmen and women Marines who so honorably serve everyday, everywhere \naround the world to protect this great nation.\n  General, as a former Marine myself, I salute you for a job \nexceedingly well done! You are a true patriot and the world is a better \nplace because of your dedication to and belief in . . . Honor, Courage, \nand Commitment. Semper Fi.\n\n                 [From Leatherneck Magazine, June 1999]\n\n                        A Farewell to the Corps\n\n                      (By Gen. Charles C. Krulak)\n\n       From my earliest days, I was always awed by the character \n     of the Marine Corps, by the passion and love that inspired \n     the sacrifices of Marines like my father and his friends. As \n     a young boy, I admired the warriors and thinkers who joined \n     our family for a meal or a visit . . . Marines like ``Howlin' \n     Mad'' Smith, Lemuel C. Shepherd, Gerald C. Thomas, and Keith \n     B. McCutcheon. I wondered about the source of their pride, \n     their selflessness, and their sense of purpose. Now, at the \n     twilight of my career, I understand those Marines. I know \n     that they were driven by love for the institution to which \n     they had dedicated their lives and by the awesome \n     responsibility they felt to the Marines who shared their \n     devotion and sacrifice. Today, that same motivation burns \n     deep within the heart of each of us. The ethos of our Corps, \n     purchased so dearly by these heroes of old, reaches into our \n     souls and challenges us to strive tirelessly for excellence \n     in all that we do. It profoundly influences the actions of \n     every Marine that has ever stood on the yellow footprints at \n     our Recruit Depots or taken the oath as an Officer of \n     Marines.\n       The ethos of our Corps is that of the warrior. It is \n     defined by two simple qualities . . . our two touchstones. \n     The first is our Touchstone of Valor. When we are summoned to \n     battle, we don our helmets and flak jackets; we march to the \n     sound of the guns; we fight and we win--Guaranteed. The \n     second is our Touchstone of Values. We hold ourselves and our \n     institution to the highest standards . . . to our core values \n     of Honor, Courage, and Commitment. These two Touchstones are \n     inextricably and forever linked. They form the bedrock of our \n     success and, indeed, of our very existence.\n       Our Touchstone of Valor is the honor roll of our Corps' \n     history. Bladensburg, Bull Run, Cuzco Well, Belleau Wood, \n     Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Iwo Jima, Inchon, the Chosin Reservoir, \n     Hue City, Kuwait . . . the blood and sacrifice of Marines in \n     these battles, and countless others, have been commemorated \n     in gilded script and etched forever on the black granite base \n     of the Marine Corps War Memorial. The names of these places \n     now serve as constant reminders of our sacred responsibility \n     to our Nation and to those whose sacrifices have earned the \n     Marine Corps a place among the most honored of military \n     organizations. The memory of the Marines who fought in these \n     battles lives in us and in the core values of our precious \n     Corps.\n       To Marines, Honor, Courage, and Commitment are not simply \n     words or a bumper sticker slogan. They reflect our deepest \n     convictions and dramatically shape everything that we do. \n     They are central to our efforts to ``Make Marines,'' men and \n     women of character who can be entrusted to safeguard our \n     Nation and its ideals in the most demanding of environments. \n     We imbue Marines with our core values from their first \n     moments in our Corps because we know that Marines, not \n     weapons, win battles. We also know that success on the \n     battlefield and the support of the citizens whose interests \n     we represent depend on our ability to make moral and ethical \n     decisions under the extreme stress of combat . . . or in the \n     conduct of our daily lives.\n       As an institution, we have had to fight hard to maintain \n     our standards. To some, they may seem old-fashioned, out-of-\n     step with society, or perhaps even ``extremist,'' but we know \n     that our high standards are the lifeblood of the Corps, so we \n     have held the line! In this regard, what individual Marines \n     are doing everyday counts far more than anything that is done \n     in Washington. The standards of our Corps are not simply \n     maintained by generals, colonels, and sergeants major, but, \n     far more importantly, by leaders throughout the Corps, at \n     every level. The Marine conviction that Semper Fidelis is a \n     way of life, not just a motto, speaks powerfully to the \n     citizens that we serve. It also unites us with our fellow \n     Marines, past and present--inspiring us to push harder, to \n     reach further, and to reject the very notion of failure of \n     compromise.\n       Sustained and strengthened by the ethos of our Corps, you \n     have accomplished a great deal during the past four years. I \n     have been humbled to be part of your achievements and witness \n     to your selfless devotion. Time and again, Marines \n     distinguished themselves in contingencies around the world, \n     across the spectrum of conflict. Marines from across the \n     Total Force were the first to fight, the first to help and \n     the first to show America's flag--consistently demonstrating \n     our resolve and readiness to win when called to action. With \n     the involvement of the Fleet Marine Force and input from the \n     entire Corps, the Warfighting Laboratory has looked hard at \n     the 21st Century strategic environment. Marines ``stole a \n     march'' on change by testing new concepts and emerging \n     technologies, exploring new tools for developing leaders and \n     decision makers, and experimenting in the ``Three Block \n     War.'' Our recruiters, drill instructors, and small-unit \n     leaders have implemented the Transformation Process and are \n     recruiting, training, and developing the ``Strategic \n     Corporals'' for tomorrow's conflicts. Led by Marines at the \n     Combat Development Command, we have deepened our \n     understanding of Operational Maneuver From The Sea (OMFTS), \n     its enabling concepts and technologies, as well as its many \n     challenges. The men and women serving in the many thankless \n     billets at Headquarters Marine Corps and in the joint arena \n     have developed and articulated our requirements for the \n     future and have secured the resources to translate OMFTS into \n     a reality. Our supporting establishment, at every post and \n     station, has epitomized selflessness and dedication while \n     providing for our readiness requirements. All these things \n     are important--and they are the accomplishments of every \n     Marine. None of them, however, are as significant as \n     maintaining our hands on the twin Touchstones of our Corps.\n       The words of my father ring as true today as when he first \n     wrote them over fifty years ago. ``We exist today--we \n     flourish today--not because of what we know we are, or what \n     we know we can do, but because of what the grassroots of our \n     country believes we are and believes we can do . . . The \n     American people\n\n[[Page S7924]]\n\n     believe that Marines are downright good for the country; that \n     the Marines are masters of a form of unfailing alchemy which \n     converts unoriented youths into proud, self-reliant stable \n     citizens--citizens into whose hands the nation's affairs may \n     safely be entrusted . . . And, likewise, should the people \n     ever lose that conviction--as a result of our failure to meet \n     their high--almost spiritual--standards, the Marine Corps \n     will quickly disappear.''\n       May God bless each and every one of you and may God bless \n     our Corps!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7924-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONFERENCE OF MAYORS ENDORSE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the United States Conference of Mayors \nrecently gave its ringing endorsement to an increase in the minimum \nwage. On June 15, at their annual conference in New Orleans, the mayors \nunanimously adopted a resolution calling for such an increase.\n  The resolution was sponsored by Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston, who \nis renowned for his leadership on behalf of working families in our \ncity, and I commend Mayor Menino for this important and constructive \ninitiation.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Mayor Menino, the Conference of Mayors \nhas highlighted the needs and concerns of America's workers. The \nadoption of the Mayors' resolution makes it all the more important for \nCongress to act, and to act this year.\n  Mayors are on the front lines at the local level. They know the day-\nto-day realities of the lives of working Americans. They have seen \nfirsthand how the decrease in value of the minimum wage leaves workers \nunable to support their families. By next year, the real value of the \nminimum wage will have dropped by $2.50 an hour from its peak 30 years \nago. For a generation, we have allowed the value of the minimum wage to \ndecline unfairly at the expense of millions of hard working American \nmen and women and their families.\n  The unfortunate reality is that in 1999, large numbers of Americans \nwork 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, yet still can't support their \nfamilies. Their wages don't enable them to put food on the table or a \nreasonable roof over their heads. A minimum wage worker earns $10,712 a \nyear--$3,100 below the poverty line for a family of three.\n  Every day, working families across the country are forced to turn to \nemergency food assistance to supplement their diets, and then to \nemergency shelters for a place to sleep. A 1998 U.S. Conference of \nMayors survey found that 61% of people requesting emergency food \nassistance were families--parents and their children. The majority of \ncities also reported an increase in requests for emergency shelter by \nhomeless parents with children. As the Mayors' survey emphasized, these \nare working Americans, yet they are not earning enough to make ends \nmeet.\n  The majority of minimum wage workers are adults struggling to achieve \na decent standard of living. Instead of enabling workers to reach this \ngoal that all families deserve, today's minimum wage tramples on that \ndream for a better life.\n  Now is the time to raise the minimum wage. The country's economy is \nsoaring to new heights and setting new records for growth and \nprosperity. The economy is the best in decades, and yet millions of \nAmerica's hardest workers are not sharing in this prosperity. The Dow \nJones Average is touching 11,000. The highest compensated CEO in 1998 \nwas paid $117 million. But minimum wage workers still can't lift their \nfamilies out of poverty.\n  Minimum wage workers deserve better. They serve our food, take care \nof our children, clean our office buildings, and perform countless \nother basic jobs. When hard working Americans put in a full day's work \nyear round, they deserve a fair share of the nation's prosperity.\n  Over 11 million workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum \nwage. They should not have to rely on food aid or shelters.\n  Mayor Menino and mayors across America want action, Congress should \nheed their call to action and raise the minimum wage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of Mayor Menino's resolution, \nadopted unanimously by the Conference of Mayors, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Resolution No. 14\n\n     (Submitted by the Honorable Thomas M. Menino, Mayor of Boston)\n\n\n              federal minimum hourly wage rate adjustment\n\n       Whereas, the current federal minimum hourly wage rate is \n     inadequate to raise families out of poverty; and\n       Whereas, the real value of the minimum wage continues to \n     fall short since its highest level in 1968; and\n       Whereas, the purchasing power of the minimum wage continues \n     to fall short and fails to allow families to make ends meet; \n     and\n       Whereas, millions of workers paid by the hour earn at or \n     below minimum wage and the majority of minimum wage workers \n     are adults; and\n       Whereas, the poverty line for a family of four leaves many \n     minimum wage earners unable to survive and they are the sole \n     breadwinners for their households; and\n       Whereas, the majority of the average share of household \n     income is earned by a minimum wage worker; and\n       Whereas, the income disparities between the races have been \n     widening, not narrowing; and\n       Whereas, the minimum wage is one factor in these wide \n     income disparities, as minorities work disproportionately in \n     minimum wage jobs; and\n       Whereas, these minimum wage jobs often lack medical, sick \n     or vacation leave, other benefits and job security; and\n       Whereas, these minimum wage jobs are a major factor in the \n     decision of millions of workers who would likely drop out of \n     the labor force because they see no future in such \n     employment, but there are no other alternatives to raise a \n     family; and\n       Whereas, many citizens who cannot survive on minimum wage \n     seek alternatives outside the traditional job market that \n     may, at time, be destructive to them, their families, and the \n     total society; and\n       Whereas, studies have shown that raising the minimum wage \n     does not result in job losses.\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the federal minimum \n     hourly wage rate should be increased to encourage \n     significantly greater labor force participation and enable \n     minimum wage job holders to support themselves and their \n     families at income levels above the nationally defined \n     poverty level.\n       Projected Cost: Unknown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7924-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE INACTION ON THE COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support \nfor the Child Survival and Disease Program Fund. Last year Congress, \nallocated $650 million plus $50 million in supplemental emergency funds \nto the Child Survival and Disease Program Fund for Fiscal Year 1999. As \nin the past, House Subcommittee Chairman Callahan has taken the lead in \nprotecting these child survival programs and I commend him for his \nleadership on this issue. For FY 2000 the Clinton Administration, \nhowever, has budgeted $40 million below the $700 million allocated last \nyear. In order to preserve the benefits of these important programs for \nchildren worldwide, as we have done in the past, we should accept in \nconference the House language that Chairman Callahan proposes.\n  It is a tragedy that millions of children die each year from disease, \nmalnutrition, and other consequences of poverty that are both \npreventable and\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\ntreatable. The programs of the Child Survival Fund, which are intended \nto reduce infant mortality and improve the health and nutrition of \nchildren, address the various problems of young people struggling to \nsurvive in developing countries. It places a priority on the needs of \nthe more than 100 million children worldwide who are displaced and/or \nhave become orphans.\n  The Child Survival and Disease Programs Fund includes initiatives to \ncurb the resurgence of communicable diseases such as malaria and \ntuberculosis. According to the World Health Organization, in 1999 \nalone, more children will die of tuberculosis than in any other year in \nhistory. In the underdeveloped world, the Child Survival and Disease \nPrograms Fund works towards eradicating polio as well as preventing and \ncontrolling the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n  Aside from addressing issues of health, the Child Survival and \nDisease Programs Fund also supports basic education programs. An \ninvestment in education yields one of the highest social and economic \nrates of return--because it gives children the necessary tools to \nbecome self-sufficient adults. According to the World Bank, each \nadditional year of primary and secondary schooling results in a 10-20% \nwage increase. Unfortunately, there are still 130 million primary aged \nchildren who are not attending any school, 2/3 of those children are \ngirls.\n  The programs supported by the Child Survival and Disease Programs \nFund are effective because they save three million lives each year \nthrough immunizations, vitamin supplementation, oral rehydration \ntherapy, and the treatment of childhood respiratory infections, which \nare the second largest killer of children on earth. If every child \nreceived vaccinations, an additional two million children each year \nwould be saved from these terminal diseases. Eliminating the symptoms \nand causes of this poverty is not only the humane thing to do--it is \nalso a necessary prerequisite for global stability and prosperity.\n  In my view, Congress needs to maintain its support for these valuable \nprograms. It is my hope that the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee \nwill accept the proposed House language. The Child Survival and Disease \nPrograms are effective and are important. They should be continued.\n  I see the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee on \nthe floor and urge his continued support for that program.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his statement. I \nhave listened very carefully to his remarks, and I commend him for his \ntireless efforts in supporting children's causes, here in the United \nStates and throughout the world. I would like to assure him that I will \ngive every possible consideration to his request when we go to \nconference.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my distinguished friend from Kentucky, and I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7925-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7925-S7926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE MILITARY AND EXTRATER-RITORIAL JURISDICTION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

S. 768 establishes authority for Federal jurisdiction \nover crimes committed by individuals accompanying our military overseas \nand court-martial jurisdiction over Department of Defense employees and \ncontractors accompanying the Armed Forces on contingency missions \noutside the United States during times of war or national emergency \ndeclared by the President or the Congress.\n  Civilians accompanying the Armed Forces have been subject to court-\nmartial jurisdiction when ``accompanying or serving with the Armies of \nthe United States in the field'' since the Revolutionary War. See \nMcCune v. Kilpatrick, 53 F. Supp. 80, 84 (E.D. Va. 1943). It is only \nsince the start of the Cold War that American troops, accompanied by \ncivilian dependents and employees, have been stationed overseas in \npeace time. Provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice provide \nfor the court-martial of civilians accused of crimes while accompanying \nthe armed forces in times of peace or war. The provisions allowing for \npeace time court-martial of civilians were found unconstitutional by a \nseries of Supreme Court cases beginning with Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 \n(1957). With foreign nations often not interested in prosecuting crimes \nagainst Americans, particularly when committed by an American, the \nresult is a jurisdictional ``gap'' that allows some civilians to \nliterally get away with murder.\n  A report by the Overseas Jurisdiction Advisory Committee submitted to \nCongress in 1997, cited cases in which host countries declined to \nprosecute serious crimes committed by civilians accompanying our Armed \nForces. These cases involved the sexual molestation of dependent girls, \nthe stabbing of a serviceman and drug trafficking to soldiers. The \nindividuals who committed these crimes against service men and women or \ntheir dependents were not prosecuted in the host country and were free \nto return to the United States and continue their lives as if the \nincidents had never occurred. The victims of these awful crimes are \nleft with no redress for the suffering they endured.\n  This inability to exercise Federal jurisdiction over individuals \naccompanying our armed forces overseas has caused problems. During the \nVietnam War, Federal jurisdiction over civilians was not permissible \nsince war was never declared by the Congress. Major General George S. \nPrugh said, in his text on legal issues arising during the Vietnam War, \nthat the inability to discipline civilians ``became a cause for major \nconcern to the U.S. command.''\n  More recently, Operation Desert Storm involved the deployment of \n4,500 Department of Defense civilians and at least 3,000 contractor \nemployees. Similarly large deployments of civilians have been repeated \nin contingency operations in Somalia, Haiti, Kuwait and Rwanda. \nAlthough crime by civilians accompanying our armed forces in Operation \nDesert Storm was rare, the Department of Defense did report that four \nof its civilian employees were involved in significant criminal \nmisconduct ranging from transportation of illegal firearms to larceny \nand receiving stolen property. One of these civilians was suspended \nwithout pay for 30 days while no action was taken on the remaining \nthree.\n\n  Due to the lack of Federal jurisdiction over civilians in a foreign \ncountry, administrative remedies such as dismissal from the job, \nbanishment from the base, suspension without pay, or returning the \nperson to the United States are often the only remedies available to \nmilitary authorities to deal with civilian offenders. The inadequacy of \nthese remedies to address the criminal activity of civilians \naccompanying our Armed Forces overseas results in a lack of deterrence \nand an inequity due to the harsher sanctions imposed upon military \npersonnel who committed the same crimes as civilians.\n  I expect the deployment of civilians in Kosovo and elsewhere will be \nrelatively crime free, but regardless of the frequency of its use, the \ngap that allows individuals accompanying our military personnel \noverseas to go unpunished for heinous crimes must be closed. Our \nservice men and women and those accompanying them deserve justice when \nthey are victims of crime. That is why I introduced this provision as \npart of the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act with \nother Democratic Members, both last year as S. 2484 and again on \nJanuary 19 of this year, as S. 9.\n  I had some concerns with certain aspects of S. 768 that were not \nincluded in my version of this legislation, and I am pleased that we \nwere able to address those concerns in the Sessions-Leahy-DeWine \nsubstitute. For example, the original bill would have extended court-\nmartial jurisdiction over DOD employees and contractors accompanying \nour Armed Forces overseas. The Supreme Court in Reid v. Covert, 354 \nU.S. 1 (1957), Kinsella v. Singleton, 361 U.S. 234 (1960) and Toth v. \nQuarles, 350 U.S. 11 (1955), has made clear that court-martial \njurisdiction may not be constitutionally applied to crimes committed in \npeacetime by persons accompanying the armed forces overseas, or to \ncrimes committed by a former member of the armed services.\n  The substitute makes clear that this extension of court-martial \njurisdiction applies only in times when the armed forces are engaged in \na ``contingency operation'' involving a war or national emergency \ndeclared by the Congress or\n\n[[Page S7926]]\n\nthe President. I believe this comports with the Supreme Court rulings \non this issue and cures any constitutional infirmity with the original \nlanguage.\n  In addition, the original bill would have deemed any delay in \nbringing a person before a magistrate due to transporting the person \nback to the U.S. from overseas as ``justifiable.'' I was concerned that \nthis provision could end up excusing lengthy and unreasonable delays in \ngetting a civilian, who was arrested overseas, before a U.S. \nMagistrate, and thereby raise yet other constitutional concerns.\n  The Sessions-Leahy-DeWine substitute cures that potential problem by \nremoving the problematic provision and relying instead on Rule 5 of the \nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This rule requires that an \narrested person be brought before a magistrate to answer charges \nwithout unnecessary delays, and will apply to the removal of a civilian \nfrom overseas to answer charges in the United States.\n  Finally, S. 768 as introduced authorized the Department of Defense to \ndetermine which foreign officials constitute the appropriate \nauthorities to whom an arrested civilian should be delivered. In my \nproposal for this legislation I required that DOD make this \ndetermination in consultation with the Department of State. I felt this \nwould help avoid international faux pax. I am pleased that the \nSessions-Leahy substitute adopted my approach to this issue and \nrequires consultation with the Department of State.\n  I am glad the legislation which I and other Democratic members of the \nJudiciary Committee originally introduced both last year and again on \nJanuary 19 of this year, is finally being considered, and I urge its \nprompt passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7926-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

I had determined to suspend \nMauritania from the GSP because Mauritania had not taken or was not \ntaking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights. I have \ndetermined that circumstances in Mauritania have changed and that, \nbased on a consideration of the eligibility criteria in title V, \npreferential treatment under the GSP for Mauritania as a least-\ndeveloped beneficiary developing country should be restored.\n  This message is submitted in accordance with the requirements of \ntitle V of the Trade Act of 1974.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \nallow employees to take school involvement leave to participate in the \nacademic school activities of their children or to participate in \nliteracy training, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                      time for schools act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in 1993, thanks to the hard work of \nSenator Dodd and others, we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act \n(FMLA). It was one of the first pieces of legislation that I was \nintimately involved in passing. During the last six years we've come to \nrealize that it has been a huge success. In fact, as we come to the \nclose of the decade we can honestly say that FMLA has been one of the \nmore useful laws we've passed in the last ten years.\n  Now I want to expand upon that success and allow parents a little bit \nof time under the current time constraints of FMLA to participate in \nschool activities. The ``Time for Schools Act of 1999'' will allow a \nparent 24 hours per year to participate in the academic activities of \nhis or her child. This 24 hour period comes from the already available \n12 weeks under FMLA.\n  This is something our country needs. Parents overwhelmingly want more \ntime to support their children in school. Businesses thrive when our \nschools produce well-trained graduates--and parental involvement helps \nkids succeed.\n  As a parent, I know how difficult and how important it is to \nparticipate in the education of children. I have been lucky to have had \nthe opportunity to be involved in the school lives of my children. But \nmany parents don't have the time it takes to do those little things \nthat will assure their child's success in school, because they can't \nget away from their jobs.\n  By adding academic school activities to one of our most successful \nlaws, we will give parents something they need: time off to become \ndirectly involved with their children's learning.\n  These days we have many dual-income families and single parents \nstruggling to work to make ends meet. All of these families know how \nimportant it is to be involved in their children's learning. However, \nthe single largest barrier to parental involvement at schools seems to \nbe lack of time.\n  Studies have shown that family involvement is more important to \nstudent success than family income or family education levels. In fact, \nthings parents can control, such as limiting excess television watching \nand providing a variety of reading materials, account for almost all \nthe differences in average student achievement across states.\n  All sectors of our communities want more time for young people. \nStudents, teachers, parents and businesses feel something must be done \nto improve family involvement. In fact, 89 percent of company \nexecutives identified the biggest obstacle to school reform as the lack \nof parental involvement.\n  And, a 1996 post-election poll commissioned by the national PTA found \nthat 86 percent of people favor legislation that would allow workers \nunpaid leave to attend parent-teacher conferences, or to take other \nactions to improve learning for their children.\n  A commitment to our children is a commitment to our nation's future. \nI want to make sure all young people receive the attention they need to \nsucceed.\n  My legislation will allow parents time to: (1) attend a parent/\nteacher conference; (2) participate in classroom educational \nactivities; or (3) research new schools.\n  I look at the Family and Medical Leave Act--which has helped one in \nsix American employees take time to deal with serious family health \nproblems, and which 90 percent of businesses had little or no cost \nimplementing--and I see success. People in my state have been able to \ndeal with urgent family needs, without losing their jobs.\n  A 1998 study by the Families and Work Institute found that 84% of \nemployers felt that the benefits of providing family or medical leave \noffset or outweigh the costs. Taking time out for children not only \nhelps parents and children, but is also beneficial to business.\n  My bill extends the uses of family leave to another urgent need \nfamilies face--the need to help their children learn. The time is right \nfor the ``Time for Schools Act.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1304\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act takes effect 120 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join in sponsoring \nThe Time for Schools Act of 1999, and I commend Senator Murray for her \nimpressive leadership. This legislation will provide parents with much-\nneeded assistance as they struggle to balance the needs of their \nchildren and the demands of their jobs.\n  Six years ago, the Family and Medical Leave Act became the first bill \nsigned into law by President Clinton. Workers covered by the law can \ntake up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year in order to care for a \nnewborn or adopted child, or a seriously ill family member, and know \nthat their jobs will be there when they get back.\n  By any measure, the Family and Medical Leave Act has been a \nresounding success. Over 89 million Americans--70% of the workforce--\nare covered by the law, and millions of workers have been able to take \nthe time they need to care for their families. The vast majority of \ncovered employers--over 90%--have found the law relatively easy to \nadminister, according to the bipartisan Commission on Family and \nMedical Leave.\n  Now it is time to take another step, and extend that success to \nenable parents to take up to 24 hours of unpaid family leave a year to \nbe involved in their children's academic activities at school. I am \nproud that, under state law, parents in Massachusetts know they can \ntake care of their children's school needs without losing their jobs. \nWe should give all parents across the nation that right under federal \nlaw, too.\n  Parents play a crucial role in their children's lives. But too often, \nsociety offers them only barriers and blame as they try to raise their \nchildren. While we hear a lot of talk about family values, the test is \nwhether we genuinely value families. If we do, then we must adopt \nbetter policies to help working parents balance the competing demands \nof the workplace and their responsibility to care for their children.\n  We know that working parents want to be more involved in their \nchildren's lives. In a study by the PTA, two-thirds of employed parents \nwith children under 18 felt they did not have enough time to spend with \ntheir children. Forty percent felt they weren't devoting enough time to \ntheir children's education. Almost a quarter reported that attending \nteacher-parent conferences created problems at work.\n  We know that involved parents increase the likelihood of a child's \nsuccess at school. According to some studies, it may be the single most \nimportant factor in student learning. One study showed that the \ninvolvement of both parents in their child's school was significantly \nassociated with the child's academic achievement.\n  The Time for Schools Act will give working parents up to 24 hours of \nleave a year to participate in their children's school activities, such \nas attending parent-teacher conferences, taking part in classroom \neducational activities, or selecting the right school for their \nchildren.\n  Responsible employers know that flexible family workplace policies \nmean better, more productive workers. These policies are good for \nfamilies, and good for business. In 1998, survey by the Families and \nWork Institute reported that the overwhelming majority of employers--\n84%--agree that the benefits of family or medical leave offset the \ncosts.\n  The advantage of this legislation to employers are clear. A mother or \nfather worried about how a child is doing at school is a less effective \nemployee. The 24 hours of leave granted under this Act will be counted \ntowards the 12 weeks of leave already provided under the Family and \nMedical Leave Act. In addition, workers must give employers a week's \nnotice, except in emergencies. As a result, the legislation will have \nonly a minimal impact on employers.\n  The tragedies we have witnessed at schools in recent years \ndemonstrate how important it is for parents to pay attention to how \nchildren are doing at school. When this bill becomes law, workers will \nknow they don't have to stop being parents when they go to work. They \ncan be good parents at school, as well as after school.\n  Again, I commend Senator Murray for her leadership on this important \nmeasure, and I look forward to working with her to enact it as soon as \npossible this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1305. A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to \nimprove the process for listing, recovery planning, and delisting, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                LISTING AND DELISTING REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Listing and \nDelisting Reform Act of 1999, cosponsored by my colleague from Wyoming,\n\n[[Page S7934]]\n\nSenator Enzi. The Endangered Species Act has become one of the best \nexamples of good intentions gone astray, and so today I am taking one \nsmall step toward injecting some common sense into what has become a \nregulatory nightmare. It is my intention to start making the law more \neffective for local landowners, public land managers, communities and \nstate governments who truly hold the key to any successful effort to \nconserve species. My legislation seeks to improve the listing, recovery \nplanning and delisting processes so that recovery, the goal of the act, \nis easier to achieve.\n  In Wyoming, we have seen first hand the need to revise the listing \nand delisting processes of the Endangered Species Act. Listing should \nbe a purely scientific decision. Listing should be based on credible \ndata that has been peer-reviewed. Recently, the Prebles Meadow Jumping \nMouse was listed in the State of Wyoming. The listing process for this \nmouse demonstrates how the system has gone haywire devoid of good \nscience. One of the more significant shortcomings of the Preble's Rule \nrelates to confusion about claims regarding the ``known range'' of as \nopposed to the alleged ``historical range.'' Historical data and \ncurrent knowledge do not support the high, short-grass, semi-arid \nplains for southeastern Wyoming as part of the mouse's historical \nhabitat range. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has even admitted to \nuncertainties regarding taxonomic distinctions and ranges. Further, the \nState was not properly notified causing counties, commissioners, and \nlandowners all to be caught off guard. Such poor practices do not \nfoster the types of partnerships that are required if meaningful \nspecies conservation is to occur. Clearly, changes are desperately \nneeded to the Endangered Species Act.\n  Not far behind the mouse in Wyoming, is the black tailed prairie dog. \nPetitions to list the prairie dog have been filed and the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service has said the petition is not only warranted but \ndeserves further study. I have lived in Wyoming most of my life, and I \nhave logged a lot of miles on the roads and highways in my State over \nthe years. I can tell you from experience that there is no shortage of \nprairie dogs in Wyoming. Any farmer or rancher will concur with that \nopinion. This petition, and countless other actions throughout the \ncountry, makes it painfully clear that some folks are intent on \ncompletely eliminating activity on public lands, no matter what the \ncost to individuals or local communities that rely on the land for \neconomic survival.\n  My legislation will require the Secretary of the Interior to use \nscientific or commercial data that is empirical, field tested and peer-\nreviewed. Right now, it is basically a ``postage stamp'' petition: any \nperson who wants to start a listing process may petition a species with \nlittle or no scientific support. This legislation prevents this absurd \npractice by establishing minimum requirements for a listing petition \nthat includes an analysis of the status of the species, its range, \npopulation trends and threats. The petition must also be peer reviewed. \nIn order to list a species, the Secretary must determine if sufficient \nbiological information exists in the petition to support a recovery \nplan. Under my proposal, states are made active participants in the \nprocess and the general public is provided a more substantial role.\n  This legislation requires explicit planning and forethought with \nregard to conservation and recovery at the time the species is listed. \nLet me be clear about the intent of this requirement. I do not question \nthe basic premise that some species require the protection of the \nEndangered Species Act. However, listing a species can cause hardship \non a community. For that reason, it is critically important and only \nreasonable that every listing be supported by sound science. We should \nbe sure of the need for a listing before we ask the members of our \ncommunities and private landowners to make sacrifices.\n  In my State of Wyoming, I have found that with several listings, the \nSecretary of the Interior is unable to tell me what measures will be \nrequired to achieve species recovery. The Secretary cannot tell me what \nacts or omissions we can expect to face as a consequence of listing. \nHow can this be, if the Secretary is fully apprized of the status of \nthe species? Conversely, if the Secretary cannot clearly describe how \nto reverse threatening acts to a species so that we can achieve \nrecovery, how can we be sure that the species is, in fact, threatened?\n  This ambiguity has caused much undue frustration to the people of \nWyoming. If the Secretary believes that certain farming or ranching \npractices, or the diversion of a certain amount of water, or a private \ncitizen's development of one's own property, is the cause for a \nlisting, then the Secretary should identify those activities that have \nto be curtailed or changed. If the Secretary does not have enough \ninformation to indicate what activities should be restricted, then why \nlist a species? Why open producers and others to the burden of over-\nzealous enforcement and even litigation without being able to achieve \nthe goal of recovering the species?\n  This legislation is ultimately designed to improve the quality of \ninformation used to support a listing. If the Secretary knows enough to \nlist a species, he should know enough to tell us what will be required \nfor recovery. That should be the case under current law, and that is \nall that this provision would require.\n  Just as the beginning of the process needs changes, we need to revise \nthe end of the process--the delisting procedure. Recovery and delisting \nare quite simply, the goals of the Endangered Species Act. Yet, it is \nvirtually impossible to currently delist a species. There is no \ncertainty in the process and the States--the folks who have all the \nresponsibility for managing the species once it is off the list--are \nnot true partners in that process. Once the recovery plan is met, the \nspecies should be delisted.\n  Wyoming's experience with the Grizzly Bear pinpoints some of the \nproblems with the current delisting process. The Interagency Grizzly \nBear Committee set criteria for recovery and in the Yellowstone \necosystem, those targets have been met, but the bear has still not been \nremoved from the list. We've been battling the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService for years over this one to noavail, despite tremendous effort \nand financial resources to meet recovery objectives. Despite rebounded \npopulations, we keep funneling money down a black hole.\n  The point is something needs to be done. My constituents, rightly so, \nare angry and upset about this current law and the trickling effects of \ncountless listings. Real lives are being impacted. It is time for some \nreal changes. These are small changes but I believe they will make big \nimpacts. The changes I have suggested will have a significant effect on \nthe quality of science, public participation, state involvement, speed \nin recovery and finally the delisting of a species. Species that truly \nneed protection will be protected, but let's not lose sight of the real \ngoal--recovery and delisting.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER:\n  S. 1306. A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nrelating to the regulation of firearms dealers, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              Targeted Gun dealer enforcement Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Targeted Gun \nDealer Enforcement Act of 1999.'' This legislation would enable law \nenforcement to crack down on certain gun dealers and ``straw \npurchasers'' responsible for funneling firearms into the hands of those \nwho use guns in crime.\n  A licensed gun dealer in West Milwaukee, Wisconsin was the retail \nsource of 1,195 guns linked to crime between 1996 and 1998 Similarly, \n1,176 crime guns recovered by law enforcement authorities over those \nthree years were traced to a single gun dealer in Riverdale, Illinois \nIn fact, 137 gun stores account for more than 13,000 crime guns seized \nin 1998 Year after year, many of these 137 dealers emerge as major \nsources of crime guns, even though most are not located in high-crime \nareas.\n  The path a gun takes to a crime scene is often a path of rapid \ndiversion from first retail sale at federally licensed gun dealers to \nan illegal market supplying juveniles and felons According to a \nFebruary 1999 ATF crime gun trace analysis report, ``New guns in \njuvenile or criminal hands signal direct\n\n[[Page S7935]]\n\ndiversion, by illegal firearms trafficking--for instance through straw \npurchases or off the book sales by corrupt FFLs.''\n  An extremely small percentage of gun dealers are disproportionately \nresponsible for this problem of rapid diversion of guns from first \nretail sale to crime scenes Indeed, almost half of the guns recovered \nin crime and traced through ATF in 1998 are traceable to a mere 1.1 \npercent of the nation's licensed gun dealers Yet law enforcement's \nability to prevent certain gun dealers and straw purchasers from \nsupplying young people and felons with new guns for use in crime is \nconstrained by current federal firearms law--which limits the records \nand sanctions to which law enforcement has ready access.\n  My legislation would give law enforcement the tools it needs to crack \ndown on certain gun dealers and ``straw purchasers'' responsible for \nfunneling firearms into the hands of those who use guns in crime The \nbill would, among other things, impose strict new reporting \nrequirements and automatic sanctions for illegal activity upon the 0.4 \npercent of licensed gun dealers responsible for 25 or more crime gun \ntraces in given year; authorize ATF to suspend the licenses of and \nimpose civil monetary penalties upon licensed gun dealers who willfully \nviolate federal firearms law; clearly outlaw and increase penalties for \n``straw purchasing''; and enable law enforcement more readily to trace \nthe purchase-and-sale histories of firearms used in crime.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1306\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AMENDMENT OF FEDERAL SENTENCING GUIDELINES.\n\n       The United States Sentencing Commission shall amend the \n     Federal sentencing guidelines to reflect the amendments made \n     by this Act.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleague Senator \nSchumer in introducing the ``Targeted Gun Dealer Enforcement Act of \n1999.'' This bill will give law enforcement the tools they need to \nprevent suspect gun dealers from supplying firearms to criminals and \nplaguing our communities with gun violence.\n  Guns kill 34,000 Americans every year--thirteen children every day. \nThey kill more teen-agers than any natural cause.\n  This bill allows the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to \nclosely monitor those gun dealers who they should be monitoring--the \ndealers who have had more than 25 crime guns traced to them in the last \nyear.\n  The facts in Illinois are particularly compelling on this issue. In \nIllinois, 26 gun dealers account for more crime guns than the remaining \n3,700 Illinois federally licensed gun dealers combined.\n  These figures show that while most gun dealers are law abiding and \nresponsible, some shops have become ``convenience stores'' for \ncriminals. Twenty-six dealers were the source of more than 1,600 crime \nguns with each dealer responsible for selling at least 25 guns used in \ncrimes in 1998.\n  This bill will help law enforcement find out why these dealers are \nthe source of guns later used to commit crimes. The bill will require \nhigh volume crime dealers to report handgun sales to ATF and local \npolice. Law enforcement can then use these records to more effectively \ntrace crime guns.\n  The bill will also encourage gun dealers to sell guns more \nresponsively. In the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, ATF found \nthat many guns used by youths to commit crimes are purchased from \nlicensed dealers by individuals acting as ``straw'' purchasers. A \n``straw purchaser'' is a person who illegally purchases a firearm for \nanother person, such as a juvenile or a felon.\n  This bill seeks to address that problem by prohibiting the sale of a \nfirearm when a seller has ``reason to know'' that such firearm will be \nused to commit a crime of violence or a drug crime. Current law \nrequires actual knowledge on the part of the dealer that the buyer will \nuse the firearm to commit a crime of violence. This change will make it \neasier for law enforcement to target dealers who they believe are \nturning a blind eye in supplying guns to buyers under questionable \ncircumstances.\n  In 1998, Chicago police officers conducted ``Operation Gunsmoke,'' an \ninvestigation to target gun-sellers just outside the city limits. Seven \nundercover officers purchased 171 guns from 12 suburban gun stores in a \nthree month period. Not one dealer refused to sell the agents weapons \neven as the agents openly violated laws needed to purchase firearms. \nThis investigation was key to the City of Chicago's\n\n[[Page S7937]]\n\ngroundbreaking lawsuit against the gun industry on the theory of public \nnuisance.\n  We must act now to keep guns from getting into the hands of \ncriminals. I applaud Senator Schumer's leadership on this issue and \nhope my colleagues will join us in this important effort to make our \ncommunities safer. The statistics show most gun dealers are \nresponsible, but a few unscrupulous dealers are supplying criminals \nwith guns that plague our communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 1307. A bill to amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to permit \nparticipating households to use food stamp benefits to purchase \nnutritional supplements providing vitamins or minerals, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n         food stamp vitamin and mineral improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nHatch and Senator McConnell in introducing the Food Stamp Vitamin and \nMineral Improvement Act of 1999.\n  Mr. President, this bipartisan legislation is very simple and I \nbelieve makes just plain common sense. It would give those Americans \nusing food stamps the ability to purchase vitamin and mineral \nsupplements for themselves and their families.\n  The change called for in this legislation has been supported by a \nbroad coalition of groups and nutrition experts. For example, it is \nbacked by the Alliance for Aging Research, the Spina Bifida Association \nof America, the National Osteoporosis Foundation and the National \nNutritional Foods Association. Nutrition experts such as Dr. Paul \nLachance, Chair of the Department of Food Science at Rutgers \nUniversity, Dr. Jeffrey Blumberg of Tufts University, Dr. Charles \nButterworth, Director of Human Nutrition at the University of Alabama \nBirmingham, and Dr. Dennis Heldman, Chair of the Department of Food \nScience and Human Nutrition at the University of Missouri have also \ncalled for making this common sense change to food policy.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation would contribute \nsubstantially to improving the nutrition and health of a segment of our \nsociety that too often falls below recommended levels of nutrient \nconsumption.\n  Scientific evidence continues to mount showing that sound nutrition \nis essential for normal growth and cognitive development in children, \nand for improved health and the prevention of a variety of conditions \nand illnesses.\n  Studies have also shown, unfortunately, that many Americans do not \nhave dietary intakes sufficient to meet even the conservative \nRecommended Daily Allowances or RDA's for a number of essential \nnutrients. Insufficient dietary intakes are especially critical for \nchildren, pregnant women and the elderly.\n  A recent study conducted by the Tufts University School of Nutrition, \nand based on government data, showed that millions of poor children in \nthe United States have dietary intakes that are well below the \ngovernment's Recommended Daily Allowance for a number of important \nnutrients. The study found that major differences exist in the intakes \nof poor versus non-poor children for 10 out of 16 nutrients (food \nenergy, folate, iron, magnesium, thiamin, vitamin A, vitamin B6, \nvitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc). Moreover, the proportion of poor \nchildren with inadequate intakes of zinc is over 50 percent; for iron, \nover 40 percent; and for vitamin E, over 33 percent.\n  For some nutrients, such as vitamin A and magnesium, the proportion \nof poor children with inadequate intakes is nearly six times as large \nas for non-poor children.\n\n  Pregnant women also have high nutritional needs. Concerns about \ninadequate folate intake by pregnant women prompted the Public Health \nService to issue a recommendation regarding consumption of folic acid \nby all women of childbearing age who are capable of becoming pregnant \nfor the purpose of reducing the incidence of spina bifida or other \nneural tube defects. That is why this change has long been a priority \nof the Spina Bifida Association of America.\n  Furthermore, the percent of pregnant and nursing women who get the \nRDA level of calcium has dropped from just 24 percent in 1986 to a mere \n16 percent in 1994. That's 84 percent of women who aren't getting \nenough calcium--which we know is critical to preventing the \ndebilitating effects of osteoporosis.\n  And again, the evidence is that lower income women, many of whom are \neligible for Food Stamps, are more likely to have inadequate intake of \nkey nutrients. Women with income of 130 percent or less of the poverty \nlevel have higher rates of deficiencies in intake of Vitamins A, E, C, \nB-6 and B-12, as well as Iron, Thiamin, Riboflavin and Niacin than \nthose with higher incomes.\n  Obviously, the best way to obtain sufficient nutrient intake is \nthrough eating a variety of nutritious foods, but some groups--\nparticularly those at the greatest risk, including children, pregnant \nwomen and the elderly--may find it significantly difficult to obtain \nsufficient nutrient intake through foods alone. Accordingly, many \npeople in our nation do rely on nutritional supplements to ensure that \nthey and their families are consuming sufficient levels of key \nnutrients.\n  This legislation would enable low-income people to have greater \naccess to nutritional supplements to improve their nutrient intake. \nCurrently, recipients of food stamps are not allowed to use those \nresources to purchase nutritional supplements. This restriction clearly \nserves as an impediment to adequate nutrition for low-income people who \nmay need supplements to ensure they are consuming sufficient levels of \nnutrients. It defies common sense.\n  This restriction also prevents food stamp recipients from exercising \ntheir own responsibility and choice to use food stamps for purchasing \nnutritional supplements that they determine are important to adequate \nnutrition for their children or themselves. It is a glaring \ninconsistency that food stamps may currently be used to purchase a \nvariety of non-nutritious or minimally nutritious foods but not to \npurchase nutritional supplements. Incredibly, you can use Food Stamps \nto buy Twinkies, but not Vitamin C or a multivitamin.\n  Opponents of this legislation will argue that food stamps are most \neffectively used to improve nutrition through purchasing food rather \nthan nutritional supplements, and that if food stamps may be used for \nnutritional supplements, households will be less able to stretch their \nresources to purchase sufficient quantities of food.\n  The available evidence indicates, however, that food stamp households \nactually make more careful and effective use of their resources in \npurchasing nutritious foods than consumers in general. Since food stamp \nhouseholds necessarily have a limited amount of money to spend on \nfood--and generally already find it difficult to meet their food \nneeds--they simply cannot afford to make unwise or unnecessary \npurchases of nutritional supplements using food stamps which would \notherwise be used for food.\n  In addition, a month's worth of daily multivitamin supplements can \ncost as little as one can of soda. So I believe the concerns that food \nstamps will be wasted or unwisely used for nutritional supplements is \nunfounded.\n  Our proposal is also clearly consistent with the stated purpose of \nthe Food Stamp program, that is to ``promote the general welfare and to \nsafeguard the health of the nation's population by raising the \nnutrition among low-income households.''\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join us in \nsupporting this legislation designed to improve opportunities for low-\nincome Americans to ensure adequate nutrition for their families and \nthemselves. Simply put, if you think it doesn't make sense that Food \nStamps can be used to buy twinkies and doughnuts but not Vitamin C or a \ndaily multi-vitamin supplement, you should support this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1307\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Food Stamp Vitamin and \n     Mineral Improvement Act of 1999''.\n\n[[Page S7938]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the dietary patterns of Americans do not result in \n     nutrient intakes that fully meet recommended dietary \n     allowances of vitamins and minerals;\n       (2) children in low-income families and the elderly often \n     fail to achieve adequate nutrient intakes from diet alone;\n       (3) pregnant women have particularly high nutrient needs, \n     which they often fail to meet through diet alone;\n       (4)(A) scientific studies show that nutritional supplements \n     that contain folic acid (a B vitamin) can prevent as many as \n     60 to 80 percent of neural tube birth defects;\n       (B) the Public Health Service, in September 1992, \n     recommended that all women of childbearing age who are \n     capable of becoming pregnant should consume at least 0.4 of a \n     milligram of folic acid per day for the purpose of reducing \n     the risk of having a pregnancy affected with spina bifida or \n     other neural tube birth defects; and\n       (C) the Food and Drug Administration has approved a health \n     claim for folic acid to reduce the risk of neural tube birth \n     defects;\n       (5) infants who do not receive adequate intakes of iron may \n     be somewhat impaired in mental and behavioral development; \n     and\n       (6) scientific evidence indicates that increasing intake of \n     specific nutrients over an extended period of time protects \n     against diseases or conditions such as osteoporosis, \n     cataracts, cancer, and heart disease.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend section 468A of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 with respect to deductions for decommissioning costs of nuclear \npower plants; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      nuclear decommissioning fund\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator John \nBreaux in introducing The Nuclear Decommissioning Funds Clarification \nAct. This change in the tax law is necessary because the electricity \nindustry is rapidly moving from a regulatory monopoly model to the \ncompetitive marketplace.\n  In 1984, Congress enacted Code Section 468A which was designed to \nallow state public service commissions to authorize that future costs \nfor decommissioning nuclear power plants could be charged by a utility \nto its customers to be dedicated to a nuclear decommissioning fund. \nCurrently, utilities are permitted a deduction for contributions to \ntheir decommissioning funds. The amount that can be deducted is \ncurrently limited to the cost of service amount or the ruling amount. \nThe cost of service amount is the amount of decommissioning costs \nincluded in the taxpayer's cost of service for ratemaking purposes. The \nruling amount is the amount that the IRS determines to be necessary to \nprovide for level funding of an amount equal to the taxpayer's nuclear \ndecommissioning costs.\n  Since Section 468A was adopted, the electricity industry landscape \nhas been substantially transformed. Since 1992, more than 20 states \nhave approved plans to introduce competition and all states are \nconsidering deregulation. The Energy Committee which I chair has also \nheld several hearings on Federal deregulation proposals and it is my \nhope that a federal deregulation bill will be adopted in this Congress.\n  Since deductible contributions made to a nuclear decommissioning fund \nare based on limitations reflected in cost-of-service ratemaking, \ncompanies operating in a competitive market can no longer deduct \ncontributions to decommissioning funds. Our bill clarifies the \ndeductibility of nuclear decommissioning costs in a market environment \nand codifies the definition of nuclear decommissioning costs that limit \ncontributions.\n  This legislation also clarifies a number of tax issues relating to \ndecommissioning funds to ensure that nuclear utilities can operate \neffectively in this new competitive environment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS:\n  S. 1309. A bill to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to provide for the preemption of State law in \ncertain cases relating to certain church plans; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n       church plan parity and entanglement prevention act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprotect the health and pension benefits of thousands of clergy and lay \nworkers. This legislation clarifies the regulatory status of church \nbenefit programs and allows service providers to continue contracting \nwith church plans.\n  Unfortunately, state insurance statutes, in all but three states, \nfail to address the legal status of these benefit programs. Thus, under \nsome interpretations of state insurance law it is possible to conclude \nthat these employer plans are subject to regulation as insurance \ncompanies. This uncertain legal status has caused service providers to \nrefuse to contract with church plans--leaving these programs without \nthe necessary tools to maximize benefits and reduce costs.\n  Recently, the Insurance Department of South Dakota informed the \nchurch benefits community that either federal or state legislation is \nnecessary to exempt their programs from their state's insurance laws. \nWith the possibility that 46 more states could make the same request, I \nbelieve the only practical solution is for Congress to clarify the \nstatus of these plans. That is what my legislation does.\n  Mr. President, my legislation is within the spirit of the National \nSecurities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-290) which \nnot only exempted church plans from federal securities laws--providing \nthe same treatment secular plans had previously enjoyed--but, also \npreempted state securities laws. This is not a unique idea. Similarly, \nthe Internal Revenue Code includes numerous accommodations to the \nspecial circumstances of church plans. For example, the church plans \nwhich annuitize benefits are deemed not to be commercial insurers for \npurposes of maintaining their tax-exempt status.\n  Mr. President, I have heard from ministers in my state about the \nurgency to move this legislation expeditiously. Indeed, Bishop Wesley \nMorris of the United Methodist Church visited me about this very \nmatter. It is supported by the Church Alliance, a coalition of more \nthan 30 denominational benefit programs, including the Presbyterian \nChurch in America, the Rabbinical Pension Board, the Christian Brothers \nService, the United Church of Christ, The United Methodist Church, the \nEpiscopal Church, the Southern Baptist Convention and many others.\n\n  While these denominations may disagree about certain theological \nissues, they are united in providing sound health care and pension \nprograms to their ministers and lay workers. Furthermore, while there \nare differing opinions with the Senate, and among ourselves, about \nhealth care legislation, there should be no disagreement that we need \nto protect benefit plans that serve ministers and lay workers. It makes \nno sense to leave these programs at the mercy of 47 different insurance \nlaws. Every person active in his or her church knows the rising cost of \nhealth care is a problem.\n  Mr. President, I want to clarify two points with respect to \npreemption of State laws as provided by this legislation. The exception \nthat allows states to enact legislation applicable to church plans is \nintended to permit states to regulate church plans only if a specific \nstatute is passed by a State legislature on a stand-alone basis and the \nsole purpose of the statute is to regulate church plans.\n  Furthermore, I want to point that this legislation is intended to \npermit insurance companies and other service providers to contract with \nchurch plans regardless of whether such church plans would have been \ntreated as multiple-employer welfare arrangements under State law, if \nthis legislation had not been enacted.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bennett, \n        Mr. Santorum, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n        Allard, Mr. Specter, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Frist, Mr. Helms, and \n        Mr. Abraham):\n  S. 1310. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmodify the interim payment system for home health services, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nHome\n\n[[Page S7939]]\n\nHealth Equity Act of 1999, which is designed to provide a measure of \nfinancial and regulatory relief for cost-efficient home health agencies \nacross the country. These agencies are experiencing severe financial \nproblems that are inhibiting their ability to deliver much-needed care, \nparticularly to chronically ill seniors with complex needs.\n  America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have \nenabled a growing number of our most frail and vulnerable Medicare \nbeneficiaries to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where \nthey want to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes.\n  In 1996, home health was the fastest growing component of Medicare \nspending, consuming one out of every eleven Medicare dollars, compared \nwith one in every forty in 1989. The program grew at an average annual \nrate of more than 25 percent from 1990 to 1997. As a consequence, the \nnumber of home health beneficiaries more than doubled, and Medicare \nhome health spending soared from $2.5 billion in 1989 to $18.1 billion \nin 1996.\n  This rapid growth in home health spending understandably prompted \nCongress and the Administration, as part of the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, to initiate changes that were intended to make the program more \ncost-effective and efficient. Therefore, there was widespread support \nfor the provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which called for \nthe implementation of a prospective payment system for home care. Until \nthis system can be implemented, home health agencies are being paid \naccording to an ``interim payment system,'' or IPS.\n  In trying to get a handle on costs, however, Congress and the \nAdministration created a system that penalizes efficient agencies and \nthat may be restricting access for the very Medicare beneficiaries who \nneed care the most--the sicker seniors with complex, chronic care needs \nlike diabetic, wound care patients or IV therapy patients who require \nmultiple visits.\n  Unfortunately, the ``interim payment system'' is critically flawed in \nthat it effectively rewards the agencies that provided the most visits \nand spent the most Medicare dollars in 1994, the base year, while it \npenalizes low-cost, more efficient providers--and their patients. None \nof us should tolerate wasteful expenditures, but neither should we \nimpede the delivery of necessary services by low-cost providers.\n  Home health agencies in the Northeast and the mid-West have been \namong those particularly hard-hit by the interim payment system. As the \nWall Street Journal observed last year, ``If New England had been just \na little greedier, its home health industry would be a lot better off \nnow--Ironically, the region is getting clobbered by the system because \nof its tradition of non-profit community service and efficiency.''\n  Even more troubling, this flawed system may force our most cost-\nefficient providers to stop accepting Medicare patients with more \nserious health care needs. According to a recent survey by the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission, almost 40 percent of the home health \nagencies surveyed indicated that there were patients whom they \npreviously would have accepted whom they no longer accept due to the \nIPS. Thirty-one percent of the agencies admitted that they had \ndischarged patients due to the IPS. These discharged patients tended to \nbe those with chronic care needs who required a large number of visits \nand were expensive to serve. As a consequence, these patients caused \nthe agencies to exceed their aggregate per-beneficiary caps.\n\n  I simply do not believe that Congress and the Administration intended \nto construct a payment system that inevitably discourages home health \nagencies from caring for those seniors who need care the most. Last \nyear's Omnibus Appropriations bill did provide a small measure of \nrelief for home health agencies. This proposal did not, however, go far \nenough to relieve the financial distress that cost-effective agencies \nare experiencing.\n  These problems are all the more pressing given the fact that the \nHealth Care Financing Administration was unable to meet its original \ndeadline for implementing a prospective payment system. As a result, \nhome health agencies will be struggling under the IPS far longer than \nCongress envisioned when it enacted the Balanced Budget Act.\n  Moreover, it now appears that Congress greatly underestimated the \nsavings stemming from the BBA. Medicare spending for home health fell \nby nearly 15 percent last year, and the CBO now projects that post-BBA \nreductions in home care spending will exceed $47 billion in FY 1998-\n2002. This is a whopping three times greater than the $16 billion CBO \noriginally estimated for that time period.\n  I recently chaired a Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) \nhearing where we heard about the financial distress and cash-flow \nproblems cost-efficient agencies across the country are experiencing. \nWitnesses expressed concern that these problems are inhibiting their \nability to deliver much-needed care, particularly to chronically ill \npatients with complex needs. More than a thousand agencies have closed \nin the past year because the reimbursement levels under Medicare fell \nso far short of their actual operating costs. Others are laying off \nstaff or declining to accept new patients with more serious health \nproblems.\n  This points to the most central and critical issue--cuts of this \nmagnitude cannot be sustained without ultimately affecting care for our \nmost vulnerable seniors. At the PSI hearing, Barbara Smith, a senior \nresearch staff scientist with the Center for Health Services Research \nand Policy at George Washington University, testified that the \npreliminary findings of her studies suggest significant potential \neffects on beneficiaries, particularly those with unstable chronic care \nneeds. Her research shows that these patients are being displaced from \nhome care or are experiencing significant changes in services that \nappear to be driven by reimbursement policies rather than by clinical \nconsiderations. In her testimony, she stated:\n\n       ``My main concern is that we are carving out a wedge of \n     people who are chronically ill and have intensive needs for \n     services who are not going to have a reliable source of care \n     in any sector. They are becoming the health care system's \n     untouchables.''\n\n  Moreover, the financial problems that home health agencies have been \nexperiencing have been exacerbated by a number of new regulatory \nrequirements imposed by HCFA, including the implementation of OASIS, \nthe new outcome and assessment information data set; new requirements \nfor surety bonds; sequential billing; IPS overpayment recoupment; and a \nnew 15-minute increment home health reporting requirement. Witnesses at \nthe PSI hearing expressed particular frustration about what Maryanna \nArsenault, the CEO of the Visiting Nurse Service in Saco, Maine, termed \nHCFA's regulatory policy of ``implement and suspend.'' They pointed to \nexamples such as the hastily enacted requirements for surety bonds and \nsequential billing where no sooner had a mandate been put into an \neffect, than it was suspended but only after agencies had invested \nsignificant time and resources in compliance.\n  The legislation that my colleague from Missouri and I are introducing \ntoday, along with a bipartisan group of 16 of our colleagues, responds \nto these concerns. It makes needed adjustments to the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997 and related federal regulations to ensure that Medicare \nbeneficiaries have access to medically-necessary home health services.\n  Among other provisions, the bill eliminates the automatic 15 percent \nreduction in Medicare home health payments now scheduled for October 1, \n2000, whether or not a prospective payment system is enacted. When the \nBalanced Budget Act was enacted, CBO reported that the effect of the \nBBA would be to reduce home health expenditures by $16.1 billion \nbetween fiscal years 1998 and 2002. CBO's March 1999 revised analysis \nestimates those reductions to exceed $47 billion--three times the \nanticipated budgetary impact. A further 15 percent cut would be \ndevastating to cost-efficient providers and would further reduce \nseniors' access to care. Moreover, it is unnecessary since the budget \ntarget for home health outlays will be achieved, if not exceeded, \nwithout it.\n  The legislation will also provide supplemental ``outlier'' payments \nto home health agencies on a patient-by-patient\n\n[[Page S7940]]\n\nbasis, if the cost of care for an individual is considered to be \nsignificantly higher than average due to the patient's particular \nhealth and functional condition. This provision would remove the \nexisting financial disincentive for agencies to care for patients with \nintensive medical needs who, according to recent reports issued by both \nthe General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission (MedPAC), are the individuals most at risk of losing access \nto home health care under the IPS.\n  The current IPS unfairly penalizes historically cost-efficient home \nhealth agencies that have been most prudent with their Medicare \nresources. Our legislation builds on reforms in last year's Omnibus \nAppropriations Act by gradually raising low-cost agencies' per-\nbeneficiary limits up to the national average over three years, or \nuntil the new home health prospective payment system is implemented and \nIPS is terminated.\n  To decrease total costs in order to remain under their per-\nbeneficiary limits, agencies have had to significantly reduce the \nnumber of visits to patients, which has, in turn, increased the cost of \neach visit. Implementation of OASIS has also significantly increased \nagencies' per-visit costs. Therefore, the legislation will increase the \nIPS per-visit cost limit from 106 to 108 percent of the national \nmedian.\n  Other provisions of the legislation will:\n  Extend the current IPS overpayment recoupment period from one to \nthree years without interest;\n  Revise the surety bond requirement for home health agencies to more \nappropriately target fraud;\n  Eliminate the 15-minute incremental reporting requirement; and\n  Maintain the Periodic Interim Payment (PIP) program through the first \nyear of implementation of the prospective payment system to ensure that \nsuch a dramatic change in payment systems does not create new cash-flow \nproblems for agencies. I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-\nsection summary further detailing these provisions be included in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. President, the Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1999 will \nprovide a measure of financial and regulatory relief to beleaguered \nhome health agencies in order to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries \nhave access to medically-necessary home health services, and I \nencourage all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              The Home Health Equity Act of 1999--Summary\n\n       The Home Health Equity Act of 1999 is intended to make \n     needed adjustments to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and \n     related federal regulations to ensure that Medicare \n     beneficiaries have access to medically-necessary home health \n     care services.\n\n\n                            Major Provisions\n\n       Eliminates the automatic 15 percent reduction in Medicare \n     home health payments now scheduled for October 1, 2000.\n       Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (as amended by the \n     Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act), expenditures for Medicare home health \n     care are to be reduced by 15 percent, whether or not a \n     Medicare home health prospective payment system is \n     implemented on October 1, 2000. This provision would \n     eliminate that proposed reduction. When it was enacted, the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that the effect of \n     the BBA would be to reduce home health expenditures by $16.1 \n     billion between fiscal years 1998 and 2002. CBO's March 1999 \n     revised analysis now estimates those reductions to exceed $47 \n     billion--three times the anticipated budgetary impact. A \n     further 15 percent cut to home health cost limits would be \n     devastating to cost-efficient providers and would reduce \n     seniors' access to care. Moreover, it is unnecessary since \n     the budget target for home health outlays will be achieved, \n     if not exceeded, without it.\n       Provides supplemental ``outlier'' payments to home health \n     agencies on a patient-by-patient basis if the cost of care \n     for an individual is considered by the Secretary to be \n     significantly higher than average due to the patient's \n     particular health and functional condition.\n       Recent reports issued by both the General Accounting Office \n     (GAO) and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) \n     conclude that patients with intensive medical needs are the \n     individuals most at risk of losing access to home health care \n     under the Interim Payment System (IPS). This provision would \n     remove the existing financial disincentive under the IPS for \n     agencies to care for these patients.\n       Increases the per-beneficiary cost limit for agencies with \n     limits below the national average to the national average \n     cost per patient over a three-year period or until the \n     Medicare home health prospective payment system is \n     implemented.\n       The Balanced Budget Act of 1997's Interim Payment System \n     (IPS) bases an agency's average per-patient reimbursement on \n     that agency's average cost per patient in 1993 or 1994. As a \n     consequences, the system unfairly penalizes historically \n     cost-efficient home health agencies that have been most \n     prudent with their Medicare resources. This provision builds \n     on reforms made by the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act (OCESSA) by gradually raising \n     low-cost agencies' per-beneficiary limits up to the national \n     average over three years or until the new home health \n     prospective payment system is implemented and IPS is \n     terminated.\n       Increases the IPS per-visit cost limit to 108 percent of \n     the national median.\n       The Balanced Budget Act reduced the per-visit cost limit \n     from 112 percent of the mean to 105 percent of the median. \n     The OCESSA increased the limit to 106 percent of the median. \n     This provision would further increase it to 108 percent of \n     the national median. Most analysts agree that the growth in \n     Medicare home health expenditures in the early 1990s was due \n     to the high number of visits provided to patients, not to the \n     cost per visit. CBO confirms that controlling use, not price, \n     is the key to Medicare home health cost containment. To \n     decrease total costs in order to remain under their per-\n     beneficiary limits, agencies have had to significantly reduce \n     the number of visits to patients, which has, in turn, \n     increased the cost of each visit. Implementation of OASIS has \n     also significantly increased agencies' per-visit costs.\n       Revises the surety bond requirements for home health \n     agencies to more appropriately target fraud.\n       This provision would clarify that the surety bond \n     requirement is only to be used to protect against \n     overpayments based on fraudulent claims or behavior. Perhaps \n     the main problem with the surety bond proposal that HCFA \n     developed last year (and which is currently in regulatory \n     limbo) was that it went beyond Congressional intent. Congress \n     enacted the original surety bond provision as a way to use \n     private sector monitors to help keep fraudulent providers out \n     of the market. HCFA tried, through the regulations it \n     developed, to use surety bonds as a means to recover any \n     overpayments they made to home health agencies. This \n     unnecessarily increased both the costs and difficulties \n     agencies encountered in trying to obtain a surety bond.\n       Extends the IPS overpayment recoupment period to three \n     years without interest.\n       The BBA did not require HCFA to publish information on \n     calculating the IPS per-visit limits until January 1, 1998, \n     even though the limits were effective beginning October 1, \n     1997. Similarly, HCFA was not required to publish information \n     related to the calculation of the agencies' annual aggregate \n     per-beneficiary limit until April 1, 1998, despite an October \n     1 start date. More than a year after the implementation of \n     the IPS, HCFA's fiscal intermediaries still had not notified \n     many agencies of the visit and per-beneficiary limits under \n     which they were expected to operate. Moreover, throughout \n     this period, fiscal intermediaries continued to pay agencies \n     in accordance with the previous years' limits, resulting in \n     significant overpayments to many home health agencies \n     throughout the country.\n       Fiscal intermediaries have begun to issue notices of \n     overpayments to these agencies and are demanding repayment. \n     This has posed a significant problem, particularly for \n     smaller agencies that do not have large cash reserves. To \n     ease these repayment problems, HCFA has directed the fiscal \n     intermediaries to allow home health agencies to extend their \n     repayments over 12 months. Many agencies, however, say that \n     this is insufficient. This provision would extend the \n     overpayment recoupment period to three years without \n     interest.\n       Eliminates the 15-minute incremental reporting period.\n       The BBA mandates that home health agencies record the \n     length of time of home health visits in 15-minute increments, \n     which the HCFA will implement on July 1, 1999. Unfortunately, \n     HCFA's instructions implementing the 15-minute reporting \n     requirement are excessively labor-intensive. As proposed by \n     HCFA, the only time that can be counted is time spent \n     actively treating the beneficiary. Time for travel or for \n     administrative duties that are essential to patient care, \n     such as charting or coordinating work with the physician, may \n     not be counted. Implementation of the 15-minute reporting \n     requirement will not only be difficult for staff, but will \n     also be disruptive to patient care. This provision would \n     eliminate the current 15-minute reporting requirement. An \n     alternative to the 15-minute reporting requirement that \n     better measures time of direct patient care and its \n     relationship to outcomes should be developed within the \n     context of the Medicare home health PPS.\n       Temporarily maintains the Periodic Interim Payment (PIP) \n     program\n       PIP is a program that is available to many home health \n     agencies that permits HCFA to make payments to the agencies--\n     based on\n\n[[Page S7941]]\n\n     historical payment levels--prior to the final settlement of \n     claims and cost-reports. This program, which is scheduled to \n     terminate on October 1, 2000, has been invaluable to \n     participating agencies and has helped them to avoid cash-flow \n     difficulties. This provision would continue PIP through the \n     first year of implementation of the prospective payment \n     system to ensure that such a dramatic change in payment \n     systems does not create new cash-flow problems.\n\n  Mr. BOND. In the last couple days, a lot of people have been talking \nabout the Medicare program and what we want it to look like as we think \nfar ahead into the future. I'm glad this is happening, because this is \nan important debate. We do need to discuss things like a prescription \ndrug benefit, comprehensive Medicare reform, the long-term solvency of \nthe program, and other related issues.\n  But as we focus on the future of Medicare, we also need to do our \nbest to make sure that the existing program is working as well as it \ncan. That's why we're here today. Part of the existing program-- the \nhome health care benefit--is completely broken, and we've come together \nto try to fix it.\n  Why do we care? Well, home health care is the key to fulfilling what \nis virtually a universal desire among seniors and those with \ndisabilities--to remain independent and within the comfort of their own \nhomes despite their health problems. For people who have difficulty \nleaving their home and who have health conditions that require low- to \nmid-level medical attention, home health care is a tremendous help. \nHome health care keeps these people out of more expensive and less \ncomfortable settings such as nursing homes and hospitals. And home care \nis often the only source of care for many disabled individuals and \nfrail elderly, especially those living in underserved rural and urban \nareas of our country. Simply put, home health is crucial to millions of \nAmericans' comfort and health, and we must make sure they continue to \nhave access to it.\n  The problem is that more and more Americans do not have access to \nneeded home health services--they simply cannot find a home health \nagency that will care for them. This means they will either not receive \nthe care they need, or that they will get this care, they'll just get \nit at more expensive and intimidating facilities like hospitals or \nnursing homes. This is the crisis we are facing.\n  I would like to take a moment to describe several different ways this \nhome health crisis is rearing its ugly head across the country.\n  First, we have seen literally thousands of home health agencies close \ntheir doors in the last two years. Perhaps as many as 2,000 of the \n10,000 agencies that existed in 1997 have either been driven out of \nbusiness or out of Medicare. In Missouri alone, about 75 out of 300 \nhome health agencies have closed since 1997, including the well-\nrespected and well-established Visiting Nurse Association of Greater \nSt. Louis. A few of the agencies that have closed have no doubt been \nshady characters we should be glad to see go. But many--and perhaps \nmost--of the agencies that have closed are legitimate providers with \nreal patients.\n  Second, those agencies that have survived have had to change \ndrastically the way they operate. Many have been forced into layoffs \nand cutbacks in other areas that directly or indirectly impact patient \ncare. Many face chronic cash flow problems and may be forced to refund \nlarge amounts of cash to the Health Care Financing Administration--\nperhaps in the hundreds of thousands of dollars--that they accidentally \nreceived because they had not yet been informed of the new ground rules \nfor home health payments. Because of the bizarre incentives against \ncaring for patients with the most complex cases, many home health \nagencies have also been actively managing the types of patients they \ncare for, trying to avoid or discharge costlier patients.\n  All of this is bad for patients, and it will likely get worse. \nWithout Congressional action, it may never get better. I truly believe \nthat without significant changes, home health services within Medicare \ncould practically disappear. Home health services would theoretically \nstill be part of the Medicare program, but few if any people with \nMedicare would be able to receive care in their home simply because \nthere will be nobody there to provide it for them.\n  The Medicare Home Health Equity Act--which I am introducing today \nwith Senator Collins and 12 other colleagues--responds to this crisis \nand attempts to save home health care within the Medicare program.\n  This bill addresses a variety of payment and regulatory issues, all \nof which have impeded or prevented home health agencies from providing \nhigh-quality, efficient care. Two provisions are particularly critical.\n  First, as I have mentioned, home health agencies currently have \nlittle incentive to provide care for sicker and costlier patients. In \nfact, because more complex patients put an agency at risk of exceeding \nthe annual per patient budget that is now in place for each home health \nagency, there is actually an incentive not to care for sicker patients. \nThe result--which shouldn't be a surprise--is that home health agencies \nare actively trying to avoid these sicker patients, either leaving them \nwithout care or leaving them to check in to a more expensive health \nfacility such as a nursing home or a hospital.\n  The Medicare Home Health Equity Act solves this problem by creating a \nsystem of ``extra'' payments for sicker patients--sometimes these are \ncalled ``outlier'' payments. Under this plan, home health agencies \nwould be assured from the start that they could receive extra payments \nfor patients who meet the criteria for ``sicker'' patients. This way, \nwe can remove the incentive for home health agencies to try to deny \ncare to seniors with complex cases.\n  The second crucial provision in the bill is something similar to a \nlast-minute pardon from the governor. In addition to all of the \nproblems they have faced in the last couple of years, home health \nagencies are scheduled to take another huge payment cut--about 15% of \nthe total amount they receive from Medicare--in October of 2000. I fear \nthat this cut would truly be the death-knell for the industry. We \ncannot allow this radical payment reduction to take place.\n  In addition to these core provisions, the Collins-Bond bill deals \nwith a variety of payment and regulatory issues, all designed to make \nsure that Medicare recipients continue to have access to quality home \nhealth care and that the home health agencies are permitted to provide \nthat care in an efficient manner.\n  I would like to commend Senator Collins for her leadership on this \nissue. I am pleased that we were able to develop a joint bill so that \nwe could unite our forces behind one bipartisan legislative vehicle and \none bipartisan solution. It is also encouraging to see that all of the \nnational trade associations that represent home health agencies are \nsupporting this bill. Finally, I would like to again thank this bill's \ncosponsors for supporting this effort and for helping to raise \nawareness that there is a home health crisis that desperately needs our \nattention in Congress.\n  I for one pledge to do my best to maintain seniors access to home \nhealth care. We cannot allow home health services within the Medicare \nprogram to disappear. It doesn't make sense for the patients, and it \ndoesn't make sense for Medicare.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1311. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to establish an eleventh region of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, comprised solely of the State of Alaska; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                             EPA REGION 11\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto create a new regional office for the Environmental Protection Agency \nto be based in Alaska. I have been concerned for some time about the \nrelationship between the federal government and my constituents. Alaska \nhas always provided unique challenges for federal regulators. Its \nweather, remoteness, and the special problems caused by them have often \nresulted in a disconnect between federal regulators and my state. \nCurrently, Alaska is part of Region 10 of the EPA based in Seattle. \nWhile it rains a lot in Seattle, the environment of Washington state is \nmuch more similar to Oregon and Idaho than Alaska. Alaska comprises 17% \nof America's total size and faces climactic extremes unheard of in the \nlower 48.\n\n[[Page S7942]]\n\n  For example, many people have heard that the unique geography of Los \nAngeles creates extreme atmospheric inversion conditions that \ncontributes to its air pollution. However, I have been told that my \nhome town of Fairbanks actually has a greater inversion problem than \nnot only Los Angeles, but also anywhere else in the world except for \nthe South Pole.\n  I also believe that the cost issue is an important one since creation \nof a regional office would lower the tremendous travel and temporary \nduty costs faced by lower 48 based EPA staff who must fly back and \nforth to Alaska. Basing them in Alaska should significantly reduce \nthese travel costs.\n  I recognize that some may feel that the creation of a new regional \noffice in Alaska is unwise. I would point out that I do not believe \nthat the Seattle office has regularly handled Alaska issues poorly, but \nI do believe that these issues could be handled better if there was a \nregional office located in Alaska. Alaska faces wetland challenges like \nno other state. Our nation has seen a tremendous loss in wetlands in \nstates such as California that has lost over 80% of its original \nwetlands. In comparison, Alaska has lost less than half of one percent \nof our nation's wetlands due to development even though we are a large \nproducer of our nation's natural resources. Alaska is a state where \nwetlands banking is not an appropriate solution to address the loss of \nwetlands in California. Alaska's wetlands are also very different than \nthose found in California or anywhere else in our nation. Much of \nAlaska's wetlands are frozen for all but a few months of the year.\n  Even the Clean Air Act has a different application in Alaska. Low \nsulfur diesel in the lower 48 for on-road usage is not appropriate for \nmy state where the percentage of diesel used for on-road uses is \nminuscule compared to that of the off-road uses. This situation is \nreversed in every other state. Fortunately, the EPA has seen fit to \nwaive the low sulfur diesel requirement until a new lower national \nstandard for both off and on-road diesel is in place during the next \ndecade. However, we need to ensure that all federal regulations put \ninto place reflect the realities of every state in our nation. Creation \nof a new Alaska based regional office of the EPA would be a firm step \nforward towards this goal.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis bill in order to make the EPA more efficient and responsive to \nsome unique environmental challenges in my state.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF EPA REGION FOR ALASKA.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall establish--\n       (1) an eleventh region of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, comprised solely of the State of Alaska; and\n       (2) a regional office for the region located in the State.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url":

COCHRAN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 128\n\n       Whereas arts literacy is a fundamental purpose of schooling \n     for all students;\n       Whereas arts education stimulates, develops and refines \n     many cognitive and creative skills, critical thinking and \n     nimbleness in judgment, creativity and imagination, \n     cooperative decisionmaking, leadership, high-level literacy \n     and communication, and the capacity for problem posing and \n     problem-solving;\n       Whereas arts education contributes significantly to the \n     creation of flexible, adaptable, and knowledgeable workers \n     who will be needed in the 21st century economy;\n       Whereas arts education improves teaching and learning;\n       Whereas when parents and families, artists, arts \n     organizations, businesses, local civic and cultural leaders, \n     and institutions are actively engaged in instructional \n     programs, arts education is more successful;\n       Whereas effective teachers of the arts should be encouraged \n     to continue to learn and grow in mastery of their art form as \n     well as in their teaching competence;\n       Whereas the 1999 study, entitled ``Gaining the Arts \n     Advantage: Lessons from School Districts that Value Arts \n     Education'', found that the literacy, education, programs, \n     learning and growth described in the preceding clauses \n     contribute to successful districtwide arts education;\n       Whereas the 1997 National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress reported that students lack sufficient opportunity \n     for participatory learning in the arts;\n       Whereas educators, schools, students, and other community \n     members recognize the importance of arts education; and\n       Whereas arts programs, arts curriculum, and other arts \n     activities in schools across the Nation should be encouraged \n     and publicly recognized: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ARTS EDUCATION MONTH.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates March 2000, as ``Arts Education Month''; and\n       (2) encourages schools, students, educators, parents, and \n     other community members to engage in activities designed to--\n       (A) celebrate the positive impact and public benefits of \n     the arts;\n       (B) encourage all schools to integrate the arts into the \n     school curriculum;\n       (C) spotlight the relationship between the arts and student \n     learning;\n       (D) demonstrate how community involvement in the creation \n     and implementation of arts policies enriches schools;\n       (E) recognize school administrators and faculty who provide \n     quality arts education to students;\n       (F) provide professional development opportunities in the \n     arts for teachers;\n       (G) create opportunities for students to experience the \n     relationship between participation in the arts and developing \n     the life skills necessary for future personal and \n     professional success;\n       (H) increase, encourage, and ensure comprehensive, \n     sequential arts learning for all students;\n       (I) honor individual, class, and student group achievement \n     in the arts; and\n       (J) increase awareness and accessibility to live \n     performances, and original works of art.\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a Senate \nResolution to designate March, 2000 as Arts Education Month. This \nlegislation complements S. 1293, the Congressional Recognition for \nExcellence in Arts Education Act, which I introduced earlier this week.\n  Instruction in music, visual arts, theater and dance occurs in \nschools across the nation. There is growing awareness of arts education \nas a serious academic subject with a list of benefits that include \nensuring America's arts traditions, higher I.Q.'s, better SAT scores, \nbetter math and language skills, less juvenile delinquency, better \nchances of\n\n[[Page S7944]]\n\nhigher education, and increased job opportunities.\n  The National Assessment of Education Progress, The College Board, The \nU.S. Department of Justice, The National Endowment for the Arts, and \nscientific research on the brain have all recently reported evidence of \nthe multiple advantages of arts instruction. For example, the July 5, \n1999 issue of Time magazine has a report titled, ``Fingers, Brains and \nMozart'' which highlights recent brain research and the positive \neffects of music instruction.\n  It is time for the United States Senate to recognize the achievements \nand efforts in arts education in all schools. I hope that by \ndesignating March, 2000 as Arts Education Month, more schools will \nengage in activities that showcase celebrate, reward and provide new \narts experiences.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me in sponsoring Arts Education \nMonth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7944-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 129--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES FOR YEARS OCTOBER 1, \n1999 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 AND OCTOBER 1, 2000 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2001 BY \n             THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nreported the following original resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 128, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following \n     new title:\n\n     TITLE--INTERNATIONAL TRAFFICKING OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN VICTIM \n                               PROTECTION\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``International Trafficking \n     of Women and Children Victim Protection Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The worldwide trafficking of persons has a \n     disproportionate impact on women and girls and has been and \n     continues to be condemned by the international community as a \n     violation of fundamental human rights.\n       (2) The fastest growing international trafficking business \n     is the trade in women, whereby women and girls seeking a \n     better life, a good marriage, or a lucrative job abroad, \n     unexpectedly find themselves in situations of forced \n     prostitution, sweatshop labor, exploitative domestic \n     servitude, or battering and extreme cruelty.\n       (3) Trafficked women and children, girls and boys, are \n     often subjected to rape and other forms of sexual abuse by \n     their traffickers and often held as virtual prisoners by \n     their exploiters, made to work in slavery-like conditions, in \n     debt bondage without pay and against their will.\n       (4) The President, the First Lady, the Secretary of State, \n     the President's Interagency Council on Women, and the Agency \n     for International Development have all identified trafficking \n     in women as a significant problem.\n       (5) The Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing \n     Conference) called on all governments to take measures, \n     including legislative measures, to provide better protection \n     of the rights of women and girls in trafficking, to address \n     the root factors that put women and girls at risk to \n     traffickers, and to take measures to dismantle the national, \n     regional, and international networks on trafficking.\n       (6) The United Nations General Assembly, noting its concern \n     about the increasing number of women and girls who are being \n     victimized by traffickers, passed a resolution in 1998 \n     calling upon all governments to criminalize trafficking in \n     women and girls in all its forms and to penalize all those \n     offenders involved, while ensuring that the victims of these \n     practices are not penalized.\n       (7) Numerous treaties to which the United States is a party \n     address government obligations to combat trafficking, \n     including such treaties as the 1956 Supplementary Convention \n     on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions \n     and Practices Similar to Slavery, which calls for the \n     complete abolition of debt bondage and servile forms of \n     marriage, and the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labor Convention, \n     which undertakes to suppress and requires signatories not to \n     make use of any forced or compulsory labor.\n\n     SEC. __03. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to condemn and combat the \n     international crime of trafficking in women and children and \n     to assist the victims of this crime by--\n       (1) setting a standard by which governments are evaluated \n     for their response to trafficking and their treatment of \n     victims;\n       (2) authorizing and funding an interagency task force to \n     carry out such evaluations and to issue an annual report of \n     its findings to\n\n[[Page S7948]]\n\n     include the identification of foreign governments that \n     tolerate or participate in trafficking and fail to cooperate \n     with international efforts to prosecute perpetrators;\n       (3) assisting trafficking victims in the United States by \n     providing humanitarian assistance and by providing them \n     temporary nonimmigrant status in the United States;\n       (4) assisting trafficking victims abroad by providing \n     humanitarian assistance; and\n\n     SEC. __04.

Their work demonstrates the significant impact that \n     USAID support of a U.S. non-governmental organization (NGO) \n     program can have on the key U.S. foreign policy priorities of \n     promoting broad-based, stable economic growth and open, \n     market-oriented economies in transitioning economies. By \n     drawing upon the skills and voluntary spirit of U.S. \n     businessmen and women to introduce companies, CDC furthers \n     the goals of the Freedom of Support Act (NIS) and Support for \n     Eastern European Democracy (SEED), forging positive, lasting \n     connections between the U.S. and these countries. The \n     Committee endorses CDC's very cost-effective programs and \n     believes they should be supported and expanded not only in \n     the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, but in \n     transitioning and developing economies throughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7950-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SEWAGE TREATMENT FACILITY--SISTERS, OREGON\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        SMITH AMENDMENT NO. 1126\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill (S. 416) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to \nconvey to the city of Sisters, Oregon, a certain parcel of land for use \nin connection with a sewage treatment facility; as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 12, strike the quotation marks.\n       On page 3, line 14, strike ``the following''.\n       At the end, add the following:\n       ``(e) Authority To Acquire Land in Substitution.--Subject \n     to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary shall \n     acquire land within Oregon, and within or in the vicinity of \n     the Deschutes National Forest, of an acreage equivalent to \n     that of the land conveyed under subsection (a).

(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Since the development of antibiotics in the 1950s, \n     tuberculosis has been largely controlled in the United States \n     and the Western World.\n       (2) Due to societal factors, including growing urban decay, \n     inadequate health care systems, persistent poverty, \n     overcrowding, and malnutrition, as well as medical factors, \n     including the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the emergence of multi-\n     drug resistant strains of tuberculosis, tuberculosis \n     has again become a leading and growing cause of adult \n     deaths in the developing world.\n       (3) According to the World Health Organization\n       (A) in 1998, about 1,860,000 people worldwide died of \n     tuberculosis-related illnesses;\n       (B) one-third of the world's total population is infected \n     with tuberculosis; and\n       (C) tuberculosis is the world's leading killer of women \n     between 15 and 44 years old and is a leading cause of \n     children becoming orphans.\n       (4) Because of the ease of transmission of tuberculosis, \n     its international persistence and growth pose a direct public \n     health threat to those nations that had previously largely \n     controlled the disease. This is complicated in the United \n     States by the growth of the homeless population, the rate of \n     incarceration, international travel, immigration, and HIV/\n     AIDS.\n       (5) With nearly 40 percent of the tuberculosis cases in the \n     United States attributable to foreign-born persons, \n     tuberculosis will never be eliminated in the United States \n     until it is controlled abroad.\n       (6) The means exist to control tuberculosis through \n     screening, diagnosis, treatment, patient compliance, \n     monitoring, and ongoing review of outcomes.\n       (7) Efforts to control tuberculosis are complicated by \n     several barriers, including--\n       (A) the labor intensive and lengthy process involved in \n     screening, detecting, and treating the disease;\n       (B) a lack of funding, trained personnel, and medicine in \n     virtually every nation with a high rate of the disease; and\n       (C) the unique circumstances in each country, which \n     requires the development and implementation of country-\n     specific programs.\n       (8) Eliminating the barriers to the international control \n     of tuberculosis through a well-structured, comprehensive, and \n     coordinated worldwide effort would be a significant step in \n     dealing with the increasing public health problem posed by \n     the disease.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that if the total allocation for this Act is higher than the \n     level passed by the Senate, a top priority for the additional \n     funds should be to increase the funding to combat infectious \n     diseases, especially tuberculosis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       CLELAND AMENDMENT NO. 1163\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for Mr. Cleland) proposed as amendment to the bill, S. \n1234, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AN INTERNATIONAL \n                   CONFERENCE ON THE BALKANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and its allies in the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) conducted large-scale military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (2) At the conclusion of 78 days of these hostilities, the \n     United States and its NATO allies suspended military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia based \n     upon credible assurances by the latter that it would fulfill \n     the following conditions as laid down by the so called Group \n     of Eight (G-8):\n       (A) An immediate and verifiable end of violence and \n     repression in Kosovo.\n       (B) Staged withdrawal of all Yugoslav military, police, and \n     paramilitary forces from Kosovo.\n       (C) Deployment in Kosovo of effective international and \n     security presences, endorsed and adopted by the United \n     Nations Security Council, and capable of guaranteeing the \n     achievement of the agreed objectives.\n       (D) Establishment of an interim administration for Kosovo, \n     to be decided by the United Nations Security Council which \n     will seek to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life \n     for all inhabitants in Kosovo.\n       (E) Provision for the safe and free return of all refugees \n     and displaced persons from Kosovo and an unimpeded access to \n     Kosovo by humanitarian aid organizations.\n       (3) These objectives appear to have been fulfilled, or to \n     be in the process of being fulfilled, which has led the \n     United States and its NATO allies to terminate military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (4) The G-8 also called for a comprehensive approach to the \n     economic development and stabilization of the crisis region, \n     and the European Union has announced plans for $1,500,000,000 \n     over the next 3 years for the reconstruction of Kosovo, for \n     the convening in July of an international donors' conference \n     for Kosovo aid, and for subsequent provision of \n     reconstruction aid to the other countries in the region \n     affected by the recent hostilities followed by reconstruction \n     aid directed at the Balkans region as a whole.\n       (5) The United States and some of its NATO allies oppose \n     the provision of any aid, other than limited humanitarian \n     assistance, to Serbia until Yugoslav President Slobodan \n     Milosevic is out of office.\n       (6) The policy of providing reconstruction aid to Kosovo \n     and other countries in the region affected by the recent \n     hostilities while withholding such aid for Serbia presents a \n     number of practical problems, including the absence in Kosovo \n     of financial and other institutions independent of \n     Yugoslavia, the difficulty in drawing clear and enforceable \n     distinctions between humanitarian and reconstruction \n     assistance, and the difficulty in reconstructing Montenegro \n     in the absence of similar efforts in Serbia.\n       (7) In any case, the achievement of effective and durable \n     economic reconstruction and revitalization in the countries \n     of the Balkans is unlikely until a political settlement is \n     reached as to the final status of Kosovo and Yugoslavia.\n       (8) The G-8 proposed a political process towards the \n     establishment of an interim political framework agreement for \n     a substantial self-government for Kosovo, taking into full \n     account the final Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-\n     Government in Kosovo, also known as the Rambouillet Accords, \n     and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity \n     of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other countries \n     of the region, and the demilitarization of the UCK (Kosovo \n     Liberation Army).\n       (9) The G-8 proposal contains no guidance as to a final \n     political settlement for Kosovo and Yugoslavia, while the \n     original position of the United States and the other \n     participants in the so-called Contact Group on this matter, \n     as reflected in the Rambouillet Accords, called for the \n     convening of an international conference, after 3 years, to \n     determine a mechanism for a final settlement of Kosovo status \n     based on the will of the people, opinions of relevant \n     authorities, each Party's efforts regarding the \n     implementation of the agreement and the provisions of the \n     Helsinki Final Act.\n       (10) The current position of the United States and its NATO \n     allies as to the final status of Kosovo and Yugoslavia calls \n     for an autonomous, multiethnic, democratic Kosovo which would \n     remain as part of Serbia, and such an outcome is not \n     supported by any of the Parties directly involved, including \n     the governments of Yugoslavia and Serbia, representatives of \n     the Kosovar Albanians, and the people of Yugoslavia, Serbia \n     and Kosovo.\n       (11) There has been no final political settlement in \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the Armed Forces of the United \n     States, its NATO allies, and other non-Balkan nations have \n     been enforcing an uneasy peace since 1996, at a cost to the \n     United States alone of over $10,000,000,000, with no clear \n     end in sight to such enforcement.\n       (12) The trend throughout the Balkans since 1990 has been \n     in the direction of ethnically based particularism, as \n     exemplified by the 1991 declarations of independence from \n     Yugoslavia by Slovenia and Croatia, and the country in the \n     Balkans which currently comes the closest to the goal of a \n     democratic government which respects the human rights of its \n     citizens is the nation of Slovenia, which was the first \n     portion of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to \n     secede and is also the nation in the region with the greatest \n     ethnic homogeneity, with a population which is 91 percent \n     Slovene.\n       (13) The boundaries of the various national and sub-\n     national divisions in the Balkans have been altered \n     repeatedly throughout history, and international conferences \n     have frequently played the decisive role in fixing such \n     boundaries in the modern era, including the Berlin Congress \n     of 1878, the London Conference of 1913, and the Paris Peace \n     Conference of 1919.\n       (14) The development of an effective exit strategy for the \n     withdrawal from the Balkans of foreign military forces, \n     including the armed forces of the United States, its NATO \n     allies, Russia, and any other nation from outside the Balkans \n     which has such forces in the Balkans is in the best interests \n     of all such nations.\n       (15) The ultimate withdrawal of foreign military forces, \n     accompanied by the establishment of durable and peaceful \n     relations among all of the nations and peoples of the Balkans \n     is in the best interests of those nations and peoples.\n\n[[Page S7957]]\n\n       (16) An effective exit strategy for the withdrawal from the \n     Balkans of foreign military forces is contingent upon the \n     achievement of a lasting political settlement for the region, \n     and that only such a settlement, acceptable to all parties \n     involved, can ensure the fundamental goals of the United \n     States of peace, stability, and human rights in the Balkans;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should call immediately for the \n     convening of an international conference on the Balkans, \n     under the auspices of the United Nations, and based upon the \n     principles of the Rambouillet Accords for a final settlement \n     of Kosovo status, namely that such a settlement should be \n     based on the will of the people, opinions of relevant \n     authorities, each Party's efforts regarding the \n     implementation of the agreement and the provisions of the \n     Helsinki Final Act;\n       (2) the international conference on the Balkans should also \n     be empowered to seek a final settlement for Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina based on the same principles as specified for \n     Kosovo in the Rambouillet Accords; and\n       (3) in order to produce a lasting political settlement in \n     the Balkans acceptable to all parties, which can lead to the \n     departure from the Balkans in timely fashion of all foreign \n     military forces, including those of the United States, the \n     international conference should have the authority to \n     consider any and all of the following: political boundaries; \n     humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for all nations in \n     the Balkans; stationing of United Nations peacekeeping forces \n     along international boundaries; security arrangements and \n     guarantees for all of the nations of the Balkans; and \n     tangible, enforceable and verifiable human rights guarantees \n     for the individuals and peoples of the Balkans.\n

Over the last decade, 35,000 \n     Colombians have been killed.\n       (6) The FARC and ELN are the two main guerilla groups which \n     have waged the longest-running anti-government insurgency in \n     Latin America.\n       (7) The Colombian rebels have a combined strength of 10,000 \n     to 20,000 full-time guerillas; they have initiated armed \n     action in nearly 700 of the country's 1073 municipalities, \n     and control or influence roughly 60 percent of rural Colombia \n     including a demilitarized zone using their armed stranglehold \n     to abuse Colombian citizens.\n       (8) Although the Colombian Army has 122,000 soldiers, there \n     are roughly only 20,000 soldiers available for offensive \n     combat operations.\n       (9) Colombia faces the threat of the armed paramilitaries, \n     5,000 strong, who are constantly driving a wedge in the place \n     process by their insistence in participating in the peace \n     talks.\n       (10) More than 75 percent of the world's cocaine HCL and 75 \n     percent of the heroin seized in the northeast United States \n     is of Colombian origin.\n       (11) The conflicts in Colombia are creating spillovers to \n     the border countries of Venezuela, Panama and Equador: \n     Venezuela has sent 30,000 troops to its border and Ecuador is \n     sending 10,000 troops to its border.\n       (12) Venezuela is our number one supplier of oil.\n       (13) By the end of 1999, all U.S. military troops will have \n     departed from Panama, leaving the Panama Canal unprotected.\n       (14) In 1998, two-way trade between the United States and \n     Colombia was more than $11 billion, making the United States \n     Colombia's number one trading partner and Colombia the fifth \n     largest market for U.S. exports in the region.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should recognize the crisis in \n     Colombia and play a more pro-active role in its resolution;\n       (2) the United States should mobilize the international \n     community to pro-actively engage in resolving Colombian wars; \n     and\n       (3) pledge our political support to help Colombia with the \n     peace process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      REID AMENDMENT NO. 1172\n  Mr. LEAHY (for Mr. Reid) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1234, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President and the \n     Secretary of State should--\n       (1) raise the need for accountability of Saddam Hussein and \n     several key members of his regime at the International \n     Criminal Court Preparatory Commission, which will meet in New \n     York on July 26, 1999, through August 13, 1999;\n       (2) continue to push for the creation of a commission under \n     the auspices of the United Nations to establish an \n     international record of the criminal culpability of Saddam \n     Hussein and other Iraqi officials;\n       (3) continue to push for the United Nations to form an \n     international criminal tribunal for the purpose of indicting, \n     prosecuting, and imprisoning Saddam Hussein and any other \n     Iraqi officials who may be found responsible for crimes \n     against humanity, genocide, and other violations of \n     international humanitarian law; and\n       (4) upon the creation of a commission and international \n     criminal tribunal, take steps necessary, including the \n     reprogramming of funds, to ensure United States support for \n     efforts to bring Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials to \n     justice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BIDEN AMENDMENT NO. 1173\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for Mr. Biden) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1234, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following section:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, on the evening of Tuesday, May 18, 1999, \nthe distinguished Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and \nmy good friend, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, received the Eisenhower \nWorld Affairs Institute's annual Leadership Award in recognition of his \noutstanding lifetime accomplishments. This is indeed an honor Ted \nrichly deserves. Ted has dedicated his life to public service, and \nembodies the values, commitment and integrity that were the hallmark of \nformer President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It is an honor to work with such \nan able legislator, particularly on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, where Ted's leadership has earned him the respect of his \nSenate colleagues. Ted is a great American and serves this institution \nwell. I was delighted to be part of the evening's festivities. I would \nlike to share with my Senate colleagues and all Americans, Senator Ted \nStevens' remarks upon the acceptance of the Eisenhower Leadership \nAward. I ask that the full text of Senator Stevens' remarks be printed \nin the Congressional Record.\n  The remarks follow.\n\n  Senator Ted Stevens' Remarks at the Eisenhower WordD Affairs Dinner \n      Upon Receiving the Eisenhower Leadership Prise, May 18, 1999\n\n       This is a very unexpected honor. Thanks to Rocco Siciliano \n     and to my departed friend, Al McDermott, who served as \n     Assistant to Ike's Secretary of Labor--a special friend who \n     would be pleased that his wife, Krieks, is here. Al, under \n     Ike's command, drove his LCT to Omaha Beach in Normandy on D-\n     Day.\n       Alaska's small population seems to be here--the effort all \n     Alaskans made to come so far to share this night means a lot \n     to me. Catherine and I are especially pleased that Lily, soon \n     to be on the Farm at Stanford, is here, together with \n     Catherine's sister, Judi.\n       This evening overwhelms me. Friends are here from almost \n     every phase of my life.\n       Russ Green and I met in California when we were 14. We \n     traveled far to be with each other for brief periods during \n     WWII. Russ still lives in California--he was our best man in \n     1952 when Ann and I were married.\n       George Reycraft has been a companion since 1947, when we \n     started law school. Catherine, Lily and I have spent \n     Thanksgiving with George since 1980. Roemer McPhee and Burton \n     Wood were with us at law school.\n       Bill Ewald served in the Interior Department before going \n     to the White House to become Ike's biographer. Donna DeVarona \n     and I were on President Ford's Commission on Amateur Sports--\n     she encouraged me and assisted me when Congress enacted my \n     Amateur Sports Act. Sandra Day and John O'Connor are \n     Arizonans from a ranching family like Catherine's mother, \n     Ellie. Tony Motley and Judy--Tony and I survived a Lear Jet \n     crash in 1978--that's a bond that is never broken.\n       My constant companions in Alaska--and anywhere the fishing \n     is good--are my brother-in-law Bill Bittner, Chuck Robinson, \n     Bill Allen and my long-time friend and traveling companion, \n     Marshall Coyne. General Joe Ralston and Dede have been close \n     friends since he commanded our 11th Air Force in Alaska--they \n     too are Alaska residents. Throughout this room are members of \n     the Senate staff with whom I have worked. I thank each of you \n     for coming.\n       And, I thank Senators Bennett, Inouye, Specter and Warner--\n     and Elizabeth Letchworth, Secretary to the Majority, who made \n     certain there were no votes tonight.\n       I am filled with awe and trepidation when the list of past \n     recipients of this award is read. I was a foot soldier in \n     Ike's battle to ``Wage Peace.'' To follow President Bush, \n     Colin Powell, Bob Dole, Lloyd Bentsen, and Brent Scowcroft is \n     an honor that takes my breath away.\n       Those previous recipients spoke much about Ike. George Bush \n     said:\n       ``I think every person in my generation, certainly every \n     product of WWII, who witnessed his dedication to duty and the \n     devotion with which he undertook his many weighty \n     responsibilities, feels exactly the same way I do. In a \n     sense, Eisenhower was like a guardian to us. Certainly, he \n     was a hero figure before he became President of the United \n     States.''\n       Bob Dole remembered that of ``the four federal balanced \n     budgets in the last half of this century, Ike gave us three \n     of them''.\n       Colin Powell told us of the Eisenhower Corridor in the \n     Pentagon where, among the President's treasures, is his \n     portrait and as Colin said the ``simple, but oh so eloquent, \n     final words Ike spoke before his death, `I've always loved my \n     wife. I've always loved my children. I've always loved my \n     grandchildren. I've always loved my country.' ''\n       I have made many statements on the Senate Floor about \n     President Eisenhower. After Ike died in 1969, my comments as \n     a freshman Senator reminded Americans the President held a \n     special place in the hearts of Alaskans. To our 34th \n     President, statehood for Alaska was a matter of simple \n     justice. And, when he listed the accomplishments of his \n     administration, statehood for Alaska and Hawaii appeared \n     first. Alaska first sought statehood in 1913. Two world wars \n     interrupted our quest. After WWII, Hawaii joined the fight. \n     Congress considered Hawaii's bill first, but proponents of \n     Alaska amended their bill and added Alaska, resulting in the \n     defeat of both.\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\n       Democrats in Congress were certain Alaska would be a solid \n     state for them; Republicans knew Hawaii was certain to be \n     solidly for them. Neither state has followed such \n     predictions.\n       In 1950, General Eisenhower said, ``. . . quick admission \n     of Alaska and Hawaii to statehood would show the world that \n     America practices what it preaches.''\n       However, in ``Eisenhower the President,'' Bill Ewald \n     reported, ``One day in Ike's first term, Orme Lewis, \n     Assistant Secretary of the Interior, cautiously entered the \n     Oval Office with Secretary Douglas McKay. `What do you want \n     to talk to me about?' The President asked. `Statehood for \n     Alaska,' McKay replied. `Well, it better be goddamn good,' \n     the President shot back.''\n       Ike was under Department of Defense pressure to oppose \n     Alaska statehood. Explaining that his 1950 statement \n     endorsing Alaska statehood was made before he had \n     Presidential responsibility, in his first term Ike urged that \n     Hawaii be admitted, but not Alaska.\n       This was at the height of the Cold War. Many WWII veterans \n     went north to find a new life, including my wife Ann and me. \n     Only 206,000 people, including military, lived in our \n     Territory. Anyone could enter Alaska without a passport, but \n     when we went to the ``South 48,'' our own Immigration Service \n     demanded a passport from everyone, or at least a birth \n     certificate and we, like Americans before us, found taxation \n     without representation downright un-American! It was \n     demeaning to those of us who had fought WWII. We wanted \n     Congress to listen to Ike and show America does practice what \n     it preaches.\n       Alaskans called a Constitutional Convention; we adopted a \n     Constitution for a new state and we also adopted the \n     ``Tennessee Plan.'' Tennessee, when it sought statehood, \n     elected two Senators and a Congressman, then sent them to \n     Washington, D.C. to demand statehood.\n       In mid-1956, I arrived back in Washington, D.C. to become \n     Legislative Counsel at the Interior Department. President \n     Eisenhower had just appointed as Secretary of the Interior \n     Fred Seaton, Publisher of the Hastings Tribune, who had \n     served briefly as one of Nebraska's Senators.\n       Alaska's newspaper publishers, particularly my friends Bill \n     Snedden of the Fairbanks News-Miner and Bob Atwood of the \n     Anchorage Times, knew Fred well and urged me to accept the \n     appointment.\n       In many ways, statehood for Alaska and Hawaii was a triumph \n     for newspaper publishers. Snedden and Atwood visited almost \n     every news entity in the United States from Bill Hearst to \n     Henry R. Luce of Time, Inc. From hundreds of daily, weekly \n     and monthly newspapers and magazines, editorial and even \n     financial support poured in. Seaton's own Western Farm Life, \n     plus his papers, radio and television stations in Wyoming, \n     Colorado and Nebraska, were all active in this endeavor.\n       Alaskans found their national champion for statehood in \n     Fred Seaton. His maiden speech on the Senate Floor was an \n     impassioned plea for immediate action on the Alaska bill. \n     (I've always believed it was ghostwritten by Bill Snedden.)\n       At Interior, I joined friends with whom I had worked here \n     in D.C. as a volunteer in Ike's 1952 campaign, preparing \n     position papers on natural resource and western issues. \n     Later, at the 1956 Republican Convention, working behind the \n     scenes with Fred Seaton, Alaskans and Hawaiians obtained a \n     provision in our Platform pledging action on both statehood \n     bills.\n       During the campaign, on September 11, 1956, the President \n     said:\n       ``Now, Alaska is a very great area, there are few people in \n     it, and they are confined almost exclusively in the southeast \n     corner.\n       ``Could there be a way worked out where the areas necessary \n     for defense requirements could be retained under Federal \n     control in the great outlying regions and a State made out of \n     that portion in which the population is concentrated, it \n     would seem to be a good solution to the problem.\n       ``But, the great and vast area is completely dependent upon \n     the United States for protection, and it is necessary to us \n     in our defense arrangements.''\n       That statement led Secretary Seaton and me to meet in 1957 \n     in Fred's hospital room with General Nate Twining, Chairman \n     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, one of Ike's favorite military \n     advisors. With Twining was Jack Stempler, then in charge of \n     legislation for DoD. Jack told me just this past week, \n     ``Legislation is spawned in many places in D.C., but I wonder \n     how many legislative solutions came from a hospital room?''\n       Secretary Seaton was in traction because of a bad back. We \n     showed him and General Twining the map upon which Ike had \n     drawn a rough line, North and West of which Ike believed \n     there were special defense problems. Twining, who had \n     commanded in Alaska, explained the military reasons for \n     Eisenhower's reservations, particularly the need for \n     unfettered access along the Northern and Western shores of \n     Alaska, obviously defense strategy for opposing the Soviets.\n       The General pointed out Ike remembered that part of \n     Alaska's Aleutian Islands were occupied by the Japanese in \n     World War II and that Alaska's Little Diomede Island in the \n     North Pacific was just two miles from the Soviet's Big \n     Diomede Island.\n       We developed a concept to meet Ike's military concerns, \n     while at the same time admitting the whole territory as a \n     state, drafting a provision to give the President power to \n     make defense withdrawals, in essence creating martial law, \n     taking over all aspects of government in the area North or \n     West of Ike's line. No such power exists in any other state.\n       The Tennessee Plan members--Bill Egan, Ernest Gruening, and \n     Ralph Rivers--later agreed, and Bob Bartlett presented the \n     concept in the House. This was not an easy decision. House \n     Rules Chairman Howard Smith was a dedicated opponent of \n     Alaska. Alaska's statehood bill bypassed his Rules Committee \n     under an old, seldom-used House Rule, which allowed statehood \n     bills to be taken directly to the House Floor. The strategy \n     worked. Alaska's bill passed the House despite repeated \n     attacks from Republicans and Southern Democrats.\n       Senate strategy was to avoid amendments. Had an amendment \n     been adopted, the bill would be returned to the House where \n     Chairman Smith would bury it.\n       In the Senate debate, our provision, known as Section 10, \n     was the principal target of statehood opponents. Senator \n     Eastland, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, led the charge \n     saying:\n       ``I submit that the reservation contained in section 10 is \n     such a condition imposed upon the new State of Alaska as a \n     price for admission in of the Union of States that it does \n     violence to the equal footing doctrine, whereby all the \n     preceding states entering into this Union all entered on \n     equal footing.\n       ``The President of the United States is authorized without \n     a declaration of martial law, to withdraw sovereignty from \n     over half of the area of the State of Alaska.''\n       Senators Thurmond and Russell spoke at length, leaving \n     Majority Leader Mansfield to wonder out loud if there was a \n     filibuster going on.\n       Senator Thurmond objected to any unanimous consent \n     agreement. I remember loud sighs then from Alaskans in the \n     Senate gallery, knowing as we did Strom's capability for long \n     debate. And Strom did speak extremely long and eloquently. \n     Senators Monroney, Fulbright, and Stennis each made motions; \n     all failed. Then Senator Russell, an absolute powerhouse in \n     the Senate, joined Stennis in seeking to refer the bill to \n     the Armed Services Committee. This also failed. Thurmond \n     moved to eliminate a portion of the land in Alaska subject to \n     section 10. That failed by a vote of 16-67. That vote showed \n     enough votes to cut off debate. Soon thereafter, our bill \n     passed, unamended, by a vote of 64-20.\n       I later served in the Senate with those Senators who \n     opposed Alaska vigorously. Each was not only a good friend, \n     but worked hard to help me and our new state.\n       Bill Ewald, when commenting on the passage of the Alaska \n     bill in ``Eisenhower the President,'' rightfully concluded \n     Seaton was a zealot on the subject--and I was a fanatic.\n       Bill also said:\n       ``. . . in the end . . . the greatest glory must go to \n     Eisenhower. He chose his lieutenants, gave them the freedom \n     to think and to innovate, backed them to the hilt despite his \n     qualms, and thus produced an outcome that, in retrospect, \n     remains a triumph of his administration.\n       ``They worked in his name; and history will, and should, \n     honor him for what they did.''\n       The privilege of being near Ike in those days is hard to \n     describe. It wasn't just a battle for Alaska--ten years after \n     Ike approved our Statehood Act, oil was discovered in Alaska. \n     Now 25 percent of all oil produced in the U.S. comes from our \n     North Slope and Cook Inlet. Over 50 percent of all fish \n     landed in the U.S. comes from waters off our shores. \n     Alaska has the highest educated population in this nation. \n     Air Force pilots train above our vast tundra, and our \n     joint Army/Air Force exercises give our defense forces the \n     finest training in the world.\n       Bryce Harlow, the President's assistant for legislative \n     affairs, held weekly meetings every Saturday for the liaison \n     assistants from every Department, reviewing the past week, \n     and planning strategy for the week ahead. Ed McCabe and \n     Roemer McPhee attended some of those meetings. General Jerry \n     Pearson joined us once in a while. Ike often stopped by \n     Harlow's meetings; he'd joke a little, take time to clearly \n     and simply explain what his priorities were, and would always \n     end with a plea to get our work done and go home to our \n     families. Once he told us, ``If you are ever at a dinner here \n     in Washington that lasts beyond ten p.m., go to your hostess \n     and tell her the President needs to see you!'' Ike firmly \n     believed in ``early to bed and early to rise.''\n       I'm sure you join me in saying how happy we are to be with \n     members of the Eisenhower family again--David and Julie, Mary \n     Jean and Susan. Ike's legacy of family love is obviously a \n     code for each of them.\n       In 1982, on the Senate Floor, I discussed Bill Ewald's \n     speech to the Eisenhower Old Guard dinner that year. Bill \n     commented about Ike's calm as the President discussed his \n     decision to send troops into Lebanon just eight days after he \n     signed the Alaska Statehood Bill.\n       Ike told Bill, ``Look, when you appeal to the force, \n     there's just one thing you must never do--that's lose. \n     There's no such thing as a little force. When you use it, you \n     use it overwhelmingly.''\n       Bill closed that speech with a comment with which we all \n     agree:\n       ``Not often in the story of mankind does a man arrive on \n     earth of steel and velvet. Peace unspeakable and perfect.\n       ``Something like that resided in the mind and heart and \n     soul of Dwight Eisenhower. In\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\n     the midst of many threatening clouds it brought us a \n     beautiful golden season of Eisenhower weather.\n       ``For what he did, and above all for what he was, we thank \n     God from the bottom of our hearts tonight.''\n       President Eisenhower's Covenant for Total Peace is known to \n     many of you. It was read by Charlton Heston on the \n     anniversary of D-Day, June 6th 1998, in Philadelphia. \n     Americans who didn't know Ike personally should read it--and \n     know what he did for us, and for the world.\n       I enlisted in General Eisenhower's crusade 50 years ago. \n     And as a member of the Eisenhower Administration, I joined \n     the President in the battle for Alaska statehood. His \n     admonition that ``there is one thing you must never do--\n     lose'' is a principle which continues to guide my public \n     life.\n       Ike will always be my Supreme Commander. His devotion to \n     duty, country, honor have shaped my nearly 50 years of public \n     service. I view the world and my responsibility to it through \n     his prism. Whether it's continuing the battle to ensure the \n     promises of statehood are kept or working side by side with \n     my partner, Dan Inouye, to maintain the strong national \n     defense that Ike helped build, I am honored to continue as a \n     foot soldier in his battle to ``wage peace.''\n       The Crusade I want to join is obvious: In my mind Dwight \n     David Eisenhower must be named the Person of the Twentieth \n     Century. My question is: where do I enlist?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7964-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NED HOMFELD WINS ENTREPRENEUR OF THE YEAR AWARD\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, it is with pride and pleasure that \nI take a moment today to recognize the Anti-Cruelty Society of Chicago \non the occasion of their 100th anniversary. The society's centennial \ncelebration is entitled ``1999--The Anti-Cruelty Society Centennial: A \nLegacy of Caring, A Vision of Hope for the 21st Century,'' and is truly \nan appropriate description of the organization's valuable impact on the \nlives and treatment of the nation's animals.\n  One hundreds years ago, the society's founders, led by Illinois \nresident Mrs. Theodore Thomas, were concerned with inhumane butchery in \nslaughterhouses, the treatment of old sick workhorses, and hundreds of \nthousands of malnourished homeless dogs and cats. In their efforts to \neliminate cruelty to animals, to educate the public on the humane \ntreatment of animals, and to create a refuge for stray animals until \nthey could be placed in good homes, the society achieved impressive \naccomplishments in Illinois and across the nation. In fact, the group \ngave rise to an organization so dynamic that it has impacted and \ncontinues to impact public policy and set the standard of humane \ntreatment for animals worldwide.\n  Once again, I congratulate the Anti-Cruelty Society in Chicago on \ntheir remarkable first 100 years of service, and wish them the best of \nluck as they continue to make a positive impact upon the lives of \nanimals and humans in the many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7964-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MISS MISSOURI 1999\n\n Mr. BOND.

SASSER AS AMBASSADOR TO CHINA\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nthanks and appreciation to Ambassador James Sasser for the excellent \njob he has done as United States ambassador to China. After more than \nthree years of dedicated service, Ambassador Sasser will be stepping \ndown from his position.\n  Ambassador Sasser served during an interesting, often strenuous, \nperiod of U.S.-China relations. Drawing on his experiences as a \ndistinguished three term United States Senator and member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, he worked tirelessly to ensure that the \nUnited States remained engaged with China to promote stability, \nopenness, and prosperity in that country. Even Henry Kissinger, who \ninitially expressed misgivings about Ambassador Sasser's appointment, \nrecently remarked, ``I have known no American ambassador who has done a \nbetter or more passionate job on Sino-U.S. relations than Ambassador \nSasser.''\n  Even during the bad times, when relations soured, Ambassador Sasser \nhas maintained a high level of communication with Chinese leaders and \nprovided a calm and steady influence. He recognized that no single \nissue can make or break U.S.-China relations and that open and frank \ndialogue is essential to promoting American values, especially those in \nthe area of human rights.\n  Though he served with distinction for more than three years, perhaps \nAmbassador Sasser's finest hour came only a few weeks ago. After the \naccidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, tens of \nthousands of angry protesters gathered in front of the American embassy \nin Beijing and hurled bricks and rocks at the building. The situation \nwas dangerously close to spinning out of control and the lives of those \ninside the embassy were potentially in danger. Rather than seek cover \nin a safer place, Ambassador Sasser stayed.\n  Near the end of his service, he provided us with a lasting image of \npoise, strength, and courage. His actions were indeed inspiring to \nthose that were with him in Beijing and also to those of us who were \nwatching as the events unfolded on television. He represented the \nfinest of Americans who serve their country in embassies and consulates \naround the world--he was a diplomat who would not give up his post.\n  Again, I congratulate Ambassador Sasser for a job well done and wish \nhim the best for his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7964-5", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7964-S7965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    KICKOFF OF THE WOMEN'S WORLD CUP\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last week marked the beginning of \nthe 1999 Women's World Cup, a competition that includes the best soccer \nteams from throughout the world. Held every four years since 1991, the \nwomen's World Cup brings together the finest women athletes and allows \nthem to compete at the highest level. It is so wonderful that young \nwomen throughout the world have these role models to look up to--role \nmodels such as our very own charismatic Julie Foudy, working mother Joy \nFawcett, teenage sensation Tiffany Roberts, and veteran superstar \nMichelle Akers.\n  The United States team, which is among the favorites to win the \ntournament, is led by the best women's soccer player of all time: Mia \nHamm. Mia Hamm has scored more international goals than any person--man \nor\n\n[[Page S7965]]\n\nwoman--in the history of the game. It was perfectly fitting that she \nscored the first goal of the tournament by half-volleying a Brandi \nChastain pass into the roof of the net.\n  It is also fitting that Mia Hamm was born in 1972, the same year that \nPresident Nixon signed into law Title IX of the Education Amendments \nAct. This law ensures that federally funded schools provide equal \nathletic opportunity for members of both sexes. Twenty-five years \nlater, the U.S. National Team is one clear sign that this law is a \nsuccess.\n  According to the Women's Sports Foundation, the number of girls who \nparticipate in high school sports since the enactment of Title IX has \nrisen from 300 thousand to 2.37 million. Women are now 37 percent of \ncollege athletes and were 39 percent of the 1996 United States Olympic \nTeam members.\n  The record-breaking crowds this weekend in San Jose and Pasadena \nreveal that the enthusiasm for women's soccer is not restricted to \nplayers only, but is shared by the public. Over 78,000 loyal fans \npacked the seats of Giants Stadium to watch the US-Denmark match, and \nthe weekend ticket sales total of over 134,000 surpassed the 112,000 \nfor the entire 1995 Women's World Cup in Sweden. Ticket sales for the \nCup to date have passed 500,000 and are rapidly growing--potentially \nshattering the 600,000 world record for a sporting event held for \nwomen.\n  The stellar start for the World Cup speaks volumes for the future of \nwomen's soccer. Female soccer players may not have to wait much longer \nto play professionally in the United States. The successful weekend \nattests to the wonderful athletic stars and enthusiastic fans ready, \nwilling and eager to support a women's professional soccer league in \nmajor markets such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Chicago. \nCitizens both domestic and worldwide are watching the Women's World Cup \nwith pride that our teams are pioneering the path to put women's sports \non parity with men's.\n  The impact of gender equality in sports goes far beyond the soccer \nfield and ticket sales. Female student athletes are more likely to \ngraduate from college than students who do not participate in sports, \nwomen who are active in sports and recreational activities as girls \nfeel greater confidence, self-esteem and pride in their physical and \nsocial selves; and 80 percent of women identified as key leaders in \nFortune 500 companies participated in sports during their childhood.\n  The Women's World Cup is also an important way to bring together \ndiverse nations of the world. From North Korea to Canada, from Ghana to \nSweden, everyone shares in the joys of competition and love of the \ngame. Television viewers throughout the world have been introduced to \nmany countries and its players. During the first week of play, we saw \nthe flamboyant Nigerian goalkeeper Ann Chiejinei confidently lead the \n``Super Falcons'' to the second round. The Brazilian one-name wonders \nof Sissi and Preinha brought to mind visions of Pele and Romario in \nscoring the first hat tricks of the tournament. And Norway, which has \nplayed in the previous two World Cup title games, opened its title \ndefense with three impressive victories.\n  So, Mr. President, I will make two predictions. My first prediction \nis that the United States will reclaim their title as women's World Cup \nChampions on July 10, in Pasadena, California. And more importantly, my \nsecond prediction is that generations of women and girls for years to \ncome will continue to thrive because of Title IX.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7965-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HIGHMORE RESEARCH STATION\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my warmest \ncongratulations to the South Dakota State University Central Research \nStation in Highmore, SD.\n  Today the experiment station is celebrating one hundred years of \ndedicated service to the agriculture industry in the Northern Plains. \nIt is an outstanding example of the continued application of \ntechnological advancements by our farmers and ranchers in an ever-\nchanging competitive environment.\n  The Highmore Research Farm, also known as the Central Crops and Soils \nResearch Station, was the first research farm created in the north-\ncentral United States. It was created in 1899 at the request of \nlivestock producers who desired drought-resistant forage plants on the \nprairie. It was determined that a substation was to be established \nbetween the James and Missouri Rivers and a location was eventually \nsecured near Highmore. Initially the work at the experiment station was \ncentered around testing drought-resisting forage and devising ways and \nmeans for livestock producers to obtain winter forage as well. Later, \ncrop production and rotation became an integral part of the research \nstation.\n  Affiliated with South Dakota State University in Brookings, this \nexperiment station has been a leader in providing and conducting state-\nof-the-art agriculture research. In Highmore and at the various other \nSouth Dakota Agricultural Experiment Stations across the state, \nresearchers cover a variety of aspects of agriculture, ranging from \ncrop to livestock production. Over 150 different projects demand the \ntime and effort by these dedicated researchers at this time. Through \nsound science and a problem solving attitude these researchers expand \nthe knowledge base for all of agriculture and those affected by it on a \ndaily basis.\n  In this critical time in production agriculture while depressed crop \nand livestock prices are driving agriculture producers from their \noperations, it is all the more essential that we encourage the research \ntaking place at the experiment stations. As we enter a new millennium \nwe must develop ways for producers to afford and adapt to the \ntechnological advancements that can make United States agriculture more \ncompetitive. This is crucial in order for South Dakota to compete in \nthe ever-changing global market.\n  The research and knowledge gained from these experiment stations \nbenefit not only agriculture producers, but also consumers living in \nrural towns and urban cities. Learning from the past and building \ntowards the future is a daily mission at the Highmore Experiment \nStation. I applaud the efforts of each researcher and all of those who \ndedicated their time and effort to this farm in the last 100 years. I \nextend my best wishes to the Central Research Station in Highmore for \nanother 100 years of successful research and service to South Dakota \nagriculture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7965-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7965-S7966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE HISTORIC CONTRIBUTION OF THE 5TH BOMB WING, MINOT, NORTH DAKOTA, TO \n                         OPERATION ALLIED FORCE\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Secretary of Defense has \ndescribed our military action in Kosovo as the most accurate \napplication of Air Power in history. The men and women of the 5th Bomb \nWing, Minot, North Dakota, were critical to that effort, and the \ncitizens of this state and our entire country are justifiably proud of \ntheir efforts.\n  The B-52 bombing raids on Yugoslavian positions on June 7, 1999, \nundoubtedly hastened the decision by Yugoslavia to sign the NATO peace \nagreement ending the conflict. As the Washington Post reported on the \nsignificance of the strike, ``Two days later, Yugoslav generals \nformally agreed to withdraw all forces from Kosovo.'' The Washington \nPost Article entitled, ``NATO's Most Lethal Airstrike Ended a Battle, \nPerhaps a War,'' reported that the B-52 attack on Mount Pastrik was the \nturning point in the Kosovo conflict.\n  Like the ``Linebacker'' operations in Vietnam, the unmatched striking \npower of the B-52 bomber convinced the enemy that negotiation was \npreferable to suffering the business end of over 70,000 pounds of \nmunitions. The crews of the B-52 bombers that carried out their \nmissions in Kosovo proved the anecdote again, ``That bomber pilots make \nhistory.''\n  In recognizing the efforts of the crews and support personnel of the \n5th Bomb Wing, we cannot forget the sacrifices made by the families and \nloved ones left behind. Today's professional All-Volunteer Air Force is \na different organization than the one that preceded it. More times than \nnot, when an Air Force member deploys, he or she leaves behind a spouse \nand small children who depend on them, who miss them, and who pray for \ntheir safe return. We in the Senate owe a debt of gratitude to those \nbrave families who\n\n[[Page S7966]]\n\nlovingly support the men and women of our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, in every conflict following the Korean War, the B-52 \nbomber has delivered the most debilitating blows to our enemies. As \ndemonstrated in Yugoslavia, the B-52 is still capable of delivering the \ninitial strikes in a conflict with stand-off weapons, and then \nexecuting decisive strikes on fielded forces with a range of munitions.\n  The United States Air Force's plan to fly the B-52 bomber well into \nthe next century is a tribute both to the aircraft and the innovative \ncrews that continue to demonstrate the decisive capabilities of the \naircraft. Most importantly, as long as the Air Force has men and women \nlike those who serve in the 5th Bomb Wing, this nation sleeps well \nprotected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7966-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7966-S7967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 131 submitted \nearlier by Senators Lott and Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 131) relating to the retirement of \n     Ron Kavulick.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, Ron Kavulick, who has faithfully \nserved the United States Senate for 20 years, will officially retire \nfrom the Senate family.\n  It took Ron Kavulick a while to get to the Senate. He worked first as \nan official court reporter for the office of The Judge Advocate \nGeneral, United States Air Force, and later, as an official reporter in \nthe White House--serving Presidents Nixon and Johnson. When he finally \ngot to us, as an Official Reporter of Senate Debates, he advanced \nquickly, ultimately serving as Chief Reporter.\n  As Chief Reporter, Ron oversaw the preparation and editing of the \nproceedings of the Senate for publication in the Congressional Record. \nHis greatest challenge, perhaps, was the impeachment trial of the \nPresident, where Ron's institutional memory and experience were called \nupon throughout the lengthy proceedings. It's all too easy for us to \nassume that capable and dedicated Senate employees, like Ron, will \nalways be here providing abiding support and quiet efficiency.\n  Thomas Carlyle argued that history is the sum of the work of \noutstanding individuals. If so, then Ron Kavulick has contributed much \nto our Senate history. His support to me and my staff will always be \nremembered. I commend Ron for his dedicated service, and wish him and \nhis wife, Pat, many years of health and happiness in retirement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today we honor 20 years of service to the \nSenate by its Chief Reporter, Ron Kavulick. For 16 years, beginning in \n1979, Ron\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\nworked on the Senate floor as a reporter of debates, where he \ndistinguished himself as a friend to everyone and as one who labored \nmightily to accurately report Senators' statements for publication in \nthe Congressional Record. He was a stickler for detail and bent over \nbackwards to make sure every aspect of his work was correct, as he \nstrove to preserve Senate history to its fullest.\n  As a result of his tenacity and dedication, Ron was promoted to Chief \nReporter in 1995. In that position, Ron was invaluable to the Senate in \nhis dedication to the accuracy of the Congessional Record. He gave of \nhimself unselfishly to be a fair and considerate supervisor.\n  Ron now retires to be with his wife, Pat, and their two married \nchildren, Jeff and Susan, and granddaughter Allison.\n  The Senate today says thank you to Ron and his family for his \nexemplary service to the Senate and its family. He truly is our friend.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank and applaud Ron \nKavulick, the Chief Reporter of Debates, for the tremendous work that \nhe did for the U.S. Senate. Being in charge of the Congressional Record \nis a very demanding and important responsibility. For it is the \nhistorical document of the Senate--the bills we introduce, the \nstatements that we make, and all of our debates are printed in the \nRecord. I am often amazed how the Record is compiled and printed in \nsuch a short amount of time.\n  Ron was to have ended his Senate career at the close of the 105th \nCongress, but remained in his position as the Senate conducted the \nimpeachment trial of the President. His experience was greatly \nappreciated throughout this historical proceeding.\n  Ron's reporting background is both extensive and impressive. He \nbecame an Official Reporter of the Record of Senate Debates in 1979 and \nserved in that capacity until he was elevated to the position of Chief \nReporter in 1995. Before that, he was an official court reporter in the \nAir Force's Judge Advocate General Corp, and while employed with \nAlderson Reporting Company, Ron had the opportunity to work at the \nWhite House.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 145, S. Res. \n21.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 21) to designate September \n     29, 1999, as ``Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States \n     Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sincere \nappreciation to my colleagues for joining me in honoring the more than \ntwo million veterans of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, of the \nUnited States as we pass legislation I introduced earlier this year, \nS.J. Res. 21, to designate September 29, 1999, as Veterans of Foreign \nWars of the United States Day.\n  September 29, 1999 marks the centennial of the VFW. As veterans of \nthe Spanish American War and the Philippine Insurrection of 1899 and \nthe China Relief Expedition of 1900 returned home, they drew together \nin order to preserve the ties of comradeship forged in service to their \ncountry.\n  They began by forming local groups to secure rights and benefits for \nthe service they rendered to our country. In Columbus, OH, veterans \nfounded the American Veterans of Foreign Service. In Denver, Colorado, \nveterans started the Colorado Society of the Army of the Philippines. \nIn 1901, the Philippine War Veterans organization was started by the \nPhilippine Veterans in Altoona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1913, \nthese varied organizations with a common mission joined forces as the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. I am honored to salute \nthis proud organization.\n  Mr. President, when many of us think about war veterans, we think \nabout the tremendous sacrifices these defenders of freedom made to \nsafeguard the democracy we cherish, especially those who made the \nultimate sacrifice. S.J. Res. 21 recognizes those contributions and \nsacrifices. It also recognizes the contributions that VFW members \ncontinue to make day-in and day-out in our communities--the youth \nactivities and scholarships programs, the Special Olympics, homeless \nassistance initiatives, efforts to reach out to fellow veterans in \nneed, and national leadership on issues of importance to veterans and \nall Americans. Over the last 100 years, members of the VFW have \ncontributed greatly to our nation both in and out of uniform in ways \ntoo numerous to enumerate.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served their \ncountry. With this legislation, we honor the men and women and their \nfamilies who have served this country with courage, honor and \ndistinction. They answered the call to duty when their country needed \nthem, and this is but a small token of our appreciation.\n  The centennial of the founding of the VFW will present all Americans \nwith an opportunity to honor and pay tribute to the more than two \nmillion active members of the VFW and to all veterans, as well as to \nthe ideals for which many made the ultimate sacrifice. I thank my \ncolleagues for joining me in a strong show of support and an expression \nof thanks to the VFW and all veterans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint \nresolution be read a third time and passed, the preamble be agreed to, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to this resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Joint Resolution (S.J. Res. 21) was read the third time and \npassed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The joint resolution, with its preamble reads as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 21\n\n       Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States \n     was founded on September 29, 1899;\n       Whereas the 100th anniversary of the founding of the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States will occur on \n     September 29, 1999;\n       Whereas for the past 100 years, the Veterans of Foreign \n     Wars of the United States has made valuable contributions to \n     the well-being of veterans of the Armed Forces and to the \n     States and their communities, and has exhibited national \n     leadership on issues of\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\n     importance to all veterans of the Armed Forces; and\n       Whereas the centennial anniversary of the founding of the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States presents an \n     opportunity to recognize, honor, and pay tribute to the more \n     than 2,000,000 veterans of the Armed Forces represented by \n     that organization, and to all the individuals who have served \n     in the Armed Forces: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     September 29, 1999, is designated as ``Veterans of Foreign \n     Wars of the United States Day'', and the President of the \n     United States is authorized and requested to issue a \n     proclamation calling upon all Government agencies and the \n     people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/30/senate-section/article/S7969-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
