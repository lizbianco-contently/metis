Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. 1906, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompanying H.R. 1906, making \n     appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and \n     Drug Administration, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, under the agreement, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume on the Agriculture conference report.\n  As Senators will remember, we invoked cloture on this conference \nreport yesterday. I think the vote was 79-20. So by a very decisive \nvote, the Senate has expressed its will that we should complete action \non this conference report. So debate has been limited, by agreement, to \n6 hours, as described in the announcement to the Senate.\n  I am very pleased we have reached this point. This has been a very \ndifficult and hard to resolve conference agreement. There have been a \nlot of issues extraneous to the appropriations process this year that \nhad to be considered because they were raised either in the Senate or \nduring consideration of the conference report.\n  We have reached the point, though, that it is time to complete action \non this conference report. We are appropriating funds for the fiscal \nyear that began on October 1. So we have already begun the fiscal year \nduring which the funds we will approve today will be needed. These \nfunds are going to be allocated for administration by the Department of \nAgriculture among a wide range of programs. Sixty billion dollars are \nmade available under the terms of this bill for programs of the \nDepartment of Agriculture including agricultural research, food and \nnutrition service, conservation programs, agricultural support \nprograms, and rural development. We also have the responsibility of \nfunding the Food and Drug Administration and the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission activities under this bill. So funds are provided \nfor those agencies as well.\n  I am very pleased that the conference agreement reflects a very \nstrong commitment to the food safety initiatives. The President has \nbeen very active in his effort to increase funding for a number of \nthose programs. Funds are provided for that--not all that the President \nwanted for every aspect of the program, but it is a well-balanced \nprogram.\n  We also fund the Food Safety Inspection Service of the Department of \nAgriculture. Under that program, we have inspection that is conducted \nat food processing plants throughout the country, trying to make sure \nthe food that is made available in the marketplace\n\n[[Page S12450]]\n\nin our country is safe and wholesome, trying to alleviate concerns and \nthe risks of foodborne illnesses.\n  I daresay we have the best record of any country in the world in \nprotecting our citizens from foodborne illnesses, and this is due in \nlarge part to those industries and those people who are involved every \nday in preparing and marketing the foods that make up the U.S. food \nsupply. So they are the ones who really deserve the credit, in my \nopinion, and we very often do not recognize that. Government officials \nlike to take the credit for just about everything, and I think that is \nwrong. In our society, we have a lot of people who work very hard and \nin a very conscientious way with the latest technologies to try to help \nmake this country the best in the world, and they have done it.\n  We try to support the activities of food processors and producers, \nbut we sometimes fall short. This year, for example, we have had a very \nserious problem in production agriculture because of low commodity \nprices. There is an oversupply of some commodities in the world market \nthat has depressed prices a great deal. We have seen a lot of weather-\nrelated disasters strike production agriculture this year. So in this \nbill there is a response to that problem. A generous disaster \nassistance program totaling $8.7 billion is included in this conference \nreport, providing emergency assistance for production agriculture.\n  The head of the Mississippi Farm Bureau was interviewed after the \nHouse approved this conference report to get his reaction to the need \nin agriculture for the funds that were provided in this bill. Here is \nwhat David Waide of the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation said about \nthis emergency assistance: It ``could well mean the difference in \nmassive foreclosures and the ability to continue farming'' in \nMississippi. ``It's that serious,'' he said, ``because of the market \nsituation and the extremely low commodity prices and the natural \ndisaster we've had with weather, every producer is impacted to some \ndegree.'' He went on to say, ``With the type of market losses that \nwe're seeing as a result of an extremely dry year, the producers are \nstill going to have to struggle.''\n\n  I point this out because there are some who think we have overreacted \nto the problems in agriculture this year. Every farmer in every area of \nthe country may not be seriously affected by the problems I have \ndiscussed and described but most are. In my State of Mississippi, David \nWaide has it right. He has described what the problems are and what the \nneeds are, why it is important for this appropriations bill with this \nemergency disaster assistance program to be approved.\n  I am hopeful Senators will come to the floor under the order that we \nhave provided for debate. We have a good amount of time available for \nthe discussion of sanctions legislation we adopted in the Senate on an \namendment offered by Senator Ashcroft, which would have limited the \nunilateral power the President has to impose embargoes, in effect, or \ntrade embargoes, stopping the flow of agricultural commodities from \nthis country into the international marketplace as a means for trying \nto discipline other countries or coerce them into some kind of change \nof behavior. For many, this has seemed to be an area where we have \nunfairly targeted agriculture and made agricultural producers and \nexporters bear the brunt of American foreign policy and, in many cases, \nit hasn't worked. It hasn't worked to change the behavior of those \ncountries against whom the trade embargoes or sanctions were imposed. \nAnd it has hurt our own economy--not just the agricultural producers \nand exporters but others, because it has had a ripple effect throughout \nour economy. So I supported that initiative and I hope we can see \nlegislation of that kind enacted. But because it was legislation, a \nchange in law, there were objections to it being included on this \nappropriations bill.\n  So there will be other opportunities to take up that issue, and I \nhope the Senate will address that at the earliest possible time. We \nhave time available for Senator Ashcroft and others who are interested \nin discussing that issue. Under the impression that there will be \nSenators coming to the floor soon to discuss those issues and others, I \nam prepared to yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent the \ntime under the quorum call be charged equally to both sides under the \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to make comments on the \nAgriculture appropriations conference report. It is a bill which I \nthink is very important for America's farmers and ranchers. Clearly, \nthe agricultural community in America is in dire straits. Farmers need \nrelief quickly. But the irony about this bill is that farmers are \ngetting, in my judgment, shortchanged. They are getting short-term \nfinancial relief, but they have been robbed of good policy; that is, a \npolicy to reform the unilateral embargoes of food and medicine that \nhave kept our farmers from being able to sell their products around the \nworld.\n  Before I get substantially into my remarks, I thank the Senator from \nMississippi, the chairman of the agriculture appropriations \nsubcommittee, for his support and vote to end unilateral food \nembargoes, and for his very mannerly handling of this issue on the \nfloor and in the Senate-House conference. He has a strong record of \nsupporting an end to the food embargoes. I know he recognizes the \nincredible groundswell of support for this policy change that is in the \nCongress and, more importantly, in the farm community. Senator Cochran \nis to be commended. I thank him. He has done an outstanding job.\n  Farmers in America are aware that the current U.S. embargoes tie \ntheir hands and give an advantage to Canada, Brazil, Europe, and South \nAmerica, farmers from around the world, when competing against the \nUnited States. Current U.S. policy favors foreign farmers--not U.S. \nfarmers. It is a tragedy that our own policies throw roadblocks between \nour farmers and the world marketplace so producers in other countries \nhave a better opportunity to be more successful than producers in our \ncountry.\n  Make no mistake about it. The history of U.S. food embargoes is that \nthey almost uniformly hurt only two parties: the American farmer and \ninnocent people overseas.\n  Food embargoes generally don't succeed in changing other nations. \nThey succeed in taking dollars out of our farmers' pockets and in \nputting dollars in the pockets of foreign farmers. They succeed in \nundermining our farmers' reputation as reliable suppliers in the world \nmarket. We understand that because farmers have talked to us. Farmers \nhave come to me. I have met with them. Senator Bond and I have several \ntimes sat down together and discussed it with farmers in the last 3 or \n4 months at various places. We were in the foothills of Missouri. We \nwere in the central part of the State. We have been at various places \naround the State. They have helped me understand this issue more \nclearly than ever before.\n  A number of other Senators are very attuned to this. This is \nsomething that goes on on both sides of the aisle. This is not an issue \nthat is defined by parties in this Congress. Senators Hagel, Baucus, \nDodd, Brownback, Dorgan, Kerrey, along with myself and many others--you \nnotice this is one of those things where you can go back and forth \nacross the aisle as you name the Members of the Senate--have been \nworking on a bill that would lift embargoes involving U.S. farm \nproducts.\n  I wish to recognize the fact that Senator Lugar has for a long time \nbeen working on measures to do the same and is chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee in the Senate.\n  This understanding about the need to have markets where farmers can \nsell what they produce is a pretty substantial understanding. It is not \npartisan. We did not surprise anyone with this proposal. Americans have \nlong agreed it is generally unwise for the United States to use food as \na weapon. The weapon usually backfires and hurts us more than it hurts \nanyone else.\n\n[[Page S12451]]\n\n  Congress has endorsed the values of the American people. Our job is \nto represent the values of the American people and not to allow a \nselect few inside Washington, DC, to go behind closed doors and impose \ntheir values on America. I am here today to do what I was elected to \ndo--to promote farm policies that reflect the values of the farm belt \ninstead of caving in to the values of the beltway.\n  If Members listen to their farmers, they will most likely hear what I \nhave been hearing. This is a letter from Kansas City, MO, signed by 10 \npeople with a strong interest in this issue. Let me read a part of it:\n\n       We believe that this legislation--\n\nthat is the legislation to allow farmers to market their products to \nchange the way we have embargoes imposed so we don't have the \nunilateral embargoes against food and medicine imposed by the President \nwithout Congress.\n\n       We believe that this legislation will help the United \n     States sell its valuable farm products and medicines as well \n     as help the receiver countries.\n       The President and Congress ought to review more carefully \n     unilateral embargoes against any country. Withholding food \n     and medicine is an affront against human rights as well as a \n     politically foolish practice. Such sanctions have never \n     toppled governments, but only serve to perpetuate hatred, \n     hunger, and poverty among the ordinary citizens.\n\n  This was signed by 10 individuals. This is one of a number of letters \nI would like to submit for the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Latin American Task Force,\n\n\n                                        Catholics for Justice,\n\n                              Kansas City, MO, September 13, 1999.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: Thank you for introducing the Food \n     and Medicine for the World Act as an amendment to the \n     agricultural appropriations bill and for championing it \n     through this far. We hope that you and Senator Bond will \n     continue to work to pass this important amendment.\n       We believe that this legislation will help the United \n     States sell its valuable farm products and medicines as well \n     as help the receiver countries.\n       The President and Congress ought to review more carefully \n     unilateral embargoes against any country. Withholding food \n     and medicine is an affront against human rights as well as a \n     politically foolish practice. Such sanctions have never \n     toppled governments, but only serve to perpetuate hatred, \n     hunger, and poverty among the ordinary citizens.\n       Thank you for your attention; we will look forward to a \n     report on the outcome of Food and Medicine for the World Act.\n       Letter signed by 10 people.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, not only do members of my constituency \nand citizens of Missouri write letters to me, but they write letters to \nthe editor. They talk to the press and farm focus forums about the \nsignificance of lifting food embargoes. Senator Bond and I not only \nwere in Columbia at one of these farm forums, but we were at the State \nfair.\n  I am reading from a newspaper article out of Sedalia, MO, entitled, \n``Farmers Meet with Bond, Ashcroft at State Fair.''\n  This is what some farmers said. This is what the article begins with. \nIt includes quotes by farmers.\n\n       Some farmers who are worried by low prices and the recent \n     lack of rain felt encouraged after talking with Missouri's \n     two U.S. Senators about emergency relief and trade barriers.\n       ``I hope the relief comes soon,'' said Brent Sandidge, a \n     hog farmer. ``[But] rather than always giving us immediate \n     relief, help us so that we can live so that emergency money \n     won't be needed.\n\n  That is what the hog farmer was saying. Give us the capacity to sell \nour products so emergency money won't always be needed.\n\n       One such long-range plan is Ashcroft's Food and Medicine \n     for the World Act. . . .\n\n  The article continues, and then Brent, the hog farmer who was with \nus, said:\n\n       . . . lifting embargoes makes sense. We need to use the \n     agriculture in this country to feed the grave hunger of \n     people around the world.\n\n  I am pleased to have had that article in the Sedalia paper. The \nbottom line is this: The final Agriculture appropriations conference \nreport should have included the embargo reform that was overwhelmingly \nsupported by American farmers and adopted by the Senate. Frankly, it is \na great disappointment to me that the Agriculture conference report \ndoes not include reform for food embargoes. First of all, this reform, \nwhich we had included in the Senate version of the Agriculture bill, \nwas a reform that would have required the President to collaborate with \nCongress and get approval before imposing any unilateral sanction that \nwould embargo food or medicine.\n  The Senate approved that amendment by an overwhelming vote of 70-28. \nThat included a majority of positive votes from both sides of the \naisle--both Democrats and Republicans. This vote shows that not only do \nwe have more than a majority, but 70 votes would be more than enough to \ninvoke cloture, if these votes remain committed, more than enough votes \nto even override a Presidential veto.\n\n  After the Senate 70-28 vote when the Agriculture appropriations bill \nwent to the conference, the House conferees voted on a proposal to make \nthe Senate reform even stronger. This is significant because it \nreflects the view of many of the House Members with whom I have talked \nthat embargoes be brought to the House of Representatives for a \nstraight up-or-down vote, and the proposal would receive the same kind \nof overwhelming support in the House that it received in the Senate. \nThey were confident of that if voted on by the House. Also, eight \nSenate conferees to three favored keeping the Senate provisions along \nwith the stronger House provisions.\n  It is a mystery that the House wanted this, the Senate wanted this, \nwe voted 70-28 to have it, and then behind closed doors a decision was \nmade to strip out the reform provision that received overwhelming \nbipartisan support in the Congress. It is something that the American \nfarmers want, that will help sell American goods overseas, that will \nhelp reverse the currently depressed prices, that will help provide \nfood and medicine to people all around the world, and a reform that \nwould reverse the rather ridiculous policy in which America finds \nitself alone so often as a nation using food and medicine as a weapon \nof foreign policy.\n  A select few in Congress have tried to make the issue of embargoes on \nfood an issue about Cuba. I reject this narrow interpretation. It is \nabout the importance of consistent U.S. policy on food and medicine \nembargoes. Since Cuba is one of those countries that we sanction or \nembargo exports of wheat, rice, pork, and other vital farm products, \nlet me address that. Does it really make sense for the United States \nnot to sell food to Cuba when the entire rest of the world already \ndoes? I don't think so. Does it really make sense for the United States \nto deny food and medicine and thereby bolster Castro's anti-American \ndistortions?\n  Let's hear from the countryside on this issue. Here is an e-mail I \nreceived from one of my constituents, Thomas Capuano, from Kirksville, \nMO:\n\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft, I want you to know that I favor \n     loosening the embargo on Cuba. The best way for understanding \n     between our two peoples is by means of free markets, free \n     exchange of ideas and goods and services, and freedom of \n     movement. . . .\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: John Ashcroft.\n     From: Tom Capuano.\n     Date: 15 July, 1999.\n     Subject: Cuba embargo.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: I want you to know that I favor \n     loosening the embargo on Cuba. The best way for understanding \n     between our two peoples is by means of free markets, free \n     exchange of ideas and goods and services, and freedom of \n     movement between Cuba and the U.S. Please consider supporting \n     the exemptions that are currently being proposed to ease the \n     embargo. Food and medicine should be totally exempted from \n     the embargo.\n       Thank you for your attention.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Here is another e-mail received from Ms. Janelle \nSharoni:\n\n       The blockade against Cuba has been going on for so many \n     years we have nearly forgotten about the terrible suffering \n     of the Cuban people and the total lack of any results to \n     point to from this blockade. The blockade has not worked and \n     has alienated us from other Latin Americans.\n       All this does is exempt food, agricultural supplies, \n     medicine and medical supplies for the trade embargo. It does \n     NOT indicate any change in American policy, just a change in \n     how we deal with the poor and suffering.\n\n  That is a description of the Food and Medicine for the World Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S12452]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: Senator Ashcroft.\n     From: ``Janell H. Sharoni''.\n     Date: 21 July, 1999.\n     Subject: End the Cuban Embargo.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: The blockade against Cuba has been \n     going on for so many years, we have nearly forgotten about \n     the terrible suffering of the Cuban people and the total lack \n     of any results to point to from this blockade. This blockade \n     has not worked and has alienated us from other Latin \n     Americans.\n       Businessmen are trying, against of course the wishes of the \n     Miami community, who seem to control our entire congress, to \n     make headway in working to establish relations with Cuba. \n     Please support or co-sponsor SB926 to end the embargo against \n     Cuba.\n       All this does is exempt food, agricultural supplies, \n     medicine and medical supplies for the trade embargo. It does \n     NOT indicate any change in American policy, just a change in \n     how we deal with the poor and suffering in the third world. \n     Is it not obvious that Fidel Castro will die in office and \n     never be removed?\n       This is the first step in ending our stupid cold war \n     relationships with a person who is head and shoulders above \n     most of the dictators we have supported in the past in our \n     anti communist stance.\n       The Pentagon is not afraid of Cuba, and especially the \n     Cuban people. Why, Senator Ashcroft, do we continue this \n     terrible ordeal against the people of a nation so close to \n     our shores.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Janelle H. Sharoni.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I received many letters about this issue. Here is one \nfrom a constituent in St. Joseph, MO, Mr. Craig Drummond, who is the \nDrake University student body vice president.\n  I don't know why he went all the way to Iowa to get his education, \nbut Drake is a fine institution.\n  He states it this way:\n\n       The United States is a country that was founded on the \n     premise of freedom, democracy and sovereignty. We enact \n     policies, laws and regulations that best exhibit the highest \n     ideals of democracy and the American public. For the most \n     part, we do a good job and function well as a powerful global \n     leader. I am a proponent of democracy and capitalism and hold \n     the values and ideas of the aforementioned paramount to any \n     other country or government. The United States has problems \n     and for the most part we are aware of these and have good \n     people working to rectify our problems and wrongs. That is \n     why this whole Cuba situation intrigues me so much.\n       Why does America continue to have an embargo against trade \n     with Cuba? Why have we chosen to isolate Cuba and ourselves \n     from each other?\n\n  I think the point here that ought to be made is a point that needs to \nbe made over and over again. For food and medicine, we don't strengthen \nthe regime; we strengthen the people. Strengthening oppressed people is \nwhat is fundamentally appropriate in terms of eventually allowing them \nto survive oppressive regimes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 22, 1999.\n       Dear Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri: I am writing this \n     letter in regards to the United States' embargo against Cuba. \n     I recently visited Cuba through a U.S. Treasury Department \n     licensed trip that was part of a class for Drake University. \n     In Cuba I was immersed in their culture and sense of \n     community and feel that after this experience, it is my \n     Lockean duty as an American citizen to write my elected \n     leaders and express my concern at the status quo foreign \n     policy that America practices in regards to Cuba.\n       The United States is a country that was founded on the \n     premise of freedom, democracy and sovereignty. We enact \n     policies, laws and regulations that best exhibit the highest \n     ideals of democracy and the American public. For the most \n     part, we do a good job and function well as a powerful global \n     leader. I am a proponent of democracy and capitalism and hold \n     the values and ideas of the aforementioned paramount to any \n     other country or government. The United States has problems \n     and for the most part we are aware of these and have good \n     people working to rectify our problems and wrongs. That is \n     why this whole Cuba situation intrigues me so much.\n       Why does America continue to have an embargo against trade \n     with Cuba? Why have we chosen to isolate Cuba and ourselves \n     from each other? This puzzles me dearly and I have searched, \n     with a patriotic mindset, to find answers, yet I have not \n     found any viable ones. Cuba operates as a socialistic \n     government and this government is by far one of the best \n     examples of true socialism that I have seen. The people are \n     educated, have access to medical care and the leaders do not \n     live lavish lifestyles. Cuba is poor and the people need \n     money and have wants, yet the division of wealth appears to \n     be fair and from the government leaders to the person on the \n     street, the people support their governmental system.\n       Why then has the United States, the world leader in human \n     rights, let itself place greed and the desires of a limited \n     minority of American businessmen above the needs of a people, \n     fair foreign policy, and the search for social justice in \n     U.S. action? American businessmen are upset because their \n     companies were nationalized in the Revolution of 1959. Cuba \n     has since offered retribution, but the former owners have \n     declined it on the grounds that the retribution is not for \n     the real amount that the assets were worth. Well, as someone \n     who has invested in foreign markets, I personally know of and \n     accept the higher degree of risk that is taken when investing \n     in foreign markets that are not under direct U.S. control. A \n     foreign investor must accept this risk and realize that there \n     is additional risk associated with transacting or operating a \n     business in a foreign country.\n       Cuba is a nation of great beauty and opportunity. The Cuban \n     people desire and need the help of the United States. I see \n     no reason for the current embargo and would ask you to \n     compare Cuba to China when talking about foreign policy and \n     governmental structures. I am asking as a constituent and \n     citizen that you look into this matter so that you can form \n     an educated opinion on this subject. Hopefully, education on \n     this subject will foster a desire to rise up and make the \n     necessary change to lift this embargo. There may have been \n     reasons in the past for the implementation of the embargo, \n     but Cuba and the U.S. have both changed since the 1950's and \n     it is time for our foreign policy to change as well.\n       The lifting of the embargo will not only help the Cuban \n     economy, but it will inevitably act as an impetus to spark \n     American investment and exports to Cuba. Such transactions \n     could only be considered a positive for the U.S. economy. \n     Thank you and if you have any questions or comments please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Craig W. Drummond,\n\n                                    Drake University Students Body\n                                                   Vice-President.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. A final letter from Mrs. Joan Botwinick in University \nCity, MO:\n\n       I want to thank you for introducing a bill which would lift \n     the embargo on food and medicine. Not only is it the humane \n     thing to do, but it would also benefit our farmers.\n\n  That is a clear statement of what I think is the important truth.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in its entirety in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          University City, MO,\n\n                                                   Sept. 24, 1999.\n       Dear Mr. Ashcroft: I want to thank you for introducing a \n     bill which would lift the embargo on food and medicine in \n     Cuba. Not only is it the humane thing to do, but it would \n     also benefit our farmers.\n       The broader issue is: Do we promote democracy by putting \n     sanctions on countries we don't like or who may be a threat \n     to us, or do we try to help improve their economies by \n     engaging in commerce and dialogue. I believe our best course \n     is the latter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Joan Botwinick.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Comments about lifting the food embargo come not just \nfrom the Midwest. An editorial from the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, \nAugust 16, 1999, states:\n\n       It clearly would be in America's best interest to expand \n     trade in food and medicine to Cuba, for more reasons than \n     one.\n\n  I continue to quote:\n\n       If nutrition and health-care conditions don't improve in \n     Cuba under the easing or lifting of U.S. trade restrictions, \n     Castro won't have the embargo to blame for his government's \n     failures.\n\n  In other words, we provide Castro with an opportunity to blame \nAmerica for hungry people, to blame America for sick people, as long as \nwe embargo food and medicine.\n  Quite frankly, there is a ground swell of support to lift the food \nand medicine embargo on Cuba--and other countries.\n  An article from the Omaha World-Herald commends the cosponsor of this \nlegislation, Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, who has been such a \nleader in this respect. I will read from that article:\n\n       Sens Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., and John Ashcroft, R-Mo., added \n     to the Senate's recent farm spending bill an amendment that \n     would exempt most food and medical supplies from U.S. \n     sanctions against foreign nations.\n       As an editorial in this space said on August 10, Cuba \n     provides the closest example of why Hagel and Ashcroft have a \n     good idea: Such sanctions usually harm only the people who \n     deserve it least, and they pointlessly exclude U.S. farmers \n     and pharmaceutical manufacturers from significant \n     international markets.\n\n\n[[Page S12453]]\n\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this editorial from the Omaha World-\nHerald, Friday, August 20, 1999, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Omaha World-Herald; Fri. August 20, 1999]\n\n                       A Gentler Face Toward Cuba\n\n       Maybe it's just a coincidence of timing. But lately it \n     seems that Midwesterners are at the forefront of a push to \n     start easing some of the barriers between the United States \n     and Cuba.\n       Sens. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., and John Ashcroft, R-Mo., added \n     to the Senate's recent farm spending bill an amendment that \n     would exempt most food and medical supplies from U.S. \n     sanctions against foreign nations.\n       As an editorial in this space said on Aug. 10, Cuba \n     provides the closest example of why Hagel and Ashcroft have a \n     good idea: Such sanctions usually harm only the people who \n     deserve it least, and they pointlessly exclude U.S. farmers \n     and pharmaceutical manufacturers from significant \n     international markets.\n       Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Sen. \n     Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., recently came back from a visit to Cuba \n     with figures that undergird that idea. They said officials in \n     Cuba told them the country imports nearly $1 billion in food \n     and medicine annually and food imports could double in five \n     years. Cuban doctors and hospital officials told the \n     Americans that more than 200 important pharmaceuticals are \n     not to be found in Cuba and that a pressing need exists to \n     restock.\n       One must consider the source of such assertions. But even \n     if the numbers were substantially exaggerated, they still \n     point to real markets and real needs.\n       Now there's the visit to Havana by the Gold Nemesis from \n     Lincoln, Nebraska's top under-17 soccer team, with its \n     people-to-people sports diplomacy stint. What are the young \n     players (many of whose parents have no memory of a time when \n     there wasn't an embargo against Cuba) learning?\n       ``People from Cuba are not stereotypical, real hard-nosed, \n     mean people,'' Gold nemesis co-captain Christian Mangrum told \n     the Associated Press. ``They're actually really nice, really \n     genuine.''\n       No surprise there, surely. The faceoff between the two \n     nations has never been about Americans vs Cubans. It is about \n     the corrupt and dictatorial regime of Fidel Castro and his \n     dreams of Pan-American revolution. And harbor no illusions: \n     Castro remains Castro. All in Cuba is not sweetness and light\n       Dorgn reported that Castro staunchly defended the current \n     system. ``He staunchly defends what he has done,'' Dorgan \n     said. ``He rejects the notion that there are human rights \n     violations.'' Dorgan said Cuban officials had told him and \n     Daschle they were free to speak to any Cuban. But that proved \n     to be untrue when they wanted to talk to four dissidents \n     recently sentenced to prison.\n       The overthrow of Castro is not a realistic prospect, but \n     after all, he will not live forever. It is time to think \n     about what happens after he's gone. If Americans demonstrate \n     to Cubans that we as a nation aren't out to starve them or \n     deprive them of medical care; if we show them more about \n     average Americans and the kind of life that is possible under \n     a more progressive form of government: doesn't it make sense \n     that in the post-Castro era they'll be open to a free and \n     open society?\n       For that reason, when the House of Representatives resumes \n     its session next month, it should join the Senate in easing \n     the food and medicine embargo.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Most people realize it is the good thing to do for our \nfarmers and it is the right thing to do in terms of humanitarian \ninterests of those abroad. That is why the Senate overwhelmingly \napproved this concept, and that is why it should have been retained in \nthe conference report which provides relief for American farmers.\n  We provide financial relief, but we ignore the need for structural \nrelief so that their market can be expanded. It is no secret that what \nhappened to the appropriations bill for farmers has been construed by \nsome as an affront to farmers. Missouri farmers are not duped; they are \nnot fooled. They understand that while there is additional financial \nassistance being given out, they are still being deprived of their \nmarkets, and Missouri farmers want to be able to produce and to sell. \nThat is what farming is all about. They are bewildered as to how their \nfreedom to market, which had majority support from both sides of the \naisle, could be stripped out of the bill. I will do everything I can to \nmake sure they get the freedom to market we have been promising them \nfor years; we must deliver.\n  Quite frankly, there is growing consideration of an idea that says we \ncan't have Freedom to Farm if we don't have freedom to market. We have \nnever given it a real chance to work. We have to give our farmers the \nchance to market what they produce as well as the freedom to be \nproducers.\n  If what happened over the last 2 weeks on sanctions policy keeps up, \nI do not think we will be seeing this program work. We have to have \nboth freedoms: The freedom to farm and the freedom to market; and who \nwill be to blame but those who kept us from passing the freedom to \nmarket?\n  Our amendment, the Food and Medicine for the World Act, is designed \nto allow our farmers to market around the world and is designed to \nrestructure the way in which agricultural embargoes, or food embargoes, \nwould be imposed--if at all. That proposal would have put United States \nfarmers on more competitive ground with the Canadians and more \ncompetitive ground with the Europeans and South Americans in world \nmarkets. It would have put money in the pockets of U.S. farmers--clear \nand simple; just a fact; there would have been money in the pockets of \nAmerican farmers.\n  It is hard to believe we simply--we? I should not say ``we.'' From \nsomewhere, in the dark of night in the conference committee, out goes \nthat provision which had overwhelming support, I believe, in both \nHouses of the Congress. It would have restored the credibility of the \nCongress worldwide, across America, and would have restored our \nfarmers' credibility worldwide as suppliers.\n  I will continue my efforts to win final approval for ending \nunilateral food and medicine embargoes. Next week the sponsors of the \namendment, that was approved 70 to 28 and was added to the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, intend to introduce the embargo reform as a \nfreestanding bill. We will bring it to the Senate and the Congress. We \nwill say to the Congress: This is not part of the Agriculture \nappropriations measure as it was before, but we want to present this to \nthe Congress. I am grateful the majority leader of the Senate has made \na commitment to me to bring the proposal back to the Senate floor for \nseparate consideration this session. That is important to me.\n\n  I wanted the measure approved as part of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill and sent to the President for signature. It would \nhave been easier. It certainly was an overwhelming consensus of this \nbody and I believe an overwhelming consensus of the House. But if that \ncan't be, then we try plan B. Plan B is to bring it up separately and \nget it passed through the Senate, get it passed through the House of \nRepresentatives, and sent to the President.\n  I thank the majority leader of the Senate who has made a commitment \nto bring the proposal back to the Senate floor for separate \nconsideration. This debate will continue, therefore.\n  Let me reiterate a few points that are vital to the proposal we are \nadvancing. The general framework is this. We do not make it impossible \nto have an embargo. We just say, before there can be an embargo, the \nCongress has to approve it. So we do not tie the hands of the \nPresident, but we ask him to shake hands with the Congress before you \ntake this draconian, drastic step which hurts American farmers, before \nyou have sanctions on food, fiber, and medicine. We will not allow the \nPresident, with the stroke of a pen, to damage the livelihood of \nAmerican farmers or to cut off the subsistence of oppressed people \naround the world. It will require consultation with the Congress.\n  I want to make one thing as clear as I can. This is genuinely a \nproposal that supports the policy of helping our farmers and putting \nproducts which will eliminate suffering and hunger into the hands of \nthose who need them most. This is not about shipping military equipment \nor even dual-use items--things that could be used in the military \nsetting--to other countries. We want to keep those kinds of things out \nof the hands of tyrants. But we do not want to assist tyrants, or \nstrengthen the hands of tyrants, by allowing them to blame America for \nhungry people who are oppressed or people who are ill in health, so \nthat the tyrant can say: The reason you are ill and the reason we don't \nhave good medicine is the United States of America won't allow you to \nhave good health or won't sell us food.\n  Our approach helps us show support for the oppressed people who need \nto be strengthened in these countries, at the same time we send a \nmessage that the United States in no way will assist or endorse the \nactivities of the rogue\n\n[[Page S12454]]\n\nleaders of these nations which threaten our interests. If these rogue \nleaders don't spend the money with the American farmers to buy food, \nthat leaves them hard currency to buy weapons and destabilize countries \naround the world. We ought to hope they spend all their money on food \nfor their people instead of weaponry they use either to repress people \nin their own regimes or destabilize neighboring countries.\n  Ending unilateral embargoes against sales of U.S. food and medicine \nis good, solid foreign policy, it is good farm policy, and it promotes \nU.S. interests around the world. In the past, we have imposed embargoes \nthat have done exactly the opposite from what we intended. If we use \nfood as a weapon, we have to be careful it doesn't backfire. Using food \nas a weapon has really resulted in more backfiring than forward firing. \nWe have actually enriched the people we were seeking to hurt, and we \nhave hurt the people, the American farmers, who have been the producers \nof what has made this Nation the greatest nation on the face of the \nEarth, where hunger has been virtually abolished--or it should be.\n\n  Let me just give this example. It is a tragic example. It is not \nhumorous, but it is almost funny because it backfired so badly. \nEveryone remembers the Soviet grain embargo in the 1970s. We canceled \n17 million tons of high-priced exports from the United States. We told \nfarmers: You cannot make those sales; we are not going to allow you to \nship that grain to Russia.\n  Here is what happened. The Russians, having been relieved of their \ncontractual obligation to buy what they wanted to buy, went into the \nworld marketplace. Do you know what they did? They bought all the stuff \nwhich we refused to sell them, and they saved $250 million in the \nprocess. We really hurt the Russians with that one. Robert Kohlmeyer of \n``World Perspectives'' brought that story to the committee as we had \nhearings on sanctions. I thought to myself, that gun backfired in a big \nway. The only people with powder burns, the only people suffering as a \nresult of that volley, were American farmers and individuals in the \nproduction of American agriculture.\n  Our market reputation as a supplier in the world went down, and other \npeople decided they would bring on land to be producers, in South \nAmerica and other settings, so they could supply what we would refuse \nto supply. All of a sudden, we brought new competitors into the arena; \nwe destroyed our reputation; we helped our enemy get $250 million he \nwouldn't otherwise have gotten, and we hurt American farmers. Seldom \ncan a gun backfire so accurately in so many directions. I say seldom, \nbut it is just generally so in the arena of embargoes. Our embargoes \nmore often deny people who suffer under such regimes the food and \nmedicine they need and desire rather than hurting the leaders in those \ncountries.\n  America has been a nation that promotes freedom worldwide. We should \ncontinue to talk truthfully about political oppression in other \ncountries. We should do so, though, without denying food and medicine \nto the oppressed people who need to be strengthened, not weakened. How \ncan we ever expect to topple a regime by starving those who populate \nit? Our foreign policy interests should be to strengthen, not to \nweaken, those who could resist an oppressive regime.\n  We need to stop using food as a weapon against the innocent. It is \nnot good foreign policy. It is failed foreign policy. That gun \nbackfires. It is not working. It is hurting those abroad and is hurting \nthose of us who are back home. In terms of market access for farmers, \nwe can talk about the roadblocks that are laid down by foreign \ngovernments--and I am pretty distressed about those roadblocks. The \nEuropeans have vast subsidies that make it hard for us to compete with \nthem overseas. But let us also be aware we have to stop throwing \nroadblocks in the way of our own farmers here at home. We have built a \nsolid brick wall in front of our own farmers. Simply, it is an \nimpenetrable wall when it relates to embargoes and sanctions imposed \nunilaterally on food and medicine against a number of countries around \nthe world. My message today to the Congress is simply this: Tear down \nthis wall we have built.\n\n  Let our farmers be free. Our food embargoes have failed. Our food \nembargoes are not effective. Food embargoes are not the way for us to \nwin. That gun backfires. It is time to tear down this wall. And we \nwill. Starting next week, we will do our best to bring this measure up \nas an independent, freestanding measure.\n  While I believe it is important to help our farmers in the \nAgriculture appropriations bill upon which we are going to be voting, \nthat is a financial assist in the short term for a disastrous year, but \nwe need the long-term structural reform that the hog farmer in Sedalia, \nBrett, came to me and said: We need the ability to market so we don't \nneed to come back for financial assistance over and over again. Tear \ndown this wall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nKansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Presiding Officer, the other distinguished \nSenator from Kansas. I appreciate his recognition. I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak for up to 10 minutes on the Ag appropriations \nconference report which is before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of what my colleague \nfrom Missouri just spoke about. As he was speaking, I was thinking \nwhere I was when the embargo happened. In the late seventies, I was a \nfarm broadcaster in Manhattan, KS, when President Carter put the \nembargo on the Soviet Union. My dad was farming, as he is today. We \nwere both long in wheat. Wheat went down lock limit for 3 days in a row \nwith that embargo. The markets did not recover when that big of a sale \nwas taken out of the system. We lost a lot of money.\n  Senator Ashcroft was talking about how much we lost as a nation and \nhow much our farmers lost. I remember what we lost as a family in that \nembargo, not that it should be any deciding factor, but it galvanized \nin my mind what happens when we do these sorts of things. That is, we \nlose markets, we lose money, our farmers are penalized, punished--and \nthe Soviet Union got cheaper grain out of the deal. It was bad for us \nall the way around.\n  One of my great disappointments with the Ag appropriations conference \nreport is that we had a chance to end once and for all the use of food \nand medicine as a foreign policy tool. We did not take that chance, and \nwe are poorer for it. We should have gotten this monkey off the back of \nU.S. farmers.\n  I rise to state my strong disappointment with this conference report, \neven though my colleague from Mississippi, who chairs this \nsubcommittee, has done everything he possibly can. There is a lot of \ngood in this appropriations conference report, but we missed a chance \nto lift these unilateral sanctions on food and medicine.\n  As you have already heard several times, the Ashcroft amendment was \nadopted overwhelmingly in this body by a vote of 70-28. It is important \nto keep mentioning that fact because it is astonishing to me that such \na clear message from the Senate could be so easily ignored.\n  In a place as diverse as America and as compact as Congress, there \nare bound to be honest disagreements about any number of issues, \nincluding sanctions. These disagreements were given a thorough and \nextensive airing in the Senate, and the result was an overwhelming \nmajority decided it was not an effective policy tool to use food and \nmedicine in foreign policy. This is a conclusion that a vast majority \nof the American public has already recognized for some time and \ncertainly the farming public has recognized this for a long period of \ntime.\n  What has occurred with the Agriculture appropriations bill is an \nattempt to avoid this important policy issue. I am delighted we are \ngoing to bring it back up next week and discuss it, but it is an \nunfortunate tactic that has moved us to next week rather than now in \ndeciding this critical policy issue for U.S. agriculture and for \nAmerica's foreign policy. Compounding this wrong is the fact that U.S. \nagriculture is in the midst of an economic struggle, and sanctions \nserve to limit U.S. markets for no real policy effect.\n  Unilaterally using food and medicine as foreign policy weapons fails \nto take into account that the U.S. has competition in agriculture. If \nwe do not\n\n[[Page S12455]]\n\nsell it, somebody else will, and that is what has taken place in the \npast. It is time we limit the possibility of this happening again in \nthe future to the United States.\n  Even if the U.S. denies trade with another nation, other countries \nwill, and do eagerly, sell these products. We know this for a fact. The \nonly one who gets hurt in this process is truly the U.S. farmer, the \nfarmers across Kansas who do not get to make these sales.\n  While it is difficult to calculate the actual gain that lifting \nsanctions would bring in the short term it is easy to see the long-term \nbenefits of sanctions reform. These benefits include the increased \nsales to new markets because we tell that new market we will be a \nreliable supplier; we will not just step in willy-nilly on this; we \nwill be reliable in our supplying. Perhaps even more profound, this \npolicy serves to reassure all our trading partners that the U.S. will \ncontinue and will always be that constant and reliable supplier of \nagricultural goods. This assurance is necessary in a competitive \nmarket.\n\n  Efforts to reinstate this important sanctions relief language or find \na compromise have certainly been valiantly put forward by Senator \nAshcroft, Senator Dorgan, and a number of others, including the Chair. \nI commend my neighbors in this principled fight and their persistence \non this issue. Still the few who oppose sanctions reform have blocked \nany progress.\n  Reluctantly, I will vote for this bill because farmers and producers \nare depending on the emergency aid funding contained in this bill. But \nI truly believe the future of U.S. agriculture depends on the long-term \nreforms such as this Senate-passed amendment lifting unilateral \nsanctions. I will continue to fight on this issue and insist that the \nwill of the majority be followed.\n  In conclusion, we had a chance to once and for all remove the use of \nfood and medicine as a foreign policy tool, and we missed it. We could \ndo something good, something right, morally on the high ground, the \nright thing for U.S. farmers, the right thing for those consumers in \nplaces around the world who need and should have this good, high \nquality food product we have. We missed that opportunity. We are poorer \nfor it, and so is the rest of the world. We will have this fight again \nnext week. I hope we can still move this bill this session of Congress. \nI lament we did not do it on this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I am glad to join my \ncolleague, Senator Cochran, in support of the conference report to H.R. \n1906, the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  I congratulate Senator Cochran, chairman of the subcommittee, for \nguiding us past many obstacles that have stood in the way of final \npassage of this measure. At the end of today's debate, we will send to \nthe President an agricultural spending bill that will result in \nimmediate aid to hundreds of thousands of farmers across our country. \nThat is an accomplishment of which we can all be proud.\n  At times, work on this bill was contentious. The money we had \navailable to work with made it very difficult to fund adequately the \nmost critical programs at USDA, FDA, and the other agencies in this \nbill.\n  Senator Cochran did a masterful job in finding a balance of \npriorities, given the budgetary constraints under which we had to work. \nIn fact, we were even able to increase spending for some critical \nprograms. This conference report provides an increase for the \nPresident's food safety initiative, as well as additional funds to help \navoid a shortfall in inspectors at the Food Safety Inspection Service. \nAn increase is provided for the WIC Program to help maintain caseload. \nOther programs, such as research and education, conservation and rural \ndevelopment are all funded at a very healthy level.\n  Most important, we have managed to include $8.7 billion in emergency \naid to farmers suffering from the price collapse that has hit too many \ncommodities. I realize some of my colleagues, especially those from the \nNortheast, will argue that more is needed to address the needs of \nfarmers suffering from the effects of this summer's drought and \nHurricane Floyd. I agree. The administration should send us a separate \nemergency request for these recent disasters, and Congress ought to act \non it immediately. But our commitment to help the farmers of the \nNortheast overcome the natural disasters of the last several months \nshould not stop us from enacting aid for farmers all over the country \nsuffering from the economic disasters of the last several years.\n  I also want to note the efforts made to ensure that harmful \nlegislative riders, such as attempts to undermine USDA reform of dairy \npolicy, did not become part of this conference report. We have spent \nmonths putting together a fair bill--not perfect, but fair. Efforts to \nincorporate dairy compacts into this legislation were defeated more \nthan once. It is time to pass this bill and get much-needed funding to \ndairy farmers and to hardworking farmers across the country.\n  And let me emphasize that last point. This bill contains almost $9 \nbillion in emergency assistance to struggling farmers everywhere. \nWithin days of the President signing the bill, almost $5 billion of \nthat aid will be on its way to farmers. It is all well and good for us \nto spend days listening to talk about this money--how it is distributed \nand how much there should be--but there are hundreds of thousands of \nfarmers who need it now to plant, feed, and operate. All the words in \nthe world will not help farmers get next year's crop in the ground or \nmilk the cows. We have talked enough--it is time now to pass this bill.\n  In closing, let me say how much I have enjoyed working with Senator \nCochran. This is my first year as ranking member on this subcommittee \nand his exceptional leadership, good judgment, and helpful hand has \nbeen indispensable in making this a positive experience for all of us. \nI would also like to thank his distinguished staff, Rebecca Davies, \nMartha Scott Poindexter, Les Spivey, and Hunt Shipman, for their \nimportant contributions to this bill. And, of course, I must thank \nGalen Fountain of the minority staff for his wisdom and patience. Galen \nis an invaluable resource to me, to all Democratic Senators, and to the \nSenate itself.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter on the Foreign Market \nDevelopment Program from the USDA be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 1999.\n     Hon. Herbert Kohl,\n     Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: This is in reply to your request for \n     information about the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) \n     Charter Act and the President's budget to fund the Foreign \n     Market Development Program (FMD) through CCC.\n       The President's budget proposes to shift funding for FMD \n     from the FAS appropriated account to the Commodity Credit \n     Corporation (CCC). The budget also proposes to fund a new \n     Quality Samples Program through CCC. In conjunction with the \n     budget, the Administration has forwarded to Congress \n     legislation authorizing the use of CCC funds for FMD and \n     capping expenditures for that purpose at the Fiscal Year (FY) \n     1998 program level of $27.5 million.\n       You questioned whether such legislation was necessary or \n     whether the Administration has the authority to fund these \n     programs through CCC administratively. You are indeed \n     correct: although it is the Administration's position that \n     such legislation should be enacted, CCC has the authority to \n     fund FMD and the proposed Quality Samples Program under the \n     Section 5(f) of the CCC Charter Act without additional \n     legislation. The legislation we submitted does not expand the \n     Secretary's existing authority; it limits it by imposing a \n     cap on CCC expenditures for the two programs.\n       If FMD ultimately is funded through CCC rather than from \n     the FAS appropriated account, the Administration intends to \n     continue to fund FMD at not less than the historic level of \n     $27.5 million annually.\n       Please feel free to contact me if you need any additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                       August Schumacher, Jr.,\n\n                                      Under Secretary for Farm and\n                                    Foreign Agricultural Services.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S12456]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for yielding and also \nthank him and the Senator from Mississippi for their efforts on behalf \nof this legislation. But I must come to the floor today in opposition \nto this bill because it is not fair legislation for all the farmers of \nAmerica--certainly not fair to the farmers of the Northeast, in Rhode \nIsland, New England, the Mid-Atlantic States, because they have \nsuffered a tremendous loss this year because of a drought that has \nhistoric implications. It was the worst drought in the history of this \nregion in over 105 years of record keeping by the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration. This has had a devastating impact on the \nfarmers of my State and of the region.\n  Most people do not consider the Northeast to be a place where there \nare lots of farms, but in my own small State of Rhode Island there are \nover 700 farmers who grow vegetables, turf, nursery stock, cranberries, \nstrawberries, and potatoes. We also have numerous orchards and dairy \nfarms. All of these farms have suffered devastating losses. And these \nare family farms; these are not large agricultural combines--certainly \nnot in Rhode Island. They are family farms that are struggling to make \ndo. This year they had a difficult struggle because of this historic \ndrought.\n  We originally thought that farm losses would be about 50 percent of \nthe crop--a serious blow. But I have just been given data today from \nour agricultural authorities where in Rhode Island they are suggesting \nthat the August estimates were not as severe as the reality is turning \nout to be. In fact, the estimate is that the percentage loss of sweet \ncorn in the State is 80 percent, silage corn is 70 percent, potatoes is \n60 percent, mixed vegetables is 75 percent, and hay is 50 percent. \nThese are difficult losses to bear, particularly difficult to bear \nwithout assistance.\n  We have received some rain through the last few weeks, but it has not \nbeen enough to reverse the damage that already was done April through \nAugust with the worst drought in the history of our region.\n  That is why I am here today, because, frankly, the resources in this \nlegislation that are being made available to the Northeast, to the Mid-\nAtlantic farmers, are insufficient. We have tried, over the last \nseveral months, to structure a meaningful relief package that would \nhelp the farmers throughout this country--every region.\n  In the 1999 emergency supplemental appropriations bill, Democrats \noffered an amendment to provide disaster relief for America's farmers \nand ranchers which would have taken care of all of our farmers \nthroughout the country. This provision was rejected by the majority. \nLater, Democrats offered additional disaster relief amendments to the \nfiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill as it was being \nconsidered in the subcommittee. Those amendments were rejected also.\n  On the floor of the Senate in August, I joined my Democratic \ncolleagues in supporting an emergency farm package that would provide \nover $10 billion to producers in need of relief, including $2.6 billion \nin disaster relief and $212 million in emergency conservation \nassistance, both of which would have been very critical to my farmers \nin Rhode Island and throughout the Northeast. Sadly, that proposal was \nalso rejected. There was even discussion to try to work out a \ncompromise, a bipartisan effort, on the order of $8.8 billion. This, \ntoo, failed.\n\n  Finally, I think in the hopes of moving the process forward, we did \nagree to the final $7 billion package proposed by the majority, as a \ndownpayment, if you will, on the necessary support we hoped we could \nobtain through the conference process and we hoped we would be voting \non today in this final conference report.\n  But today we are faced with a bill which we cannot amend, which we \nmust either accept or reject; and, sadly, despite all the efforts, all \nthe earnest efforts of my colleagues, I must vote against it because it \ndoes not provide the kind of assistance that is necessary for the \nfarmers of my State and my region.\n  Of the $8.7 billion in emergency farm relief in the appropriations \nbill, only $1.2 billion is set aside for all disasters declared by the \nSecretary of Agriculture in 1999. In the Northeast alone, our Governors \nhave told us we are facing nearly $2 billion in total losses. And as \ntoday's data indicates, those are probably conservative estimates. For \nthe Department of Agriculture to cover 65 percent of our region's \nlosses alone would cost about $1.3 billion. Yet we have only \nappropriated $1.2 billion for the entire country--every region, for \nevery natural disaster from January 1 to December 31.\n  So as you can see, all of this money that is within this bill could \neasily be used in the Northeast, in the Mid-Atlantic alone, but it will \nbe spread throughout the country and, in fact, be spread in such a way \nthat my farmers will be particularly disadvantaged.\n  It is unlikely this $1.2 billion of disaster relief money will be \navailable to my farmers until sometime in the middle of next year \nbecause, as the legislation is written, the Secretary must wait until \nthe end of the year to calculate all of the damages throughout the \ncountry and then begin the cumbersome process of proration and \ndistribution of these funds, which could take months. That is another \nproblem with the legislation. Not only are there insufficient funds \navailable to the Northeast, but these funds may not come until the \nmiddle of next year.\n  That is in contrast to what my colleague from Wisconsin pointed out \nwith respect to those farmers who are part of the Agricultural Market \nTransition Act. There is $5.5 billion there. That money will be flowing \nout immediately. They will get assistance immediately. Not only will \nthey get this assistance, but they will also qualify for this $1.2 \nbillion of natural disaster money if they suffered their loss through a \nnatural disaster. They will get essentially two bites of the apple, \nwhere my farmers in the Northeast will get what is left.\n  There are many States throughout this country that qualify for this \ndisaster program, this $1.2 billion--33 States, in fact. So there will \nbe a long line of farmers who have to be satisfied by this insufficient \namount of money.\n  There are things we could have done, I believe we should have done, \nin addition to putting more money into the natural disaster program so \nwe could take care of the real needs of all the farmers across the \ncountry.\n  I had hoped we could have increased the Crop Loss Disaster Assistance \nProgram, which is something that has been helpful in the past. There is \nalso a Livestock Feed Assistance Program which is also critically \nimportant to my farmers in the Northeast because much of the silage has \nbeen lost. In our dairy farms particularly, that is a critical loss.\n\n  We also, as we go forward, should think about the structure of the \nprogram for noninsured crop disaster assistance, the NAP program. There \nis a trigger in that program that requires a 35-percent areawide loss. \nSometimes we can't meet that loss, but, frankly, most of the crops in \nmy State are noninsured. They are strawberries, vegetables, et cetera. \nThey individually sometimes can't meet this trigger, and they are \ndenied any assistance whatsoever. If that program were more flexible, \nwe could address some of the concerns we are talking about today in \nterms of insufficient funding.\n  In addition to this lack of resources, in addition to the unfairness \nof the distribution, in addition to the lack of timely response to the \nproblems of my farmers in the Northeast and Rhode Island, there is also \nthe issue of the dairy compact. Failing to extend this undercuts a \nprogram that was working, a program that provided not only support to \nthe dairy industry in my State but, frankly, provided consumers with \nmilk at reasonable prices. It also provided tremendous environmental \nbenefit to the State of Rhode Island and other States because of the \npressure of development, particularly in the Northeast. Many of these \ndairy farms, given the choice of producing at a loss each year or \nselling out to developers, will sell out. In Rhode Island, the little \ngreen space we have becomes less and less and less.\n  For all these reasons, I must oppose this legislation. I hope in the \nremaining days of this session we can, in fact, find ways and other \nlegislative vehicles, perhaps even a supplemental, to\n\n[[Page S12457]]\n\ndirect assistance to the farmers throughout this country, including \nfarmers in the Northeast, particularly in my home State of Rhode \nIsland.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Grams.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I will talk a few minutes this morning in \nsupport of the Ashcroft amendment to the Agriculture appropriations \nbill dealing with sanctions. I know this Agriculture appropriations \nbill covers many areas, including dairy, as we just heard our colleague \nfrom Rhode Island discuss. I have a different view, of course, on the \ndairy situation. I hope to have more on that in another statement that \nwill also be entered into the Record in regard to the Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  I was disappointed the conferees decided to drop the Ashcroft Food \nand Medicine for the World amendment added by 70 Senators to the Senate \nAg appropriations bill. I am a cosponsor of the bill to be introduced \nby Senator Ashcroft and the cosponsors of his amendment. While I would \nprefer this bill addressed all unilateral sanctions, not just food and \nmedicine, I strongly support the bill as a good start to reforming our \nsanctions policy. As a cosponsor of the Lugar Sanctions Reform Act, I \nbelieve it is long overdue that the administration and the Congress \nthink before we sanction.\n  it makes no sense to punish the people of a country with which we \nhave a dispute. Denying food and medicine does nothing to penalize the \nleaders of any country. Government leaders can always obtain adequate \nfood and medicine, but people suffer under these sanctions, whether \nthey are multilateral or unilateral. Those two areas should never be a \npart of any sanction.\n  At the same time our farmers suffer from the lingering effects of the \nAsian financial crisis as well as those in other areas of the world, we \neither have, or are debating, sanctions that further restrict markets \nfor our farmers and medical supply companies. Since most of our \nsanctions are unilateral, it makes no sense to deny our farmers and \nworkers important markets when those sales are made by our allies. I \nneed not remind any of you that we are still experiencing the aftermath \nof the Soviet grain embargo of the early 1980's when the United States \nearned a reputation as an unreliable supplier.\n  Another example of how we have harmed our farmers is the Cuban \nembargo. I have for several years supported Senator Dodd's Cuba food \nand medicine bill, similar to this proposal. For 40 years this policy \nwas aimed at removing Fidel Castro--yet he is still there. This is a \nhuge market for midwestern farmers, yet it is shut off to us for no \ngood reason. Because Cuba has fiscal problems, many of its people are \nexperiencing hardship. Those who have relationships with Cuban-\nAmericans receive financial support, but those who don't have relatives \nhere need access to scarce food and medical supplies. Higher shipping \ncosts from other import sources has restricted the volume of food that \ncan be imported. Yet here we are 90 miles away. We could help these \npeople, but we cannot. It is time to develop more contact with the \nCuban people and time to help those who do not have relatives in the \nUnited States. This bill does not aid the government, as United States \nguarantees can only be provided through NGOs and the private sector. \nCurrently, donations are permitted, as well as sales of medicine, but \nthey are very bureaucratically difficult to obtain, and they don't help \neveryone. Our farmers are in a good position to help and they should be \nallowed to do so.\n  I applaud Senators Ashcroft and Hagel and many others for there work \nto ensure farmers and medical companies will not be held hostage to \nthose who believe sanctions can make a difference. Any administration \nwould have to get Congressional approval for any food and medicine \nsanction. This is our best opportunity to help farmers and to show the \nworld we are reliable suppliers. I urge the support of my colleagues \nfor this long overdue legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, seeing no Senators seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time \nbe charged equally among all sides to the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized for as much time as he may consume.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor the work that has been done on both sides. I know this is a very \ndifficult issue, one about which Members have very different ideas \nconcerning resolution. I do appreciate the work that has been done.\n  Certainly, one of the things that has occurred and has an impact on \nwhat we are talking about today has been the difficult times we are \nhaving in agriculture. In my State of Wyoming, we have basically three \nareas of economic activity. This is one of the three; minerals is the \nother. Both have not been good lately. Fortunately, there are some \nsigns of improvement, particularly in the livestock area, which is of \ncourse the most important part of Wyoming's agriculture.\n  I come to the floor to talk about what we need to do in the long run. \nWe are talking in this bill about a great deal of fairly short-term \nremedies. I don't argue with those particularly. I guess maybe we have \nspent a little more money than we should, used the emergency technique \nfor some things that probably are not bona fide emergencies. On the \nother hand, we have a great deal to do in our community in agriculture \nand all that needs to be done.\n  No one doubts the urgency of providing the short-term relief, whether \nit be from emergencies in weather, from emergencies in markets, or \nwhether it be other kinds.\n  But the fact is that this, in my view, is not the long-term solution \nto the problems we have. Producers in Wyoming generally do not favor \nreturning to the Government farm programs. I think they would much \nprefer the idea of being in the marketplace, producing for the \nmarketplace, developing new markets.\n  We had an agricultural seminar in our State recently, and those were \nthe things that were talked about--that we do need to develop markets; \nwe need overseas markets because we are great producers. We produce \nefficiently and at good prices. But in order to do that, we have to \ncontinue to develop markets. I think we have to, in addition, reduce \nthe kinds of restrictions that prohibit the sort of production we \nchoose. So we need to follow up, and I think many of the agricultural \nleaders in the Senate believe we have some things we have to do to make \nFreedom to Farm work. Those are the things we must do in following up \nto make that marketplace work.\n  One of them, of course, is to reduce unfair trade barriers throughout \nthe world. We have a great many of those, and probably the most \npressing one is the European Union, where they have found various ways \nthrough tariff barriers, or nontariff barriers, to keep agricultural \nproducts in the country moving--beef, for example, which is important \nto me and others.\n  We have a great opportunity, as we go forward with the WTO meetings \nin Seattle soon, to take to that meeting the kinds of things that are \nimportant to us. I happen to be involved as chairman of the \nsubcommittee on Asia and the Pacific rim. So I have been involved with \nsome of the countries with which we deal to a great extent.\n  Japan has a 40-percent tariff on American beef. This is not a \nrealistic thing to do. If we are going to have trade organizations and \ntrade treaties that are designed to level the playing field and be \nfair, those kinds of things should not happen. We have some \nopportunities in China, as a matter of\n\n[[Page S12458]]\n\nfact, where they moved this summer to suggest they would take more \nwheat and also more beef. So we have some great opportunities to do \nthat. We just this week had some hearings with respect to the NAFTA \ntreaty with Canada. In this instance, we had some hearings before the \nInternational Trade Commission to seek enforcement of those trade \nagreements.\n  So what I am saying, of course, is that these are the kinds of \nthings, over the long term, that we have to do to cause American \nagriculture to produce for the market and to be able to produce from \nthat market a reasonable price. We can do that.\n  Unilateral sanctions. We have had a great deal of talk and discussion \nabout unilateral sanctions. I think most people would agree that \nunilateral sanctions are not an effective tool for foreign policy. \nBasically, what we do is bar our own producers from selling in those \nparticular places and gain no advantage from it. If there have to be \nsanctions, they certainly ought not to be unilateral. They should be \nthrough some kind of a trade organization.\n  So that, coupled with enforcement, I believe, of trade agreements is \nsomething that agricultural people are very anxious about. Obviously, \nforeign trade is not the only remedy, but it is one of the major ones. \nIt was unfortunate that at the time we were moving into the marketplace \nin agriculture, we had the currency crisis in Asia, a place where we \nhave a potential for great markets. Of course, now, hopefully, the \nAsian market is strengthening and we will find we will be able to move \nback there again.\n\n  As I mentioned, foreign trade is not the only remedy and not the only \nissue on which we ought to be working. I think we have to have some \nother innovative avenues to spur market competition. I think one of \nthem that, again, was talked about at our seminar in Wyoming was \nproducer-owned cooperatives that move on through to the retail \nmarketing of these products.\n  I think it is pretty clear, particularly in the case of beef--or at \nleast it is very appropriate there--where you had a major reduction in \nthe price received by producers but no reduction in the retail market, \nno reduction in the grocery store when you went there--so there is some \nsort of a problem in between. We think producer-owned cooperatives may \nbe a way to do the processing and to ensure that, indeed, producers are \ngiven their fair share of the final product. Another is niche \nmarketing. A great number of things are taking place on the Internet, \nwhere people are marketing products in specialties areas.\n  I think we need to look at the concentration of packers, where there \nare only two or three packers that handle 80 to 85 percent of the \nlivestock. I think there are some similarities in the grain industry, \nwhere very few buyers are available to go into the marketplace. So you \nhave to ask the question, Is there, indeed, a competitive, fair \nmarketplace? We have the Packers and Stockyard Act which is designed to \ndo that. Over the years, we have appealed to the Justice Department a \nnumber of times to look at whether there was, indeed, a monopoly \nfactor. They have said that, under the law, there is not. Not everybody \nagrees with that. Nevertheless, that has been the result.\n  We are going to, I think sometime this week, introduce a proposition \nthat would have to do with packers' ownership of livestock and see if \nwe can do something about reducing the potential for monopolies so the \nmarket prices are there. In this bill, I think there is a market-price-\nrevealing requirement that is very important.\n  Financial solvency, of course, for agriculture is always difficult.\n  Crop insurance. The Senator who is presiding at this time continues \nto do a great deal with crop insurance, and we need to do that--at \nleast from the weather emergency standpoint. That is the kind of thing \nthat needs to be in place to protect the investment of farmers. In the \nform of tax relief, we have tried to do some things to extend income \naveraging. As you can understand, because some years are good and some \nare not, there needs to be the ability to income average.\n  There is interest in estate taxes. Most agricultural people have \ntheir estate in property, and they make very little profit often, but \nit accumulates toward their estate under the circumstances, and after \nthey get beyond the exemption of 55 percent, that estate has to be paid \nin taxes. That is extremely difficult for agriculture. So we are going \nto be doing some things there.\n  Regulatory relief is particularly important in States such as ours, \nwhere 50 percent of the land belongs to the Federal Government, where \nmuch of agricultural activity, particularly livestock, is carried on, \non public lands. The restrictions sometimes are very difficult.\n  So I am pleased we are going forward with this bill. As is the case \nwith many, it probably isn't the way I would do it if I were in charge. \nBut I am not in charge, nor is anyone else. So when you put it all \ntogether, it is difficult. I think the committee has done the best they \ncould and has done a good job, but we need to focus on the long-term \nprosperity in agriculture, the family farm. We need to focus on \ncontinuing to keep U.S. producers competitive in the world market and, \nfinally, opening those markets throughout the world for our \nagricultural products on a fair basis, so we are not kept out of those \nmarkets by nontariff barriers, and, in addition, of course, to develop \ndomestically the things we do.\n\n  So, again, I say to the chairman, the Senator from Mississippi, good \njob. He has worked very hard in doing this, and we are pleased that \nthis bill will be sent to the White House.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, repeat what I \nsaid on the floor yesterday, which is that I am going to support this \nemergency package, both the financial emergency package and the \ndisaster relief emergency package.\n  I am going to do so because, may I say for the Record, Tracy Beckman \ntells me this will mean $620 million in AMTA payments to Minnesota, and \nthis will be important for some 60,000-plus producers. I hasten to add \nthat most of this money to farmers will end up being used to pay back \nbankers.\n  I also am going to support this because I want to get some assistance \nout there. I don't think we are going to have enough with this $8.7 \nbillion package. I don't think there is enough for disaster relief.\n  Clearly, our farmers in the Northeast are saying we don't figure in. \nAnd in northwest Minnesota where we have had so much wet weather and \nsome farmers haven't been able to get a crop in or much of a crop in, I \nfear there won't be enough assistance.\n  But I think that when we are at least talking about something we can \npass. We need to get this to the President and have President sign it \nin order to get some of this financial assistance out to our \ncommunities within the next couple of weeks. For this reason, I am \ngoing to support it. I also want to say that I hope to have to never \nvote for such a package again.\n  I believe these disaster relief bills are becoming a disaster. I \nthink they are a complicated way of acknowledging the fact that we have \na failed agricultural policy. Who would ever have dreamed that we would \nhave spent over $19 billion now to keep farmers going post-Freedom to \nFarm bill. This doesn't make a lot of sense.\n  The producers in my State, the farmers in my State, much less the \nrural communities, the small businesses that are affected by this, the \nimplement dealers, and those who sell tools all say: What we want is a \ndecent price.\n  I want to make it real clear that I wish--though I appreciate the \nwork, I don't think there is any Senator on the floor who has any \nunkind words to say about Senator Cochran, publicly or privately, \nbecause I think he is held in such high regard--I wish we were doing \nthis through a somewhat different mechanism because I fear that too \nmuch of the support will be in reverse relation to need. I think we \nwill have yet another supplementary emergency package to deal with, \nespecially disaster relief because there is not enough in here.\n  In any case, we ought to deal with the root of the problem. The \nfamily farmers in my State of Minnesota and in the rural communities \nthat have been so affected by this economic convulsion in agriculture--\nit is a depression in agriculture--I want to see a\n\n[[Page S12459]]\n\nnew policy. The Freedom to Farm bill has become the ``freedom to fail'' \nbill. I do not hear very many Senators talking any longer about staying \nthe course. We have to change the course of agricultural policy.\n  I make a plea on floor of the Senate that before we finish, before we \nadjourn, before we leave Washington, before we go back to our States, \nwe pass legislation to change farm policy; that we pass some \nlegislation to deal with the price crisis; that we pass legislation to \ngive our farmers and our producers some leverage in the marketplace so \nthey can make a decent price and so they can support their families.\n  The plea or the cry in rural America from family farmers is nothing \nmore than to say for all you people who believe there should be a \nfamily wage, or a living wage, and a parent or parents ought to be able \nto make enough of a wage to support their families, well, those of us \nwho produce the food and the fiber for families in this country ask for \nthe same thing.\n  That is what this is all about.\n  I want to translate this crisis in personal terms.\n  Lynn Jostock is a Waseca, MN, dairy farmer. He tells his story:\n\n       I have four children. My 11-year-old son Al helps my \n     husband and I by doing chores. But it often is too much to \n     expect of someone so young. For instance, one day our son \n     came home from school. His father asked Al for some help \n     driving the tractor to another farm about 3 miles away. Al \n     was going to come home right afterward. But he wound up \n     helping his father cut hay. Then he helped rake hay. Then he \n     helped bale hay. My son did not return home until 9:30 p.m. \n     He had not yet eaten supper. He had not yet done his \n     schoolwork. We don't have other help. The price we get at the \n     farm gate isn't enough to allow us to hire any farmhands or \n     to help our community by providing more jobs. And it isn't \n     fair to ask your 11-year-old son to work so hard to keep the \n     family going. When will he burn out? How will he ever want to \n     farm?\n\n  Gary Wilson, an Odin farmer, says:\n\n       Received the church newsletter in the mail. What's normally \n     to the entire congregation had been addressed to only \n     farmers. The newsletter said farmers should quit farming if \n     it was not profitable. If larger, corporate-style farms were \n     the way to turn a profit, the independent farmers should let \n     go and find something else to do. ``What he doesn't \n     understand is that the farmers are his congregation. If we \n     go, he won't have a church.''\n\n  Oh, how right Gary Wilson is.\n  The point is, if we continue with this failed policy, we are going to \nlose a generation of producers. We are going to see this convulsion in \nagriculture play out to the point where we have a few large \nconglomerates that control all phases of the food industry. Believe me, \nif you have just a few landowners versus a lot of family farmers who \nlive and buy in the community and invest in the community, there won't \nbe the support for the church. There won't be the support for the \nsynagogue. There won't be the support for the small business. There \nwon't be the support for the school system.\n  Darrel Mosel is a Gaylord farmer.\n\n       Farming for 18 years. When he started farming in Sibley \n     County, which is one of Minnesota's largest agricultural \n     counties, there were 4 implement dealers in Gaylord, the \n     county seat. Today, there are none. There's not even an \n     implement dealer in all of Sibley County. The same thing has \n     happened to feed stores and grain elevators. Since the farm \n     policies of the 1980s and the resulting reduction in prices, \n     farmers don't buy new equipment they either use baling wire \n     to hold things together or quit. ``The farm houses have \n     people in them but they don't farm. There's something wrong \n     with that.''\n\n  That is a direct quote from Darrel.\n  John Doe--this is a farmer who wants to remain anonymous:\n\n       This family has gone through a divorce and the father and \n     three children are operating the farm. The father has taken \n     an off farm job to make payments to the bank and has his 12 \n     year old son and 14 year old daughter are operating the \n     farming operation, unassisted while he is away at work. The \n     neighbors have threatened to turn him in to human services \n     for child abandonment and so he had to have his 18 year old \n     daughter quit work and stay at home to watch the two younger \n     children.\n       The 12 year old boy is working heavy farm equipment, mostly \n     alone. He is driving these big machines and can hardly reach \n     the clutch on the tractor. It's this or lose the farm.\n\n  I could go on and on, but I will not. I want to repeat what I have \nsaid, which is that I am going to support this emergency assistance \npackage. But all it does, at best, is enable farmers to live to farm \nanother day. The truth of the matter is it isn't going to help the \nfarmers who it needs to help the most.\n  In addition, I am going to support it because at least it gets some \nassistance to some families. It doesn't do anything for the small \nbusinesses. Most important of all, farmers simply will not have any \nfuture.\n  Ken and Lois Schaefer from Greenwald, MN, will not receive much \nassistance. Ken and Lois are one of the few small, independent hog \noperations still remaining, with roughly 400 hogs. They raise feeder \nhogs and sows. Lois has an off-farm job to make ends meet. Ken is \nconsidering an additional job. This is common. People who farm have \njobs off the farm; it is unbelievable stress on the family. There is no \nchoice if they are to survive.\n  A recent hog operation opened near the Schaefer farm and is seeking \nemployees. Ken's neighbor started working part time for the hog \nfactory. Ken and Lois will not receive much assistance; there is not \nnear enough livestock assistance. However, Ken and Lois do not \nnecessarily want assistance. What they want is a decent price for their \nhogs.\n  They ask the question: How can it be that we as hog producers are \nfacing extinction and these packers are in hog heaven? How can it be \nthat we as hog producers are facing extinction and the IBPs and the \nCargills and the ConAgras are making record profits?\n  Several weeks ago, I spoke about the crisis that is ravaging rural \nAmerica. I told my colleagues about farmers I visited in Minnesota, \nIowa, Missouri, South Dakota, and Texas. Today, I want to talk about \nwhy there is this convulsion, why every month more and more family \nfarms are put on the auction block; why every month more and more \nfamily farmers are forced to give up their way of life; why they lose \ntheir work; why they are losing their hope; and why they are sometimes \nlosing their communities.\n  We ought to act now. I have said to the majority leader three or four \ntimes that I want an opportunity to bring to the floor of the Senate \nsome legislation that will alleviate the suffering. I want to talk \nabout this today. I want the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on \na moratorium on any further mergers or acquisition of any huge \nagribusiness. We have a frightening concentration of market power. \nThese big conglomerates have muscled their way to the dinner table and \nare driving out family farmers. At the very minimum, we can put into \neffect the moratorium and have a study so over the next 18 months we \ncan come up with legislation while this moratorium is in place that \nwill put some competition and free enterprise back into the food \nindustry, giving our family farmers, our producers, a fighting chance.\n  Several weeks ago I spoke on the floor at some length about the \ncrisis that is ravaging rural America today. I told my colleagues about \nsome of the farmers I've visited with in Minnesota, in Iowa, in Texas, \nand around the country who are on the brink of financial disaster \nbecause of record low farm prices.\n  Farmers from all around the country were in Washington, DC, that week \nbecause they know that the future of the family farm is at stake. Every \nmonth, more and more family farms are put on the auction block. Every \nmonth, more and more family farmers are being forced to give up their \nlife's work, their homes, and their communities. We must act now.\n  In Minnesota, about 6,500 farmers are expected to go out of business \nthis year. That's about eight percent of all farmers in my state. In \nnorthwest Minnesota, which has been hit especially hard by this crisis, \nabout 11 percent are expected to go under. An August 1999 survey of \nMinnesota County Emergency Boards reported that more Minnesota farmers \nare quitting or retiring with fewer farmers taking their place; more \nMinnesota farm families are having to rely on non-farm income to stay \nafloat; and the number of Minnesota farmers leaving the land will \ncontinue to increase unless and until farm prices improve. We must act \nnow.\n  Today I want to take a step back and look at the larger picture. I \nwant to examine what is going on in American agriculture and why; what \nit means for farmers and for us as a society; and, most importantly, \nwhat we can do about it.\n  I want to talk about record low farm prices. I want to talk about \nrecord high\n\n[[Page S12460]]\n\nlevels of market concentration and the absence of effective competition \nin almost every major commodity market. I want to talk about the \nfailure of our antitrust enforcement authorities to do much of anything \nabout this.\n  I want to talk about the need for Congress to take immediate action \nto restore competitive markets in agriculture and give farmers more \nequal bargaining power against corporate agribusiness. And I also want \nto make the case for a moratorium on large agribusiness mergers and \nacquisitions, effective immediately, which I have recently proposed \nalong with Senator Dorgan.\n  In my travels around Minnesota and around the country, I've found \nthat many people are not even aware of the crisis afflicting rural \nAmerica today. Even fewer have any idea to what extent market \nconcentration and anti-competitive practices have substantially \neliminated competition in agriculture. So let me just start by ticking \noff a few statistics that some of my colleagues may find surprising.\n  In the past decade and a half, an explosion of mergers, acquisitions, \nand anti-competitive practices has raised concentration in American \nagriculture to record levels.\n  The top four pork packers have increased their market share from 36 \npercent to 57 percent.\n  The top four beef packers have expanded their market share from 32 \npercent to 80 percent.\n  The top four flour millers have increased their market share from 40 \npercent to 62 percent.\n  The market share of the top four soybean crushers has jumped from 54 \npercent to 80 percent.\n  The top four turkey processors now control 42 percent of production.\n  49 percent of all chicken broilers are now slaughtered by the four \nlargest firms.\n  The top four firms control 67 percent of ethanol production.\n  The top four sheep, poultry, wet corn, and dry corn processors now \ncontrol 73 percent, 55 percent, 74 percent, and 57 percent of the \nmarket, respectively.\n  The four largest grain buyers control nearly 40 percent of elevator \nfacilities.\n  By conventional measures, none of these markets is really \ncompetitive. According to the economic literature, markets are no \nlonger competitive if the top four firms control over 40 percent. In \nall the markets I just listed, the market share of the top four firms \nis 40 percent or more. So there really is no effective competition in \nthe processing markets for pork, beef, chicken, turkeys, ethanol, \nflour, soybean, wet corn, dry corn and grain.\n  This development is not entirely new. In some sectors of agriculture, \nthere was already considerable horizontal concentration at the turn of \nthe century. Pork and beef slaughtering and processing were dominated \nby Wilson, Armour and Swift. That's why Congress passed the Packers and \nStockyards Act in 1921.\n  But now, with this explosion of mergers, acquisitions, joint \nventures, marketing agreements, and anti-competitive behavior by the \nlargest firms, these and other commodity markets are becoming more and \nmore concentrated by the day.\n  Recently the Justice Department approved a modified merger between \nCargill and Continental. Just a few weeks ago Smithfield Foods, a major \nmeat processor, announced the acquisition of Murphy Family Farms, a \ngiant hog producer. DuPont is buying Pioneer Hi-Bred International. ADM \nis buying more and more of IBP. Among seed companies and input \nsuppliers, there has been more than $15 billion worth of combinations \nin the last three years.\n  In my hands I have a monthly listing of new mergers, acquisitions, \nand other agribusiness deals through March 1999. Let me just read a \nsample of some of the headlines to give you a sense of how rapidly this \nconcentration is taking place. March 1999: Dupont to buy Pioneer. \nFarmland-Cenex to discuss combining grain operations. Smithfield to \nacquire Carroll's.\n  February 1999: Three California dairies preparing for merger. \nDecember 1998: Monsanto completes Dekalb purchase. Smithfield gains \ncontrol of Schneider. Cargill buys Bunge's Venezuelan units. November \n1998: Cargill buys out rival grain operation; deal boosts firm's hold \non market. Dow Chemical completes purchase of Mycogen. IBP buys \nappetizer business in expansion move. And so on.\n  The effect of this surge of concentration is that agribusiness \nconglomerates have increased their bargaining power over farmers. When \nfarmers have fewer buyers to choose from, they have less leverage to \nget a good price. Anybody who has been to an auction knows that you get \na better price with more bidders. Moreover, when farmers have fewer \nbuyers to choose from, agribusinesses can more easily dictate \nconditions that farmers have to meet. And fewer buyers means farmers \noften have to haul their production longer distances, driving up their \ntransportation costs.\n  In addition to this horizontal concentration among firms in the same \nline of business, we are also seeing another kind of concentration. \nIt's called vertical integration. Vertical integration is when one firm \nexpands its control over the various stages of food production, from \ndevelopment of the animal or plant gene, to production of fertilizer \nand chemical inputs, to actual production, to processing, to marketing \nand distribution, to the supermarket shelf.\n  The poultry industry is already vertically integrated, by and large. \n95 percent of all chicken broilers are produced under production \ncontracts with fewer than 40 firms. Now the same process is occurring \nin the pork industry. Pork packers are buying up what's called captive \nsupply--hogs that they own or have contracted for under marketing \nagreements. If these trends continue, grain and soybean production may \nsoon be vertically integrated just like poultry.\n  The problem with this kind of vertical concentration is that it \ndestroys competitive markets. Potential competitors often never know \nthe sale price for goods at any point in the process. That's because \nthere never is a sale price until the consumer makes the final \npurchase, since nothing is being sold outside the integrated firm. It's \nhard to have effective competition if prices are not publicly \navailable. Today there is essentially no price discovery, and therefore \nno effective competition, for chicken feed, day old chicks, live \nchicken broilers, turkeys and eggs. If vertical integration of pork and \ndairy continues at the current pace, we can expect much the same in \nthose industries.\n  Vertical concentration stacks the deck against farmers, as we can see \nclearly in the case of the rapidly consolidating hog industry. An April \n1999 report by the Minnesota Land Stewardship Project found that:\n\n       Packers' practice of acquiring captive supplies through \n     contracts and direct ownership is reducing the number of \n     opportunities for small- and medium-sized farmers to sell \n     their hogs;\n       With fewer buyers and more captive supply, there is less \n     competition for independent farmers' hogs and insufficient \n     market information regarding price; and\n       Lower prices result.\n\n  Even the USDA's Western Corn Belt hog procurement study showed price \ndiscrimination against smaller farmers. Smaller farmers were paid lower \nbase prices, lower premiums, and they were given little or no access to \nlong-term marketing contracts.\n  The combined effect of these two different kinds of concentration is \nto put enormous market power in the hands of a handful of global \nagribusiness giants. Not only do these conglomerates dominate \nprocessing for all the major commodities, but the same firms appear \namong the top four or five processors for several different \ncommodities. ConAgra, for example, is among the Top Four for beef, \npork, turkeys, sheep, and seafood, and it's number five for chicken \nbroilers. To make matters worse, many of these firms are vertically \nintegrated. Cargill, for example, is among the Top Four firms trading \ngrain, producing animal feed, feeding hogs and beef, and processing \nhogs and beef.\n  Farmers clearly see the connection between this concentration and \nlower farm prices. Leland Swensen, president of the National Farmers \nUnion, recently testified that\n\n       The increasing level of market concentration, with the \n     resulting lack of competition in the marketplace, is one of \n     the top concerns of farmers and ranchers. At most farm and \n     ranch meetings, market concentration ranks as either the \n     first or second in priority\n\n[[Page S12461]]\n\n     of issues of concern. Farmers and ranchers believe that lack \n     of competition is a key factor in the low commodity prices \n     they are receiving.\n\n  Well, no wonder. How else can you explain the record profits that the \nlarge agribusiness conglomerates are racking up, at the same time low \nprices are causing a depression for family farmers? IBP's earnings in \n1998, for example, were up 62 percent. In the second quarter of this \nyear, they were up a whopping 126 percent. Packing plants, food \nprocessors and retailers are all reporting record profits.\n  While corporate agribusiness grows fat, farmers are facing lean \ntimes. The commodity price index is the lowest since 1987. Hog prices \nare at their lowest since 1972. Cotton and soybean prices are the \nlowest they've been since the early 1970s. Feed grain prices are the \nlowest they've been since the mid-1980s. Food grain prices are at the \nlowest levels since the early 1990s. Agricultural income in the mid-\nWestern states is predicted to fall between 15 and 60 percent this \nyear.\n  Current prices are so low that many family farmers are lucky to stay \nin business. Market prices are lower than their cost of production. The \nvalue of field crops is expected to be more than 24 percent lower in \n1999 than it was in 1996--42 percent lower for wheat, 39 percent lower \nfor corn, and 26 percent lower for soybeans. But farmers' expenses \naren't falling by the same amount. In fact, they're not falling at all. \nFarmers can't cash flow if their selling prices are falling through the \nfloor while their buying prices are shooting through the roof.\n  It all comes down to market power. Corporate agribusinesses are using \ntheir market power to lower prices,  without passing those price \nsavings on to consumers. The gap between what consumers pay for food \nand what farmers get paid is growing wider. According to the USDA, the \nso-called farm-to-retail price spread--the difference between the farm \nvalue and the retail price of food--rose 4.7 percent in 1997. From 1984 \nto 1998, prices paid to farmers fell 36 percent, while consumer food \nprices actually increased by 3 percent.\n\n  In other words, the farmer's share of farm profit is falling. The \nfarmer share of every retail dollar has fallen from 50 percent in 1952 \nto 25 percent today. By the same token, the profit share of farm input, \nmarketing, and processing companies is rising. The agribusiness \nconglomerates claim that this is because they're putting more ``added \nvalue'' into food products. Actually, it looks like they're taking \nadditional value out.\n  Some people have blamed low farm prices on other factors, such as \ndeclining exports. That's a big debate that will have to wait for \nanother day. But let me just say this. We can hardly expect export \ngrowth to translate into higher prices for American farmers if the \nmultinational agribusinesses still have enough bargaining power to keep \nfarm prices down.\n  As Jim Braun, a third-generation Iowa farmer, wrote recently, \n``Unfortunately, increased exports do not necessarily mean more money \nfor farmers. IBP has doubled exports since 1990 and quadrupled profits \nin 1998, while it destroyed family farmers by paying below Depression-\nera prices for hogs. If Cargill, ConAgra, or ADM, the three major grain \nprocessors and exporters, could sell corn overseas for $20 per bushel, \nthey could still pay American farmers below the cost of production \nsimply because they have the power to do so.''\n  What we do know for sure is that low farm prices are driving \nthousands of farmers into bankruptcy, and concentration is helping to \ndepress prices. That's reason enough why we should take immediate \naction to address the problem of concentration. But there are plenty of \nother reasons why we should be concerned about concentration in \nagriculture.\n  First of all, concentration is bad for the environment. When large-\nscale corporate feedlots replace family-size farms, they create large \namounts of waste in a relatively small space. That puts enormous strain \non the local ecology. The lower prices resulting from unequal \nbargaining power also put pressure on farmers to abandon careful soil \nand water conservation practices.\n  There's another reason why we should be concerned about concentration \nin agriculture. The price effects of unequal bargaining power are \ntremendously destructive of community and family values. This \nconnection was made explicit in an infamous 1962 report by the \nCommittee for Economic Development, whose members included some of the \nbiggest food companies.\n  Amazingly, the Committee had this to say about community and family \nvalues. They recommended investment ``in projects that break up village \nlife by drawing people to centers of employment away from the village . \n. . because village life is a major source of opposition to change.'' \nThey went on to say, ``Where there are religious obstacles to modern \neconomic progress, the religion may have to be taken less seriously or \nits character changed.''\n  So the largest agribusinesses were afraid that ``village life'' and \nreligion would stand in the way of modern economic progress. But what \nexactly did they mean by the term ``modern economic progress\"? It turns \nout they meant the bankruptcy and forced emigration of two million \nfarmers. That's what their report recommended. These agribusiness \ngiants were advocating lower price supports for farmers in order to \nlower farm prices. And the primary benefits of lowering farm prices, \nthey argued, would be to lower input prices for the food companies, to \nincrease foreign trade, and to depress wage levels by putting two \nmillion farmers out of business and dumping them into the urban labor \npool.\n  There's a third reason why we should be concerned about concentration \nin agriculture. As the Committee for Economic Development report makes \nclear, this concentration is harmful to the economic development of \nrural communities. It's been estimated that when a farm goes under, \nthree to five jobs are destroyed. For every six farm failures, one \nrural business shuts down.\n  The reason is pretty simple. When production is controlled by more \nnon-local corporations, profits don't get reinvested in the community. \nWhen family businesses operate local farms, elevators, and grocery \nstores, they plough profits right back into other local businesses. \nThose revenues circulate locally three or four times, creating what's \ncalled a multiplier effect. But there's no multiplier effect when non-\nlocal corporations drain profits out of the community. Rural \ncommunities become little more than a source of cheap labor inputs for \nagribusiness multinationals--to be purchased as cheaply as possible in \ncompetition with low-wage labor overseas.\n  Obviously, this kind of concentration is not good for the social and \neconomic health of rural communities. According to the Nebraska Center \nfor Rural Affairs, virtually all researchers have found that social \nconditions deteriorate in rural communities when farm size and absentee \nownership increase. Studies have shown that communities surrounded by \nlarge corporate farms suffer from greater income polarization--with a \nfew wealthy elites, a majority of poor laborers, and virtually no \nmiddle class. The tax base shrinks and the quantity and quality of \ntheir public services, public education, and local government declines.\n  John Crabtree of the Center for Rural Affairs sums it up this way: \n``Replacing mid-size farms with big farms reduces middle-class \nentrepreneurial opportunities in farm communities, at best replacing \nthem with wage labor. . . . A system of economically viable, owner-\noperated family farms contributed more to communities than systems \ncharacterized by inequality and large numbers of farm laborers with \nbelow-average incomes and little ownership or control of productive \nassets.'' He concludes that ``Societies in which income, wealth, and \npower are more equitably distributed are generally healthier than those \nin which they are highly concentrated.''\n  I think this last point is true not only of rural communities,  but \nof our country as a whole. ``Societies in which income, wealth, and \npower are more equitably distributed are generally healthier than those \nin which they are highly concentrated.'' In other words, we all do \nbetter when we all do better. When we have a thriving middle class, \nincluding a thriving family farm sector, our economy performs better. \nOur democracy functions better.\n\n  The idea that concentrations of wealth, of economic power, and of \npolitical power are unhealthy for our democracy is a theme that runs \nthroughout American history, from Thomas\n\n[[Page S12462]]\n\nJefferson to Andrew Jackson to the Progressive Era to the New Deal. But \nthis idea was perhaps most forcefully expressed by the People's Party \nof the late 1800s, sometimes called the Populists.\n  The People's Party embodied popular disgust with rampant \nmonopolization and concentration of economic and political power. The \nPopulist platform from the 1892 nominating convention in Omaha \ndeclared, ``The fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to \nbuild up colossal fortunes for a few, unprecedented in the history of \nmankind.'' People's Party founder Tom Watson thundered, ``The People's \nParty is the protest of the plundered against the plunderers.''\n  In the Gilded Age of the late 1800s and the Progressive Era of the \nearly 1900s, the danger of concentrated economic power was widely \nrecognized and hotly debated. The Populists argued that a free and \ndemocratic society cannot prosper with such concentration of power and \ninequalities of wealth. As the great Supreme Court Justice Louis \nBrandeis said, ``We can have democracy in this country, or we can have \nwealth in the hands of a few. We can't have both.''\n  The Populists were reacting to a concentration of wealth, economic \npower, and political power that was remarkably similar to what we've \nexperienced in the late 1900s. Today, despite wage gains for low-income \nworkers over the past couple years, inequality in America has reached \nrecord levels.\n  According to reports by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \nand the Economic Policy Institute, the gap between rich and poor is \ngreater today than at any time since the Great Depression. CBO data \nshows that after-tax income is more heavily concentrated among the \nrichest one percent of the population than it has been since 1977. CBO \nprojects that in 1999 the richest 1 percent of Americans (2.7 million \npeople) will receive as much after-tax income as the poorest 38 percent \n(100 million people) put together.\n  At the same time, we are witnessing the biggest wave of mergers and \neconomic concentration since the late 1800s. Not only in agriculture, \nbut in media and communications, banking, health care, airlines, \nenergy, hi-tech, defense, you name it. There were 4,728 reportable \nmergers in 1998, compared to 3,087 in 1993; 1,529 in 1991; and a mere \n804 in 1980. And as Joel Klein, head of Justice Department's Antitrust \nDivision, has pointed out, the value of last year's mergers equaled the \ncombined value of all mergers from 1990 through 1996 put together.\n  Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, the political scientist E. J. Dionne, \nand the philosopher Michael Sandel, among others, have all drawn \nparallels between the conditions of today and the heyday of monopoly \npower in the 19th Century. In the Gilded Age, the welfare of farmers, \nrural communities, and small businesses was sacrificed for the economic \ninterests of burgeoning bank, railroad, and grain monopolies. Today, \nthe welfare and future of our family farmers and rural communities is \nbeing sacrificed to the economic interests of near-monopoly global \nagribusiness.\n  While the Sherman Act was written by a Republican senator and signed \ninto law by a Republican president, in 1896 William McKinley and the \nRepublicans openly sided with the titans of industry and decided to \nwrite off rural America. They felt that the ``social reformers, \nagrarian rebels, church leaders, and others who challenged the \nauthority of the industrial giants'' were being hopelessly sentimental, \nas E.J. Dionne puts it. The McKinley Republicans presumed that monopoly \ninterests were on the right side of history, of economic progress, and \nof civilization.\n  Interestingly enough, Populist demands were initially rebuffed with \nmany of the same arguments that have become conventional wisdom today. \nThe Populists were told that monopoly power was the legitimate outcome \nof free markets, that concentration was the inevitable result of \ntechnological progress, that concentration represented economic \nefficiency, and that there were no viable alternatives.\n  These arguments are no truer today than they were at the turn of the \ncentury. The current trend towards concentration in agriculture is not \nthe product of the ``free market,'' nor of Adam Smith's invisible hand. \nFor starters, with no effective competition in the major commodity \nmarkets, these can hardly be held up as models of free market \ncompetition. What they really stand for is market failure.\n  In any event, these near-monopolies were not created by the free \nmarket at all. They were created by government, just like the railroad \nmonopolies of the 19th century. Instead of Adam Smith's invisible hand, \nwe are seeing the hand of multinational food conglomerates, in the \nwords of Iowa farmer Jim Braun, ``acting inside the glove of \ngovernment.''\n  The role of government in creating and fostering these monopolies is \nprobably most obvious in the context of intellectual property rights, \nsuch as patents and copyrights. These are monopolies by definition. The \nwhole point of intellectual property protection is to prevent \ncompetition. Without that patent protection, there would be a lot more \ncompanies selling seed and other inputs to the farmer, there would be a \nlot more competition, and the farmer would pay much lower prices. And \nbecause of that protection, intellectual property rights generate \noutsized profits and market power.\n  My point is not that these patent protections are a good thing or a \nbad thing. The answer will probably depend on a lot of different \nfactors in each particular case. My point is that they are not an \nexample of the free market at work. On the contrary, these are \nmonopolies formally granted by the government.\n  The issue here is not just competition for the patented goods, but \nbarriers to competition for the entire agribusiness industry. If one of \nthese conglomerates engages in high-handed behavior, new businesses \ncould normally be expected to enter the market and steal its market \nshare. But smaller competitors can't enter the market if the barriers \nto entry are too high. And intellectual property rights are a mighty \nhigh barrier.\n  In fact, one of the motors driving consolidation of agribusiness \ntoday is biotechnology. Soon biotech companies will be able to control \nthe entire food production chain with their genetics. Already Monsanto, \nDuPont, and Novartis are gobbling up smaller biotech companies' market \nshare, patent rights, and customer base. And biotech patent monopolies \non plant and animal genomes will be a nearly insurmountable barrier to \nmarket entry in the future.\n  Professor Bill Heffernan, who was commissioned by the National \nFarmers Union to study these trends, projects that the entire \nagricultural sector will soon consolidate into a small number of ``food \nchain clusters,'' revolving around intellectual property firms. The \nnumber of these clusters will be limited by the small number of firms \nwith intellectual property protection and by extremely high barriers to \nmarket entry.\n  A handful of vertically integrated food chain clusters are already \npoised to control food production from the gene to the supermarket \nshelf. Professor Heffernan identifies three existing food cluster \nchains: Cargill-Monsanto, ConAgra, and Novartis-ADM. He predicts that \nanother two or three will eventually develop. Smaller seed firms, \nindependent producers and other independent businesses will face a \ndilemma. Either they join one of alliances to obtain inputs and sell \ntheir production, or they go out of business.\n  The emergence of these titanic food conglomerates is not the \ninevitable outcome of technological progress, but of conscious policy \nchoices. Our government-funded research programs, for example, have \nchosen to fund expensive technologies that generate greater sales for \nthe largest agribusinesses and diminish the role of farmers in the \nproduction of food.\n  Government support for private-sector monopoly over the ``terminator \ngene'' is a good example of the bias inherent in these choices. The \nterminator gene is a gene that can be inserted in plants to make their \nseeds sterile. It forces farmers to buy new seeds every year instead of \nreusing their own.\n  This is not a neutral technology. It raises the income of the seed \nsuppliers and intellectual property holders by forcing farmers to pay \nmore for seed. As Lee Swenson of the National Farmers Union recently \nhas testified, ``Biotechnology and the terminator gene have put the \nfarmer at the mercy of\n\n[[Page S12463]]\n\nthe food cluster for seed to plant crop. If the firms in the processing \nstage of the cluster require specific genetic material and the farmer \ncannot get that seed, the farmer has no market access.'' Yet this \ntechnology was developed with support from none other than the USDA.\n  While choosing to invest in technologies such as the terminator gene, \nthe government has generally failed to invest in technology that would \nbenefit the family farmer. Research dollars have not been directed \ntowards technologies that would reduce farmers' costs for capital or \ninputs, for example, or help them produce higher value products. Dr. \nNeil Harl of Iowa State University also calls for more government \nsupport of cutting edge seed varieties that should be made available to \nsmaller seed companies, helping them compete against the emerging food \nclusters.\n  Instead, Congress has chosen to cut funding for publicly available \nresearch in biotechnology. One seed company CEO, when asked what \nfarmers could do to resist the growing vertical integration of \nagriculture, said, ``Absolutely nothing, because these are property \nrights owned by the companies, so the farmer is going to become more \nand more at the mercy of the few who own intellectual properties. \nAgain, it goes back to the shortsightedness of funding basic research \nin such a parsimonious fashion. Without government funding, companies \nare going to fund research and control it.''\n  Economic concentration is not dictated by economic efficiencies any \nmore than it is by free markets and technological progress. In the late \n1800s, John D. Rockefeller made the classic argument for the economic \nefficiencies of monopoly power. He claimed that Standard Oil's monopoly \nwas good for the public because it created efficiencies that could be \npassed along to the consumer in the form of lower oil prices. That \nargument wasn't compelling then, and it's not compelling today.\n  First of all, efficiency is not what's driving the trend towards \nconcentration in agriculture. Research by Iowa State University \neconomist Mike Duffy shows no further economies of scale beyond 600 \nacres of row crops and about 150 sows. But the most rapidly growing \nfarming operations in Iowa are much larger than that, so economies of \nscale cannot be driving their expansion.\n  One Iowa farmer writes, ``Today efficiency and cost of production \nhave nothing to do with determining which farmer will survive as a food \nproducer.'' The most important factor is probably the special \nrelationships the integrating firm has with other businesses. In \nindustries undergoing vertical integration, especially, farmers who \ndon't have special relationships with feed or slaughtering firms often \nhave to pay more for inputs and have more problems selling their \nproduct. And smaller farmers are being forced to sign production \ncontracts with input suppliers to obtain new technologies they need to \nstay competitive.\n  Another critical factor determining who survives in these non-\ncompetitive markets is deep pockets and market share. Conglomerates \nwith multiple holdings can cross-subsidize one of their operations with \nprofits from another operation, making it harder for smaller, less \ndiversified firms to compete. They can also drive local non-diversified \nfirms out of business by excess production or processing of a \ncommodity, driving price down below the cost of production.\n  These cross-subsidies are increasingly taking place on a global \nscale. A firm like Cargill, which has operations in 70 countries, can \nabsorb losses in one country so long as it can cross-subsidize with \nrevenues from another country. Because they control supplies in more \nthan one country, these multinationals can also drive prices down to \nthe detriment of farmers in both countries.\n\n  Even if concentration did produce economic efficiencies, such \nefficiencies wouldn't concern us if they weren't passed on to the \nconsumer. But we've already seen that the agribusinesses' price \nwindfalls are not being passed on to the consumer. That's because they \nare able to exploit their economic power to increase profit share at \nthe expense of farmers.\n  So it's simply not true that there are no viable alternatives to \ncontinued economic concentration. Concentration is not dictated by free \nmarkets, by technological progress, or by economic efficiency. It's \noccurring because of government-created monopolies, biased choices in \ntechnology policy, special relationships, and cross-subsidies. And it's \noccurring because our choices in farm and trade and antitrust policies. \nIn the end, concentration is driven by policy choices that could be \nmade differently.\n  Consider all the policy choices that have brought American \nagriculture to where it is today. When we paved the way for family \nfarming with the Homestead Act and the defeat of slavery, that was a \npolicy choice. When we enacted parity legislation in the 1940s, leading \nto an increase in the number of farmers, expansion of soil and water \nconservation practices, and a decline in farm debt, that also was a \npolicy choice.\n  When we cut loan rates in the 1950s and 1960s to lower farm prices, \nthat was a policy choice. When we interlinked domestic commodity \nmarkets with lower world prices through trade agreements, that was a \npolicy choice. When we eliminated the safety net for farmers with the \nFreedom to Farm Act, that was a policy choice.\n  When we invest public resources in technology that tilts the scales \nagainst family farmers, that is a policy choice. When we fail to fund \nenough economists at GIPSA or enough antitrust staff at Justice and the \nFTC, that is a policy choice. And when we encourage global \nconcentration through our trade policies while allowing corporate \nagribusiness to destroy competitive markets here at home, that too is a \npolicy choice.\n  Now the policy choices before us are clear. We can take legislative \naction that will help preserve family-based agriculture. Or we can \ncontinue on our present course, which is leading unmistakably in the \ndirection of contract farming, rural depopulation, and global \noligopoly.\n  In August, the Omaha World Herald carried a story about one \neconomist's projections for the future of American agriculture. \n``Farmers who stubbornly insist on being their own boss will end up in \nthe economic scrap heap,'' he said. This economist described a trend \ntoward ``polarization of farms by size, with the number of large farms \ngrowing at a rapid pace''; ``separation of land ownership from land \nproduction, with more and more people owning land as an investment and \nleasing property for production''; and contract farming, which will \nchange the role of farmers from that of an independent producer to \nskilled tradesman.''\n  Can any Senator honestly tell me this is the vision he or she \nsupports? Do we really want a world of contract farming, in which farm \nlaborers are stuck with one-sided contracts and inadequate price \ninformation and struggle to get out from under mountains of debt? Do we \nreally want a world in which our rural areas become depopulated because \nfamily farmers have to leave the land? Do we really want a world in \nwhich vertical integration and contract farming shift ever more \nbargaining power to agribusinesses?\n  Do we really want a world in which management decisions are made by a \nsmall group of corporate executives, removed from the land thanks to \nnew precision farming technologies? Do we really want a world in which \ntitanic food chains face little pressure to pass on price savings to \nthe consumer?\n  Do we have any say in this matter? I think we do. We don't have to \naccept this vision of the future if we don't want to. We can propose a \ndifferent one, and we can fight for it. These are all policy choices.\n  These choices are made more difficult by the immense power of \ncorporate agribusiness--not only economic power, but political power as \nwell. As Lee Swenson of the NFU recently testified,\n\n       The remaining firms are increasing market share and \n     political power to the point of controlling the governments \n     that once regulated the firms. Some of the biggest \n     corporations have gotten tax breaks or other government \n     incentives. . . . Corporate interests have also called on the \n     government to weaken environmental standards and immigrant \n     labor protections in order to allow them to reduce \n     productions costs.\n\n  The bigger these agribusinesses get, the more influence they have \nover our public policy choices. The bigger they\n\n[[Page S12464]]\n\nget, the more money they have to spend on political campaigns. The \nbigger they get, the more lobbyists they can afford to amass on Capitol \nHill. The bigger they get, the more likely they are to be named special \nU.S. trade representatives, like the CEO of Monsanto. The bigger they \nget, the more likely public officials will be to confuse their \ninterests with the public interest, if they don't already do that. And \nthe bigger they get, the more weight they will pull in the media.\n  It's a vicious circle. These agribusiness conglomerates used their \npolitical clout to shape public policies that helped them grow so big \nin the first place. Now their overwhelming size makes it easier for \nthem to dictate policies that will help get even bigger.\n  This was just as much a problem at the turn of the century as it is \nnow. American democracy suffered greatly as a result of concentration \nof economic power in the late 1800s. But the Populists and their \nsuccessors showed us that there is a different path, that there are \nalternatives, and they proceeded to lay the groundwork for the \nProgressive Era.\n  Even before the founding of the People's Party, populists and labor \nand progressives began working to rein in the concentration of economic \npower. With the help of some  forward-looking Republicans, they fought \nfor and passed the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act and the Packers and \nStockyards Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act. They also reined \nin the trusts through regulation of banks and railroads. And they \ndemanded more and better democracy through the direct election of \nsenators.\n\n  Judge Robert Bork notwithstanding, I don't believe the Sherman Act \nwas motivated by concerns over economic efficiency and consumer \nwelfare. In fact, during consideration of the Sherman Act, Congressman \nMason directly responded to the efficiency arguments raised by John D. \nRockefeller.\n\n       If the price of oil, for instance, were reduced to one cent \n     a barrel, it would not right the wrong done to the people of \n     this country by the trusts which have destroyed legitimate \n     competition and driven honest men from legitimate business \n     enterprises.\n\n  As Richard Hofstadter has written, the Sherman Act was ``a ceremonial \nconcession to an overwhelming public demand for some kind of reassuring \naction against the trusts.'' During debate on the Act, Senator John \nSherman himself railed against the ``kingly prerogative'' of men with \n``concentrated powers.'' He vowed that ``We will not long endure a king \nover production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessities of \nlife.''\n  But the antitrust laws, in the words of Supreme Court Justice William \nO. Douglas, are now ``mere husks of what they were intended to be.'' In \nthe last 20 years, the courts have been unduly influenced by the anti-\nantitrust views of Judge Bork and the Chicago School. Today \ntremendously unfair market power routinely goes unpunished, especially \nwith regard to vertical integration.\n  Courts have limited the effectiveness of the antitrust laws by \nnarrowing their focus to questions of economic efficiency and consumer \nwelfare. The focus on consumer welfare is an obstacle to antitrust \nenforcement in agriculture, even though farmers were an integral part \nof the original antitrust movement. Conventional antitrust analysis \nfocuses on the ability of dominant firms to charge higher prices to \nconsumers; price declines are generally not regarded as a problem. But \nfarmers today are drawing attention to the ability of dominant firms to \nabuse their market power to pay lower prices to producers, not \nconsumers.\n  The Justice Department's recent approval of the Cargill-Continental \nmerger raises troubling questions about the future of antitrust \nenforcement in agriculture. If DOJ can't stop the merger of Cargill and \nContinental, what merger will it ever stop? Will it ever be able to \ntake any action at all to arrest the trend towards concentration in \nagriculture?\n  The Packers and Stockyards Act is a similar story. Enacted in 1921 to \ncombat the market abuse of the top five meat packers, it has extremely \nbroad and far-reaching language. Under the Packers and Stockyard Act, \nit is unlawful for any packer to ``engage in or use any unfair, \nunjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practice or device.'' It is \nunlawful to ``make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or \nadvantage.''\n  However, some court decisions have limited its scope, and USDA is \nunwilling to test its regulatory authority in court. Meanwhile, \nconcentration in the meat-packing industry today is higher than it was \nwhen the FTC issued its original report leading to enactment of the \n1921 Act.\n  Clearly, we cannot simply rely on the current antitrust statutes and \nantitrust authorities to address the rapid consolidation of the \nagricultural sector. We must change our antitrust laws. Whether or not \nour antitrust agencies have authority that they are unwilling to \nexercise, we need to force their hand. And we must develop a new farm \npolicy. Realistically, however, we know that doing these things may \ntake some time. We must act now.\n  There is something we can do in the short term. I am offering \nlegislation with Senator Dorgan that would impose a moratorium on \nmergers and acquisitions among agribusinesses that must already submit \npre-merger filings under current law (annual net revenue or assets over \n$100 million for one party and $10 million for the other). This \nmoratorium would remain in effect for 18 months, or until Congress \nenacts legislation to address the problem of concentration in \nagriculture, whichever comes first.\n  Over the longer term, however, we need to focus on equalizing the \nbargaining power between farmers and the global agribusiness giants. A \ngrowing disparity of economic power is shifting a larger share of farm \nincome to agribusiness. We need to reverse that trend and level the \nplaying field. Unless we ensure that farmers and ranchers receive a \nfair share of the profit of the food system, little else we do to \nmaintain family-size farms is likely to succeed.\n  Of course, there's more than one way to attack the problem of unequal \nbargaining power. The antitrust statutes helped equalize bargaining \npower by increasing competition, thereby reducing the market power of \nmonopolies. The formation of agricultural cooperatives under the \nCapper-Volstead Act helped equalize bargaining power from the opposite \ndirection--by increasing the market power of farmers. Under either \napproach, farmers improve their bargaining position and are likely to \nobtain a greater share of farm income.\n  Yet there are some inherent disparities in market power that can only \nbe remedied through farm policy. Because there are so many farmers, no \nsingle farmer can influence price on his or her own. On their own, \nfarmers cannot limit production waiting for prices to rise or until \nthey can shift crops. Farmers are unable to reduce supply without \nassistance from the government, which is where farm policy can play a \nrole.\n  Farm policy can also remedy inherent disparities in market power by \nplacing a floor on prices. Laws guaranteeing workers the right to \nbargain collectively and a minimum wage are based on the same idea. The \nminimum wage law recognizes that there is unequal bargaining power \nbetween employers and workers, and that wage negotiation would often \nlead to wages that are too low. The bargaining power between \nagribusiness conglomerates and farmers is similarly unequal, and it is \nresulting in farmer prices that are too low. Farmers today essentially \nneed the equivalent of a minimum wage.\n  Of course, bolstering the market power of family farmers is inimical \nto the economic interests of corporate agribusiness, and it will be \nfiercely resisted. But in the past we have managed to tame \nconcentrations of economic and political power, and I refuse to believe \nwe cannot do so again. For this reason, the examples of the Populist \nmovement and the Progressive Era are enormously instructive and \nencouraging.\n  Finally, I want to mention the fiery closing speech at the People's \nParty convention in 1892, which reads like it could have been written \nyesterday. It was delivered by a remarkable Minnesotan--an implacable \nfoe of monopoly power named Ignatius Donnelly. Donnelly affirmed that \n``the interests of rural and urban labor are the same,'' and he called \nfor a return to America's egalitarian founding principles. ``We seek to \nrestore the government of the\n\n[[Page S12465]]\n\nRepublic to the hands of the `plain people' with whom it originated,'' \nhe said.\n  We should do no less. If we want to sustain a vibrant rural economy \nand a thriving democracy, we need urgent reform of our farm and \nantitrust laws. We must act now. We can start by passing an 18-month \nmoratorium on the largest agribusiness mergers.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of our time for the \nminority.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--and I do not \nintend to object--that the time consumed by the Senator be charged \nequally to all time under the order on the appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am not going to take much time. I \ncertainly hope the Senator from Minnesota did not cut his remarks short \nbecause he certainly is articulating something in which we are all very \ninterested. I would do what I could to protect his rights to get a vote \nif he needed a vote, the same as I ask my rights be protected to either \nget a vote or to object to a unanimous consent request, which I have \nbeen doing with regularity in the last few days.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12465-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12465-S12467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to share with \nthe Senate something that has not been mentioned yet in this whole CTBT \ndebate.\n  First of all, let me respond to a couple of things that were said by \nthe last speaker who spoke in favor of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty. I hate to be redundant, but I cannot let these things continue \nto go by. People will actually believe them when, in fact, they are not \ntrue.\n  The statement was made by one of the Senators that the Directors of \nthe labs--the three energy labs--were in favor of this treaty. I \nlistened to this, and yet we had them before our committee which I \nchair. They were very emphatic about their feelings. I am going to read \nto make sure the record reflects this.\n  Dr. Paul Robinson, one of the Directors, said:\n\n       The Treaty bans any ``nuclear explosion,'' but \n     unfortunately, compliance with a zero-yield requirement is \n     unverifiable. The limitations of verifiability introduce the \n     possibility of inconsistent observance of the ban under the \n     threshold of detectability.\n\n  The threshold of detectability is something that is there. What that \nmeans is, no matter what equipment we use, we are unable to detect \ncertain tests that are underground under certain yields. This is a \nzero-yield test.\n  We kept hearing from the same individual yesterday that they can get \nonsite inspections. Onsite inspections are not assured. Under this \ntreaty, it is very specific. Going back to Paul Robinson, the Director \nof Sandia Lab:\n\n       The decision to approve a request for an onsite inspection \n     must be made by an affirmative vote of at least 30 of the \n     51 members of the treaty organization's Executive Council.\n\n  I know there is supposedly some informal agreement that we in the \nUnited States would be a member of that executive council. I do not see \nanything in this treaty that says we are. We are putting our fate in \nthe hands of some 30 nations, and we do not know at this point who \nthose 30 nations will be.\n  I will quote further to get my point across, although the Senator was \nwell meaning yesterday in making the comment this was endorsed by the \nDirectors of the labs. I will quote Dr. Paul Robinson again. He was \nreferring to himself and the Directors of the other two labs. I am \ntalking about all three labs:\n\n       I and others who are or have been responsible for the \n     safety and reliability of the U.S. stockpile of nuclear \n     weapons have testified to this obvious conclusion many times \n     in the past. To forego that validation through testing is, in \n     short, to live with uncertainty.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       If the United States scrupulously restricts itself to zero \n     yield while other nations may conduct experiments up to the \n     threshold of international detectability--\n\n  The one I just talked about--\n\n     we will be at an intolerable disadvantage.\n\n  We have to read that over and over because people are not getting \nthat message.\n  The second thing he said was, what is the rush? This morning, I heard \nthe President in his press conference of yesterday talk about the rush. \nHere is the President who has been saying over and over that he demands \nthis come before this Senate and be acted upon by November of this \nyear. Here it is. That is next month. We are doing exactly what he \nwanted. Yet now he wants to withdraw this treaty because he does not \nbelieve he has the votes for the ratification. I agree. He does not \nhave the votes. It would shock me if he had the votes.\n  Yet we have had a chance for a very deliberative session. We have \ntalked for hours and hours, some 22 hours of debate and committee \nactivity on this subject. We are all very familiar with it.\n  I also suggest that any Member of the Senate who stands up now and \nsays we should not be doing this and how unconscionable that we are \nconsidering something of this magnitude right now, any one of those \nSenators saying that had the opportunity, as the Senator from Illinois \nwould have had the opportunity, to object to bringing it up because it \nwas done so by unanimous consent.\n  The third thing they were talking about is how everyone is a strong \nsupporter of this treaty. For the record, one more time, we have 6 \nformer Secretaries of Defense and several former Directors of Central \nIntelligence, as well as some 13 former commanding generals, all of \nwhom are in the Record right now, and I do not need to put it in again, \nI have already put that in the Record; also, the statement by Bill \nCohen. There is no one for whom I have greater respect than my former \ncolleague on the Senate Armed Services Committee, the former Senator \nBill Cohen, now Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen.\n  But I had to remind him, during our committee meeting, that maybe now \nhis attitude is different on some of these critical things because he \nis now working for the President. But what he said in September of \n1992--and I remember when he said it when he was leading the fight to \nstop this type of a treaty; in fact, it is the same provisions--he \nsaid:\n\n       . . . [W]hat remains relevant is the fact that many of \n     these nuclear weapons which we intend to keep in our \n     stockpile for the indefinite future are dangerously unsafe. \n     Equally relevant is the fact that we can make these weapons \n     much safer if limited testing is allowed to be conducted. So, \n     when crafting our policy regarding nuclear testing, this \n     should be our principal objective: To make the weapons we \n     retain safe.\n       . . . The amendment that was adopted last week . . .\n\n  This is back in 1992, but this is the same language we are talking \nabout today--\n\n     does not meet this test . . . [because] it would not permit \n     the Department of Energy to conduct the necessary testing to \n     make our weapons safe.\n\n  Here is the same Secretary of Defense, back when he was in the \nSenate, talking about the fact that our weapons are not safe. By the \nway, we had a chart that we showed of information that came from all \nthree of the Energy labs which is in the Cloakroom right now, but we \nhave used on the floor several times, showing specifically not one of \nthe nine weapons in that arsenal meet the safety tests today. In other \nwords, we have gone 7 years now without testing, and it has now taken \nits toll. We are having a problem. So anyway, that is very significant \nto remember those words of Secretary Cohen.\n  I have been asked the question by a number of people as to why I am \nso adamant about objecting to the unanimous consent request--and I do \nnot care who makes it--to take this from the calendar and put it back \ninto the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I do so because there is something that has not even been discussed \non\n\n[[Page S12466]]\n\nthis floor yet; and that is, unless we kill it and actually reject this \ntreaty by a formal action, the provisions of this treaty are going to \nremain somewhat in effect. In other words, we are going to have to \ncomply with this treaty that has been signed--going back to a document \nof the Vienna Convention that was actually signed on May 23, 1969, but \nit did not become a part of the international law until January of \n1980.\n  Article 18--and this is in effect today--says:\n\n       Obligation not to defeat the object and purpose of a treaty \n     prior to its entry into force.\n       A State is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat \n     the object and purpose of a treaty when:\n       (a) it has signed the treaty or has exchanged instruments \n     constituting the treaty subject to ratification, acceptance \n     or approval, until it shall have made its intention clear not \n     to become a party to the treaty. . .\n\n  What that means is, we have this flawed treaty, this treaty that \nallows our adversaries to conduct underground tests. Yet while we \ncannot do it, we have to comply with this treaty, if we merely send it \nback to committee.\n  So I just want to make sure--I am going to read that again. This is \nfrom the Vienna Convention. This is something that we are a party to. \nIt says--I will take out some of the other language--\n\n       A State is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat \n     the object and purpose of a treaty when:\n       (a) it has signed the treaty or has exchanged instruments \n     constituting the treaty subject to ratification, acceptance \n     or approval, until it shall have made its intention clear not \n     to become a party to the treaty . . .\n  What that means is, we have this flawed treaty, this treaty that \nallows our adversaries to conduct underground tests; yet while we \ncannot do it, we have to comply with this treaty, if we merely send it \nback to committee.\n  So I just want to make sure--I am going to read that again. This is \nfrom the Vienna Convention. This is something that we are a party to. \nIt says--I will take out some of the other language--\n\n       A State is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat \n     the object and purpose of a treaty when:\n       (a) it has signed the treaty or has exchanged instruments \n     constituting the treaty subject to ratification, acceptance \n     or approval, until it shall have made its intention clear not \n     to become a party to the treaty . . .\n\n  How do you make your intentions clear? Under the Vienna Convention \nlanguage, not to be a party to this treaty you have to vote it down. \nYou have to bring this up for ratification and reject it formally on \nthe floor of this Senate. To do anything other than that is to leave it \nalive and to force us to comply with this flawed treaty, which is a \ngreat threat to our safety in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make a couple comments about the \nconference report on Agriculture appropriations. Before I do, I would \nlike to make a comment or two about the presentation just offered by my \nfriend from Oklahoma.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, as he always does, makes a strong \npresentation for something he believes very strongly in. I believe very \nstrongly that he is wrong. I believe very strongly in the other side of \nthe issue. Let me describe why just for a few moments.\n  The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is a question presented to \nthis country in this form: Will the United States of America assume the \nmoral leadership that it must assume, in my judgment, to help stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons around the world? There are two nuclear \nweapons superpowers--the United States and Russia. Between us, we have \nroughly 30,000 nuclear weapons. Some other countries have them, and \nmany other countries want them. There are many countries, there are \nrogue nations, and there are terrorist groups that want to have access \nto nuclear weapons.\n  The question of what kind of a future we will have in this world \ndepends, in large part, upon the direction this country takes in \nassuming its responsibility to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  We already decided 7 years ago, as a country, we will no longer test \nnuclear weapons. We made that decision unilaterally. Over 40 years ago, \nPresident Eisenhower said: We must have a Comprehensive Nuclear Test-\nBan Treaty; we must do that. About 5 or 6 years ago, we began \nnegotiating with other countries to develop such a treaty. Two years \nago, President Clinton sent to the Senate a treaty that would provide a \ncomprehensive nuclear test ban all around the world.\n  For 2 years, that treaty languished here without 1 day of hearings \nbefore the primary committee that it was sent to, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I know there is disagreement on that, but I tell you, \nSenator Biden, who is the ranking Democrat of that committee, says \nthere was not 1 day of hearings devoted to that treaty.\n  I understand some people want to kill it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the Senator, if it should not have been brought up \nfor the purpose he just articulated, why did this Senator not object to \nthe unanimous consent request to have a vote on it?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say this about the unanimous consent request. If \nyou take a look at all the arms control treaties that have been offered \nto the Senate--the ABM Treaty, the START I treaty, the START II treaty, \non down the line--and take a look at how many days of comprehensive \nhearings they had, No. 1, in the committee of jurisdiction and, No. 2, \nhow many days they were debated on the floor of the Senate, what the \nSenator will discover is this treaty, that has been treated lightly, it \nis a serious matter--treated lightly by the fact that the majority \nleader said, even without comprehensive hearings, we will bring this \ntreaty to the floor of the Senate and kill it.\n  It alone is the arms control treaty that has been treated in this \nmanner. All other treaties were dealt with seriously with long, \nthoughtful, comprehensive hearings--day, after day, after day--and then \na debate on the floor of the Senate--day after day--which involved the \nAmerican people and public opinion; and then this country made \ndecisions about those treaties.\n  I know there are some who have never supported an arms control treaty \nunder any condition. They have not.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield further?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me finish my statement.\n  They do not support arms control treaties. I respect that. I just \nthink they are dead wrong. I have on my desk--I ask consent to show it \nagain--a piece of a bomber. This is a piece of a Backfire bomber, a \nRussian bomber. Why is a Russian bomber in a circumstance where its \nwing was sawed off--not shot down, its wing sawed off? Because arms \ncontrol agreements have reduced the number of delivery systems and \nnuclear weapons.\n  This part was sawed off a Russian bomber wing as part of the \nreduction of the threat under our arms control treaties. These treaties \nwork. We know they work. That is why, without shooting down a bomber, I \nhave a piece of a Russian Backfire bomber wing, just to remind us that \narms control treaties work.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Just for a moment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think it is very significant because this subject has \ncome up during 14 hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. We have over 130 pages of testimony on this. We have \ndiscussed it for hours and hours over the last 2 days. Again, any \nSenator could have objected to this and apparently believed it was not \nnecessary.\n  But I have to ask you this question. You talked about only two \ncountries having these weapons.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I did not say that. Let me reclaim my time. I did not \ntalk about ``only two countries.''\n\n[[Page S12467]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. There was a time when that was true. During the cold war \nthat was a valid argument. It is no longer true. Virtually every \ncountry has weapons of mass destruction. Now it is a matter of which \ncountries have missiles that could deliver them, of which now we know \nof North Korea and Russia and China--and whoever else we don't know \nbecause they have been trading technology with countries like Iraq and \nIran, and other countries.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I did not say that the United States and Russia are the \nonly countries that have nuclear weapons. I said we have 30,000 between \nthe two countries. Other countries have nuclear weapons as well, and \nmany other countries aspire to have nuclear weapons.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma said something that is not the case. He \nsaid virtually every other country has weapons of mass destruction. \nThat is not the case. The nuclear club, those countries that possess \nnuclear weapons, is still rather small, but the aspiration to get a \nhold of nuclear weapons is pretty large. A lot of countries--more than \njust countries, terrorist groups--want to lay their hands on nuclear \nweapons. What happens when they do? Then we will see significant \nthreats to the rest of this world.\n  It is in our interest as a country to do everything we can possibly \ndo to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Do we want Bin Laden to have \na nuclear weapon? Do we want Qadhafi to have a nuclear weapon? Do we \nwant Saddam Hussein to acquire a nuclear weapon? I don't think so. Arms \ncontrol agreements and the opportunities to prevent the spread of \nnuclear weapons are critical.\n  How do we best do that? Many of us believe one of the best ways to do \nthat is to pass this treaty, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.\n  We are going to have this treaty back on the floor, I think, for 3 \nhours today. I will make it a point to come and I will spend the entire \n3 hours with the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield for a response.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have not yielded, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This treaty was brought to the floor for 14 hours of \ndebate. Name another arms control treaty that came to the floor with \nonly 14 hours of debate. The Senator asks: Why didn't someone object? \nThe burden is on us. Because the majority leader treated a serious \nmatter lightly, the burden is on someone else.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma knows we objected the first time the \nSenator from Mississippi proposed it. He knows an objection was raised. \nThe second time the Senator from Mississippi proposed it, he linked it \nto a time. If that is the only basis on which we had the opportunity to \nconsider this treaty, so be it. But it is not treating a serious matter \nseriously, in my judgment. Name another treaty that has come to the \nfloor of the Senate dealing with arms control, the arms control issues \nembodied in this treaty, trying to prevent the spread of nuclear \nweapons, that has had this little debate and comes to the floor, \ndespite what my colleague says, without having had 1 day of \ncomprehensive hearings devoted to this treaty in the committee to which \nit was assigned? Those are the facts.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield on that point.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to speak about the Agriculture \nappropriations bill. The only reason I made these comments is, the \nSenator from Oklahoma was, once again, making statements. He is good at \nit. He feels passionately about these things. But I think, with all due \nrespect, he is wrong on this issue.\n  This country has a responsibility to treat these issues seriously. \nThis country has a responsibility to lead in the area of preventing the \nspread of nuclear weapons. We don't lead in that regard by turning down \nor rejecting this treaty. There was a coup in Pakistan yesterday; we \nare told. We don't know the dimensions or consequences of it. Pakistan \nis a nuclear power. Pakistan and India are two countries that don't \nlike each other. They exploded nuclear weapons, literally under each \nother's chin, within the last year. Is that a serious concern to the \nrest of the world? It is.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Absolutely, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Are we going to lead and try to stop nuclear testing? Are \nwe going to lead in trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons? I \nhope so. I cast my vote to ratify this treaty, believing it is the best \nhope we have as a country to weigh in and be a leader, to say we want \nto stop the spread of nuclear weapons around the rest of the country.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Arizona has also joined us. I \ncame to speak about this Agriculture bill. I know my colleague from \nIllinois is waiting to address these issues as well.\n  Mr. KYL. I wonder if I might prevail on the courtesy of the Senator \nfor 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator asked a question which I think deserves an \nanswer: Name one other treaty that had less time or more time than \nthis. Here are the treaties: The Chemical Weapons Convention had 18 \nhours allotted for it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is that less than 14?\n  Mr. KYL. That includes amendments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How many comprehensive hearings did that treaty have?\n  Mr. KYL. If I could complete my answer to the Senator, which is that \nthis treaty, pursuant to a request by the minority, had 14 hours \nassociated with it, plus 4 hours per amendment, if there were \namendments offered. There was an amendment offered on the Democratic \nside. The Democratic side used 2 hours allotted to them for that. The \nConventional Forces in Europe Treaty had 6 hours, compared to 14 for \nthe CTBT. The START Treaty had 9\\1/2\\ hours, about 6 hours less. The \nSTART II Treaty had 6 hours, and the CFE Flank Agreement, 2 hours. So \nevery one of these treaties ended up having less time than the CTBT \nallotted for debate on the floor.\n  All of last week was consumed by hearings in the Intelligence \nCommittee, the Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate Armed \nServices Committee; I don't know how many hours total. Prior to that \ntime, the Government Operations Committee had three separate hearings. \nThat is the specific answer to the Senator's question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One thing I hate in politics is losing an argument I am \nnot having. The Senator from Arizona cites the number of hours this \ntreaty or that treaty was considered on the floor of the Senate. I will \nbring to the floor this afternoon the compendium of action by the \nSenate on the range of arms control treaties, START I, START II, ABM, \nso on. What I will show is that in the committee of jurisdiction, there \nwere days and days and days of comprehensive hearings and the length of \ntime those treaties were considered, in terms of number of days on the \nfloor of the Senate, were extensive. It allows the American people to \nbe involved in this discussion and this debate. This approach, which \ntreats a very serious issue, in my judgment, too lightly, says, let us \nnot hold comprehensive hearings. I remind the Senator that the request \nfrom the minority was of the majority leader to hold comprehensive \nhearings, allow consideration, and allow a vote on this treaty. That is \nnot the course the majority leader chose.\n  Having said all that, I am happy to come back this afternoon. I feel \npassionately about this issue. We should talk about all the things the \nSenator from Oklahoma is raising. We haven't tested for 7 years, and we \nthink this country is weaker because of it. I don't know how some \npeople can sleep at night. North Korea is going to attack the Aleutian \nIslands with some missile. Our nuclear stockpile is unsafe, one Senator \nsaid the other day. The bombs in storage are unsafe. We have been \nstoring nuclear weapons for over 40 years in this country. All of a \nsudden they are unsafe, on the eve of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-\nBan Treaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12467-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12467-S12468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \nRELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT--Continued\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Having said all that, let me turn to the question of the \nAgriculture Appropriations bill. Let me ask how much time I have \nremaining? I had sought 20 minutes.\n\n[[Page S12468]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 136 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will take 5 minutes. My friend, the Senator from \nIllinois, is waiting and the Senator from Mississippi, who manages the \nbill, has the patience of Job. I will not spend a lot of additional \ntime.\n  I want to run through a couple charts, if I might. I want people to \nthink through if this were their income, what their situation would be. \nEvery one of you have a job; you have an income. If you have a \nbusiness, you have some profit or an expected profit. Ask yourself what \nyour situation would be personally if your job was to raise corn. This \nis what has happened to the price of corn; it has dropped dramatically. \nThink of what that would mean if that happened to your income.\n  What about if you are a producer out there, a family farmer raising \nsome children and trying to operate a farm? You are raising wheat. Here \nis what has happened to your income. It has plummeted?\n  What if you are raising some kids and trying to operate a family farm \nand doing well and you are producing soybeans? This is what happened to \nyour income. Again, a drastic reduction.\n  Do you know of any other business in which prices have fallen as much \nas for wheat, corn, soybeans?\n  Likewise, what if somebody said that the product you raise, a bushel \nof wheat, for example, as a percentage of the cereal grain dollar, was \ngoing to shrink by over half?\n  Take another example. Say you were raising hogs and not too long ago \nyou sold a 200-pound hog and got $20 for it. Then that hog was \nslaughtered and the meat from that hog went to the grocery store and \nwas sold for $350. There is something wrong with that picture.\n  Is there something wrong with the stream of income that goes to the \nperson who actually raised that hog versus the amount of income that \ngoes to the middle people who process it? Absolutely.\n  We could go through chart after chart, those of us who represent farm \nStates. All of us know what the story is. The story is, our family \nfarmers are in crisis. We have a farm bill that has an inadequate \nsafety net. We have the collapse of grain prices in this country in an \nalmost unprecedented way. We have the weakening Asian economy, which \nmeans fewer exports. We have concentration and monopolies in every \ndirection, which cuts the farmer's share of the food dollar.\n  When Continental and Cargill are allowed to get married, as they just \ndid, two big companies gathering together under one umbrella, it \ndemonstrates that our antitrust laws don't work. Every direction the \nfarmer looks, he finds a monopoly. Want to raise some grain and ship it \non a railroad? You are held up for prices that are outrageous in order \nto haul it by the railroad. The same is true with virtually every other \ncommodity such as selling wheat into a grain trade that is highly \nconcentrated. In every set of circumstances, farmers have been \ninjured. And the result of all of these adverse circumstances coming \ntogether, especially the twin calamities of the collapse of commodity \nprices and weather-related crop disasters, means we have a full-scale \nemergency on our family farms.\n\n  This piece of legislation is not particularly good. I am going to \nvote for it, but with no great enthusiasm. I was one of the conferees. \nThe conference met for a brief period of time. Senator Durbin was a \nconferee, as well, and he will recall we met for a period of time, and \none of the things we pushed for was to stop using food as a weapon. No \nmore food embargoes. Guess what. That was our strong Senate position, \nbut it is not in this report.\n  This report doesn't end the embargoes on food or end using food as a \nweapon. This report doesn't do that because the conference dumped it. \nWe didn't do it because we were part of the conference, but the \nconference didn't meet. It adjourned in a pique and never got back \ntogether. We are told the Senate majority leader and the Speaker of the \nHouse cobbled together this bill, with some technical help. When we saw \nit again, it said we want to continue to use food as a weapon and keep \nembargoes on various countries around the world.\n  I am not happy with this bill. Let's provide income support to \nfarmers, it says, after we pushed for that. But it says do it with \nsomething called AMTA payments. We are going to have people getting \nemergency payments who didn't lose any money because of collapsed \nprices; they weren't even farming. In fact, the payment limits have \ngone up. So it is conceivable that some landowners are going to get \n$460,000 without putting a hand to the plow. That is the new payment \nlimit. Can you imagine telling a taxpayer in a city someplace that we \nwant to help farmers in trouble, and they ask which farmers? Well, \nsomebody is going to get a $460,000 payment whether or not they are \nactually farming. That is not helping America's family farmers. So \nthere is a lot wrong with the payments provided by this bill.\n  Similarly, the disaster aid is only $1.2 billion and contains no \nspecific line item for flooded lands. We know that amount shortchanges \nall the known needs. We know that is not going to cover the drought of \nthe Northeast, the flooding from Hurricane Floyd and the prevented \nplanting in the Upper Midwest--all of the disasters that need to be \naddressed across this country. But the combination of things in this \nlegislation has put us in a position of asking if we are going to \nprovide some help or no help.\n  We are in a situation where we have to say yes, we will vote for this \npackage, but without great enthusiasm. This was done the wrong way. \nMost of us know that. We should have helped farmers who lost income \nbecause of collapsed prices and weather disasters, the people who \nreally produce a crop. We ought not to have a $460,000 upper payment \nlimit, and we ought not to have dropped the provision that says we are \ngoing to end embargoes on food and medicine forever. It was wrong to \ndrop that. We know that.\n  I will have to vote for this conference report, without enthusiasm, \nbecause there is an emergency and a crisis, and some farmers will not \nbe around if we don't extend a helping hand now. Never again should we \ndo it this way. This is the wrong way to do it. It is not the right way \nto respond to the emergency that exists in farm country.\n  My friend, the Senator from Illinois, wants to speak. I thank him for \nhis patience. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12468-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12468-S12469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are several issues that have been \ndebated on the floor this morning, and it is typical of the Senate, \nwhich considers myriad issues, to consider some that are quite \ncontrasting. To move from nuclear proliferation to help for soybean \ngrowers is about as much a contrast as you could ask for. But it \nreflects the workload that we face in the Senate, and it reflects the \ndiversity of issues with which we have to deal.\n  I will speak very briefly to the issue of the nuclear \nnonproliferation treaty. This nuclear test ban treaty, which may be \nconsidered for a vote this afternoon, could be one of the most \nsignificant votes ever cast by many Members of the Senate. It appears \nthe vote will be overwhelmingly in favor of the treaty on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, with a handful of Republican Senators \njoining us--not enough to enact this treaty into law and to ratify it \nso that it becomes virtually a law governing the United States. If that \noccurs, if we defeat this treaty this afternoon--as it appears we are \nheaded to do--it could be one of the single most irresponsible acts \never by the Senate.\n  Let me give specifics. It was only a few hours ago, in Pakistan, that \na military coup took place and replaced the administration of Mr. \nSharif. Mr. Sharif had been elected. He was a man with whom we had \ndealt. He was a person who at least came out of the democratic process. \nBut he was toppled. We have not had that experience in the United \nStates, and I pray we never will. But the military leaders decided they \nhad had enough of Mr. Sharif. They weren't going to wait for an \nelection. They decided to take over. It appears from the press reports \nthat the source of their anger was the fact that Mr. Sharif had not \naggressively pursued the war against India, nor had he escalated the \nnuclear testing that took place just a few months ago.\n\n[[Page S12469]]\n\n  You may remember, on the Fourth of July, the President of the United \nStates of America stayed in the White House for a special meeting--a \nrare meeting on a very important national holiday with Mr. Sharif of \nPakistan, where he laid down the rule to him that we didn't want to see \nthe Pakistani army engaged in the militia tactics against the Indians \nin an escalated fight over their territory in Kashmir. He produced, I \nam told, satellite imagery that verified that the Pakistanis were \ninvolved, and he told Mr. Sharif to stop right then and there. If this \nescalated, two nascent nuclear powers could see this develop into a \nconflagration that could consume greater parts of Asia. The President \nwas persuasive. Sharif went home and the tension seemed to decline--\nuntil yesterday when the military took over.\n  Why does that have any significance with our vote on a nuclear test \nban treaty? How on God's Earth can the United States of America argue \nto India and Pakistan to stop this madness of testing nuclear weapons \nand escalating the struggle when we reject a treaty that would end \nnuclear testing once and for all? It is really talking out of both \nsides of your mouth.\n  This nuclear test ban treaty had been supported originally by \nPresidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, Democratic and Republican \nPresidents, over the years. It was President George Bush who \nunilaterally said we will stop nuclear testing in the United States. He \ndid not believe that it compromised our national defense, and he \ncertainly was a Republican.\n\n  If you listen to the arguments of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, you would think this is just a cut and dried partisan issue, \nwith Republicans on one side and Democrats on the other. The polling \ntells us that 82 percent of the American people want us to pass this \ntest ban treaty. They understand full well that if more and more \nnations around the world acquire nuclear weapons, it doesn't make the \nUnited States any safer; it makes the world more dangerous. Leaders in \nsome of these countries, who should not be entrusted with a cap gun, \nwill end up with a nuclear weapon, and we will have to worry whether \nthey have the delivery capability.\n  Why is a nuclear test an important part of it? You can't take this \nnuclear concept from a tiny little model on a bench and move it up to a \nbomb that can destroy millions of people without testing it. If you \nstop the testing, you stop the progress of these countries. Some say \nthere will be rogue nations that will ignore that, that they don't care \nif you sign a treaty in the United States; they are going to go ahead \nand build their weapons.\n  I don't think any of us would suggest that we can guarantee a \nnuclear-free world or a nuclear-controlled world by a treaty. But ask \nyourself a basic question: Are we a safer world if we have a nuclear \ntest ban treaty that puts sensing devices in 350 different locations so \nwe can detect these tests that occur? Are we a safer world if we have a \nregime in place where one nation can challenge another and say, ``I \nthink you have just engaged in the development of a nuclear weapon you \nare about to test, and under the terms of the treaty I have a right to \nsend in an international inspection team to answer the question once \nand for all.''\n  Why, of course, we are a safer world if those two things occur. They \nwill not occur if the Republicans beat down this treaty today, as they \nhave promised they will. An old friend of mine--now passed away--from \nthe city of Chicago, said, ``When it comes to politics, there is always \na good reason and a real reason.''\n  The so-called good reason for opposing the treaty has to do with this \nbelief that it doesn't cover every nation and every possible test.\n  The real reason, frankly, that a lot of them are nervous about going \nagainst this treaty is the fear that in a week or a month or a few \nmonths we will have another member of the nuclear club; in a week or a \nmonth or a few months we will have more testing between India and \nPakistan; in a few weeks we may see what is happening in Pakistan \ndisintegrating further and then having to worry about whether there \nwill be nuclear weapons used in the process of their confrontation with \nIndia.\n  Those who vote to defeat the treaty will wear that collar, and they \nwill know full well that they missed the signal opportunity for the \nUnited States to have the moral leadership to say our policy of no \nnuclear testing should be the world policy; it makes us safer. It makes \nthe world safer.\n  Sadly, we have spent virtually no time in having committee hearings \nnecessary for a treaty of this complexity, and a very limited time for \nfloor debate. It is a rush to judgment. I am afraid the judgment has \nalready been made. But ultimately the judgment will be made in November \nof the year 2000 when the American voters have their voice in this \nprocess. Our debates on the floor will be long forgotten. But the \nvoters will have the final voice as to which was the moral, responsible \ncourse of action to enact a treaty supported by Presidents Eisenhower \nand Kennedy, and the Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a treaty \nthat really gives us an opportunity for a safer world, or to turn our \nbacks on it.\n  I sincerely hope that enough Republicans on that side of the aisle \nwill muster the political courage to join us. The right thing to do is \nto pass this treaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12469-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12469-S12474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \nRELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT--Continued\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to address the second issue before \nus, and one which is of grave concern in my home State of Illinois. It \nis the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  It has been my high honor to serve on the agriculture appropriations \nsubcommittee in both the House and the Senate. I have been party to \nsome 13 different conferences. That is where the House and Senate come \ntogether and try to work out their differences.\n  I want to say of my chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Cochran, \nthat I respect him very much. When I served in the House and he was a \nconferee, I believe that we always had a constructive dialog. There are \nimportant issues involving American agriculture. I was honored to be \nappointed to the same committee in the Senate, and I have respected him \nagain for the contribution he has made as chairman of the committee.\n  But what happened to Senator Cochran in this conference shouldn't \nhappen to anyone in the Senate. He was moving along at a good pace, a \nconstructive pace, to resolve differences between the House and the \nSenate. Unfortunately, the House leadership turned out the lights, \nended the conference committee, and said we will meet no more. What was \nusually a bipartisan and open and fair process disintegrated before our \neyes. That is no reflection on the Senator from Mississippi. I have no \nidea what led to that. It occurred. It was clear that the problem was \non the House side. We were making progress. We were making bipartisan \ndecisions. The process broke down.\n  But with that said, I will vote for this bill, and reluctantly. I \nbelieve it will provide some relief for struggling farmers in our \nfragile farm economy.\n\n  The Illinois Department of Agriculture estimates that $450 million \nfrom the $8.7 billion agricultural relief package will directly benefit \nIllinois producers through receipt of 100 percent of the 1999 AMTA \npayments. I agree with the Senator from North Dakota. Using an AMTA \npayment is fraught with danger. I think it is an open invitation for \nevery one of these investigative television shows to have fun at the \nexpense of this bill and this decision process. When they find people \nwho haven't seen a tractor in decades but have ownership of a farm \nreceiving payments upward of $.5 million, they are going to say: I \nthought you were trying to help struggling farmers, not somebody with a \ntrust account who has never been near a farm.\n  That may occur because we have chosen these AMTA payments. We should \nhave done this differently. I think we are going to rue the day these \npayments are made and the investigations\n\n[[Page S12470]]\n\ntake place. But these AMTA payments will be in addition to the more \nthan $450 million already received by Illinois farmers this year to \nhelp them through this crisis.\n  I voted for the Freedom to Farm Act. I have said repeatedly that I \ndid not believe when I voted for that farm bill that I was voting for \nthe Ten Commandants. I believed that we were dealing with an \nunpredictable process. Farming is unpredictable. Farm policy has to be \nflexible. We don't know what happens to weather or prices. We have to \nbe able to respond.\n  You have to say in all candor as we complete this fiscal year and \nspend more in Federal farm payments than ever in our history that the \nFreedom to Farm Act, as we know, has failed. It is time for us, on a \nbipartisan basis, to revisit it, otherwise we will see year after weary \nand expensive year these emergency payments.\n  Look at the Illinois farm economy. My State is a lucky one. We \nusually aren't the first to feel the pain. God blessed us with great \nsoil and talented farmers and a good climate. But we are in trouble.\n  Farm income in Illinois dropped 78 percent last year to just over \n$11,000 a year. That is barely a minimum wage that farmers will \nreceive. That is the lowest net income on farms in two decades.\n  Incidentally, if you are going to gauge it by a minimum wage, as the \nPresiding Officer can tell you, farmers don't work 40-hour workweeks. \nWhen they are out in the fields late at night and early in the morning, \nthey put in the hours that are necessary. Yet they end up receiving the \nminimum wage in my State of Illinois. That is down from $51,000 in \n1997. That was the net farm income per family in that year. Lower \ncommodity prices and record low hog prices in particular are primarily \nto blame for this net farm income free fall in my home State.\n  The Illinois Farm Development Authority recently noted that the \nfinancial stress faced by Illinois farmers today is higher than it has \nbeen for 10 years. Activity in the authority's Debt Restructuring \nGuarantee Program is four or five times higher than last year. They \nhave approved 7 to 10 loans per month in 1998. In 1999, the authority \nhas been approving 30 to 40 debt restructuring loans per month--a 300-\npercent increase. This is a record level unmatched since the 1986-1987 \nfarm crisis.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has predicted that prices for \ncorn, soybeans, and wheat will remain well below normal, and that farm \nincome may drop again next near. Nationally, farm income has declined \n16 percent since 1996.\n\n  On Saturday night in Springfield, IL, I went to a wedding reception \nand sat next to a friend of mine. I said: What is a bushel of corn \ngoing for now? He said $1.51. If you follow this, as they do every day \nin farm country, that is a disaster--$1.51 a bushel.\n  I said: How is your yield this year?\n  He said: It is up a little, but I can't make up for that decline in \nprice.\n  That is what is coming together. That is the disaster in Illinois and \nin many places around the Nation.\n  The USDA is facing the largest farm assistance expenditure in its \nhistory. The Department of Agriculture processed 2,181 loan deficiency \npayments in 1997, about 2.1 million in 1998--1,000 times more--and they \nwill work through a projected 3 million this year. Unfortunately, it \nappears that this crisis is going to drag on in the foreseeable future \nfurther draining USDA's resources and reserves.\n  I am going to address separately the whole question of the Ashcroft-\nDodd amendment because I think it is one that deserves special \nattention. But I want to say that though I did not sign this conference \nreport because of the procedures that were followed, I hope that we \ndon't repeat this process in the future. It really undermines the \ncredibility of Congress and of the good Members such as the Senator \nfrom Mississippi and others who really do their best to produce a good \nbill when they turn out the lights and send us home, and then circulate \na conference report that has never been seen until they put it before \nyou for signature.\n  Once the Senate acts on the conference report, sends it to the \nPresident, our role in helping improve conditions in rural America does \nnot end. We should explore other ways to help our farmers.\n  Let me say a word about the Ashcroft-Dodd amendment.\n  You may recall during the Carter administration when the Soviets \ninvaded Afghanistan. President Carter announced an embargo on the \nSoviet Union--an embargo that became one of the single most unpopular \nthings that he did. President Carter and the Democratic Party wore the \ncollar for a decade or more that we were the party of food embargoes, \nof agricultural embargoes. Our opponents and critics beat it like a tin \ndrum to remind us that it was our party that did that.\n  I think it should be a matter of record that a strong bipartisan \nsuggestion from Republican Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, and \nSenator Chris Dodd, a Democrat of Connecticut, that we stop food \nembargoes once and for all passed the Senate with 70 votes and then was \ndefeated in that very same conference committee to which I referred. \nThe bill we now have before us continues food embargoes. The sticking \npoint apparently was that of the countries exempted from embargoes on \nfood and medicine, specifically Cuba was to be excluded.\n  There are some Americans, many Cuban-Americans, who hate Castro with \na passion for what he did to their country, their family, and their \nbusiness, and believe we should punish him. He has been in power for \nover 40 years, and we imposed embargoes on his nation for food and \nmedicine.\n  I have said on the floor and I will repeat again, in the 40 years I \nhave seen photographs of Mr. Castro since we have embargoed exports of \nfood to Cuba, I have never seen a photo of Mr. Castro where he appeared \nmalnourished or hungry. The bottom line is, somehow he is pretty well \nfed. I bet he has access to good medicine. The people who are suffering \nare the poor people in Cuba and a lot of other countries. The people \nare suffering because we don't have the trade for American farmers. It \nis a policy that has not worked.\n  How did we open up eastern Europe? We opened it up by exposing the \npeople who were living under communism to the real world of the West--\nfree markets and democracy. They fled Moscow and that Soviet control as \nfast as they could. We have always thought we could isolate Cuba. I \nthink exactly the opposite would end Castro's totalitarian rule--when \nthe people in Cuba get an appetite for what is only 90 miles away in \nthe United States, through trade, through expanded opportunities.\n  The Governor of the State of Illinois, George Ryan, a Republican \nGovernor, has said he will take a trade mission to Cuba. I support him. \nI think the idea of opening up that kind of trade is the best way to \nquickly bring down any control which Castro still holds in that \ncountry.\n  When that amendment to end the embargo on food and medicine in six \ncountries went to conference, the Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives stopped it in its tracks. After we had voted on a \nbipartisan basis on the Senate side to move it forward, they stopped it \nin its tracks.\n  That is a sad outcome not just for the poor people living in the \ncountries affected but for the United States to still be using food as \na weapon with these unilateral embargoes on food and medicine. Yes, in \nthe case of Cuba and many other countries, it is a policy which does \nharm a lot of innocent people. In Cuba, it is very difficult to get the \nmost basic medicines. Are we really bringing Castro down by not \nproviding the medicines that an infant needs to survive? Is that what \nthe U.S. foreign policy is all about? I hope not.\n  Senator Ashcroft is right. Senator Dodd is right. We have to revisit \nthis. I am sorry this bill does not include that provision. It is one \nthat I think is in the best interests of our foreign policy and our \nfuture.\n  I hope the President will sign this conference report quickly and \nwork with Congress to submit a supplemental request, taking into \naccount the devastating financial crisis that continues in rural \nAmerica. To delay further action on this would be a great disservice to \nthe men and women who have dedicated their lives to production \nagriculture, a sector of the economy in which I take great pride in my \nhome State of Illinois, and I am sure we all do across the United \nStates.\n\n[[Page S12471]]\n\n  I am extremely disappointed that this conference agreement removed \nthe Ashcroft amendment that would have allowed food and medicine to be \nexported to countries against which we have sanctions. This amendment \npassed the Senate overwhelmingly after language was worked out \ncarefully and on a bipartisan basis. I am especially disturbed that, \nafter the conference stalled on this issue, just a few decided to \nwithdraw this provision behind closed doors.\n  The sticking point was the idea of selling food and medicine to the \npeople of Cuba--not to Iran, Iraq, or Libya. Cuba remains a Communist \ncountry whose leaders repress their people and commit serious abuses of \nhuman and political rights. We all agree on the goal of peaceful change \ntoward democracy and a free market economy in Cuba. But continuing the \nrestrictions on sending food and medicine to Cuba is the wrong way to \naccomplish this goal.\n  The report issued 2 years ago by the American Association for World \nHealth, Denial of Food and Medicine: The Impact of the U.S. Embargo on \nHealth & Nutrition in Cuba concluded that ``the U.S. embargo of Cuba \nhas dramatically harmed the health and nutrition of large numbers of \nordinary Cubans.'' The report went on to say:\n\n       The declining availability of foodstuffs, medicines and \n     such basic medical supplies as replacement parts for 30-year-\n     old X-ray machines is taking a tragic toll. . . . The embargo \n     has closed so many windows that in some instances Cuban \n     physicians have found it impossible to obtain lifesaving \n     machines from any source, under any circumstances. Patients \n     have died.\n\n  I would like to read part of a letter I got from Bishop William D. \nPersell from the Diocese of Chicago who relates his experiences in \nvisiting villages outside of Havana. He says:\n\n       I was especially struck by the impact of the American \n     embargo on people's health. We saw huge boxes of expired pill \n     samples in a hospital. Other than those, the shelves of the \n     pharmacy were almost bare. We talked with patients waiting \n     for surgeries who could not be operated upon because the X-\n     ray machine from Germany had broken down. A woman at the \n     Cathedral was chocking from asthma for lack of an inhaler. At \n     an AIDS center, plastic gloves had been washed and hung on a \n     line to dry for re-use. The examples of people directly \n     suffering from the impact of our government's policy after \n     all these years was sad and embarrassing to see.\n\n  Many religious groups in the United States have called for the end of \nthese restrictions, which the U.S. Catholic Conference, for example, \nhas termed ``morally unacceptable.'' During Pope John Paul II's visit \nto Cuba last year, he noted that it is the poorest and most vulnerable \nthat bear the brunt of these policies.\n  Hurting everyday people is not what this country is about. Such \nsuffering attributed to our great nation is unconscionable. Even in \nIraq, where stringent international sanctions have been imposed, there \nis an international ``oil for food'' program, which aims to be sure the \nIraqi people have adequate nutrition. That program has not always been \nas successful as I had hoped, but we have not even tried similar relief \nfor the Cuban people.\n  The burdensome and complex licensing procedures that Americans have \nto go through to get food and medicine to Cuba essentially constitute a \nban on such products because of the long delays and increased costs. I \napplaud and welcome the changes the Clinton administration made \nfollowing Pope John Paul II's visit to streamline the licensing \nprocedures for getting these products to Cuba, but I'm afraid these \nchanges are not enough. Although agricultural and medical products \neventually have been licensed to go to Cuba through this lengthy and \ncumbersome process, much of it has not been sent. The licensing \nprocedure itself discourages many from even trying to use it.\n  I believe that the suffering of the Cuban people because of these \nrestrictions on food and medicine is counterproductive to our shared \ngoal of democratization in Cuba. Castro gets to blame the United \nStates, and not his own failed Communist policies, for the suffering \nand hardships of the Cuban people. The policy encourages a ``rally \n'round the flag'' mentally, where people who otherwise might oppose \nCastro's regime hunker down and support the government in such trying \neconomic circumstances portrayed as the fault of the United States.\n  There seems to be a consensus developing that food and medicine \nshould not be used as a weapon against governments with which we \ndisagree. Congress has supported lifting such sanctions against India, \nPakistan, and even Iran. The people of Cuba should be treated no \ndifferently.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe distinguished Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Mississippi who has managed this Agriculture appropriations bill \nthrough the high winds and difficult seas over the last few weeks. Some \nof that was acknowledged this morning. We started out dealing with \nagriculture, and we have now been dealing with the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty and other important things. I am grateful for his patience, \nleadership, and diligence to get to this point.\n  This is a very important conference report we take up today. I rise \nto support the Agriculture appropriations conference report.\n  As has been noted on the floor of the Senate this morning that \nAmerican agriculture is in trouble. Our American agricultural producers \nare struggling. I think it is worthy that we examine briefly what has \ncaused this difficulty.\n  Good weather over the last 3 years has led to worldwide record grain \nyields, which has created a large oversupply and significantly reduced \ngrain prices. Other important causes for these difficult times facing \nour agricultural producers are: The 2-year Asian economic crisis which \nhas spread throughout the world; the high value of the American dollar \nversus other currencies; export subsidies and unfair trade practices by \nour foreign competitors; the lack of meaningful trade and sanctions \nreform; the lack of real tax and regulatory reform; and, for the last 5 \nyears, the lack of fast-track trade authority for the President. All of \nthese and more are directly responsible for the current situation in \nAmerican agriculture.\n  I might add, they have nothing to do with our current farm policy, \nwhich is known as Freedom to Farm. What I have just registered, what I \nhave just cited--those unpredictables, those uncontrollables--would be \nhere regardless of America's farm policy. It is important to point that \nout because I have heard some suggest it is America's Freedom to Farm \npolicy that this Congress enacted and this President signed in 1996 \nthat is at the root of this disastrous agricultural situation in which \nwe find ourselves. In fact, it is not.\n  This $69.3 billion bill will assist agricultural producers by \nproviding, among other things, short-term assistance. It includes an \n$8.7 billion emergency package, and it is important we work our way \nthrough this so the American people understand what is included in this \npackage:\n  There is $5.5 billion in agricultural market transition assistance \npayments that are paid directly to our agricultural producers, to the \nfarmers and the ranchers. This equates to a 100-percent increase from \nthe producers' 1999 payment and puts the money directly in the hands of \nour producers and certainly does it much faster than supplemental loan \ndeficiency payments.\n  There is $1.2 billion for disaster relief; $475 million in direct \npayments to soybean and minor oilseed producers; $325 million in \nlivestock feeder assistance; $325 million for livestock producers; $200 \nmillion is in the form of assistance to producers due to drought or \nother natural disasters; $400 million to assist producers in purchasing \nadditional insurance for crops coming up that they will plant early \nnext year for fiscal year 2000; and mandatory price reporting to assist \nlivestock producers in their marketing decisions.\n  While the Agriculture appropriations conference report and emergency \nassistance package are important and they are very helpful in the short \nterm, we need to look at the long-term solutions: How do we fix this \nfor the long term so we don't keep coming back to Congress year after \nyear after year for more supplemental appropriations? That is what we \nmust stay focused on. We find those long-term solutions in opening up \nmore opportunities for our farmers and our ranchers to sell the \nproducts.\n  Our producers need more open markets. While we need to adjust parts \nof\n\n[[Page S12472]]\n\nFreedom to Farm and we need to do that to make it work better, the \nbasic underlying principle of Freedom to Farm should be preserved. And \nthe basic underlying principle of Freedom to Farm is plant to the \nmarket, let the market decide.\n  In order to become more efficient and to produce for a growing \nmarket, we must give the producers the flexibility to grow what they \nwant when they want: Grow for the market, not what the Government \ndictates or what the Government manipulates.\n  We need to adjust transition payments to make them more useful in \ntimes when cash flows are tight, when they are needed, not just \narbitrary: Another supplemental appropriation. Payment levels may need \nto be adjusted annually, that is the way it is, to take into account \nsuch things as the value of the U.S. dollar, export opportunities, \nnatural disasters, actual production levels, and other factors.\n  Loan deficiency payments have proven a useful tool for farmers, but \nwe need to build into that more flexibility so producers can quickly \nrespond to changes in the market.\n  The Crop Insurance Program is critical to the future of our ag \nproducers. The Crop Insurance Program needs to be expanded and reformed \nso producers can be more self-reliant during economic downturns. We \nneed to focus on private-sector solutions rather than public-sector \nsolutions.\n  The United States needs a relevant and a vital trade policy that \naddresses the challenges of the 21st century. We need WTO accession for \nChina, trade and sanctions reform, and more international food \nassistance programs. WTO negotiations also need to address unfair \nmanipulation and other trade barriers that hurt America's farmers and \nranchers. We are currently working our way through the beef hormone \nissue. The WTO has consistently come down in favor of the American \nproducer, yet we still find the Europeans throw up artificial trade \nbarriers. These are big issues, important issues. Trade must be a \nconstant. It must be elevated to a priority in the next administration. \nThe next President must put trade on the agenda, and he must lead \ntoward accomplishment of that agenda.\n  As my friend, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, noted earlier, \nI, too, am disappointed this conference report does not contain the \nAshcroft-Hagel-Dodd sanctions reform language, which passed this body, \nas noted by the distinguished Senator from Illinois, 70 to 28--70 votes \nin favor of lifting unilateral sanctions on food and medicine. I am \nconfident we can move forward on this legislation. We will come back to \nit when it soon comes, again, to the Senate floor for consideration. \nThe Ashcroft-Hagel-Dodd bill would exempt food and medicine from \nunilateral sanctions and embargoes. It is supported by the American \nFarm Bureau and the entire American agricultural community.\n  This reform also strengthens the ties among peoples and nations and \ndemonstrates the goodness and the humanitarianism of the American \npeople. It sends a very strong, clear message to our customers and our \ncompetitors around the world that our agricultural producers will be \nconsistent and reliable suppliers of quality products. The American \nagricultural producer can compete with anyone in the world. Passing \nsanctions reform legislation will open up new markets, and it will \nallow our agricultural producers to compete in markets around the \nglobe. I am hopeful we will move forward on comprehensive sanctions and \ntrade reform legislation early next year. This must be a priority. It \nshould be a priority. It is a priority, and it is a bipartisan \npriority.\n  As Senator Durbin mentioned earlier, if you look at those 70 Senators \nwho voted in favor of lifting sanctions on food and medicine, they \nrepresented the majority of both the Republican and the Democratic \nParties in this body. That is a very clear message that this is a \nbipartisan issue. We should capture the essence of that bipartisanship \nand let that lead us next year as we should, and we will, make \nconsiderable progress in trade and sanctions reform.\n\n  Regulations continue to add to the cost of production to farmers and \nranchers. Regulatory reform is critical. We need to look at all the \nregulations currently on the books and make sure they are based on \nsound science and, lo and behold, common sense.\n  We need to look at tax reform. In 1996 when the Congress passed and \nthe President signed Freedom to Farm, two promises were made by \nCongress to our agricultural producers: We would comprehensively deal \nwith the important dynamics of tax reform and regulatory reform. We \nhave failed to do so. We have failed to address comprehensive tax \nreform and regulatory reform, aside from what we have discussed, not \ndealing with sanctions and trade reform either. We need to look at tax \nreform. For example, farm and ranch risk management accounts, FARRM \naccounts, reduction in capital gains rates, elimination of estate \ntaxes, income averaging, and other constructive actions are all \nmeasures that take us, move us, get us to where we want to be.\n  This conference report includes an important new provision we have \nnot seen in past Agriculture appropriations bills, the mandatory price \nreporting provision. This is important for livestock producers. It \nallows for market transparency, it levels the playing field, and \nensures fairness. We also need to look hard at other issues like \nindustry concentration and meat labeling to ensure that markets remain \nfree, fair, and competitive.\n  While we deal with short-term crises, we also need to work \nconsistently, diligently on the long-term improvements focused on \ntrade, and sanctions, and taxes, and regulatory reform, and \nagricultural policy.\n  This is important legislation we debate today and will vote on this \nafternoon. It provides much needed assistance at a very critical time \nin the agricultural community. I hope we will pass this conference \nreport today and the President will sign it, so we can get our farmers \nand ranchers the assistance they need. Then this body can move on to do \nthe important business of our Nation and the important business of our \nagricultural community, connected to the total of who we are, as a \nnation and as a global leader, and that is paying attention to the \nissues of trade and foreign policy, sanctions reform, and all that is \nconnected to the future for our country and the world as we enter this \nnext millennium.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I compliment and thank my good friend from \nNebraska for his statement on this Agriculture conference report.\n  Nebraska is an agricultural State. As my colleague from Montana, the \nPresiding Officer, knows, Montana is also an agricultural State. I see \non the floor the chairman, my good friend from Mississippi. Mississippi \nis also an agricultural State. Every State is an agricultural State--\nsome more than others, of course.\n  But I must say about the statement the Senator made--in most respects \nI agree with him--it was a good one.\n  Essentially it comes down to this. A lot of farmers and ranchers are \nsuffering very dire economic consequences because of low prices in the \nmain but also because of bad weather, because of disaster, droughts, or \nin many cases floods. The hurricane, for example, that came up the east \ncoast not too long ago has devastated a lot of eastern American \nfarmers. Those States are not part of the farm program but, \nnevertheless, have heavy agricultural segments in their economy and \nhave been damaged significantly. We have a conference report in front \nof us which provides about $8.7 billion in emergency aid. Most of that \ngoes to Midwest farmers, western farmers, and not enough goes to the \nnortheastern farmers. That is regrettable.\n  There is not enough in this conference report that takes care of \nEastern and Northeastern agriculture. There should be. I hope we can \nfigure out a way to provide for those in agriculture in the Eastern and \nNortheastern parts of the United States because they are not \nsufficiently provided for in this bill.\n  Nevertheless, for most of America, this bill does help. It just \nhelps. It does not do much more, but it helps relieve a lot of the pain \nthat farmers--when I say farmers, I mean grain producers and livestock \nproducers--are facing.\n  It is an old story. It has not changed. Agriculture is in a special \nsituation; namely, it suffers the vagaries of weather; it suffers the \nvagaries of the market price. Most businesses today do\n\n[[Page S12473]]\n\nnot have that to worry about. Most businesses today can control the \nprices they pay for their products. To some degree, they can control \nthe prices for which they sell their products. There is a lot more \nstability in most other industries compared to agriculture.\n  Because of the instability in agriculture, again because farmers and \nranchers have virtually no control over the price they get for their \nproducts and because the costs they pay for all of their supplies and \nimplements keep rising--and they have virtually no say about that--\nagriculture is getting squeezed more and more each year. That is the \nproblem, particularly when there is a natural disaster on top of it.\n  This Senate has not done a very good job in addressing this problem. \nThere are a lot of fancy speeches about we have to do this and we have \nto do that. I have made some of them. All Senators in this Chamber at \nthe present time have made some of them. I am not blaming us all, but I \nam giving us all a little bit of a reminder that we have not followed \nup our speeches enough with action. It is hard. It is very hard to know \nwhat the solutions should be, but we still have not found the \nsolutions. We are elected to find the solutions. That is why we run for \nthese jobs, and that is theoretically why people elect us. They think \nwe are going to do something about some of the problems our people \nface.\n\n  Why haven't we done more? I submit in large part because this place \nis so partisan. It has become very partisan in the last several years. \nI am not going to stand here and blame one side or the other. I am \ngoing to say it is a fact. Because it is so partisan, there is very \nlittle trust, and because there is very little trust not much gets \naccomplished. There is not much trust between the majority party and \nthe White House. When that happens, not much gets accomplished.\n  Our Founding Fathers set up a form of government of divided powers. \nWe are not a parliamentary form of government. We are a divided \ngovernment. We have the executive branch and the legislative branch, \nthe two Houses of Congress, and people have to get along if we are to \nget something accomplished; people have to work together if we are \ngoing to get something accomplished.\n  Too often, people in the House and the Senate, and probably the \nexecutive branch as well, run to the newspapers, they run to the press \nback home and they make all these high-sounding statements to make \nthemselves look good and the other side to look bad. They are trying to \nclaim credit for doing the good things and basically saying the other \nguys are doing the bad things.\n  That is where we are. There is not a person listening to my remarks \nwho does not disagree with that. That is exactly where we are.\n  The question is, How do we get out of this? How do we start to regain \nsome lost trust? How do we begin to regain, in some sense--some are \ngoing to dispute a little of this--those times in the older days when \nthere was a little more cooperation? How are we going to do that?\n  Basically, it takes leadership. It takes leadership by Senators; it \ntakes leadership by the leadership. It means standing above matters a \nlittle bit, standing back and getting a perspective, remembering why we \nare here, remembering what really counts. And what really counts is \nserving our people without a lot of fanfare rather than trying to make \na lot of big fancy statements.\n  I am reminded of a former Senator from Montana, Mike Mansfield. Mike \nMansfield, who was majority leader for 17 years --he was leader longer \nthan any other Senator has ever been leader in this body--was the kind \nof person--and that is probably why he was leader for so long--who \nbasically worked to get things done but did not crow about it and did \nnot try to take a lot of credit for it. He was a guy who wanted to get \nthings done to serve the people and to serve the right way, not play \npolitics, not play partisan politics. In fact, there is a new book \ncoming out about Mike Mansfield. If you page through it, you can get a \nsense of what he was about, and we can take a lesson from it.\n  I am going to list a couple of things I know we have to do in the \nhope that--knowing that most agree we have to do these things--we \nsomehow get together and start doing something about them.\n  One is to get this conference report adopted. It is going to help. It \nis not going to solve all the problems, but it is going to help. As I \nmentioned, it does not do enough for the Northeastern United States or \nEastern United States. I very much hope we can find the time and way to \ndo that.\n  In addition, we do need to address the longer term; that is, some \nkind of a safety net. There has been a lot of debate--most of it has \nbeen ideological--over Freedom to Farm. It is basically an ideological \ndebate. Most farmers and ranchers do not give two hoots about ideology. \nMost farmers and ranchers just want some basic program, structure, or \nsomething that addresses the bottom so there is some kind of a safety \nnet.\n  We are not talking about a handout. Nobody is talking about a \nhandout. We are not talking about some solution where farmers are given \nan absolute guarantee they are going to make money or absolute \nguarantee they are going to make a profit. But we know because of \nweather conditions--sometimes it rains too much, sometimes not enough, \nsometimes there are floods, sometimes droughts, sometimes the market \nfalls to the bottom--we need a floor to basically prevent people from \ngoing out of business--not to make a profit but prevent them from going \nout of business because we know how important agriculture is to our \ncountry.\n  Let's get over the ideology of Freedom to Farm, the ``freedom to \nfail.'' Those are nice sounding words. All of us have heard them \nhundreds of times. I say let's forget the words and figure out a way to \ndesign a safety net. It is not going to happen this year because there \nis not enough time. I ask us all, when we are home during the recess, \nto be thinking about this and thinking about a way to get a square peg \nin a square hole or a round peg in a round hole and find a solution. I \nguarantee, the best politics is really the best policy; that is, if we \nenact something that makes sense, then all the Republicans and all the \nDemocrats can say: Yes, we did something good. And the people at home \nare going to be very happy for that. They care much more about that \nthan who is blaming whom for not getting the job done.\n  I do not know why I have to say that. It is so obvious. I guess I say \nit because it is still not done.\n  We, obviously, have to address crop insurance. We want a Crop \nInsurance Program essentially so farmers and ranchers can make their \nown decisions and know how much they should be insured. We want a \nprogram that works and covers a lot more than the current program does.\n  As you well know, Mr. President, because you and I have spent a lot \nof time on these issues, we have to have a much better international \ntrade regime. American farmers and ranchers are being taken to the \ncleaners. They are being taken to the cleaners compared with farmers \nand ranchers worldwide.\n  One example is this beef hormone matter. The Europeans for 12 years \nhave said they are not going to take a single ounce of American beef. \nWhy? Because they say our feed lots with growth hormones cause disease \nand people who eat American beef--Americans eat it all the time and \nother people do, too--has an adverse health effect on European \nconsumers. It is a totally bogus issue, totally. Europeans know it; we \nknow it. But for 12 years, they still have not taken any beef.\n  What do we do? We bring an action before the World Trade \nOrganization. What happens? The World Trade Organization agrees. They \nsent it to an international scientific panel which concluded the \nAmericans are right and the Europeans are wrong. They sent it to a \nsecond scientific panel. It came to the same conclusion. All the \nscientific panels came to the same conclusion. Europe still says no.\n\n  The WTO says that we have a right, as Americans, to impose tariffs on \nEuropean products, on the value of the beef that is not going into \nEurope, so we do. Europeans say: Fine, we will just pay; we still won't \nimport any beef. That is one of many examples where we are getting \nstiffed because there is not a way, there is not leverage, there is not \na regime for us to stand up for what is right for American farmers.\n\n[[Page S12474]]\n\n  And take the state trading enterprises, the Canadian Wheat Board, the \nAustralian Wheat Board. We still have not solved that problem.\n  We will face a huge problem, too, in the coming years with respect to \nEurope. Europeans are getting on their high horse about genetically \nmodified organisms. It is going to be a huge problem with Europe. To \nmake matters even worse, Europe is starting to feel its oats. I think \nit is kind of upset with the United States because they see the United \nStates as this big country. I think the war in Yugoslavia has \nexacerbated things a little bit because the European defense \nestablishment did not provide the sophisticated materiel that was \nneeded there. So now they want to build up their defense establishment. \nIt is wrapped up in an awful lot of issues.\n  And it is OK for Americans to criticize the Europeans for their \nfailure to be straight and have a level agricultural playing field. I \nmight add, for example, their export subsidies are out of this world. \nEuropean export subsidies are about 60 times American export subsidies \nfor agriculture--60 times. Our EEP is about $300 million, $200 \nmillion--I do not think it is ever used--whereas their export subsidies \nare gargantuan.\n  Do you think Europeans, out of the goodness of their heart, are going \nto lower their export subsidies? No way. No way. We know that no \ncountry altruistically, out of the goodness of its heart, is going to \nlower their trade barriers. The only way to lower trade barriers is \nwhen there is a little leverage. So we have to find leverage in the \nusual way.\n  What I am saying is we have a huge challenge ahead of us; that is, to \ntry to figure out--hopefully, in a noncombative way --how to deal with \nEurope. There are many issues with Europe, and they are just getting \nmore and more complicated--whether it is Airbus or whether it is air \npollution rules. They will not take our planes now because they say our \nairplanes pollute Europe. They are just huge issues. Basically, they \nare economic issues. And the economic issues are also very heavily \nagricultural.\n  We have to figure out a way. It takes leadership from the President. \nIt takes some cool-mindedness in the House and the Senate, on both \nsides of the aisle, to try to figure out some way to crack this nut. It \nis going to be a very difficult nut to crack, but it has to be if it is \ngoing to help our farmers because right now our farmers are being taken \nadvantage of by the Europeans--pure and simple. Nobody disputes that.\n  It is up to us to try to figure out a way to solve that one. I know \nthat the more we criticize Europe, the more it makes us feel good, but \nit probably causes Europeans to dig their heels in a little more, and I \ndo not know how much it will get the problem solved. We have to find \nleverage and some commonsense way to go about it and deal with this \nissue.\n  The leverage I suggest is the WTO ``trigger,'' as I call it, the \nexport subsidy trigger. This legislation I have introduced essentially \nprovides that if the Europeans do not reduce their agricultural \nsubsidies by 50 percent in a couple years, then the United States is \ndirected to spend EEP dollars in a like amount. If they do not \neliminate them in another year, then the United States is directed to \nspend several billion dollars in EEP directed and targeted exactly at \nEuropean producers, the European countries. So that is one bit of \nleverage.\n  I am also going to introduce legislation soon. It is agricultural \nsurge legislation, to prevent farmers from suffering so much from \nimport surges from other countries to the United States. We need action \nsuch as that and then to sit down calmly and coolly to talk with the \nEuropeans, talk with the Chinese and the Japanese and the Canadians, to \nfind a solution.\n  There are a lot of other things we need to do to help our farmers. \nMany have talked about the concentration of the beef packing industry, \nand they are right; there is way too much concentration of the beef \npacking industry, which is hurting our producers. There is labeling in \nthis bill that helps.\n  There is one big omission. Seventy Senators voted to end the \nunilateral sanctions on food and medicine. The conferees disregarded \nthe views of 70 Senators. They took that out. I do not know why. It \ndoes not make any sense why the conferees took that out of this \nconference report, particularly when 70 Senators, on a bipartisan \nbasis, said, hey, we should not have unilateral sanctions on medicine \nand food; it should not be there. I wish they had not done that. \nClearly, we have to find a way to get that passed.\n  I will stop here, Mr. President, because I see a lot of other \nSenators on the floor who wish to speak. But I strongly urge a heavy \nvote for this conference report and in a deeper sense--because \nobviously it is going to pass--calling upon us to back off from the \npartisanship. Let's start to think as men and women, as people. We are \nsupposed to be educated. We are supposed to be smart. We are supposed \nto be leaders in a certain sense. Let's do it. Let's act as grownups, \nadults, problem solvers. That is all I am asking. It is not a lot. Over \nthe recess, I hope we think a little bit about that, so when we come \nback next year, we can start to solve some problems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12474-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on one other matter, although I told the \nSenator from Mississippi I would not address this subject, I am going \nto do so very briefly. That is the other matter before the Senate \ntoday, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.\n  This is a no-brainer. It is an absolute no-brainer. It makes no \nsense, no sense whatsoever, for the Senate to disregard the views of \nthe President of the United States to bring up the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty knowing it is going to fail. It makes no sense. It is \nirresponsible. It is tragic. I cannot believe the Senate will let that \nhappen. I cannot believe it because of the obvious signal it is going \nto send around the world.\n  What is that signal? The signal is: The United States is abrogating \nits leadership. The United States is sticking its tail between its legs \nand running away. It is leaving the scene. It is not being a leader. I \ncannot believe the Senate will allow that treaty to come up knowing it \nis going to be a negative vote.\n  I do not know what planet I am on--Mars, Pluto, Jupiter--to think of \nwhat the Senate could possibly do today. It is outrageous.\n  While I am on that point, let me speak toward bipartisanship just \nbriefly. It used to be when the President of the United States had a \nmajor foreign policy request of the Congress, politics would stop at \nthe water's edge. Politics would stop because it would be such an \nimportant national issue, and the Congress--Republicans and Democrats--\nwould work together on major foreign policy issues.\n  There is plenty of opportunity for politics in the United States. \nThere is plenty of opportunity--too much. It is highly irresponsible \nfor the Senate to stick its thumb in the eye of the President of the \nUnited States when the President of the United States requests that \nthere not be a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, whatever his \nreasons might be, and say: We don't care what you think, Mr. President; \nwe're going to vote anyway because we want to knock this thing down.\n  I just cannot believe it. It is just beyond belief.\n  I very much hope that later on today and in future days, Senators \nwill think more calmly about this, exercise a little prudence, and do \nwhat Senators are elected to do; that is, be responsible and do what is \nright, not what is political.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12474-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12474-S12504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \nRELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport on the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill. I \nregret very much having to do this because I appreciate the fact that \nall across our country, farmers are in need of assistance. I recognize \nthat it is important to try to get some of these programs out to them. \nBut I am very frank to tell the Senate that I think the conference\n\n[[Page S12475]]\n\nbadly overlooked the pressing problems which the farmers in the \nNortheast and the Mid-Atlantic are facing. I can't, in good conscience, \nsupport a bill which simply fails to take into account the situation \nwith which we are confronted, a situation which is unparalleled.\n  Steven Weber, President of the Maryland Farm Bureau, was recently \nquoted as saying:\n\n       This is not just another crisis. This is the worst string \n     of dry summers and the worst run of crop years since the \n     1930s. Talk to the old-timers. They haven't seen anything \n     like it since they were young.\n       Our farmers have been absolutely devastated by the weather \n     we have experienced, not only over this past farming season \n     but in previous ones leading up to it as well. We face a very \n     pressing situation.''\n\n  In addition, I think this bill fails to address the needs of our \ndairy farmers. I will discuss that issue subsequently. First, I want to \naddress the disaster assistance.\n  Most of the disaster assistance that is available under existing \nprograms is in the form of low-interest loans for those who have been \nrejected twice by commercial lenders. What this approach fails to \nrecognize is that our farmers have been hit with a double whammy. First \nof all, they had the low commodity prices which farmers all across the \ncountry have confronted; and in addition, in our particular situation, \nour farmers were confronted by severe drought problems, as I have \nindicated, unparalleled in the memory of those now farming for more \nthan half a century. Low-interest loans simply won't work to address \nthe collective and drastic impact of these factors.\n  Recognizing that, we sought substantially more and more direct \ndisaster assistance in the Conference Agreement. And the response that \nthe Conferees made to this request--the $1.2 billion that is in this \nbill--is clearly inadequate. The Secretary of Agriculture estimated \nthat in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, we needed $1.5 to $2 billion just \nfor those States alone. Never mind, of course, comparable damage, \neither drought or floods, that have occurred in other parts of the \ncountry which also need assistance. Indeed, it should not be our goal \nto identify an amount of funding where we have to take from one to give \nto the other. These states need assistance as well. What we are arguing \nis that this package ought to be comprehensive enough to meet the needs \nin the agricultural sector all across the country. I appreciate that \nother parts of the country have been hit with droughts and floods and \nthat we must address these needs as well, but the amount provided in \nthis conference report for disaster assistance is clearly inadequate to \naccomplish this goal. The amount that this legislation provides and \nthat which will eventually make its way into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic \nStates will not enable us to confront the problem bleakly staring our \nfarmers in the face.\n  We wrote to the conferees, a number of us from this region of the \ncountry, asking them to consider the following measures. I regret that \nvery little weight was given to this request. All of them, I think, are \nexceedingly reasonable requests, and had they been addressed, it would \nhave affected, obviously, the perspective I take on this legislation.\n  We asked the conference committee to consider the following measures: \nFirst, crop loss disaster assistance programs that provide direct \npayments to producers based on actual losses of 1999 plantings. These \npayments could be drawn from the Commodity Credit Corporation funds \nwithout an arbitrary limit. The arbitrary limit currently in the \nagreement precludes comprehensive assistance and delays the \navailability of the assistance. We asked that yield loss thresholds and \npayment levels be determined in advance so the payments can be made to \nproducers as soon as they apply, rather than providing a fixed amount \nwhich would require all producers to apply before a payment factor can \nbe determined and payments can be issued. We asked for this measure \nbecause these farmers need the help now. They need it quickly. They are \nunder terrific pressure.\n  Secondly, we asked the committee to consider sufficient livestock \nfeed assistance, which addresses losses in pasture and forage for \nlivestock operations, provides direct payments to producers based on a \npercentage of their supplemental feed needs, determined in advance to \nspeed payments and avoids prorating.\n  Thirdly, we requested the conference to consider credit assistance \nwhich addresses the needs of producers who have experienced natural and \nmarket loss disasters.\n  Fourthly, we asked the conference for adequate funding to employ \nadditional staff for the Farm Service Agency and the National Resource \nConservation Service so they could swiftly and expeditiously implement \nvarious assistance programs at the State and local level.\n  Finally, we requested cooperative and/or reimbursable agreements that \nwould enable USDA to assist in cases where a State is providing State-\nfunded disaster assistance.\n  All of these, had they been responded to as we sought, would have \ngiven us an opportunity to address the situation in our region, not \nonly in a forthright manner but one that would accommodate the pressing \ncrisis which we confront. As we indicated, this crisis has reached \noverwhelming proportions. We risk losing a substantial part of the \nregion's critical agricultural sector. The measures in this conference \nreport, I regret to say, are not sufficient, nor sufficiently focused \non the needs of the Eastern States to address their problems. That is \none major reason I oppose this conference report and will vote against \nit.\n  Secondly, this conference report deals with the dairy issue in a way \nthat is harmful to our region. By failing to adopt option 1-A and \ndisallowing the extension of the authorization of the Northeast Dairy \nCompact, the conference agreement has left our dairy farmers \nconfronting a situation of instability. Milk prices have been moving up \nand down as if they were on a roller coaster. Our dairy farmers have \nbeen subjected to wide and frequent swings, which place our dairy \nproducers in situations where they don't have the cash-flow to meet \ntheir costs in a given month. The price goes up; the price comes down. \nIt takes an enormous toll on the industry in our State and elsewhere in \nthe east.\n  As a result of these fluctuations, the number of dairy farmers in \nMaryland has been declining markedly over the last 2 decades. We fear \nthat if this process continues, we are going to see the extinction of a \ncritical component of our dairy industry and the farm economy; that is, \nthe family-run dairy farm. Indeed, my concern is primarily focused on \nfamily farmers and on sustaining their presence as part of the dairy \nsector.\n  The Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to enable Maryland \nto join the Northeast Dairy Compact. They also took measures in that \nlegislation to ensure that the interests of consumers, low-income \nhouseholds and processors, would be protected when a farm milk price \nwas established. In fact, a representative from those groups would be \non the compact commission, as well as from the dairy industry itself. \nOther states that are a part of the Compact or want to participate have \ntaken the measures to protect same interests. And we believe this \nestablished a reasonable solution to provide stable income for those in \nthe dairy industry, particularly family dairy farmers.\n  But the conference denied what I regard as a fair and reasoned \napproach--in refusing to extend the authorization of the compact, and \ntherefore, committed our region's dairy industry to a continuance of \nthis unstable and volatile environment.\n  Mr. President, agriculture is an important economic actor in the \nstate of Maryland. It contributes significantly to our State's economy. \nIt employs hundreds of thousands of people in one way or another. We \nreally are seeking, I think, fair and equitable treatment. I don't \nthink this legislation contains a fair and equitable solution for the \ncrisis that faces farmers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. \nIndeed, it seems to ignore the fact that we have farmers as well. The \nonly farmers in the country are not in sectors other than the Northeast \nand Mid-Atlantic and the needs of all of our farmers should have been \naddressed in this legislation.\n  The Farm Bureau has written me a letter urging a vote against \nadoption of the conference report. I ask unanimous consent that this \nletter be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n\n[[Page S12476]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. They write:\n\n       Maryland Farm Bureau believes that many of the provisions \n     in the economic disaster relief package are important and \n     necessary. We are concerned, however, that the adoption of \n     the conference report as drafted will not meet Maryland's \n     drought disaster needs. We also believe that the absence of \n     the Option 1A dairy language will have long-term negative \n     impacts on the State's dairy industry.\n\n  I agree with that. We should reject this package, go back to \nconference, and develop a package that addresses the dairy issue, \nallows us to develop the compact to give some stability and diminished \nvolatility in the industry, and also increases the drought assistance \npackage so it adequately and directly meets the needs of the farmers of \nour region.\n  The conference agreement should have done better by these very hard-\nworking men and women, these small farm families. And because it has \nnot--as much as I appreciate the pressing needs of agriculture \nelsewhere in the country, and as much as I, in the past, have been \nsupportive of those needs--we in the region must take measures to have \nour farmers' needs addressed in the current context. We have \nexperienced a very difficult and rough period for Maryland agriculture, \nand for agriculture generally in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. \nBecause this crisis is not adequately addressed in this conference \nreport, I intend to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                   Maryland Farm Bureau, Inc.,\n\n                               Randallstown, MD, October 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing to urge you to vote \n     against adoption of the conference report on Agricultural \n     Appropriations when it is considered on the floor tomorrow.\n       Maryland Farm Bureau believes that many of the provisions \n     in the economic disaster relief package are important and \n     necessary. We are concerned, however, that the adoption of \n     the conference report as drafted will not meet Maryland's \n     drought disaster needs. We also believe that the absence of \n     the Option 1A dairy language will have long-term negative \n     impacts on the state's dairy industry.\n       I urge you to vote to send the agricultural appropriations \n     conference report back to the conferees with instructions \n     that they add the Option 1A dairy language and that they \n     increase the drought assistance package to adequately meet \n     the needs of mid-Atlantic farmers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Stephen L. Weber,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \ncommend my colleague for his comments. He could have easily been \nspeaking on behalf of the State of Connecticut in talking about the \nparticular concerns of his home State of Maryland. In a moment, I will \nexplain why I also have serious reservations about this bill. But his \npoint that the New England States, the Northeast, contribute \nsignificantly to the agricultural well-being of this country is well \nfounded.\n  I know Secretary Glickman came to Maryland and he came to Connecticut \nduring the drought this past summer. The exact number eludes me, but it \nwas surprisingly high, the number of farmers and the significant \nportion of agricultural production that occurs east of the Mississippi \nand north of the Mason-Dixon line, or near north of the Mason-Dixon \nline.\n  So when we talk about these issues, it may seem as if it is more sort \nof hobby farms to people, but for many people in Maryland and for the \n4,000 people in Connecticut who make a living in agriculture--these are \nnot major agricultural centers, but in a State of 3.5 million people, \nwhere 4,000 families annually depend upon agriculture as a source of \nincome, it is not insignificant.\n  So when you have a bill that virtually excludes people from Maryland, \nConnecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania from \nreceiving some help during a time of crisis, I hope our colleagues who \ncome from the States that benefit from this bill, who I know have \nenjoyed the support of the Senator from Maryland, this Senator, and \nothers during times of crisis, because we have seen a flood in the \nMidwest, or a drought in the Midwest, or cyclones and hurricanes that \nhave devastated agriculture in other parts of our country--I never \nconsidered my voting to support people in those areas as somehow a \nregional vote. When I vote to support a farmer who has lost his \nlivelihood because of a natural disaster, I think I am voting to \nstrengthen my country, not to help out a particular farmer in a State \nthat I don't represent.\n  So when we have a drought in the Northeast, as we did, a record \ndrought this year that wiped out farmers, caused them to lose \nsignificant income, to lose farms and the like, and then to have a bill \nthat comes before us that disregards this natural disaster--in my \nState, $41 million was lost as a result of the drought--I am \ndisappointed. My colleagues may have stronger words to use. I am \nterribly disappointed, as someone who, year after year, has been \nsupportive of particular agricultural needs, although I didn't directly \nrepresent them, that our colleagues in the House and Senate could not \nsee fit to provide some financial help beyond, as my colleague from \nMaryland said, the loan program, which is not much help. We don't have \ncrop insurance for my row croppers. The small farmers don't get crop \ninsurance. When they get wiped out or lose income, they have to depend \nupon some direct payment. A loan program is of little or no assistance \nto them.\n  I am terribly disappointed that this bill excludes those farmers from \nthe eastern part of the United States. It was the worst drought that \nhas hit our region in decades. Congressional delegations throughout the \nregion have consistently supported our colleagues in other regions when \ntheir States have suffered catastrophic floods, hurricanes, and \nearthquakes. We don't understand why it is so difficult for the eastern \npart of the country to convey to our colleagues how massive the \ndevastation has been to our small farmers. As I have said, in my State \nalone, it is $41 million. In other States, the numbers may be higher. I \nrepresent a small State.\n\n  The dairy industry is one of the major agricultural interests in our \nregion. It has gotten a double hit in this legislation--inadequate \ndrought relief assistance and the exclusion of provisions that would \nhave extended the Northeast Dairy Compact. On top of the drought \nlosses, our farmers will lose an additional $100 million if the new \nmilk marketing pricing goes forward.\n  While I am heartened by the recently issued court injunction \npostponing the implementation of the new pricing scheme, quite frankly, \nthis is only a short-term solution and is no substitute for affirmative \naction taken by the Congress. Northeast dairy farmers are deserving of \nthe same kinds of assistance we offer to the agricultural sectors in \nother parts of the country. I believe it is grossly unfair that this \nconference report has chosen to ignore their plight.\n  We should not be placing one part of the country against another. I \ndon't want to see a midwestern farmer or a western farmer be adversely \naffected by votes we cast here. But, likewise, I don't want to see \nfarming interests in my State or my region of the country be harmed as \na result of our unwillingness to provide some relief when they \nabsolutely need it to survive.\n  Inadequate drought relief and the exclusion of the Northeast Dairy \nCompact would be reason enough to vote against the legislation before \nus today. But I want to raise another issue that has caused a lot of \nconsternation during the debate on this Agriculture appropriations \nbill. I am referring to the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft, myself, and Senator Hagel of \nNebraska. The House leadership literally hijacked this piece of \nlegislation and denied the normal democratic process to work when it \ncame to this measure that was adopted overwhelmingly in the Senate by a \nmargin of 70-28--by any measure, an overwhelming vote of \nbipartisanship. This measure would have ended unilateral sanctions on \nthe sale of U.S. food and medicine to countries around the globe.\n  The amendment had broad-based support from farm organizations across \nthe country which, time and time again, have been forced to pay the \nprice of lost income when Congress has decided to ``get tough'' with \ndictators\n\n[[Page S12477]]\n\nand bar farm exports. Farmers, over the years, have rightfully noted \nthat, although in some cases sanctions have been in place for 40 years, \nthere is nothing in the way of positive foreign policy results to show \nfor these sanctions.\n  On the other hand, the losses to our farmers are measurable and \nsubstantial--in the billions of dollars annually--as a result of these \nunilateral sanctions on food and medicine we have imposed for years.\n  Church groups and humanitarian organizations have joined farm \norganizations in strongly opposing use of food and medicine as \nsanctions weapons on moral grounds.\n  Ironically, U.S. sanctions--particularly ones on food and medicine--\nhave been used as an instrument by hostile governments to shore up \ndomestic support and retain power, the very power that we are allegedly \ntrying to change through the use of sanctions actually having \ncontributed to these dictators staying in power for as many years as \nsome of them have. Whether or not the United States is fully \nresponsible for the suffering of these men, women, and children in \nthese targeted countries, it is hard to convince many of them that the \nUnited States means them no ill will when we deny them the access to \nfoodstuffs, critical medicines, and medical equipment--the reason \nseventy of our colleagues decided to end this policy of unilateral \nsanctions on food and medicine.\n  Unfortunately, the House Republican leadership would not allow the \nprocess to work in conference. As a result, this bill was tied up for \ndays over this single measure.\n  Again, I compliment my colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, and \nSenator Hagel, who are leaders on this, along with others in fighting \nfor this provision.\n  This is not a provision that is designed to help dictators. It is a \nprovision to, in fact, change these dictatorial governments and to \nprovide needed relief and opportunity for millions of people who are \nthe innocent victims of these dictators, and not deny our own farm \ncommunity and business interests the opportunity to sell into these \nmarkets and make a difference. They are prepared, of course, to deny, \nin the case of the major opposition, by the way, which comes from some \nMembers.\n  I want to emphasize that some members of the Cuban American community \nfeel particularly strongly about the government in Cuba. I respect \ntheir feelings. I respect it very deeply. These families have lost \ntheir homes, jobs, and family members as a result of the government in \nCuba under Fidel Castro. There is no way I can fully appreciate the \ndepth of their feelings and passions about this. As I say, I respect \nthat.\n  The exile community is not unfounded in its deep concerns about what \nhas happened on the island of Cuba.\n  Before I make any comments about the island of Cuba and what goes on \nthere, I want it to be as clear as I can possibly make it that my \nsympathies, my heartfelt sympathies go to the exiled community that \nlives in this country and elsewhere. Their passions, I understand and \naccept, and I am tremendously sympathetic.\n  But I must say as well that there are 11 million Cubans who live on \nthat island 90 miles off our shores who are suffering and hurting \nbadly. Arguably, the problem exists with the government there. I don't \ndeny that. But to impose a sanction for 40 years on the same of food \nand medicine to 11 million people in this country also is not \nwarranted.\n  While we may want to change the government in Cuba--and that may \nhappen in time--we shouldn't be compounding the problem by denying the \nsale of food and medicine to these people.\n  Many people say they won't set foot on Cuban soil while Castro \nremains in power. I understand that as well. But don't deny the 11 \nmillion people in Cuba the opportunity to at least have basic food \nsupplies and medicine. It seems to me that--in fact I believe--a \nmajority of the Cuban American people in this country have similar \nfeelings. Their voices are not heard as often as is oftentimes the case \nwhen a minority view is extremely vocal and can dominate. But I believe \nthe vast majority of Cuban Americans feel strongly about Fidel Castro, \nwant him out of power, and want democracy to come to their country but \nsimultaneously believe the 11 million people with whom they share a \ncommon heritage ought not to be denied food and medicine by the United \nStates.\n\n  To make my point, these Cuban Americans try on their own to do what \nthey can by sending small packages to loved ones and family members and \nfriends who live in Cuba. Others travel to deliver medicines. Some \n150,000 Cuban Americans travel annually to go into Cuba to bring \nwhatever they can to help out family members and friends. However, \nthese gestures of generosity are no substitute for commercial sales of \nsuch products if the public health and nutritional need of 11 million \npeople are going to be met.\n  Unfortunately, the antidemocratic forces have succeeded in stripping \nthe Ashcroft-Dodd-Hagel amendment from this bill. I hope enough of my \ncolleagues will vote against this legislation to prevent its adoption. \nWe can delay a few days, send this measure back to conference, and \nreestablish this language that was supported overwhelmingly, and I \nthink supported in the House of Representatives, the other body, as \nwell, and bring the measure back.\n  If this measure goes forward without the inclusion of the Dodd-Hagel-\nAshcroft amendment, rest assured we will be back on this floor offering \nsimilar amendments at every opportunity that presents itself, and we \nwill continue to do so. The day is going to come when a majority of the \nCongress and the will of the American people, including the Cuban \nAmericans, I strongly suggest, is going to prevail.\n  On that day, the United States will regain a moral high ground by \nceasing forever to use food and medicine as a weapon against innocent \npeople.\n  I argue, as Senators Ashcroft, Hagel, Grams, and others, that the \nadoption of amendments that would allow for the lifting of unilateral \nsanctions on food and medicines will also be a major contributing \nfactor to changing governments in these countries.\n  Aside from helping out farmers and businesses that want to sell these \nproducts and the innocent people who can't have access to them in these \ncountries, I believe the foreign policy implications of allowing the \nsale of food and medicine will be significant for our country and for \nthe people who live under dictatorial governments.\n  For those reasons, and what is being denied our farmers and \nagricultural interests in the State of Connecticut and elsewhere in the \nNortheast, and the rejection of the Ashcroft-Hagel-Dodd amendment, I \nwill oppose this conference report, and I urge my colleagues to do \nlikewise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, some of our colleagues have denounced the \nAgriculture appropriations conference report as inadequate. I must \nagree. Without a doubt this bill is deficient.\n  It fails to acknowledge the full impact of natural disasters that \nhave been experienced by agricultural producers across the country.\n\n  It fails to include adequate funding for the drought that has hit the \nNortheast.\n  It fails to provide adequate funding for the hurricane damage to the \nSoutheast and the Northeast.\n  It fails to include adequate funding for flooded farmland in my own \npart of the country.\n  This bill is also deficient in the way it got here because in the \nconference committee when it became clear that there were going to be \nsteps to change the sanctions regime of this country, the minority, the \nDemocrats, were simply shut out. That is wrong. That should not happen. \nBut it did happen.\n  So we are left with that result. As a result partly of that lockout, \nthis bill fails to provide the kind of sanctions reform that ought to \nhave occurred.\n  In 1996 when we passed the last farm bill, the Republican leadership \npromised American farmers that what they lost in domestic supports they \nwould make up through expanded export opportunities. That was a hollow \npromise. The harsh reality is that now the prices have collapsed, \nfarmers are in desperate trouble, and there must be a Federal response.\n  I wish this bill were better. I wish it contained adequate assistance \nfor\n\n[[Page S12478]]\n\nthose who have been hit by hurricanes. I wish it had adequate \nassistance for farmers who have had their acreage flooded. I wish it \nhad sanctions reform.\n  Food should not be used as a weapon. It is immoral; It is \nineffective; and it is inhumane. But the harsh reality is we are where \nwe are. We have a conference report that is flawed. Indeed, it is badly \nflawed.\n  The easy thing to do would be to vote against this conference report. \nBut it would not be the right thing to do. This bill is not just about \nresponding to natural disasters. It also responds to the price collapse \nthat has occurred and threatens the livelihood of tens of thousands of \nfarmers in my State and across the country.\n  The need for emergency income assistance could not be more clear.\n  I can say that in my State many farmers are relying on this bill as \ntheir only chance for financial survival. I don't say that lightly. It \nis the reality.\n\n  If this assistance is not passed and distributed immediately, \nliterally thousands of farmers in my State are going to go out of \nbusiness. It is that simple. A way of life and the tradition of farming \nwill be lost in dozens of communities across my State. The funding in \nthis bill only meets the most basic needs of our producers. Make no \nmistake, it is absolutely essential. Prices for agricultural \ncommodities are at their lowest levels in 50 years in real terms. Wheat \nand barley are the lowest they have been in real terms in over 50 \nyears. Farm bankruptcies are rising; auctions are being held on an \nunending basis. If nothing further is done, thousands of our farmers \nwill go out of the business. That is the stark reality in farm country.\n  If we fail to pass this bill, we are going to mortgage the future of \nliterally thousands of farm families. I think we should keep in mind \nthis is not our last chance to get something done for those who have \nbeen so badly hurt, whether it is my farmers who have flooded acres, \nwhether it is people in the Northeast and the Southeast hit by \nhurricanes, whether it is farmers in the Northeast hit by drought. \nThere is another chance this year to get additional assistance. I \nsympathize with my colleagues from the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic \nStates. They are not alone. In my State this year, we have been hit by \nsevere storms, flooding, extreme snow and ice, ground saturation, mud \nslides, tornadoes, hail, insects, and disease. It is unbelievable what \nhas happened in my State.\n  Growing up in North Dakota I always thought of my State as dry. I now \nfly over much of North Dakota and it looks similar to a Louisiana rice \npaddy. There is water everywhere. Millions of acres are inundated and \nwere never planted this year. Our farmers planted the lowest level of \nspring wheat since 1988, the year of intense drought. Yet prices remain \nvery low--in fact, record lows. Barley production in North Dakota is \ndown 42 percent. Yet prices remain very low.\n  Things have gone from bad to worse this fall. Farmers were anxious to \nget into the field for harvest but were forced to stay at home and \nwatch the rain. North Dakota farmers suffered through 2 weeks of rain \nat the end of August and early September, the key time for harvest. As \na result, the completion of harvest has been delayed. Damage resulting \nfrom a delayed harvest is deducted from prices farmers receive for \ntheir crops. At this point, there is absolutely no way some farmers \nwill come anywhere close to matching their expenses for this year. We \nsimply must pass this bill to allow entire communities to survive.\n  I was called by a very dear friend of mine 2 weeks ago describing \nwhat had happened to him. He was just beginning harvest when the rains \nonce again resumed in our State. He had just cut his grain. It was on \nthe ground and the rains came and continued day after day after day. As \na result, that grain that was on the ground sprouted. He had 30-percent \nsprout in his fields. He took a sample into the elevator and the \nelevator said: Don't even bother trucking that in; we aren't going to \nbuy it at any price.\n  That happened all over my State. I know it has happened in other \nStates, as well.\n  Passing this bill and releasing this funding is absolutely critical \nfor those farmers who have been so hard hit. Remember, passing this \nbill does not bar Congress from doing more in the future. We have other \nopportunities this year to help those who have been hit by a hurricane. \nThere is other legislation moving through this body that has funds for \nthose hit by hurricanes. That package can be improved upon. When we \npassed the emergency supplemental bill last May, we agreed to revisit \nagricultural emergency spending once the extent of the price disaster \nwas known. We have done that. We can pass this bill now and assess \nfuture needs in response to natural disasters while this assistance is \ndistributed.\n\n  The statement of the managers on this bill made several references to \nthe need for additional Federal spending for 1999 disasters. They have \nrecognized the reality. I hope colleagues on the floor will understand \nthere are additional opportunities to achieve the result they seek. The \nanswer is not to kill this bill. This bill, however flawed, is a step \nin the right direction. It would be a profound mistake to defeat it.\n  I close by urging my colleagues to support this conference report. We \nhad an overwhelming vote in the Senate yesterday. It was an important \nvote to send the signal that this legislation ought to pass.\n  My colleagues in the Northeast are not alone. In many ways, we are in \nthe same circumstance. We desperately need those farmers who have \nflooded acres to have legislation that addresses their needs. We will \nhave another chance. We will have another opportunity. That is the \ngreat thing about the Senate; there is always another chance.\n  I close by looking at a picture that shows what is happening in my \nState. This is several sections of land in North Dakota. Everywhere you \nlook is water, water, water--water everywhere. I have flown all over my \nState. It is truly remarkable; places that were dry for 30 years are \nnow saturated.\n  I talked about the price collapse. I want to visually show what it is \nfarmers are contending with. This chart shows clearly what has happened \nto spring wheat and barley prices over the last 53 years. The blue line \nis spring wheat; the red line is barley. These are two of the dominant \ncrops of my State. Today the prices in inflation-adjusted terms, in \nreal terms, are the lowest they have been in 53 years. That is the \nreality.\n  This chart shows the cost of wheat production with the green line; \nthe red line shows what prices are. Prices have been below the cost of \nproduction the last 3 years. This is a disaster scenario of its own. \nThis is the reality of what is happening in my State. This threatens \nthe economic future of virtually every farmer in my State. The price is \nfar below the cost of production. There are not many businesses that \nsurvive when it costs more to produce the product than is being \nreceived--not for a few months but for 3 years.\n  The next chart shows a comparison of the prices farmers paid for \ntheir inputs--the green line that keeps going on--versus the prices \nthat farmers received. We can see there is a gap and it is a widening \ngap. In fact, the closest we came to having these two on the same line \nwas back at the time of the passage of the 1996 farm bill. Since that \ntime, the prices farmers pay have gone up. Thank goodness they have \nstabilized somewhat in the last couple of years, but the prices they \nhave received have collapsed. That is the hard reality of what our \nfarmers confront. These are, by the way, statistics from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n\n  I want to conclude by saying we ought to pass this bill. It is not \nperfect. In fact, in many ways it is deeply flawed. But it is far \nbetter than the alternative of nothing. It is far better than to take \nthe risk of sending this bill back to conference and having it come \nback in much worse shape. At least we can take this and put it in the \nbank because this does address the question of price collapse. It does \nnot do a good enough job on the disaster side, but we have other \nopportunities that will come our way before this session of the \nCongress concludes.\n  I will end by thanking the Senator from Mississippi, the chairman of \nthe subcommittee, and Senator Kohl, his counterpart, for the good job \nthey have done under very difficult circumstances. Make no mistake, \nthere are 100 Senators and there are probably 100 different opinions of \nwhat agricultural policy should be and what an Agriculture \nappropriations bill should\n\n[[Page S12479]]\n\nlook like. But we do respect and admire the work they have done. We \nagain thank them for their patience and perseverance bringing this bill \nto the floor. It deserves our support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, agriculture across most of America is in \na state of crisis. We are facing incredibly low livestock and grain \nprices, coupled with weather disasters in many parts of the country, \nall simultaneously. The legislation before us, as my colleague has \nnoted so ably, is imperfect. Some have referred to it as throwing a \nleaking liferaft to a drowning person, and there is some truth to that. \nBut it is urgent legislation. It is legislation we need to move forward \nbecause the need is immense and the urgency is critical. There is \ncertainly no assurance, if we were to vote this particular bill down, \nthat it would be back to us anytime soon or that it would come back to \nus in a better situation than it is now.\n  I think we need to recognize the inadequacies of the legislation, but \nat the same time that we move forward, we do so with a commitment to do \nbetter, still this Congress and in the coming year, to address the \nunderlying problems that at least contributed to the crisis we have in \nrural America. Faulty agricultural policy brought to us by Freedom to \nFarm, combined with low prices, natural disasters, and weak export \nmarkets, resulted in an inadequate safety net--for family producers, in \nany event--across this country.\n  We have seen net farm income absolutely plummet from $53 billion in \n1996 to $43.8 billion in 1999. Off-farm income in many of our States, \nincluding mine, South Dakota, is responsible for 80 to 90 percent of \nour family producers being able to stay on the farm. If it were not for \noff-farm income, there would be an even more massive exodus off the \nfarm and ranch than we are seeing.\n\n  Are there inadequacies in the bill? Certainly. I commend our \ncolleagues, Senator Cochran, Senator Stevens, Senator Kohl, and many \nothers, for hard work on this legislation under circumstances that \nsurely were trying, where the level of resources would certainly not \npermit what they would prefer to see happen. Nonetheless, I think we \nhave to acknowledge we need a recommitment in this body and from our \nfriends on the other side of the Capitol to address the underlying \nstructural problems ag faces today. I believe that involves revisiting \nthe Freedom to Farm legislation. I believe that involves strengthening \nour marketing loan capabilities.\n  I would like to see us pass my country-of-origin meat labeling \nlegislation. I am still working with a bipartisan group of colleagues \nthis week to put together legislation addressing vertical integration \nin the packing industry, so we do not turn our livestock producers into \nlow-wage employees on their own land. I fear that is the road we are \ngoing down.\n  We have to address issues of trade, value-added agriculture, farmer-\nowned cooperatives, and crop insurance reform. All of these are issues \nthat cry out for attention, above and beyond anything done in this \nlegislation.\n  I do applaud the effort in this bill to include mandatory price \nreporting on the livestock side. I do applaud some modest funding, at \nleast, for my school breakfast pilot project that is included in this \nbill. I am concerned, however, the process led us to legislation that \ninvolves a distribution process that may not be as equitable as what I \nthink the American public deserves. I will quote briefly from an \nanalysis by the Associated Press, Philip Brasher, where he observes:\n\n       Some of the largest, most profitable farms in the country \n     would be among the biggest beneficiaries of Congress' $8.7 \n     billion agricultural assistance package because it loosens \n     rules that wee intended to target government payments to \n     family-size operations.\n       An individual farm could claim up to $460,000 in subsidies \n     a year--double the current restriction--and the legislation \n     creates a new way for producers to get around even that \n     limit.\n       The payment limits apply to two different programs: crop \n     subsidies that vary according to fluctuations in commodity \n     prices; and annual ``market transition'' payments, which were \n     guaranteed to producers under the 1996 farm law.\n       Farmers are technically allowed to receive no more than \n     $75,000 in crop subsidies and $40,000 a year in market \n     transition payments under current law. But many farms, \n     legally claim twice that much because they are divided into \n     different entities. A husband and a wife, for example, can \n     claim separate payments on the same farm.\n       The aid package would double those caps, so farms could get \n     up to $300,000 in crop subsidies and $160,000 in market \n     transition payments this year.\n       Last year, about 550 farmers nationwide claimed the maximum \n     amount in crop subsidies, USDA officials said.\n       Critics of the looser payment rules fear they will \n     encourage the consolidation of farms and hasten the demise of \n     smaller-scale operations. ``Big farms will use the extra cash \n     to buy up land from the neighbors, driving up land prices in \n     the process,'' said Chuck Hassebrook, program director of the \n     Center for Rural Affairs in Walthill, NE.\n       ``What is the purpose of these farm programs? Is it to help \n     very wealthy, very large landowners get bigger and get \n     richer?''\n\n  These are the kinds of questions and concerns many of us have. I \nthink they are profound questions, having to do with the very nature of \nagriculture, the very nature of rural America. What road we are going \ndown, in terms of ag and rural policy in America, policy responsible \nfor feeding so efficiently and so effectively and in such an \nextraordinary manner the people of our Nation?\n  But for all its failings and shortcomings, many of which I briefly \nraised this morning, the fact is there is absolute urgency this \nlegislation go forward, that we address the problems of income \ncollapse, disaster all over America, with this legislation; and, \nhopefully, upon passage of this legislation, we recommit ourselves to \ngoing expeditiously forward to address the remainder of these other \nissues I have raised, and others of my colleagues have raised, \nreflecting upon the inadequacies and inefficiencies and the \nshortcomings of this legislation. They are many. But to stop this \nlegislation now would only hasten the demise of still more family \nproducers all across America. It would not guarantee a return to a \nbetter policy anytime very soon. We need to pass this bill, then go \nforward with additional legislation to redress these inadequacies.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on passage of this legislation and \nto work with us in a bipartisan fashion on the remainder of these \nagricultural issues and budget issues before the country.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the conference report for the fiscal year \n2000 Agriculture appropriations bill addresses one of the most \nbeleaguered fisheries in the United States. The Norton Sound region of \nAlaska has suffered chronically poor salmon returns in recent years. \nNorton Sound is an arm of the Bering Sea off the west coast of Alaska. \nIt lies to the north of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, which has also seen \nvery poor salmon returns in recent years.\n  Both of these regions are extremely rural and heavily dependent on \ncommercial and subsistence salmon fishing for survival.\n  The provision in the conference report addresses the Norton Sound \nproblem in several ways. First, it will make the Norton Sound region \neligible for the Federal disaster assistance made available to the \nYukon-Kuskokwim delta region last year.\n  Second, it changes the income eligibility standard from the Federal \npoverty level to that for the temporary assistance to needy families \nprogram.\n  The standard of living in many of these fish-dependent communities is \nwell below the poverty line. This was one of the chief complaints \nvoiced to my staff and several Commerce Department officials when they \nvisited western Alaska last summer. This provision will allow more \nneedy families to qualify for 1999 disaster assistance, much of which \nhas gone unallocated.\n  Additionally, this bill will provide $10 million in grants through \nthe Economic Development Administration for infrastructure improvements \nin the Norton Sound region.\n  The conference report included is $5 million in disaster assistance \nunder the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to \ndetermine\n\n[[Page S12480]]\n\nthe cause of the decline and to identify ways to improve the area's \nfisheries in the future. These funds will be available in 2001.\n  The main reason these communities are unable to ride out cyclical \nfishery failures is the lack of commercial infrastructure in rural \nfisheries. The EDA grants will help provide ice machines and other \nequipment to help these communities modernize their processing \ncapabilities and extract more value from the resources they harvest.\n  I was also pleased to work with my colleagues from New England on \ntheir request for fishery disaster assistance. New England will receive \n$15 million in 2001 for cooperative research and management activities \nin the New England fisheries. These funds will provide New England \nfishermen with an important role in working to solve the problems of \ntheir own fisheries.\n  Within this conference report, I have also asked that the \nAgricultural Marketing Service--the AMS--convene two national meetings \nto begin development of organic standards with respect to seafoods. One \nof these meetings will be held in Alaska and the other meeting will be \nheld on the Gulf of Mexico coastal area.\n  The AMS will use the information gathered at these meetings to \ndevelop draft regulations establishing national organic standards for \nseafood to be published in fiscal year 2000.\n  It is estimated that the sales of organic foods will reach $6.6 \nbillion by the year 2000. The organic industry has been growing at a \nrate of 20 to 24 percent for the last 9 consecutive years.\n  Ocean-harvested seafood should be at the same level with other \nqualifying protein commodities, such as beef, pork, and chicken. I hope \nthat these protein sources will be included in the proposed U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture rules to be finalized by June 2000. Ocean-\nharvested seafood should not be excluded as an organically-produced \nproduct when USDA issues its final rule.\n  This issue is very important to Alaska, as the harvesting of seafood \nis an industry that employs more Alaskans than any other industry. In \nparticular, I am concerned about the inclusion of wild salmon within \nUSDA's final rule for the National Organic Program. Wild salmon is an \norganic product.\n  This past summer, two private certifying firms for organic food \nproducts visited two Alaska seafood processors to determine whether the \nwild, ocean-harvested salmon processed at these facilities could be \ncertified as organic. One of the certifiers, farm verified organic, \ninspected capilliano seafoods. Their report is very positive. In fact, \ntheir approval allowed capalliano's salmon to be admitted to natural \nproducts east, which is a large organic food show in Boston, \nMassachusetts. In order to be admitted to this trade show, a product \nmust be verified as organic.\n  I, frankly do not know what the dispute is about. Natural fish, wild \nfish should certainly be verified as organic.\n  I am confident that the AMS will find Alaskan wild salmon a very \nheart-healthy protein source, to be of high quality and organic, for \nthe purposes of USDA's national organic program.\n  I thank my friend from Mississippi and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know a number of \nMembers are waiting to speak.\n  The Governors and legislators in the six New England States had five \ngoals in mind when they enacted the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact \ninto law in each of their States.\n  They wanted to assure fresh, local supplies of milk to consumers. In \nfact, they wanted to do it at lower prices than found in most other \nparts of the Nation. They wanted to keep dairy farmers in business, \nthey wanted to protect New England's rural environment, and they wanted \nto do this without burdening Federal taxpayers.\n  It turned out the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact was a stirring \nsuccess on every one of these points. But it also had an added benefit. \nIt increased interstate trade into the region as neighboring farmers \ntook advantage of the compact. Not only did prices come down, but the \nnumber of farmers going out of business has declined throughout New \nEngland for the first time in many years. We find there are still some \nwho favor having Federal bureaucrats run this farm program, at a cost \nto the taxpayers, instead of the States themselves, with no cost to the \ntaxpayers.\n  Because it has been so successful, half the Governors in the Nation, \nhalf the State legislatures in the Nation, asked that the Congress \nallow their States to set their own dairy policies, within certain \nlimits, through interstate compacts that, again, cost taxpayers \nnothing. The dairy compact legislation passed in these States \noverwhelmingly.\n  Perhaps most significant, and I mention this because we have heard \nthose from Minnesota and Wisconsin attack this, what they do not tell \nus is that the retail milk prices in New England not only average lower \nthan the rest of the Nation, but they are much lower than the milk \nprices in Minnesota and Wisconsin. So those in these parts of the \ncountry who are attacking the Northeast Dairy Compact say they are \nconcerned about consumers and ignore the fact that consumers pay a lot \nmore in their States than they do in New England.\n  One has to ask, Why does anybody oppose the Dairy Compact? GAO and \nOMB report that consumer prices are lower and farm income is higher \nthan the average for the rest of the country, without increased cost to \nthe taxpayers. Why would anybody oppose it?\n  One of the things I learned long ago is to follow the money, and \nthere is one group making a whole lot of money on this issue. They are \nthe huge milk manufacturers, such as Suiza, or Kraft which is owned by \nPhilip Morris, or other processors represented by the International \nDairy Foods Association. They oppose the compact not because they care \nfor the consumers, not because they care for the farmers, but because \nthey care for their own huge, bloated profits.\n  Indeed, they sent around corporate front organizations to speak for \nthem. One was the Public Voice for Food and Health Policy. When it \nfinally became clear that Public Voice was going around fronting for \nthese organizations, and that their policies were determined not by \nwhat was best for everybody but by corporate dollars, they finally went \nout of business.\n  I've talked about the close alliances between a lead executive who \nhandled compact issues for Public Voice who negotiated a job to \nrepresent the huge processors.\n  I will give the press another lead on the next public interest group \nwhose funding should be investigated, the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica. One of their officers, formerly from Public Voice, has been \ngoing around Capitol Hill offices with lobbyists representing dairy \nprocessors.\n  One might ask why would Philip Morris want to use these organizations \ninstead of going directly to the editorial boards of the New York Times \nor the Washington Post to bad mouth the compact? Why not have somebody \nwho appears to be representing the consumers rather than Philip Morris \ncoming in and talking about it?\n  The consumer representative, being paid by the big processors, could \ncome in and say: Editorial board members, milk prices are higher for \nchildren in the School Lunch Program under this compact.\n  We ought to compare those prices. Let's compare the retail milk \nprices in New England against retail milk prices in the upper Midwest. \nA gallon of whole milk in Augusta, ME, was $2.47. The price was up to \n50 cents more in Minneapolis, MN, the area opponents used as an example \nof how to save money.\n\n  I think we ought to take a look at these issues because when we hear \nsome of the big companies, such as Philip Morris and Kraft and Suiza, \nsaying, well, it's not the money. But you know, of course, it is the \nmoney. When they say ``we are here because we're concerned about the \nconsumers,'' you know--with their track record--that the consumer is \nthe last thing on their mind. And when these processor groups say they \nwant to protect the farmer . . . oh, Lordy, don't ever, ever believe \nthat, because there is not a farmer in this country who would.\n  Lastly, if anybody tells you the dairy compact will cost you money, I \npoint out, not only does it not cost taxpayers any money, but the cost \nof milk is much lower than in States without a compact.\n\n[[Page S12481]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Governors and legislators in the six New England \nstates had five goals in mind when they enacted the Compact into law in \neach of their states.\n  They wanted to assure fresh, local supplies of milk to consumers--at \nlower prices than found in most of the nation--they wanted to keep \ndairy farmers in business, they wanted to protect the New England's \nrural environment from sprawl and destructive development, and they \nwanted to do this without burdening federal taxpayers.\n  The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has delivered beyond the \nexpectations of those Governors and state legislators.\n  The Compact provided an added benefit--it has also increased \ninterstate trade into the region as neighboring farmers took advantage \nof the Compact.\n  This great idea--coming from those six New England states--has \ncreated a successful and enduring partnership between dairy farmers and \nconsumers throughout New England.\n  Thanks to the Northeast Compact, the number of farmers going out of \nbusiness has declined throughout New England--for the first time in \nmany years.\n  It is unfortunate that most still favor federal bureaucrats running \nthe farm programs--I think Congress should look at more zero-cost \nstate-initiated programs rather than turning a deaf ear to the pleas of \nstate legislators.\n  Indeed, half the Governors in the nation, and half the state \nlegislatures in the nation, asked that the Congress allow their states \nto set their own dairy policies--within federally mandated limits--\nthrough interstate compacts that cost taxpayers nothing.\n  And the dairy compact legislation passed with overwhelming support in \nalmost all these states.\n  One of the most difficult challenges posed by the New England \nGovernors is that the Compact had to cost nothing--yet deliver a \nbenefit to farmers. The Compact is scored by CBO as having no costs to \nthe Federal treasury.\n  Major environmental groups have endorsed the Northeast Dairy Compact \nbecause they know it helps preserve farmland and prevent urban sprawl. \nIndeed, a New York Times and a National Geographic article that I \nmentioned yesterday discuss the importance of keeping dairy farmers in \nbusiness from an environmental standpoint.\n  Perhaps most significantly, retail milk prices in New England average \nlower than the rest of the nation and much lower than milk prices in \nMinnesota and Wisconsin, according to GAO.\n  The question is: why does anyone in America oppose the dairy compact? \nSince GAO and OMB report that consumer prices are lower and farm income \nis higher than the average for the rest of the country, without \nincreased costs to taxpayers, why does anyone oppose the Compact?\n  The answer is simple, huge milk manufacturers--such as Suiza, \nheadquartered in Texas, Kraft which is owned by the tobacco giant \nPhilip Morris, other processors represented by the International Dairy \nFoods Association--oppose the Compact.\n  Even the most junior investigative reporter could figure out the \nanswer to my question with the above information. All anyone has to do \nis look up the donations made by these, and other, giant processors. \nAll the negative news stories about the compact have their genesis in \nefforts by these giant processors and their front organizations.\n  I have explained the details of this on the Senate floor so scholars \nwho want to know what really happened can check the public records and \nthe lobby registration forms.\n  Indeed, one of the corporate front organizations--Public Voice for \nFood and Health Policy--apparently could not continue to exist when it \nwas so obvious that their policies where determined by corporate \ndollars rather than good policy.\n  A simple glance at the list of corporations who funded and attended \ntheir functions could be easily researched by any reporter. It will \ndemonstrate that sad and disturbing relationship--now ended as Public \nVoice had to close up shop because it lost its conscience.\n  I have detailed the close alliances between their lead executive who \nhandled compact issues for them and the job he negotiated to represent \nthe huge processors a couple of times on the Senate floor.\n  I will give the press another lead on the next public interest group \nwhose funding should be investigated--the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica. Indeed, one of their officers--formerly from Public Voice--is \nbeing taken around Capitol Hill offices by lobbyists representing \nprocessors. A glance at who funds their functions and efforts will be \nas instruction as investigations of Public Voice.\n  Why should Philip Morris or Kraft want to use these organizations \ninstead of directly going to the editorial boards of the New York Times \nor the Washington Post to badmouth the compact? The question does not \nneed me to provide the answer.\n  What would be the best attack--whether true or not--on the Compact \nthat might swing public opinion?\n  It might be to simply allege that milk prices are higher for children \nin the school lunch program. Who would the editorial boards more likely \nlisten to regarding school children: a public interest group or a \ntobacco company?\n  By the way, I would be happy to compare milk prices after the Compact \nwas fully implemented.\n  I would be pleased to compare retail milk prices in New England \nagainst retail milk prices in the Upper Midwest.\n  A GAO report, dated October, 1998, compared retail milk prices for \nvarious U.S. cities both inside and outside the Northeast compact \nregion for various time periods.\n  For example, in February 1998, the average price of a gallon of whole \nmilk in Augusta, ME, was $2.47. The price in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was \n$2.63 per gallon. Prices in Minneapolis, Minnesota, were much higher--\nthey were $2.94 per gallon.\n  Let's pick another New England city--Boston. In February 1998, the \nprice of a gallon of milk was $2.54 as compared to Minneapolis which \nwhere the price on average was $2.94/gallon.\n  Let's look at the cost of 1% milk for November 1997, for another \nexample.\n  In Augusta, Maine, it was $2.37 per gallon, the same average-price as \nfor Boston and for New Hampshire and Rhode Island. In Minnesota, the \nprice was $2.82/gallon. It was 45 cents more per gallon in Minnesota.\n  I could go on and on comparing lower New England retail prices with \nhigher prices in other cities for many different months. I invite \nanyone to review this GAO report. It is clear that our Compact is \nworking perfectly by benefitting consumers, local economies and \nfarmers.\n  I urge my colleague to vote against this bill because, as I mentioned \nyesterday, it does not provide enough disaster assistance to the East \nand it does not provide enough disaster assistance to the nation.\n  Also, I cannot vote for it because it does not extend the Northeast \ndairy compact and does not allow neighboring states to also \nparticipate.\n  It also ignores the pleas of Southern Governors who wanted to be able \nto protect their farmers without burdening U.S. taxpayers.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate is scheduled to \nvote on final passage of the fiscal year 2000 Department of \nAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations bill. It is critical that we complete \naction on this bill today to speed assistance to American farmers in \nneed. Therefore, I shall vote for the bill and urge my colleagues to \nsupport it also.\n  The severe drought that has gripped the Eastern United States this \nyear is, by all accounts, the most damaging and prolonged such \noccurrence since the early 1930s. Just like that period nearly 70 years \nago, springs have gone dry, streams have ceased to flow, pastureland \nand crops have broiled in the relentless Sun until all possible \nbenefits to livestock or man have burned away. In the 1930s the drought \nturned much of our Nation's farmlands into a veritable dust bowl. \nModern conservation practices today may have helped to reduce the \nerosion by wind,\n\n[[Page S12482]]\n\nbut the soil is just as dry, and farmers in West Virginia and all along \nthe East Coast are suffering from the natural disaster of a generation. \nSome farmers have had to make the painful decision to sell off their \nlivestock or to give up farms that have been in their families for \ngenerations. This is what has been happening in West Virginia. This is \nnothing short of an emergency. It demands our attention and response.\n  This bill provides funding for many ongoing and long running programs \nas well as much needed assistance to farmers who suffered at the hands \nof Mother Nature this year. The $8.7 billion emergency package that is \nattached to this appropriations bill contains $1.2 billion specifically \nfor 1999 natural disasters, including drought. In all, more than $1.2 \nbillion will be available for direct payments for farmers suffering \ncrop and livestock losses from natural disasters this year, up \nsignificantly from the $50 million in the version that first passed the \nSenate in August. That may not be enough to fully cover the still-\nmounting losses to farmers, but it is a good start. These emergency \nfunds will be able to be distributed upon enactment of this legislation \nto farmers who have been waiting and waiting for the Federal Government \nto deliver. American farmers cannot afford to wait any longer for \nFederal assistance, and the Senate cannot afford to delay final passage \nof this fiscal year 2000 Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report.\n  Unfortunately, once this measure reached the conference committee, \nthe process that we follow yearly as routine in conferences was \nsidelined. When difficult issues came before the conference, after only \nan evening and a morning of debate, the conference committee adjourned \nfor lunch, and never returned. For several days, the conference was \n``out to lunch,'' until deals could be reached behind closed doors \nguided by invisible hands, and our tried and true procedure was \ncircumvented. I believe that this selective bargaining is why some \nMembers have expressed their dissatisfaction with the final bill. The \nbest work of the Congress is demonstrated when, as a body, we cooperate \nand allow ourselves to be guided by the rules and the traditions that \nhave allowed our Government to flourish under the Constitution now for \nover 200 years.\n  I have stood before this body on numerous occasions since visiting \nWest Virginia with the Secretary of Agriculture on August 2 of this \nyear to impress upon my fellow Members what a significant impact the \ndrought has had in West Virginia, and, of course, in other Mid-Atlantic \nand Northeastern States. Many of these States received a secretarial \nemergency declaration that has provided some limited USDA assistance to \nfarmers who have experienced losses as a result of the drought. But, \nunfortunately, much of the assistance came in the form of loans to \nfarmers who were already deep in debt. The recent losses caused by \nHurricane Floyd make clear that more emergency assistance will be \nneeded. We can do better for farmers, so I supported the Statement of \nManagers language directing the administration to conduct full \nestimates of the remaining need, and to submit to the Congress a \nsupplemental budget request as soon as possible for both hurricane and \nadditional drought assistance.\n  When we consider all of the natural disasters that have affected \nfarmers this year, from frosts that killed citrus trees, to devastating \ndrought, to States ravaged by storms, and by the hurricane, I feel that \nit is highly appropriate that the Senate act now because it seems a \ncertainty that the $1.2 billion will be insufficient to help farmers \nwho have been harmed by nature. But the current emergency package \nattached to the conference report is essential to begin addressing the \ncrisis in rural America that has only been compounded by the weather \ndisasters of 1999. Failure to pass this measure will only allow the \nsuffering of struggling farmers to continue without relief.\n  The House of Representatives passed this measure on October 1, 1999. \nIt is now time for the Senate to pass this measure.\n  I want to thank Senator Cochran in particular for his study and \nconsideration and for the skill with which he has brought this bill to \nits present status. I want to thank him also for supporting some of my \nrequests in the bill.\n  I requested that there be grants to farmers, livestock farmers in \nparticular, in the amount of $200 million and also that there be \nprovisions whereby farmers could restore their land, where there could \nbe new vegetation planted so that they could have a chance of starting \nover again. It was in that conference that the chairman, in particular, \nsupported my effort.\n  I was one of the three Democrats on this side who signed the \nconference report, and did so in particular because of the funding \nwhich had been provided, at my request, for the livestock farmers. \nThere are livestock farmers in my State who were selling out their \nentire herds, not just for this year but for good. Some of those \nlivestock farmers have been in the farming business for years, and the \nfarm indeed has come down to them after one or more generations. It is \nimportant not only from the standpoint, I think, of helping these \npeople who are so in need and who have to work every day, 365 days a \nyear, who can never be sure what the weather is going to be, and who \nare at the mercy, in many instances, of Mother Nature--it is important \nthat we come to their aid--it is also important for our country that we \ncontinue to sustain the small farmer.\n  In the Roman Republic, the small farmers left their farms in the \nApennine Mountains and went into the cities and joined with the mob. \nWhen those farmers, those peasants of the land in Italy, left the land \nand migrated into the cities, the Roman republic began to collapse. It \nwas in the homes of the Roman farmers that family values and the Roman \nspiritual values flourished. When those peasants left the land, the \nspiritual values of the Romans began to deteriorate because it was in \nthe homes that they venerated their ancestors and worshipped their \ngods. They were pagan gods, but the Romans worshipped those gods.\n  Those family values, which included respect for authority and order--\nthere is where the stern Roman discipline had its beginning. It was \nbecause of that stern Roman discipline that came out of the homes of \nthe peasants--it was because of that stern Roman discipline that the \nRoman legions were able to conquer the various other nations around the \nMediterranean basin.\n  It was the same way in our own country in colonial days. Most of the \npeople in this country were from farming stock. There was a time when \nover 90 percent of the people in this country were from the farms. That \nday has long gone, as the corporate farms have largely taken over, just \nas in the Roman Republic, the latifundia--large corporate farms--which \nwere owned mostly by Roman senators, pushed the small farmers off the \nland.\n  I suppose Oliver Goldsmith had that in mind when he wrote ``The \nDeserted Village.'' In his lines, he told the story of the Roman \nfarmers as well as our own people.\n\n     Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey,\n     Where wealth accumulates, and men decay:\n     Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade;\n     A breath can make them, as a breath has made:\n     But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,\n     When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.\n\n  I thank all Senators for listening. I hope Senators will soon vote \nfor this important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia for his kind comments about the handling of the \nlegislation. I thank him for his valuable assistance in the crafting of \nthe language of our disaster assistance provisions and other provisions \nas well.\n  I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. \nCollins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the conference report on \nthe fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill. I do so with \nconsiderable reluctance because the distinguished senior Senator from \nMississippi, the subcommittee chairman, has always been so responsive \nto the needs of rural Maine. And the Senator, in his capacity as \nchairman, has provided valuable assistance to the State of Maine, \nparticularly in the area of agricultural research, which is very \nimportant to my State.\n\n[[Page S12483]]\n\n  Unfortunately, circumstances largely beyond the control of my good \nfriend from Mississippi have brought this measure before us without a \ncomponent that is absolutely critical to the survival of Maine's dairy \nfarmers. The lack of provisions reauthorizing the Northeast Dairy \nCompact creates a serious regional inequity and places an unfair burden \non Maine's dairy farmers.\n  While this measure contains $5.4 billion in payments for farmers \nharmed by low commodity prices, it ignores a mechanism that provides \nstability in pricing for dairy farmers in the Northeast. The Northeast \nDairy Compact is a proven success, and it is absolutely critical to the \nsurvival of dairy farmers in Maine and throughout the Northeast.\n  First approved by Congress as part of the 1996 farm bill, the \nNortheast Dairy Compact has a proven track record of benefits for both \nconsumers and farmers. The compact works by simply evening out the \npeaks and valleys in the fluid milk prices, providing stability to the \ncost of milk, and ensuring a supply of fresh, wholesome local milk.\n  The compact works with market forces to help both the farmer and the \nconsumer. As prices climb and farmers begin to receive a sustainable \nprice for their milk, the compact turns off. When prices drop to \nunsustainable levels, the compact is triggered on. The compact simply \nsoftens the blow to farmers of an abrupt and dramatic drop in the \nvolatile fluid milk market.\n  It is important to reiterate that consumers also benefit from the \ncompact. Not only does the compact stabilize prices, thus avoiding \ndramatic fluctuations in the retail cost of milk, but also it \nguarantees that the consumer is assured of the availability of a supply \nof fresh local milk. Let us remember that the proof is in the prices.\n  Under the compact, New England consumers have enjoyed lower retail \nfluid milk prices than many other regions operating without a dairy \ncompact. Moreover, the compact, while providing clear benefits to dairy \nproducers and consumers in the Northeast, has proven that it does not \nharm farmers or taxpayers in other regions of the country. Indeed, a \n1998 report by the Office of Management and Budget showed that during \nits first 6 months of operation, the compact did not adversely affect \nfarmers outside the compact region and added no Federal cost to \nnutrition programs. In fact, the compact specifically exempts WIC, the \nWomen, Infants, and Children's Program, from any costs resulting or \nrelated to the compact.\n\n  The reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact is also important \nas a matter of States rights. We often hear criticism of the inside-\nthe-beltway mentality that tells States that we here in Washington know \nbetter than they do, even on issues that traditionally fall under State \nand local control.\n  That is simply wrong. In the Northeast Dairy Compact, we have a \nsolution that was devised by our dairy farmers, that was approved by \nthe legislators and Governors of the New England States, that is \nsupported by every State agricultural commissioner in the region and \noverwhelmingly, if not unanimously, by the dairy farmers of the region. \nWe in Congress should not be an obstacle to this practical local \nsolution.\n  It is not too late. There are a variety of ways that Congress can \nallow dairy farmers in the Northeast to help themselves. All we need to \ndo is to reauthorize the compact and take advantage of those \nopportunities. I am very disappointed, however, that Congress is \nmissing the logical opportunity to renew this important measure through \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill. Therefore, I must oppose this \nconference report. But I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nresolve this matter before we adjourn.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Mississippi. He has been extremely \nresponsive to the needs of agricultural producers in my State. I know \nthat he shares my commitment to resolving this matter and coming to a \nsolution that will help our dairy farmers survive before we adjourn \nthis session of the Senate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back to the chairman any remaining \ntime I might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaine for her kind comments. We will certainly continue to do \neverything possible to be responsive to the needs of agricultural \nproducers both in New England and elsewhere in the country.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Jeffords.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the FY 2000 \nAgriculture Appropriations bill. I oppose the Agriculture funding bill \nnot because of what's in the bill, but because of what has been left \nout.\n  I have listened to several of my colleagues speak in support of the \ndisaster aid in this bill. They have spoken passionately on how we need \nto help our family farms. I, too, support providing relief to farmers \nand ranchers across the nation who have suffered from weather and \nmarket related disasters.\n  However, this bill has ignored one of this nation's most important \nagriculture sectors--our dairy farmers. The bill, which provides $8.7 \nbillion in aid to farmers, in large part as direct payments, has \nneglected dairy farmers, not only in my home state of Vermont, but the \ndairy farm families in the entire country.\n  Unlike the commodity farmers throughout the country, dairy farmers \nhave not asked for assistance in the form of federal dollars. Instead, \nthey have asked for relief from a promised government disaster in the \nform of a fair pricing structure from the Secretary of Agriculture and \nthe extension of the very successful Northeast Dairy Compact, at no \ncost to the federal government.\n  Mr. President, I would like to remind my colleagues from the states \nand regions of the country that will be receiving billions of tax payer \ndollars in aid for their farmers, that the Northeast Dairy Compact has \nno cost to the federal government and has no adverse impact on any \nfarmer outside the compact region.\n  If my colleagues who have opposed our efforts to bring fairness to \nall dairy farmers truly supported family farms across this country they \nwould support my efforts to help protect the dairy farmers in my state \nas well as the dairy farmers in the rest of the nation.\n  While Congress is providing needed government assistance to commodity \nfarmers across the nation, I would like to remind my colleagues on just \nhow well the Dairy Compact helps dairy farmers protect against sudden \ndrops in the price of their products.\n  This no cost initiative has given farmers and consumers hope. In \nlarge part based on the success of the Northeast Compact, which \nincludes the six New England states, no less than nineteen additional \nstates have adopted dairy compacts.\n  In total, twenty-five of the states in the country have passed \ncompact legislation. During the past year Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina, \nTennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Georgia, Kansas, and Missouri have \nall passed legislation to form a southern dairy compact. Texas is also \nconsidering joining the Southern Compact.\n  The Oregon legislature is in the process of developing a Pacific \nNorthwest Dairy Compact. In addition, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, \nNew York and Pennsylvania have passed state legislation enabling them \nto join the Northeast Dairy Compact.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact, which was authorized by the 1996 farm \nbill as a three-year pilot program, has been extremely successful. The \nCompact has been studied, audited, and sued--but has always come \nthrough with a clean bill of health. Because of the success of the \nCompact it has served as a model for the entire country.\n\n  One look at the votes cast by each state legislature, and you can see \nthat there is little controversy over what is in the best interest for \nthe consumers and farmers in each respected state. For example, in \nAlabama and Arkansas, both legislative chambers passed compact \nlegislation unanimously. It passed unanimously in the North Carolina \nHouse. In the Oklahoma State Senate, it passed by a vote of 44-1 and \nunanimously in the Oklahoma House. It passed unanimously in the \nVirginia State Senate and by a vote of 90-6 in the Virginia House. In \nKansas, the bill\n\n[[Page S12484]]\n\npassed in the Senate by a vote of 39-1 and an impressive 122-1 in the \nKansas House.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact was also approved on overwhelming votes \nin each of the New England state's legislative bodies.\n  Mr. President, given its broad support among the states, we all know \nthat the issue of regional pricing is one that will continue to be \ndebated. I am pleased with the tremendous progress the Southern states \nand other Northeastern states have made to move their compacts forward.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Cochran, Senator Specter and \nothers progress has been made.\n  While the debate continues, we must allow the Northeast Compact to \ncontinue as the pilot project for the concept of regional pricing.\n  I am, of course, aware that some of my colleagues oppose our efforts \nto bring fairness to our states and farmers by continuation of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact pilot project. However, why do Members who \nshare my admiration and respect for family farms oppose an initiative \nthat has no cost to the federal government and has no adverse impact on \nfarmers outside the region?\n  Unfortunately, Congress has been bombarded with misinformation from \nan army of lobbyists representing the national milk processors, led by \nthe International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and the Milk Industry \nFoundation. These two groups, backed by the likes of Philip Morris, \nhave funded several front groups such as Public Voice and the Campaign \nfor Fair Milk Prices to lobby against the Dairy Compact and other \nimportant dairy provisions.\n  The real fight over dairy compacts should not come from Members of \nthe Senate that support protecting small farms and consumers, but from \nthe National Milk Processors who work against all farmers to the \nbenefit of their bottom line, because they control the price now, and \nthat gives them higher profits. All we want is a fair price.\n  It is crucial that Congress debate the issues presented on dairy \ncompacts on the merits, rather than based on misinformation. When \nproperly armed with the facts, I believe you will conclude that the \nNortheast Dairy Compact has already proven to be a successful \nexperiment and that the other states which have now adopted dairy \ncompacts should be given the opportunity to determine whether dairy \ncompacts will in fact work for them as well.\n  Mr. President, federal dairy policy is difficult to explain at best. \nAs a Member of the House of Representatives, I served as the ranking \nmember of the Dairy and Livestock Subcommittee. During my years in the \nHouse, I worked very closely with the programs that impacted dairy \nfarmers and consumers. I know the industry, I know the policies, and \nthe compact is a raving success.\n  Of all the programs and efforts by the federal government to help our \nnation's dairy farmers and protect the interests of consumers, the most \neffective and promising solution I have seen thus far is the creation \nand operation of the Dairy Compact.\n\n  Unfortunately, many of my colleagues have not yet seen the benefit of \ncompacts and may be basing their reasons on misinformation.\n  In addition to being sound public policy, the Dairy Compact \nrepresents a state's right to do all it can under the law to protect \nits farmers and consumers.\n  The courts agree that the Compact is legally sound. Last January, a \nfederal appeals court rejected a challenge to the Dairy Compact by the \nMilk Industry Foundation. The Court found that the Compact was \nconstitutional and the U.S. Agriculture Secretary's approval of the \nCompact was justified.\n  In November of 1998, a Federal district court judge also ruled in \nfavor of the Compact Commission in a challenge brought by five New \nYork-based milk processors. The court found that the Commission had the \nauthority to regulate milk that is produced or processed outside of the \nregion but distributed within the Compact region. In each case, the \ncourts found that the work of the Commission is of firm and legal \ngrounds.\n  Mr. President, in recent weeks Governors from throughout the \nNortheast and Southeast sent a letter to the Majority Leader of the \nSenate and House, urging Congress to consider and support the Dairy \nCompact legislation.\n  The Governors of the Compact regions speak not only for their farmers \nand consumers but for the rights of the States. The message to Congress \nfrom Governors nationwide has been clear. ``Increase the flexibility of \nstates and support legislation that promotes state and regional policy \ninitiatives.''\n  Governors from the twenty-five Compact states represent diverse \nconstituents. They have all considered the benefits and potential \nimpacts by compacts on all those in their states. In the state of Rhode \nIsland for example, there are nearly six million consumers and only 32 \ndairy farmers. Yet, the dairy compact passed overwhelmingly in the \nRhode Island State legislature and is supported by the entire Rhode \nIsland delegation. A similar story is true for Massachusetts.\n  As I mentioned previously in my statement, nearly all the states \nsupported the Dairy Compacts overwhelmingly.\n  The success of the three year pilot program of the Northeast Dairy \nCompact, has created an opportunity for a partnership between Congress \nand the States, to help strengthen the fundamental federalism movement.\n  The New England states by joining together as one are doing what any \nlarge state can do under the law such as California. A large State can \ndo it. We can't because of the commerce clause. We have to join \ntogether and get a compact. We did that.\n  The reauthorization of the successful experimentation of the \nNortheast Compact and the creation of a Southern Compact as a pilot \nprogram will help maintain that the States' constitutional authority, \nresources, and competence of the people to govern is recognized and \nprotected.\n  Mr. President, the Compact also stands on firm constitutional \ngrounds. Does Congress possess the authority to approve the Northeast \nInterstate and Southern Dairy Compacts?\n  The answer to this question is clear, simple, and affirmative. Under \nthe Compact Clause of the United States Constitution, states are \nexpressly authorized to seek congressional approval of interstate \ncompacts, even states in the Upper Midwest. And congressional approval, \nonce given, endows interstate compacts with the force of federal law. \nThe Compact Clause, and the Compacts that Congress may license under \nit, are important devices of constitutional federalism.\n  Despite what some of my colleagues have said, the Northeast Dairy \nCompact is working as it was intended to. Instead of trying to destroy \nan initiative that works to help dairy farmers with cost to the federal \ngovernment, I urge my colleagues to respect the states' interest and \ninitiative to help protect their farmers and encourage that other \nregions of the country to explore the possibility of forming their own \ninterstate dairy compact.\n  For many farmers in Vermont and New England, the Compact payments \nhave meant the difference between keeping the farm and calling the \nauctioneer.\n  Dairy farming in Vermont represents over seventy percent of the \nagricultural receipts in the state. No other state relies on one sector \nof agriculture more than Vermont depends on dairy.\n  What we were trying to accomplish in the Agriculture Appropriations \nbill was about helping farmers and protecting consumers. Farmers \ndeserve our support and recognition. It is sometimes easy to forget \njust how fortunate we are in this country to have the world's least \nexpensive and safest food supply.\n  Dairy farmers work harder than many of us realize. The cows have to \nbe milked at least two times a day, 365 days a year; farmers work on \nthe average 90 hours per week, an average of 13 hours a day; farm \nowners receive an average hourly wage of $3.65, take few if any \nvacations or holidays and have no sick leave. That is why they are so \nsensitive to something which may destroy or reduce the prices.\n  Prices received by farmers in the month of October will be lower than \nthe prices received over 20 years ago. Can you imagine maintaining your \nlivelihood or business with salaries of 20 years ago? Think about what \nthat means to consumers also. The price of milk, if you look on an \ninflationary scale, is well below what it would be for softdrinks or \nanything else.\n\n[[Page S12485]]\n\n  I am certain that my colleagues will agree with me that dairy farmers \ndeserve a fair price for their product. What does it say about our \nvalues when some of the hardest working people, our farmers, are \nunderpaid and unappreciated? Mandating option 1-A and continuing the \ndairy compact ensures that dairy farmers will have the needed tools to \nhelp face the challenges of the future.\n  In Vermont, dairy farmers help define the character of the state. I \nam proud to work to protect them to protect the traditions and special \nqualities of the state. Dairy is not just a farming operation for \nVermont and other states in New England, it is symbol of our culture, \nhistory and way of life. Its survival is a highly emotional subject.\n  Vermonters take pride in their heritage as a state committed to the \nideals of freedom and unity. That heritage goes hand and hand with a \nunique quality of life and the desire to grow and develop while \nmaintaining Vermont's beauty and character. Ethan Allan and his Green \nMountain Boys and countless other independent driven Vermonters helped \nshape the nation's fourteenth state while making outstanding \ncontributions to the independence of this country.\n  Today, that independence still persists in the hills and valleys of \nVermont. Vermonters have worked hard over the years to maintain local \ncontrol over issues that impact the charm and quality of the state. \nVermont's decision to enhance and protect its wonderful scenic vistas \nby prohibiting bill boards along its highways and roads was a local, \nstatewide decision. Because of the vision Vermonters many years ago \nhad, driving throughout Vermont enjoying the beautiful landscapes and \nnature beauty is a pleasurable experience. And it would not be without \ncows on the hillside. Vermonters choose to control their state's \ndestiny. They should, as any other state have the right to protect \ntheir consumers, farmers and way of life.\n  Most Americans know Vermont as a tiny state in the Northeast that has \ngood skiing, great maple syrup, and beautiful fall foliage--a charming \nplace where the trees are close together and the people are far apart--\nfar from the problems that plague many communities across the country. \nIt is nearly impossible to drive down any country road in Vermont and \nnot pass a farm with a herd of cows. Dairy farms still define the nooks \nand crannies of the rolling hills. Maybe there's a small pond nearby \nand a few horses or sheep. Or maybe there's a pasture with bales of hay \nand cows lining up at the barn waiting for milking time.\n  The look of Vermont distinguishes it as a throwback to a bygone, \nsimpler time. Vermont is the home of stone fences, covered bridges, and \nred farmhouses. Vermonters have a special place in their hearts and \nlives for farmers.\n  Vermonters of today are struggling to keep step with the modern world \nwhile holding onto the state's classic rural charm and agriculture \nbase. It's a difficult task requiring much thought and work. But then \nagain, overcoming difficulties through hard work is what the native \nVermonter is all about. Farm families know all about hard work.\n  Mr. President, dairy farmers did not ask Congress for billions of \ndollars in disaster aid? Instead, and most appropriately, they asked \nCongress to provide them with a fair pricing structure and the right of \nthe states to work together at no cost to provide a structure that \nwould help them receive a fair price for their product--not a bail out \nfrom the federal government.\n  Therefore, I must oppose the Agriculture Appropriations bill and \nsuggest that Members whose farmers will be getting federal dollars in \ndisaster assistance take a close look at how the Northeast Dairy \nCompact helps protect farmers and consumers with no cost to the federal \ngovernment or any adverse impact on farmers outside the compact region.\n  I urge my friends to watch closely what is happening to dairy and to \ngive us the opportunity to continue to live in a beautiful State with \ncows on the hillside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment with the agriculture conference report that we in the \nSenate will vote on today. This agriculture appropriations bill falls \nwell short of helping the Connecticut farmers whose very livelihood was \nbadly hurt by this summer's record drought, and who are depending on \nour assistance to recover from the devastating losses they have \nsuffered. Instead, this plan simply leaves farmers throughout the \nNortheast even higher and drier, and leaves me no choice but to vote \nagainst this bill.\n  In August, I joined with Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman in \nvisiting a family farm in Northford to inspect the drought damage done \nin Connecticut this year. On that day, the Secretary declared the \nentire state a drought disaster area. Since then, it has been estimated \nthat farmers in our state have incurred losses of $41 million; \ntogether, the 13 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states estimate their \nlosses at $2.5 billion.\n  Sadly, despite strong bipartisan pleas for support, the agriculture \nappropriations bill shortchanges our state as well as the entire \nNortheast region. Of the $8.7 billion in ``emergency'' farm relief this \nbill provides, only $1.2 billion is available for natural disaster aid. \nThis smaller allocation of money must be distributed, in turn, to \nfarmers nationwide for drought, flood, and other natural disaster \ndamage. It is likely that the drought-stricken farmers of the Northeast \nand Mid-Atlantic states would receive only about $300 million--less \nthan one-eighth of their estimated recovery costs.\n  Historically, hard working Connecticut farmers benefit from very \nlittle federal assistance. During the last fiscal year, for example, \nConnecticut farmers received less than one-tenth of one percent of the \n$10.6 billion paid out by the government-funded Commodity Credit \nCorporation. It is only fair that when they need emergency recovery \nassistance, the government come through for Connecticut farmers too. \nSadly, this bill is not fair.\n  This agriculture spending plan is regionally inequitable, offers \ninsufficient disaster assistance for Connecticut farmers, and \nrepresents unacceptable public policy. In times of legitimate farm \ncrises, Congress has repeatedly provided a helping hand to farmers in \nthe Midwest and South. We owe nothing less to the farmers in \nConnecticut and throughout the Northeast who make a critical \ncontribution to our economy. They deserve real help, not a bill of \ngoods.\n  I am also concerned by the disappearance during conference of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact, which had been approved by the House of \nRepresentatives. Because the usual conference committee proceedings \nwere circumvented this year, it is impossible to know why the Dairy \nCompact is missing in action. Regardless of the answer to this \nquestion, the subversion of the conference committee process disturbs \nme and represents a bad precedent for our legislative process.\n  Because this bill does not provide real, equitable relief for \nConnecticut farmers and does not include reauthorization of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact, I will join my colleagues from the Northeast \nin voting against it. I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a matter that will severely \naffect milk producers and processors in my state of Arizona and impede \ntheir ability to compete effectively in the state of Nevada. Under the \nSecretary's final rule, Arizona and Clark County, Nevada, make up one \nof the 11 consolidated Federal Milk Marketing Order Areas. During \nconsideration of the Agriculture Appropriations bill, a provision was \nagreed to in the Senate by voice vote that attempted to remove Clark \nCounty, Nevada from this proposed order. I say attempted because the \ndrafting of this language was fatally flawed. It would not have \nachieved its intended goal of allowing Nevada to remove itself from the \nsystem. Of course, the Nevada Senators realized this mistake and moved \nto amend the language in conference. I notified the committee, both in \nwriting and orally, that I objected to any attempt to amend or modify \nthe Senate-passed language. Unfortunately, the language change sought \nby the Nevada Senators was approved, and is now found in Section 760 of \nthe Agriculture Appropriations bill of FY 2000.\n  Section 760 creates, for the first time in nearly 75 years of federal \nmilk-price\n\n[[Page S12486]]\n\nregulation, a category of milk handler which is statutorily exempt from \nmilk-price regulation. Anderson Dairy--the sole processor in Clark \nCounty--will gain a tremendous competitive advantage from this \nexemption at the expense of the Arizona dairy industry. Allowing \nAnderson to be removed from the Arizona/Nevada order will make it the \nonly milk processor with sales in Clark County that enjoys a regulatory \nexemption. But its competitors--such as the Arizona processors--will \ncontinue to be regulated on all Clark County sales, which make up \napproximately 20 percent of their market. In other words, Anderson will \nbe able to price its milk well below that of the Arizona processors who \nremain subject to the pricing structure of the milk-order system.\n  Moreover, this statutory exemption will extend to Anderson Dairy \nsales outside of Clark County. Anderson Dairy would, therefore, enjoy a \ncommercial advantage in its sales in Arizona while its competitors \nwould continue to be regulated on all such sales.\n  A good argument can be made in support of a milk industry that is \nfree from pricing regulations; however, that is not the case today. \nCompetitive equity has been the foundation of Federal Milk Orders for \nover one-half century. Under 7 U.S.C. 608(c)(5)(A), handlers are \nsubject to the same uniform classified prices as their competitors, and \nunder Sec.  608(c)(5)(B)(ii), revenue from handlers is pooled and \nblended so that producers may benefit from ``uniform prices'' \nirrespective of handler use of milk.\n  Section 760 of the FY 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill strikes at \nthe heart of each component of regulatory equity by exempting the Clark \nCounty handler from the uniform price and economic standards applicable \nto competitors within the order, and by excluding from the producer-\nrevenue pool all revenue from milk sales to the plant. For the plant \noperators in Arizona who continue to operate under price regulation, \ncompeting against an exempt plant such as Anderson is like fencing with \nyour sword arm tied behind your back. Anderson can exploit its \ncommercial advantage by expanding sales to current or prospective \ncustomers of nonexempt handlers. Such expansion would, in the end, \nseverely harm Arizona producers.\n  Mr. President, legislative exemption for Clark County plants should \ngreatly enhance Anderson's asset value for acquisition purposes. \nSeveral national and international dairy companies have aggressively \nexpanded their operations in the United States during the past few \nyears. These include Dean, Suiza, and Parmalat. A price-exempt plant in \nthe nation's fastest growing major metropolitan area would be very \nattractive to any expanding dairy enterprise. Should this occur, the \nproducers and processors in Arizona would be negatively impacted.\n  Having one state subject to the pricing structure of the milk-order \nsystem and another, contiguous state free to set its own price creates \nan uneven playing field. When Anderson is granted the right of removal \nfrom a system created to maintain stability and equity within that \nregion, we have effectively undermined the intent of that system.\n  Some 56 years ago, U.S. Appellate Judge Frank lamented that ``the \ndomestication of milk has not been accompanied by a successful \ndomestication of some of the meaner impulses in all those engaged in \nthe milk industry.'' Queensboro v. Wickard, 137 F. 2d 969 (1943). \nRegional preferences and exemptions will only fuel these cynical \nimpulses. I hope we can find a way to rectify this egregious situation \nand maintain a level playing field for the Arizona milk industry.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this \nconference report. The East Coast suffered through months of drought \nthis summer, causing enormous crop losses to our farmers. Then \nHurricane Floyd arrived with severe rains, further affecting farmers \nwith widespread floods.\n  These two acts of nature are serious emergencies affecting millions \nof people, yet this conference report does not do nearly enough for \nfarmers on the East Coast.\n  In my state of New Jersey, agriculture is a $1 billion a year \nbusiness involving 830,000 acres on over 8,000 farms. While in some \nmore rural states these statistics may not be significant on a relative \nbasis. But in a densely populated place like N.J. they are over-\npowering.\n  This summer's drought caused losses on 406,000 acres affecting 7,000 \nof those farms. All 21 counties in my state were declared drought \ndisaster areas. It has taken a truly devastating toll on our farm \ncommunity.\n  According to Secretary Glickman, the drought alone resulted in a \ntotal of $1.5 to $2 billion in damages throughout the Northeast and \nMid-Atlantic regions.\n  And now, we have the devastation of Hurricane Floyd on top of the \ndrought disaster. If any state has suffered a true farm disaster this \nyear--it's New Jersey as well as our neighbors in the northeast.\n  Unfortunately, although this conference report contains $8.7 billion \nin emergency assistance for farmers, only $1.2 billion of that is for \nweather related disasters. And this $1.2 billion is spread out over the \n50 states. That will not leave a fair share for New Jersey and other \nnortheastern states that actually suffered a disaster this year.\n  Numerous New Jersey farmers have been left with no hay, no crops and \nno livestock worth taking to market.\n  Without our help, the result of these disasters may force some \nfarmers to end decades of family farming and to give up the way of life \nthat they love.\n  This Congress must do more. The situation facing East Coast farmers \nis a true emergency, in every sense of the word. At a time when we are \nwatching entirely predictable activities like the census being declared \nemergencies, we are doing little to assist those who face true acts of \nGod.\n  I cannot support this conference report until the farmers in New \nJersey and up and down the East Coast receive the help they need.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I plan to cast my vote in favor of \nthe fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations conference report. I do \nso, however, with great disappointment in the final package crafted by \nthe Republican leadership. In short, I believe the conference report \ninadequately addresses the needs of our Nation's farmers, falls short \non lifting economically dangerous embargos, and has turned a usually \nbipartisan, open, and fair process into a backroom operation.\n  With that said, Mr. President, I cannot stand in the way of at least \nsome relief for to our struggling farmers and our fragile farm economy. \nThe Illinois Department of Agriculture estimates that $450 million from \nthe $8.7 billion agriculture relief package will directly benefit \nIllinois producers through receipt of 100 percent of their 1999 \nAgriculture Market Transition Act (AMTA) payments. This is in addition \nto the more than $450 million already received by Illinois farmers this \nyear to help them through this crisis.\n  The Illinois farm economy is in trouble. Farm income in Illinois \ndropped 78 percent last year to just over $11,000, the lowest in two \ndecades and down significantly from the $51,000 figure in 1997. Lower \ncommodity prices and record low hog prices, in particular, are \nprimarily to blame for this net farm income free fall in my home State.\n  The Illinois Farm Development Authority recently noted that the \nfinancial stress faced by Illinois farmers today is higher than it has \nbeen for 10 years. Activity in the Authority's Debt Restructuring \nGuarantee Program is four or five times higher today than last year. \nThe Authority approved 7 to 10 loans per month in 1998. In 1999, the \nAuthority has been approving 30-40 Debt Restructuring loans per month-a \n300-percent increase. This is a record level, unmatched since the 1986-\n87 farm crisis.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has predicted that prices for \ncorn, soybeans, and wheat will remain well below normal and that farm \nincome will again drop this year. Nationally, farm income has declined \nmore than 16 percent since 1996.\n  USDA is facing the largest farm assistance expenditure in its \nhistory. USDA processed 2,181 Loan Deficiency Payments LDPs in 1997, \nabout 2.1 million in 1998--a thousand times more, and will work through \na projected three million LDPs this year. Unfortunately, it appears \nthat this crisis will drag on for the foreseeable future, further \ndraining USDA's resources and reserves.\n  I served as a conferee on this bill. However, I never had the \nopportunity\n\n[[Page S12487]]\n\nto fully debate the disaster provisions or bring up important matters \nsuch as producer-owned livestock processing and marketing cooperatives. \nAlso, I find it unacceptable that the conference report excludes Cuba \nfrom the list of countries exempted from embargoes and sanctions for \nfood and medicine. The Senate voted overwhelmingly in August to include \nthe Ashcroft-Dodd provision in this bill. And Senate conferees insisted \non this important language. When it became clear that the House \nconferees were on the verge of agreeing to a food and medicine \nexemption for Cuba, the House Republican leadership shut down the \nconference and completed the outstanding issues behind closed doors.\n  I did not sign the conference report because I believe the process \nwas tainted--conferees were excluded from important final decisions. I \nhope this is never repeated. It undermines the credibility of the \nentire Congress.\n  Once the Senate acts on the conference report and sends it to the \nPresident, our role in helping to improve conditions in rural America \ndoes not end. We should vigorously explore other ways to help our \nNation's farmers and our rural economy. We should work on short-term \nremedies like additional targeted disaster assistance as well as long-\nterm solutions such as expanded trade opportunities--including ensuring \nthat agriculture has an equal seat at the table for the upcoming round \nof WTO talks, promotion of renewable fuels like ethanol, and tax \nfairness.\n  I hope the president will sign this bill quickly and then work with \nthe Congress to submit a supplemental request taking into account the \ndevastating financial crisis that continues in rural America. To delay \nfurther action on this matter would be a great disservice to the men \nand women who dedicate their lives to production agriculture.\n  Mr. ROCKFELLER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to comment on \nthe conference report and the crisis in agriculture that came to pass \nin my State of West Virginia during the historic drought of 1999.\n  I am happy that after seeming to be a forgotten issue for so long, \nthe necessity of emergency assistance for the victims of weather-\nrelated disasters has been included in the final bill that will be sent \nto the President. I commend the diligence of my colleague, the senior \nSenator from West Virginia, in working to ensure that this funding made \nit, and for working to include a specific mention of West Virginia's \nhorrible statewide drought in the final report language.\n  Earlier this year, I saw the devastation visited on my State by this \ndrought, and I vowed to do whatever I could to help West Virginia \nfarmers and producers. I probably have written or signed onto more \nletters about agriculture funding this year than in all my years in the \nSenate. I invited the Secretary of Agriculture to come out and see the \ndamage first-hand, and I walked along with him and Senator Byrd through \nthe parched fields of Mr. Terry Dunn, near Charles Town, West Virginia. \nFarmers from around West Virginia told us how terribly the drought was \nhurting them. Many of these people work their farms and another full-\ntime job, in hopes of keeping viable family farms that have passed down \nthrough four, five, and six generations.\n  I voted today to approve the conference report, although I believe \nthe amount of emergency assistance should have been much higher. I \nvoted for cloture because this money is needed, wherever it will \neventually go, as soon as it can be dispersed. I made the decision that \n``too little right now'' was better than ``too little, too late.''\n  I also realize that other, more divisive, issues have bogged down the \nconferees much more so than the prospect of providing a helping hand to \nstruggling agricultural producers in the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic, \nand Southeastern states. Actually, I am led to believe that some level \nof drought funding was among the least contentious issues, and that the \nconferees ultimately based their number on estimates provided by the \nSecretary of Agriculture.\n  Still, I remain troubled that the amount appropriated seems so low, \nand that emergency funding took so long to become a sure thing. I am \nmindful of the severe budget constraints under which they are \noperating, and the tense debates that have accompanied any attempt to \nappropriate emergency funding. But if the drought of 1999 was not a \nvalid emergency, when will we see one?\n  Another thing that I will never understand is how the U.S. Senate--\nincluding Senators whose own states have suffered the worst drought \ndamage since records were kept--could have voted down emergency funding \nwhen we originally debated this bill. I voted for the Democratic \npackage which lost, and now finds its way into the final report. \nAnother thing that troubles me is that while the conferees used \nSecretary Glickman's preliminary estimate of drought losses, they \ngrouped those losses together with losses incurred during the \ndevastation wrought by Hurricane Floyd, estimates of which exceed the \nemergency assistance in this bill by many billions of dollars, and did \nnot appropriate a more realistic sum.\n  Once again, I know the conferees have attempted to give guidance to \nUSDA in how this money should be distributed, and I look forward to an \nemergency supplemental appropriation that will allow for meaningful \nrehabilitation of the flood-ravaged agricultural areas of the Southeast \nand New Jersey. I hope, Mr. President, that if any such supplemental \nassistance is proposed, that there be included with it sufficient \nadditional funds for our many drought survivors as well.\n  I hope for this, because this drought might be the last straw that \nends the farming life as last for as many as ten percent of my state's \nsmall- and medium-sized farmers. Because of this terrible drought, it \nis estimated that West Virginia will suffer truly horrendous losses: As \nmuch as $89 million in cattle; half of our annual apple crop--for the \nworst yield since 1945; half of our corn; almost half of our soybeans; \nand nearly 90 percent of our new Christmas trees, a relatively new crop \nfor West Virginia farmers, but one that has allowed many family farms \nto remain in the family.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I once again applaud the efforts of my \ncolleague Senator Byrd for doing all that he could to see that our \nfarmers weather this crisis. And I call upon the rest of my colleagues \nto recognize that most farmers in the drought- and flood-ravaged \nportions of the eastern United States will need much more help, as soon \nas it can get to them.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \nfrustration with the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture Appropriations \nconference report before us today.\n  Two weeks ago, the Republican leadership pulled the plug on \nconference negotiations--and killed our prospect for comprehensive \nsanctions reform and additional assistance for agricultural communities \nhit by economic and natural disasters. When we look back at this first \nsession of the 106th Congress, I believe we will see that decision as \nan enormous missed opportunity.\n  Mr. President, Washington State is the most trade-dependent State in \nthe nation. And agriculture is one of its top exports. The growers in \nmy State need open markets. Many times, market access is closed or \nlimited because of the actions of foreign countries. We can and must \nfight to break down barriers erected by other nations.\n  We must also fight to break down the barriers to foreign markets \ncreated by our own government. Sanctions that include food and medicine \ndo not serve the interest of the United States, and they certainly do \nnot serve the interests of American producers. Oftentimes with the best \nof intentions, we have cut off all trade with states that sponsor \nterrorism, fail to live up to critical agreements, or refuse to share \nour principles of democracy.\n  Mr. President, we cannot and must not tolerate reprehensible actions \nby rogue states. But it is clear to me, and to 69 other Senators who \nvoted for sanctions reform, that we do not act in the best interests of \nAmerican foreign policy or American agricultural producers when we \nimpose unilateral food and medicine sanctions. The people in the world \nwe hurt most with unilateral sanctions are American growers.\n  The Senate sanctions reform package was a huge step in the right \ndirection. It deserves to become law. Wheat growers in my State deserve \naccess to Iran,\n\n[[Page S12488]]\n\nwhich was once our largest export market for soft white wheat. And pea \nand lentil growers deserve access to Cuba, a market valued at more than \n$17 million. In both of these cases, our foreign competitors have \nstepped into the market vacuum created by U.S. sanctions policy.\n  The Administration started sanctions reform earlier this year. I \napplaud those efforts--belated as they were. I also applaud those in \nthe Senate who worked so hard for passage of the Ashcroft-Dodd \namendment. But now the Republican leadership has sent the message to \nour foreign competitors that they can continue to conduct business as \nusual--that U.S. growers will not soon be players in markets like Iran \nand Cuba.\n  After hearing for years from some Republicans that the Administration \nlacked the will to reform our nation's outdated and ineffective \nsanctions policies, the Republican leadership proved it could not lead \nAmerican agriculture into the 21st century. Too many of our producers \nalready have empty wallets and empty bank accounts, and--in response--\nCongress delivered empty rhetoric on sanctions reform.\n  In September, I met with representatives of the Washington \nAssociation of Wheat Growers, the Washington State Farm Bureau, and the \nWashington Growers Clearing House. I expressed my strong support for \nthe sanctions reform package and my hope that some agreement could be \nreached between the Senate and House. I did not count on the procedural \nmaneuvering that doomed the sanctions package. Our growers deserved a \nbetter process and a better outcome.\n  Mr. President, in a perfect world this bill would include sanctions \nreform. Its emergency provisions would include more money for specialty \ncrops, additional funding for the Market Access Program, and increased \nSection 32 money for USDA purchases of fruits and vegetables. It would \ninclude more resources for farm worker housing and Natural Resource \nConservation Service conservation operations.\n  On the subject of minor crops, I would like to discuss the plight of \napple growers in my state. The apple industry in particular is in the \nthroes of the economic conditions as bad as anyone can remember. Poor \nweather has played a role, but more important are the economic factors.\n  Apple juice dumping by China has removed the floor price for apples. \nChinese apple juice concentrate imports increased by more than 1,200 \npercent between 1995 and 1998. I was pleased to sponsor a letter with \nSenator Gorton, signed by a total of 21 Senators, to Commerce Secretary \nDaley urging the administration to find that Chinese dumping is \ndestroying our growers and to impose stiff retroactive duties. Weak \nAsian markets and high levels of world production have contributed \ngreatly to the terrible economic situation in central Washington State.\n  As a result, many small family farms that grow some of the best fruit \nproduced in the world are going out of business. Many of these are not \nmarginal producers. They are efficient growers whose families have been \ngrowing high quality apples and pears and other commodities for \ngenerations.\n  As in other parts of rural America, the communities that rely on tree \nfruit production for their economic base are reeling. It is hard to \ndiversify when your economic foundation is crumbling. It is estimated \napproximately 20 percent of Washington apple growers will lose their \nfarms in the next three years. And that is a conservative estimate. \nOver the August recess, I met with community leaders in north central \nWashington State. Okanogan County alone has experienced $70 million in \nlosses in the tree fruit industry leading the county to declare an \neconomic disaster.\n  Language in the conference report directs the Farm Service Agency to \nreview all programs that assist apple producers, and review the limits \nset on operating loan programs used by apple growers to determine \nwhether the current limits are insufficient to cover operating \nexpenses. I urge FSA to complete this review as soon as possible so \nthat those of us who represent apple producing states can improve the \nFederal Government's assistance to our growers.\n  The conference bill before us provides $1.2 billion in disaster \nassistance. The report language for that section of the bill mentions \nthe plight of apple growers and urges the USDA to address the problem. \nHowever, let's be clear that it will be very difficult for my state's \napple producers to get meaningful assistance through this bill. Simply \nput, this bill is not a victory for apple growers or their communities.\n  In the future, some of my colleagues may criticize the Secretary of \nAgriculture for not recognizing the critical need in apple country and \nfailing to deliver assistance. Earlier this year, August Schumacher, \nUnder Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, came to \nWashington State to hear from apple growers. I know the administration \nunderstands the needs of growers in my State. But the administration \ncan't realistically address the needs of growers all over the country \nwith only $1.2 billion. Nevertheless, I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to direct aid to apple growers in Washington State.\n  I believe this Congress needs to accept responsibility for the \nshortcomings in the bill. The Republican leadership certainly bears \ncomplete responsibility for the unacceptable manner in which this bill \nwas taken out of the hands of congressional appropriators in the middle \nof conference negotiations.\n  Mr. President, while this bill is flawed, it is still a step in the \nright direction. I intend to vote for the conference report. Although \nwe didn't do it two weeks ago, we must send the message this week that \nCongress will try to reestablish opportunity in rural America.\n  I will vote for this bill because it provides emergency assistance to \nmany of our farmers and ranchers. It funds research, including new \npositions for potato and temperate fruit fly research that are critical \nto minor crop producers in my state. It delivers a nearly $52 million \nincrease for programs in President Clinton's Food Safety Initiative, \nincluding $600,000 for research into listeriosis, sheep scrapie, and \novine progressive pneumonia virus (OPPV) at ARS facilities in Pullman, \nWashington and in DuBois, ID. It provides critical funding for WIC and \nother feeding programs, and for P.L. 480.\n  Mr. President, I was tempted to vote ``no'' on this conference \nreport. But just as I believe the Republican leadership should have \nembraced responsibility on sanctions reform, I believe voting to pass \nthis conference report is the most responsible approach. It is my \nsincere hope the Senate will pass sanctions reform and other \nlegislation to provide greater economic security to communities that \nrely on agriculture before the end of this session.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for a \nprovision by Senator Ashcroft included in the Senate version of the \nAgricultural Appropriations Act for FY2000. This provision passed with \n70 votes in the Senate but it was subsequently stripped out of the \nconference report after the conference stalled and never reconvened.\n  The Ashcroft provision is simple. It substantially curtails the use \nof unilateral sanctions of food and medicines without removing them \nabsolutely from the palette of foreign policy options. If the President \ndecided to include food and medicine in future sanctions, he would have \nto receive the approval of Congress, through an expedited procedure.\n  Mr. President, American farmers have spoken and they want help. In \nthe past year, cotton prices have tumbled 46 percent and wheat is down \nmore than 60 percent. Corn sells for as low as $1.50 for a bushel in \nsome places. It is not surprising that net farm income dropped almost \none billion dollars between 1996 and 1998. Storms and drought have \ndestroyed our Nation's crops. We must help our struggling farmers out \nof this crisis.\n  The farmers in my home State of Arkansas have made it clear to me \nthat one measure needed to help them out of the current crisis is an \nexpansion of export markets. Indeed, our farmers are missing out on \nmillions of dollars in exports each year. It is estimated that \nagricultural sanctions have robbed U.S. farmers out of an estimated ten \npercent of the world wheat market and half a billion dollars in sales. \nBefore agricultural sanctions were placed on Cuba in 1963, that country \nwas the largest U.S. export market\n\n[[Page S12489]]\n\nfor rice, taking more than 50 percent of total rice exports. Even \ntoday, American farmers are losing out to farmers in Canada, Europe, \nand Asia who sell $600 million worth of food products to Cuba.\n  While President Clinton issued an executive order in April of this \nyear allowing food and medicine sales to Sudan, Libya, and Iran, these \nsales would still face significant restrictions. Sales would be \nlicensed on a case-by-case basis and made only to non-governmental \nentities. In some cases, where there are no non-governmental entities \nbuying food for the people, no sales could be made.\n  It is true that the regimes that are sanctioned from food and \nmedicine, including the governments of the Sudan, Libya, Iran, Iraq, \nand Cuba, are reprehensible. But we must also consider the populations \nof the these countries--people with whom we have no argument, people \nwho are starving, people who are sick because they do not have enough \nfood or medicine. While governments may intentionally withhold food and \nmedicine from their populations, both to foster anti-American sentiment \nand to keep the people under subjection, we benefit no one by denying \nour farmers the opportunity to sell their crops. If we allow these \nsales--if we rein back our food and medicine sanctions, then we leave \nthese regimes without an excuse for not providing their people with \nfood. We close off a channel of resentment and make clear to people \nliving under repression that their government is solely responsible for \nleaving them hungry. And we leave these governments with less money for \nweapons. Senator Ashcroft's provision accomplishes all of these things.\n  Mr. President, I am not arguing for a provision that has been \ndefeated and will never reappear. Let me say again that the Senate \npassed this provision with 70 votes. I am confident that it will \nadvance this legislation favorably again.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, Chairman Cochran and his staff have done a \nhighly commendable job of crafting a bill to help agriculture in these \ntough times. Important funding is included in the bill for agricultural \nresearch, nutrition programs, natural resource programs, food safety, \nexport enhancement, rural development, and marketing and regulatory \nprograms. I am exceptionally pleased with the funding that will go to \nMontana to carry out important agricultural research and promote rural \ndevelopment.\n  Times are tough in agriculture. In Montana, thousands of farmers and \nranchers are experiencing a severe price crunch. Commodities simply are \nnot bringing the prices agricultural producers need to break even. Now \nis an essential time to provide producers opportunities for \ndiversification and increased marketing opportunities. Times are tough \nand times are changing.\n  The Federal Government has the opportunity to provide agricultural \nproducers with enhanced options for marketing. We can do that through \nfunding for agricultural research and rural development and policy \nchanges for sanctions reform, country-of-origin labeling, rescission of \nthe USDA grade, balance of trade laws, and price reporting.\n  I am extremely pleased with the inclusion, at my request, of \nreporting in this bill. Mandatory price reporting is a milestone for \nlivestock producers. For too long there has been too much mistrust \nbetween agricultural producers and meat packers. Four major packers \ncontrol 79 percent of the meat-packing industry. Many producers raising \nand feeding livestock feel that packers can control the market by not \nproviding data on either the number of cattle they buy or the prices \nthey pay for it. The USDA collects the information voluntarily. This \nlegislation mandates that packers will provide that data twice daily \nand make it easily accessible to ranchers.\n  Mandatory price reporting provides Montana producers with all the \npertinent information they need to make the best possible marketing \ndecision. It means that a Montana rancher can check the daily markets. \nThey will have the necessary data to make the decision to sell their \nlivestock immediately or hold out for a better price. A five cent \nincrease in the market can mean an extra $30 per animal. On a 300-head \noperation that means an extra $9,000. To those experiencing the best \neconomic times in years, $9,000 doesn't seem like much. I can tell \nyou--to a rancher who hasn't met the cost-of-production in three or \nfour years, any amount of money in the black looks pretty good.\n  Lately ranchers have not had the money even to buy necessities for \noperating expenses. Due to the nature of the business and risks \ninvolved, farmers and ranchers are used to utilizing credit and \noperating loans. However, this economic crisis has bankers and rural \nbusiness worried. Main Street Rural America is hurting too. Producers \nmaking knowledge-based marketing decisions helps everybody. It helps \nagricultural producers--and it helps rural communities who depend on \nagriculture for their livelihood.\n  Kent and Sarah Hereim own a 300-head operation between Harlowton and \nJudith Gap, MT. Nine thousand dollars means to them a new computer. \nThat gives them even more accessibility to marketing information and \nthe ability to make better marketing decisions. A computer provides \naccess to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade \nfor futures marketing options. It provides an updated mechanism to pay \nbills and keep spreadsheets on operating expenses. A computer can be a \nvaluable tool for ranchers to keep production records, carcass data, \ngrazing plans, and other management information. These records allow \nproducers to be better managers and increase profits.\n  Nine thousand dollars can mean a new bull in addition to the \ncomputer. Buying better seedstock increases genetic capability and \nproduces better animals. Increase in quality increases profit. More and \nmore emphasis is being placed on paying producers on a grid. Paying on \na grid means ranchers are paid on the quality of their animals not \nmerely the number of pounds. This gives producers who strive for better \ngenetics and meat quality a clear advantage.\n  Rural communities win too. An extra $9,000 helped the local computer \nstore and it helped others in the industry. That new bull Kent and \nSarah bought helps the seedstock (bull) producer who now has extra \nmoney to buy fencing supplies from the local agricultural supply store. \nThe owner of that ag supply store now has extra money for Christmas \ngifts at the local clothing store. That clothing store owner puts extra \nmoney in a CD at the bank. In a rural community a dollar turning over \nmakes a world of difference.\n  This example is why it is so important to put control back in the \nhands of the livestock producer. It is exceedingly important to \nproducers to have an assurance that they are receiving timely and \naccurate data. It doesn't make sense for those raising the commodity to \nbe a passive price-taker. Having the information readily accessible \nputs the rancher in a position to make good marketing decisions and not \nbe left fully at the mercy of the buyer.\n  In Montana, livestock outnumber people by at least twice. These are \nless than a million people in Montana and over 2.5 million head of \nlivestock. Sixty-four percent of the land in Montana is used for \nagricultural production. Livestock producers depend on the livestock \nmarkets for their livelihood. Mandatory price reporting gives them that \ndata and the controls to use it.\n  Also important to livestock producers is the Sheep Industry \nImprovement Center. This center, which is located at USDA, has a $30 \nmillion budget to assist the sheep and goat industries in research and \neducation.\n  I realize that no long-term solution will work until this current \neconomic crisis is taken care of. This bill goes a long way in getting \nproducers back on their feet and on the way to a better agricultural \nsector. Immediate funding needs of farmers and ranchers are addressed \nin a manner that will give them an opportunity to get back on track.\n  The $8.7 billion package contains important funding for Agricultural \nMarketing Transition Act (AMTA) payments for wheat and barley producers \nin Montana, as well as $322 million for livestock producers and $650 \nmillion in crop insurance.\n  I am pleased that important language for durum wheat producers was \nincluded in the bill. Before this change, the method for calculating \nloan deficiency payments (LDP) repayments unfairly presumed a high \nquality for\n\n[[Page S12490]]\n\ndurum, which resulted in a lower repayment rate for their crop. \nHowever, as a result of this language, the USDA has agreed to correct \ninequities in the current loan deficiency program (LDP) program for \ndurum wheat.\n  The crop insurance portion of the bill will provide $400 million to \nprovide agricultural producers with a premium discount toward the \npurchase of crop insurance for the 2000 crop year. Currently, farmers \nwould pay a higher premium for the year 2000 than for 1999 or 2001. \nWith the lowest prices in years, agricultural producers cannot afford \nhigher premiums.\n  I am disappointed that sanctions reform was taken out of the bill. I \nbelieve these concerns must be addressed as soon as possible. I will \nsupport Senator Ashcroft in his efforts to exempt food and medicine \nfrom sanctioned countries. American farmers and ranchers stand much to \nlose by not having all viable markets open to them.\n  Imposing trade sanctions hurts American farmers and ranchers. \nSanctions have effectively shut out American agricultural producers \nfrom 11 percent of the world market, with sanctions imposed on various \nproducts of over 60 countries. They allow our competitors an open door \nto those markets where sanctions are imposed by the United States. In \ntimes like these our producers need every available marketing option \nopen to them. We cannot afford lost market share.\n  Trade sanctions are immoral. Innocent people are denied commodities \nwhile our farmers and ranchers are denied the sale to that particular \ncountry. It is my sincere hope that my colleagues will see fit to open \nup more markets by supporting Senator Ashcroft.\n  Farmers and ranchers must be provided a fighting chance in the world \nmarket, and the people of sanctioned countries must be allowed access \nto agricultural commodities.\n  Again, I thank the fine chairman Mr. Cochran, and his staff, for all \ntheir work on this bill. I will continue to fight for Montana farmers \nand ranchers and provide a voice for agriculture.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the conference \ncommittee on H.R. 1906, the Agricultural appropriations bill for FY \n2000 included a legislative rider sponsored by Senator McConnell that \nwould fundamentally change the H-2A temporary foreign agricultural \nworker program.\n  I am concerned that the McConnell rider would be harmful to both \nforeign and domestic farm workers. The McConnell rider would \nessentially allow agribusinesses to import as many H-2A foreign guest \nworkers as they want, regardless of whether there are workers here in \nAmerica who want those jobs.\n  That would be harmful to the U.S. farm workers who want the jobs, \nobviously. But it would also be harmful to other farm workers, who \nwould then have to compete with more easily exploitable foreign labor. \nAnd I believe it would not be good for the guest workers themselves, \nwho would have few of the protections and benefits to which Americans \nare entitled.\n  The Administration opposes the McConnell rider. So does the U.S. \nCatholic Conference, the National Council of La Raza, the Farmworker \nJustice Fund, and the United Farm Workers. The McConnell rider also \nflatly contradicts the recommendations of the General Accounting \nOffice.\n  Let me take a moment to describe how the H-2A foreign guest worker \nprogram works, and maybe that will help explain what the McConnell \nrider does. The H-2A program allows agricultural employers to import \nforeign workers on a temporary basis, but only when there is a shortage \nlocally of available U.S. workers. The Labor Department has to issue a \nlabor certification that there is a shortage of available U.S. workers. \nBut before employers can get that certification from the Labor \nDepartment, they have to recruit U.S. workers during a period of 28 to \n33 days.\n  The McConnell rider would substantially shorten the period during \nwhich agricultural employers have to recruit U.S. workers. Under \ncurrent law, the recruitment period is 28 days, though it can be \nextended to 33 days if employers have to refile their application. The \nMcConnell rider would shorten the recruitment period to 3 days, with a \n5-day extension for refiling. The recruitment period would shrink from \n28 days to three days.\n  Three days! Does anyone think any kind of meaningful recruitment is \ngoing to take place in a period of three days? Of course not. \nShortening the recruitment period to three days would turn the labor \ncertification process into a sham and a charade. The result would be \nthat U.S. farmworkers who want those jobs wouldn't be able to get them, \nand employers would have almost automatic access to cheap, exploitable \nforeign guest workers.\n  GAO agrees that shortening the recruitment period to three days would \nundermine the labor certification process. A December 1997 GAO report \nlooked at this very proposal and found that ``employers will not have \nsufficient time to meet their duties as required by the program and \ndomestic workers will not have ample opportunity to compete for \nagricultural employment.''\n  The issue here is whether we should make the deplorable working \nconditions of farmworkers in this country even worse, because that \nwould be the effect of the McConnell rider. I don't think my colleagues \nreally want to do that.\n  Given the--frankly--miserable working conditions that many farm \nworkers have to endure, I think it would be unconscionable for us to \nadd to their burdens. Farm workers don't have a lot of power. They \ndon't have a lot of economic power, and they don't have a lot of \npolitical power. They don't have a lot of money to contribute to \npolitical campaigns. You don't see a lot of farm worker faces among the \nlobbying groups that visit our offices.\n  Yes, there are some people who advocate on their behalf--groups like \nthe U.S. Catholic Conference, National Council of La Raza, the \nFarmworker Justice Fund, the UFW. But farmworkers are largely \ndisenfranchised and disempowered. Ultimately, they are dependent on our \ngood will. I hope we can show a little good will towards people who \ndon't have much leverage over us, but people who are very decent and \nhardworking and deserve better.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the agriculture \nappropriations conference report. First, I thank the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator \nCochran and Senator Kohl, for their hard work on this legislation. They \nfaced multiple challenges in trying to find funds for so many different \nand critical areas within agriculture.\n  I support this bill, Mr. President. I support it because it will help \nprovide some immediate relief to our farmers, who, in many states, are \nfacing a twin blow from drought and low commodity prices. I know that \nin my home state of Ohio--where agriculture is the number one \nindustry--many of our farmers are in serious financial trouble. When \nyou're getting hit from both drought and low commodity prices, it \nreally hurts.\n  I am pleased that the bill we will send to the President today will \ntake an important step toward helping agriculture producers overcome \nsome of the current problems resulting from this summer's drought and \nlow commodity prices. For example, the conference report includes $5.54 \nbillion in emergency assistance for Agricultural Market Transition Act \npayments (AMTA). This amount will double producers' AMTA payments for \n1999 crops. Also, the bill enables farmers to receive AMTA payments at \nthe beginning of the fiscal year rather than in two installments. This \nis very important for many of Ohio's farmers who are struggling right \nnow to make ends meet. The Senate should get this bill to the President \nas quickly as possible. Our farmers need relief now--not later.\n  This summer has brought with it one of the most prolonged periods of \ndrought in this century. I have talked to many farmers back home and \nhave driven along the highways and back roads in Ohio--you can see how \nthis summer's drought has severely stunted the growth of corn and other \nkey crops. It's devastating. And this devastation is widespread. \nSecretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman has designated all but one of \nOhio's eighty-eight (88) counties as natural disaster areas. Of those, \nSecretary Glickman designated sixty-six (66) counties as primary \ndisaster areas.\n  According to the Governor of Ohio, our state's farmers are expected \nto lose\n\n[[Page S12491]]\n\n$600 million in income due to the drought. Let me repeat that, Mr. \nPresident. In Ohio, our farmers stand to lose $600 million. When \ncombined with the current low commodity prices, it is no wonder that \nmany farmers in Ohio are asking themselves--and us--how they and their \nfamilies are going to make it.\n  In response, the bill we will send to the President today provides \napproximately $1.2 billion--to assist farmers plagued by the drought. \nIt's a decent start. But, while this assistance will surely help lessen \nthe immediate financial worries of many of our drought-stricken \nfarmers, it doesn't address a fundamental issue here--and that is that \nour farmers aren't equipped to withstand cyclical economic downturns \nand natural disasters over which they have no control. As I see it, we \nhave failed to give agriculture producers the tools they need, over the \nlong-term, to manage risks--whether those risks come from the market or \nnature. There are things that we, in Congress, are trying to do to help \nget to the root of the challenges facing our farmers today. Let me \nexplain.\n  The United States is the most open market in the world. While our \nfarmers are the most productive in the world, market barriers against \nthe free and fair trade of our agriculture products exist. Dismantling \nthese barriers must be a top priority. Congress can help by giving the \nPresident fast track authority to negotiate trade agreements. Fast \ntrack authority would allow the Administration to enter into trade \nagreements with other countries, where we are the most competitive and \nto negotiate with specific regions of the globe.\n  Failure to pass fast track puts our farmers at a serious disadvantage \nwith global competitors. For instance, the Latin America and Carribean \nregion offers great opportunities for increased agriculture exports. It \nis one of the fastest growing markets for U.S. exports and will exceed \nthe European Union as a destination for U.S. exports by next year. This \nmarket is expected to exceed both Japan and the European Union combined \nby the year 2010. Other nations already are working to break down \nbarriers in this region. The United States cannot afford to sit on the \nsidelines--just watching--much longer. We need to get into the game. \nThat would help our farmers.\n\n  When our foreign trading partners are not trading by international \nrules, and doing so to the detriment of our farmers, our trade \nauthorities should use all the tools available to them. For example, I \nintroduced bipartisan legislation, the ``Carousel Retaliation Act,'' \nwhich would increase pressure on our trading partners to comply with \nWorld Trade Organization rules by requiring the U.S. government to \nrotate targets every six months.\n  What's happening is that our nation--and especially our farmers--are \nbeing injured by the refusal of some foreign countries to comply with \nWorld Trading Organization (WTO) Dispute Settlement rulings. \nNoncompliance with Dispute Settlement rulings severely undermines open \nand fair trade. As many of our farmers, cattle ranchers, and large and \nsmall business owners know firsthand, this is having a devastating \nimpact on their efforts to maintain or gain access to important \ninternational markets.\n  The ``Carousel Retaliation Act'' would help ensure the integrity of \nthe WTO Dispute Settlement by rotating--or carouseling--the retaliation \nlist of goods to affect other goods 120 days from the date the list is \nmade and every 180 days, thereafter. Currently, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative has the authority to carousel retaliation lists, but is \nnot required to do so.\n  The Carousel bill requires the U.S. Trade Representative to rotate \nand revise the retaliation list so that countries violating WTO Dispute \nSettlements cannot merely subsidize the affected industries to recover \nfrom retaliation penalties. American farmers are the most efficient and \ncompetitive in the world. When given the opportunity to compete on \nequal footing, they will be the most successful, as well.\n  Besides opening new markets abroad, there are things we can do here \nat home to help our farmers prosper under the Freedom to Farm Act we \npassed three years ago. I cosponsored legislation that would allow \nfarmers to open savings accounts into which they can place--tax free--a \ncertain percentage of their profits during good economic times. These \nfunds can remain in their accounts for up to five years. If hard times \ncome along--as we know they do--farmers can withdraw funds from their \naccounts. The only time these funds would be taxed is when they are \nwithdrawn from the account or after five years.\n  This bill, the Farm and Ranch Risk Management (FARRM) Act, was \nincluded in the $792 billion tax-relief package that I supported and \nCongress passed. That tax relief package had many other provisions \nhelpful to farmers. Besides the FARRM provision, the bill included the \nelimination of estate taxes, broad-based tax relief, the elimination of \nthe marriage penalty, and the full deductibility of health insurance \nfor the self-employed. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed this \nreasonable tax relief package--that doesn't help our farmers.\n  Most important, we should get the federal government off the backs of \nour farmers so they can have the freedom to do what they do better than \nany other country--and that's produce. I have cosponsored the \nRegulatory Fairness and Openness Act, which would require the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency base pesticide use decisions on sound \nscience rather than worst-case scenarios. Also, I have cosponsored \nlegislation that would require the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration (OSHA) to base any ergonomic standards on sound science.\n  Mr. President, our farmers need assistance--the kind that is provided \nthrough the agriculture appropriations bill and the kind of assistance \nthat comes from pursuing trade and tax policies that would further the \neconomic strength and freedom of American agriculture.\n  I urge the President to sign the appropriations bill immediately so \nthat farmers in Ohio--and throughout the country--can receive short-\nterm relief as quickly as possible. I also urge the President to take a \nlong, hard look at how we can give our farmers the kind of lasting \nrelief they need to stay in business not just this year, but for \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr President, I rise today to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues the plight of our nation's farmers. Now, one might ask, \nwhat is a Senator from Rhode Island doing speaking about farming? Isn't \nthat usually handled by Members from the Midwest? Well, Mr. President, \nthat is not the case. Farming is alive at our nearly 700 farms in Rhode \nIsland. However, these same family farmers in Rhode Island and those \nacross the nation are looking to Congress for some much needed help in \nthe wake of this summer's horrible weather conditions.\n  Today, the Senate will be asked to vote on final passage of the \nconference report on the Fiscal Year 2000 Department of Agriculture and \nrelated agencies appropriations bill. This bill is just one of the \nthirteen spending bills which Congress must approve and the President \nmust sign before the beginning of the new fiscal year. This is a major \nbill which funds many important farming and environmental programs. \nHowever, I must reluctantly vote against final passage of this report \nfor two reasons.\n  During the debate on the bill earlier this year, farmers in the \nNortheast and Mid-Atlantic were in the middle of what would become one \nof the worst droughts in the history of this region. In fact, the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that Rhode \nIsland experienced its driest growing season in 105 years of \nrecordkeeping. As a result, crop damages were widespread. According to \nthe Farm Service Agency in my state, crop losses ranged from 35 percent \nto an astounding 100 percent. These losses created a terrible financial \nburden on the farmers in Rhode Island, as well as the entire state \neconomy.\n  In response to these problems, as well as those experienced by \nfarmers across the country, the Senate approved a $7.4 billion \nemergency relief package, and I was glad to support it. In the House, \nno such funding existed. However, as the difficulties worsened and the \nneed for additional funding was necessary, I was committed to making \nsure that our family farms in Rhode Island would not be left out of the \npot. To that end, I pressed for direct assistance to specifically \naddress drought damage in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. As everyone \nknows the 1999 drought knew no state barriers or boundaries. Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle knew that\n\n[[Page S12492]]\n\nmaking this a partisan issue would not make federal assistance for our \nfarmers come any quicker. We needed to help our farmers and farming \nfamilies to start the process of rebuilding for new crops and a new \nseason.\n  In the end, an additional $1.2 billion was allocated for assistance \nto farmers across the country who have incurred losses for crops \nharvested or intended to be planted or harvested in 1999. The key word \nin that sentence is ``across the country.'' In the Northeast and Mid-\nAtlantic alone, damage assessments range from $2 to $2.5 billion. \nHowever, this additional money will not go directly to those farmers in \nthe Northeast and Mid-Atlantic that need it the most. Instead, the \nmoney will be available to all farmers who have suffered from flooding, \nHurricane Floyd, and the drought. This certainly is not sufficient \nfunding for our region's family farmers.\n  I also must vote against this conference report because of its \nfailure to include language that extends the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact. This is an issue that has the support of a majority of the \nSenators in this body. In fact, during debate on the agriculture \nspending bill, a majority of Senators--53 to be exact--voted to end a \nfilibuster on the dairy compact issue.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Compact was a state-generated \nresponse to the decline in the New England dairy industry over the last \ndecade. In the early 1990s, all six New England states approved \nidentical legislation to enter into the Compact. Congress approved the \nCompact as part of the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill.\n  Due to the unique nature of fluid milk, it must be worked quickly \nthrough the processing chain and get to store shelves within days of \nits production. Due to these conditions, dairy farmers are at a \ndistinct disadvantage when bargaining for a price for their product. As \na result, the minimum farm price fluctuated wildly over time. The \nCompact corrected this problem and leveled the playing field at no cost \nto the American taxpayer. How can one be against that?\n  I am heartened by the consistent efforts of my colleagues Senators \nJeffords, Specter, and Leahy among others to keep these dairy farmers \nin mind throughout the debate on the bill and in conference. Although \nwe were not successful, the issue will not go away. The dairy compact \nissue will be revisited and the voice of the majority of Senators will \nbe heard.\n  I thank the chair for this time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues today in \nopposition to the Fiscal Year 2000 Agriculture Appropriations \nConference bill. Usually, it's a testimony to someone's power when they \ncan ``kill two birds with one stone.'' Well, amazingly the managers of \nthis bill were able to kill three birds with one stone - - the \nNortheast Dairy Compact, drought relief and agricultural sanctions.\n  Unfortunately, the impact felt by small farmers in the Northeast will \nbe meteoric. I have heard from many of my colleagues about the price \ndrops their farmers have experienced this year. Well, dairy farmers \nwitnessed a 40 percent price drop in one month. If it was not for the \nNortheast Dairy Compact, this drop could have crushed Vermont dairy \nfarmers.\n  They have also suffered through one of the worst droughts this \ncentury. And how does this Conference bill respond? It doesn't.\n  Instead, the Conference Committee blocked Senator Specter from even \nraising his amendment to extend the Northeast Dairy Compact and denied \nany targeted disaster relief for farmers in the Northeast and Mid-\nAtlantic who suffered through fifteen months of drought.\n  However, we are yet again sending disaster payments and price \nsupports to the Midwest and Southeast. I guess the Conference committee \ndecided to ignore the old adage that you should not hit someone when \nthey are down. Why not continue to prop up grain prices so that when \nVermont farmers have lost all their livestock feed to the drought they \ncan pay even more for feed from other states?\n  When we passed the Freedom to Farm bill, one of the premises its \nsuccess was based on was that farmers would also have the freedom to \nmarket. By expanding our markets overseas, our farmers would not have \nto depend on subsidies from the federal government. Yet, after the \nSenate overwhelmingly passed an amendment to update our sanctions \npolicy and allow our farmers access to more markets, the Conference \ncommittee decided to continue with the old system of guaranteeing \nfarmers the price they want through artificial means and expect \ntaxpayers to go along with it.\n  Now, I am sure that many of these crops did suffer significant price \nor market losses and may deserve assistance. But, farmers in the \nNortheast and Mid-Atlantic are just as worthy. In Vermont alone, we \nhave witnessed over $40 million in drought damage. Without some \nassistance many of our farmers are not going to make it through the \nwinter. In the last two years they have suffered through an ice storm, \nflooding, and two summers of drought.\n  What is so galling to me is that although Congress authorized $10.6 \nbillion in disaster payments in Fiscal Year 1999, the Northeast and \nMid-Atlantic have only received 2.5 percent of that assistance. Today, \nwe will likely pass $8.7 billion in disaster assistance and our farmers \nwill probably only receive 2 cents out of every dollar.\n  Adding salt to our wounds, the Conference Committee also saw fit to \nblock any extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact. Our region \ndeveloped and implemented a system to help our dairy farmers at no cost \nto the federal government.\n  I cannot understand how it made sense to the Conferees to stop a \nprogram that is supported by farmers and consumers alike because it \ndoes not increase retail price and does not cost the taxpayers money \nwhile continuing programs that do cost the taxpayers money. In fact, \nretail milk prices within the Compact region are lower on average than \nin the rest of the nation.\n  I could go on for hours about the ironies contained in this \nConference bill. Although I am tempted to run through the virtues of \nVermont dairy products like my colleague from Wisconsin did last week, \nI will let the ``Best Cheddar'' award won by Vermont's Cabot Creamery \nat the U.S. Championship Cheese Contest in Green Bay, Wisconsin speak \nfor itself.\n  However, I do want to take just a few more minutes to reiterate the \nimportance of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. Thanks to the \nNortheast Compact, the number of farmers going out of business has \ndeclined throughout New England--for the first time in many years.\n  If you are a proponent of states' rights, regional dairy compacts are \nthe answer. Compacts are state-initiated, state-ratified and state-\nsupported programs that assure a safe supply of milk for consumers. \nHalf the Governors in the nation and half the state legislatures asked \nCongress to allow their states to set their own dairy policies--within \nfederally mandated limits--through compacts.\n  When it was clear that federal policies were not working to keep \ndairy farmers in business, states took the matter into their own hands \nto insure that dairy farmers stay in business and to assure consumers \nfresh, local supplies of milk. It saddens me that Congress is now \nstanding in their way.\n  The Northeast Compact has done exactly what it was established to do: \nstabilize fluctuating dairy prices, insure a fair price for dairy \nfarmers, keep them in business, and protect consumers' supplies of \nfresh milk. Many of our friends in the South saw how the Compact \nprovided a modest but crucial safety net for struggling farmers. They, \ntoo, want the same for their farmers, and their farmers deserve that \nsame opportunity.\n  Unfortunately, opponents of dairy compacts--large and wealthy milk \nmanufacturers, represented by groups such as the International Dairy \nFoods Association--have thrown millions of dollars into an all-out \ncampaign to stop compacts. These processor groups are opposed to dairy \ncompacts simply because they want milk as cheap as they can get it to \nboost their enormous profits to record levels, regardless of the impact \non farmers.\n  Mr. President, it is time for Congress to go back to worrying about \nsmall farmers in this country. That is why this Conference bill is such \na disappointment to so many of us. The triple whammy of blocking the \nNortheast Dairy Compact, providing no drought relief and closing the \ndoor to new markets will jeopardize the future of small farmers in my \nregion.\n\n[[Page S12493]]\n\n  These farmers do not usually come to Congress asking for help and \nthey have rarely received it. Now, when they are facing one of their \nbleakest moments Congress has said ``no.'' I expected better.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the \npassage of this very important bill for American agriculture. I want to \nthank Senator Cochran and his staff for all of their hard work to \nproduce this legislation under very difficult circumstances. Although I \nfeel much more needs to be done to address the problems in the farm \nsector in my state, I will be supporting this conference report today \nin the hopes that it will provide immediate help to agriculture \nproducers across the country still reeling from the combination of low \nprices and poor weather this year.\n  Although the underlying bill provides some $60 billion for domestic \nnutrition programs, food safety, agriculture research and extension, \nand other important programs administered by the Department of \nAgriculture, I would like to speak specifically to the farm relief \npackage component of this conference report. This bill contains $8.7 \nbillion in emergency farm assistance for producers hard hit by recent \nplunges in commodity prices and, in many parts of this country, weather \ndisasters. Of this total, nearly $5.5 billion will go to program \ncommodity producers in the form of increased AMTA payments to help \ncompensate for lost markets. In Oregon, we produce a considerable \namount of wheat for export to Asia, especially in the Pendleton area \nwhere I am from. For many Oregon wheat producers reeling from collapsed \nmarkets and prices, I know these increased AMTA payments may make the \ndifference between keeping land in production and having to sell the \nfarm. Since the beginning of this farm crisis, we have used this \nmechanism to deliver ad-hoc market loss payments to keep program \ncommodity farmers afloat, and it may be the best and most efficient \ntool available to us in the short term. However, I believe the only \nlong-term solution is to expand overseas market opportunities for our \ncommodities. Although unilateral sanctions reform was taken out of this \nbill in conference, I hope we will have an opportunity to revisit this \nissue before the end of this session so that we may begin to address \nsome of the root causes of our commodity price problems.\n  This farm aid package also provides $1.2 billion for weather-related \ndisaster assistance. Severe droughts, both in the Mid-Atlantic States \nand in parts of my state, have caused tremendous agricultural losses \nthis year. In addition, as we all know, flooding in the aftermath of \nHurricane Floyd brought severe farm losses to the Carolinas this fall. \nRising waters are also a problem for the second consecutive year in the \nMalheur-Harney Lakes Basin of Southeastern Oregon, an issue which the \nconferees have noted in this conference report. Certainly Mother Nature \nhas not been kind to many of our farmers this year, and I am concerned \nthat the $1.2 billion set aside in this conference report to address \nthese weather-related losses may be inadequate. Should this turn out to \nbe the case, I hope that my colleagues and the Administration will be \nwilling to provide the resources to address these needs in a future \nsupplemental appropriations vehicle.\n  Perhaps the biggest reservation I have with this farm assistance \npackage is that it does not provide any funding to address the problems \nof the so-called minor crops. When the bill passed the Senate last \nAugust, it contained a $50 million earmark for fruit and vegetable \nproducers. While these farmers have persevered with virtually no \nfederal assistance in the past, they have not been immune to the Asian \nfinancial crisis and the historic downturn in the agriculture sector \nthat we have seen in recent years. Nursery and potato producers are \njust as much a part of Oregon agriculture as wheat and cattle, yet they \nare not represented in this relief package. I am especially concerned \nabout the future of Oregon's tree fruit industry. A number of producers \nin my state may be forced to tear out apple and pear orchards due to \nthe deadly combination of international market collapse, frost and \nother weather problems, and mounting domestic regulatory and labor \ncosts. I did note that the conferees made fruit and vegetable producers \neligible for the $1.2 billion in weather-related disaster assistance \nmoney. However, I am afraid that none of this funding will reach Oregon \ntree fruit producers, considering that this same pot of money will be \nstretched to the limit to assist producers impacted by weather problems \nthis year. I believe specialty crop farmers deserve a place at the \ntable alongside our program commodity producers, and I hope we will \nbetter address their needs in future appropriations legislation.\n  Mr. President, despite the reservations I have about this conference \nagreement, I find that the few negatives are, in the end, outweighed by \nthe many positive aspects of this bill for the Oregon farm sector. \nWhile I look forward to the opportunity to work with my colleagues on \nthe pressing farm issues that have not been spoken to in this \nconference report, I will be casting a vote in favor of the bill. I \nhope that we will act affirmatively on this legislation today and not \nfurther delay the delivery of this needed relief to family farmers \nacross the country.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I plan to vote for the Agriculture \nAppropriations Bill today, and I would like to thank those who have \nhelped move the ball down the field. But I'd like to state for the \nrecord my opposition to the Conference Committee's decision to remove \nlanguage previously approved by the Senate that would have removed \nbarriers to trade for domestic producers.\n  I am extremely disappointed and disheartened that this year's \nAgriculture Appropriations bill will not take steps to open up \nadditional trade markets to domestic producers, especially after this \nbody voted 70-28 to pass legislation that would exempt agricultural \nproducts from unilateral economic sanctions.\n  In short, Mr. President, a small handful of people have overturned \nthe will of the majority by strong-arming Congress with decisions made \nbehind closed doors. The Members who removed sanctions language from \nthe Conference Report are the very same members who promoted the \nFreedom to Farm Act. It's beyond me how they expect Freedom to Farm to \nwork when they remove the best chance for our farmers to compete in a \nglobal economy.\n  For months our farmers have been left hanging when it comes to \ndisaster relief payments, loan guarantees and crop insurance reform. \nProducers in Arkansas should not be let down by Congress again. They \nshould be looking forward to sending 300,000 metric tons of rice to \nCuba next year. Arkansas producers have been particularly affected by \ntrade sanctions with countries such as Cuba, Iran and Iraq.\n  According to Riceland executive Richard Bell, who testified before \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee in May, ``Probably no domestic \ncommodity or product has suffered more from these trade sanctions than \nrice. The sanctions towards Cuba in particular were a major blow to our \nindustry, especially to growers in the South who produce long-grain \nrice.''\n  There is bipartisan support for changes in the way this country \nconsiders economic and trade sanctions. So, in light of the conferees' \ndecision to remove sanctions language, I hope my colleagues will take a \nserious look at cosponsoring S. 566, the Agricultural Trade Freedom \nAct, which would exempt exports of food and other agricultural products \nfrom any current or future U.S. unilateral sanctions imposed against a \nforeign government. I also encourage my colleagues to consider \nsupporting S. 1523, The HOPE Act, which will require the President to \njustify how economic sanctions serve our national interests and to \nreport to Congress on an annual basis the costs and benefits of food \nsanctions.\n  It's foolish to let our foreign policy objectives cloud common sense. \nWithout access to foreign markets, we cannot expect the agricultural \ncommunity to survive. Without a better long-term farm policy, it most \ncertainly will not.\n  While this bill provides some relief, it doesn't go far enough. What \nwe must do is give our farmers a consistent, workable agriculture \npolicy. We must give them some idea of what they can count on from \ntheir government in terms of consistent farm policy. Repeatedly passing \nemergency disaster relief bills isn't the answer. And it is clear that \nFreedom to Farm has not\n\n[[Page S12494]]\n\nworked. According to today's Washington Post, ``Congress has now spent \n$19 billion more in the first four years of Freedom to Farm than it was \nsupposed to spend during the bill's entire seven-year life-span.''\n  This relief package will hopefully get several of our nation's \nproducers through this growing season, but it does nothing to ease the \nminds of our agriculture community for next year. We've taken care of \nthe short term needs of our agriculture community, I hope that my \ncolleagues will soon take care of the long term.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to once again reiterate my \nsupport for the reauthorization of the very successful Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact, and I must vote against the FY2000 \nAgriculture appropriations conference report without its \nreauthorization. This past Thursday night, I came to the Senate floor \nto urge my colleagues to consider certain points that should prove that \nsupport of the Compact is justified and I would like to briefly \nreiterate them again today.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact has addressed the needs of states in New \nEngland who compacted together within their region to determine fair \nprices for locally produced supplies of fresh milk. All of their \nlegislatures and the governors approved the Compact and all that is \nrequired is the sanction of Congress to reauthorize it.\n  The Compact has proven to be an effective approach to address farm \ninsecurity. The Compact has protected New England farmers against the \nloss of their small family dairy farms and the consumers against a \ndecrease in the fresh local supply of milk. The Compact has stabilized \nthe dairy industry in this entire region and protected farmers and \nconsumers against volatile price swings.\n  Mr. President, over ninety seven percent of the fluid milk market in \nNew England is self contained within the area, and fluid milk markets \nare local due to the demand for freshness and because of high \ntransportation costs, so any complaints raised in other areas about \nunfair competition are quite disingenuous.\n  All we are asking, Mr. President, is the continuation of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact, the existence of which does not threaten or \nfinancially harm any other dairy farmer in the country.\n  Only the consumers and the processors in the New England region pay \nto support the minimum price to provide for a fairer return to the \narea's family dairy farmers and to protect a way of life important to \nthe people of the Northeast.\n  Under the Compact, New England retail milk prices have been among the \nlowest and the most stable in the country. The opposition has tried to \nmake the argument that interstate dairy compacts increase milk prices. \nThis is just not so as milk prices around the U.S. have shown time and \ntime again that prices elsewhere are higher and experience much wider \nprice shifts than in the Northeast Compact states.\n  Also, where is the consumer outrage from the Compact states for \nspending a few extra pennies for fresh fluid milk so as to ensure a \nsafety net for dairy farmers so that they can continue an important way \nof life? I have not heard any swell of outrage of consumer complaints \nover the last three years. Why, because the consumers also realize this \ninitial pilot project has been a huge success.\n  Mr. President, there is almost $8 billion in the Agriculture \nAppropriations Conference Report for farm disasters partially created \nby competition in the global marketplace and because of a series of \nweather-related problems. The funding will be paid for by the federal \ngovernment. Now, some of my colleagues want to create a disaster \nsituation for Northeast dairy farmers by taking away a program that has \nnot cost the federal government one cent. There has been no expense to \nthe federal government--not one penny--for the Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact. The costs to operate the Dairy Compact are borne \nentirely by the farmers and processors of the Compact region. And, when \nthere has been a rise in the federal milk marketing prices for Class I \nfluid milk, the Compact has automatically shut itself off from the \npricing process.\n  In addition, the Compact requires the compact commission to take such \naction as necessary to ensure that a minimum price set by the \ncommission for the region does not create an incentive for producers to \ngenerate additional supplies of milk. There has been no rush to \nincrease milk production in the Northeast as has been stated here \ntoday. There are compensation procedures that are implemented by the \nNew England Dairy Commission specifically to protect against increased \nproduction of fresh milk. No other region should feel threatened by our \nNortheast Dairy Compact for fluid milk produced and sold mainly at \nhome.\n  There is no evidence that prices Northeast dairy farmers receive for \ntheir milk encourages overproduction of milk that spills over into \nother regions and affects dairy farmers in other areas. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record, a table from the Daily Market \nNews showing USDA Commodity Credit Corporation purchases of surplus \ndairy products with the total and percentage by regions for the last \nthree fiscal years.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  USDA COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION PURCHASES OF SURPLUS DAIRY PRODUCTS\n TOTAL, AND PERCENTAGE BY REGIONS FY 1996/97, FY 1997/98 AND FY 1998/99\n                                 TO DATE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 1998/99\n                                             1996/97   1997/98     \\1\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal estimated milk volume (million).....       390     1,412     2.090\n                                           =============================\nPercentage:\n    Midwest...............................      56.8       9.6       9.5\n    West..................................      43.2      90.2      90.5\n    East..................................       0.0       0.2       0.0\n                                           -----------------------------\n    U.S...................................     100.0     100.0     100.0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ October 1, 1998-September 3, 1999.\n \nNotes: The eastern region from Maine to Florida has sold no surplus\n  dairy products to USDA this fiscal year. All CCC purchases have been\n  nonfat dry milk with 164 million pounds (90.5%) coming from the\n  western states and 15 million pounds (9.5%) coming from the Midwest\n  states for a total of more than 179 million pounds.\nSources: Dairy Market News, USDS-AMS: Vol. 65--Report 39 (Oct. 2, 1998)\n  and Vol. 66--Report 35 (September 3, 1999).\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. An important point here, Mr. President, is that, despite \nwhat has been said on the Senate floor today, the Eastern region of the \ncountry from Maine to Florida--the very states that wish to compact--\nsold no surplus dairy products to the USDA this past fiscal year. All \nCommodity Credit Corporation purchases came from the Western and \nMidwest states.\n  And, despite what has been stated by the opposition, there are no \nadded costs to the federal nutrition program. There has been no adverse \nprice impact on the WIC program--the Women's Infants and Children's \nprogram--or the Federal school lunch and breakfast programs. In fact, \nthe advocates of these programs support the Compact and serve on its \ncommission.\n  So, I ask for the support of my colleagues today for my dairy farmers \nin Maine and to vote against the Agriculture Appropriations Conference \nReport because it does not include the reauthorization of the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact as the State of Maine and every other New \nEngland state legislature, governor and its citizens have requested, \nand I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \nlegislation. It does not provide adequate relief to farmers across this \ncountry. It fails to address issues which will decide the fate of tens \nof thousands of family farms. It fails to give relief to an entire \nregion with a significant farming community. The drought afflicting \nfarmers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions is as severe a threat \nto their existence as low crop prices are to others. The farmers of my \nstate wish they had crops to receive low prices for. Yet this bill \nfails to remotely begin to address their concerns. The entire relief \npackage of $8.7 billion is primarily focused on low crop prices in the \nSouth and to a much lesser degree the Midwest. Only $1.2 billion or \nslightly over 10% is for ``weather-related disaster relief''.\n  To put this in perspective, let me explain the extent of the drought \ndamage. Despite recent rains, New Jersey is in the middle of its driest \nseason in 33 years. From June to August the State received less than 2 \ninches of rain. Normally, we receive more than 8 inches during this \nperiod. Reservoir levels in Northern New Jersey dipped to 10% below \nnormal--and despite the\n\n[[Page S12495]]\n\nrecent ``rains'', farmers have not recovered. The impact of the drought \non New Jersey agriculture is devastating. 400,000 acres on 7000 farms \nhave sustained damage from 30%-100%. Damage estimates are $80 million, \nand expected to reach $100 million.\n  But let me be clear that New Jersey is not alone. Secretary Glickman \nestimates that the need for drought relief in the Mid-Atlantic and \nNortheast regions is over $2 billion. Governors of our States estimate \nthe damage to be closer to $2.5 billion. But even the limited amount of \nfunds offered in the Agriculture Conference report isn't designated for \ndrought--the entire country including losses from Hurricane Floyd will \ncompete for this funding.\n  Mr. President, my region of the country has a long tradition of \nhelping out other regions in need. I recall my House colleagues \nreferring to the Great Midwest Drought of 1988. Many considered this \ndrought the worst in the Midwest since the Great Depression. That year, \nwe passed an emergency relief bill which provided direct disaster \npayments to farmers in the amount of $3.4 billion. I voted for this \nbill because it was the right thing to do. I realized that farmers in \nthese states needed drought relief, and I gave my vote of support, \nbecause it was needed.\n  In 1992, Hurricane Andrew, one of the most destructive storms of this \ncentury, ripped through Florida, inflicting $30 billion in damage. I \nvoted for the Emergency Supplemental bill which brought $9 billion to \nFlorida, to help the citizens of that state recover from the enormous \ndamage to infrastructure, homes, businesses, and crops.\n  1993 was another horrible year for the Midwest, this time, hit by \nflooding. Many call it the Great Midwest Flood of 1993. Midwestern \nstates were horribly damaged by the breaching waters of the \nMississippi. I voted for this $2.5 billion supplemental for farm \ndisaster payments. Mr. President, New Jersey was not hit with severe \nflooding in 1993. In fact, New Jersey only received $5.5 million in the \nbill. But I voted for this package nonetheless. Because farmers in the \nMidwest needed it, and it was right to provide them with adequate \nrelief.\n\n  In January of 1994, the Northridge Earthquake rocked Southern \nCalifornia, causing in excess of $30 billion. I voted for H.R. 3759 \nwhich provided $4.7 billion in supplemental funding to assist \nCalifornians in their time of need. My point, Mr. President, is to \nillustrate that I have voted to assist the people of other regions of \nthis country in their time of need, despite the fact that my state may \nnot reap substantial benefit. I ask that my colleagues respect that New \nJersey and other Northeast states have endured a prolonged drought that \nthreatens our remaining agriculture.\n  Over the August recess, I visited farms and county fairs and spoke to \nNew Jersey farmers about the effect of the drought on their livelihood. \nThey understand weather and they accept the difficult life of a farmer \nbut they cannot understand how Congress, which repeatedly sends \nbillions to the South and Midwest, can ignore them in their time of \nneed. I don't have an answer for them but I can only imagine it is \nbecause Members do not realize the extent of the agriculture community \nin my State and our region.\n  So I would like to educate this body to the significant agriculture \ncommunity in New Jersey and the Northeast. There is a reason why they \ncall New Jersey the Garden State. The $56 billion food and agriculture \ncomplex is New Jersey's third largest industry, behind only \npharmaceutical and tourism in economic benefit. Last year, New Jersey's \n9,400 farms generated over $777 million in sales. Nearly 20% of the \nentire state of New Jersey is productive farmland. That's one million \nacres of working farms in New Jersey. And in an era of increasing \nconsolidation in the agriculture industry, virtually all of New \nJersey's farms are family-owned. The average farm size in New Jersey is \njust over 100 acres. At $8,370 an acre, our farmland is the most \nvaluable in the nation.\n  Farmers in the Garden State produce more than 100 different kinds of \nfruits and vegetables for consumption locally in New Jersey but also \nfor export around the world. Nationally, New Jersey is one of the top \nten producers of cranberries, blueberries, peaches, asparagus, bell \npeppers, spinach, lettuce, cucumbers, sweet corn, tomatoes, snap beans, \ncabbage, escarole and eggplant. Mr. President, in addition to the fruit \nand vegetable farmers of my state, a small number of individuals from \nWarren, Salem, Sussex, Burlington, and Hunterdon counties are the \nbackbone of agriculture in New Jersey. These are New Jersey's dairy \nfarmers. The dairy industry is an important segment of our agricultural \neconomy, supplying almost one-fifth of the fluid milk and dairy \nproducts used by over 7.5 million residents in New Jersey. The industry \nis comprised of 180 dairy farmers. Farmers who get up early to milk 7 \ndays a week, 365 days a year, starting out long before dawn, before \nmost of us are up.\n  However, this pales in comparison to what the dairy industry used to \nbe. New Jersey has lost 42% of its dairy farms in the past decade. New \nJersey dairy farmers produced 300 million pounds of fresh, locally \nproduced milk in 1997, with a value of $41.3 million.\n  If we do not re-authorize the New England Dairy Compact and allow for \nNew Jersey's entrance the remaining 180 farmers will be gone in the \nnext decade. New Jersey's state legislature has already approved entry \ninto the compact. The loss of dairy farms--whether from inadequate \nrelief from this summer's drought or from an inability to enter the \nDairy Compact means more that just a loss of business in New Jersey. \nThis is more than just a nostalgia about the decline of a time in \nAmerica when agriculture was dominated by family farms, it is also \nabout the practical reality of the loss of open space. It is about \nfarms being sold to developers and turned into parking lots & strip \nmalls. It is a story we know all too well in New Jersey. An average of \n10,000 acres of rural/agricultural land is being developed piecemeal \nevery year in New Jersey. In 1959, New Jersey had 1,460,000 acres of \nfarmland; today we have but 800,000. In 1959, New Jersey had 15,800 \nfarms. Today we have 9,400.\n\n  As I said earlier this horrible drought has crippled the fruit and \nvegetable farmers in my state. Unfortunately, it has also had a \ndevastating impact on New Jersey's already very tenuous dairy industry. \nIt has compounded the dire circumstances affecting dairy farmers from \nlow prices. Erratic fluctuations in dairy prices is forcing many out of \nbusiness. For example, in March dairy farmers across the country \nexperienced a 37% drop in milk prices. When the price drops, the price \nfamily farms must pay to feed their cows, hire help, and pay utility \ncosts stays the same. As prices decline and costs increase, farmers \nneed a mechanism to ensure stable prices for milk or they will go out \nof business.\n  In addition to the erratic market, New Jersey's family farms face a \nthreat from a pricing system introduced by the Department of \nAgriculture. This system, Option 1B, would almost surely be the death \nknell for New Jersey's dairy farmers. Option 1B, would reduce dairy \nfarmer income in New Jersey by $9 million a year.\n  New Jersey's membership in the Compact would set a floor on dairy \nprices and reimburse farmers in times of financial trouble. It would \nprovide protection in the event of another drastic price drop. Compacts \nwould also help maintain environment efficiency and open space by \npreserving the more than 100,000 acres of New Jersey farmland for \nagricultural use and preventing development.\n  Unfortunately, the Dairy Compact and Option 1A pricing provisions are \nnot included in this Conference Repot. This will force dairy farmers in \nmy state out of business. Like real drought relief, the dairy \nprovisions necessary to sustain farmers in our region are simply not \npresent.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this conference report and send \na message that we should implement farm policy for a nation of farmers, \nnot to serve certain regions at the expense of others.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the FY2000 Agriculture \nappropriations bill. This important piece of legislation provides a \ntotal of $60.3 billion. While a large portion of this funding goes \ntoward food stamps and nutrition programs, this bill also contains \nfunding for agriculture research, conservation, rural development and \ndirect assistance for our farmers to get through these tough times.\n  Farmers across the board are facing difficult times. Prices are the \nlowest\n\n[[Page S12496]]\n\nthis decade and exports are decreasing while imports are increasing. \nFor most commodities, the cost of production exceeds the revenue \nreceived. It doesn't take long to go out of business when your costs \nare more than what you can get for your end product.\n  The problem is price, not the farm bill or farmers. Because of the \nAsian flu and depression of other world markets, our farmers are \nsuffering. Simple economics tells you when supply is above demand, \nprices will drop. Ag commodity prices will increase as our world \nmarkets come back, but we don't expect that to happen this year or \nnext. If we want our farmers to stay in business, we must help them in \nthe short term until commodities can be sold on a world market.\n  Something must be done to help the American farmer through these \ntough times, which is why I support this bill's $8.7 billion in farmer \naid. The emergency aid includes $5.54 billion in additional agriculture \nmarket transition payments, which represent a 100 percent increase in a \nproducer's 1999 payment. This is a direct payment that our farmers \ncould receive before Thanksgiving if the President signs the bill into \nlaw. This is the immediate assistance our farmers and farm groups ask \nfor in hearings in the Agriculture Committee and elsewhere.\n  The conference report includes assistance for crop insurance premium \nwrite-downs to maintain the 1999 level, which is essential if we want \nfarmers to keep using the program. I am also pleased to see assistance \nto certain specialty crop producers. These are just a few of the \nprovisions that I supported in this bill.\n  The conference report also contains mandatory livestock price \nreporting legislation. I supported this price reporting legislation \nwhen it was voted out of the Agriculture Committee and I am pleased to \nsee it is moving forward. There needs to be greater transparency within \nthe livestock industry. Our producers need information on which to base \ntheir marketing decisions, and this legislation will provide that.\n  As others have noted, this conference report does not include \nsanctions reform language that passed by wide margin on the floor of \nthe Senate. However, I understand legislation to exempt agricultural \ncommodities from unilateral economic sanctions will come before the \nSenate before we adjourn, and it is something we ought to pass this \nyear. In order to insure the long term survival of the Agriculture \nindustry in the United States we must work on trade and sanctions \nreform to enable U.S. producers to compete on a level playing field \nwith the rest of the world.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate adopts the conference report today \nand the President signs it into law so that the hard working farmers \nacross the country can get the assistance we have promised them and \nthat they so deserve.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support the FY 2000 Agriculture \nAppropriations Conference Report because it provides important \nemergency assistance for America's farmers and will provide $15 million \nin disaster assistance for the commercial fisheries failure in the Gulf \nof Maine. I believe that this funding is crucial to the survival of \nfishing industry in New England. It will allow our fishermen to use \ntheir fishing vessels as research platforms to do, among other things, \ncooperative research activities in partnership with the New England \nFisheries Management Council and the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n  I thank appropriations committee Chairman, Mr. Stevens, and the \nDemocratic ranking member, Mr. Byrd, for their support of New England \nfishermen and their assistance in obtaining the funding included in the \nConference Report. I also thank Agriculture appropriations subcommittee \nchairman, Mr. Cochran, and Democratic ranking member, Mr. Kohl, and \ntheir staffs. Finally, I thank Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Gregg, and Ms. Snowe \nfor their support in including this provision in the conference report.\n  Last year, we were able to secure $5 million in emergency assistance \nfor cooperative activities to assist fishermen who were negatively \naffected by groundfish closures in the Gulf of Maine. These new funds \nwill be used to help fishermen overcome drastically reduced trip \nlimits. A trip limit of 30 pounds, about 2 cod, was imposed immediately \nafter the fishery opened. This was raised to 100 pounds by Commerce \nSecretary Daley at the request of the New England Fisheries Management \nCouncil.\n  These trip limits have had a severely detrimental economic and social \nimpact on many fishery-dependent communities in New England. Ongoing \nstock recovery requirements have required continued reductions in \nfishing and resulted in continuing hardship. The additional funding \nincluded in the Conference Report will be used to employ fishermen in \ncooperative research programs, fund on-vessel observer programs, and \nprovide training and education for fishermen.\n  I thank my colleagues for recognizing that New England fishermen and \ntheir communities require disaster assistance until our fisheries have \na chance to rebuild.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, during my service as a United States \nSenator representing the State of Washington, I have consistently \nreiterated one message to the growers and producers I represent. While \nI am not a farmer, and could not possibly pretend to understand the \nintricacies of the business, I will always do my best to understand \nfarmers' needs and work on agriculture's behalf. But there is one \nmessage growers in the State of Washington have emphasized to me that I \nunderstand without question. When times are tough and the check book \ndoesn't balance, families feel the pinch.\n  When times are tough, I have asked farmer after farmer, ``why do you \ndo this?'' The job is terribly difficult, so much of what growers \ndepend upon is unpredictable, and for two years in a row now, world \nmarkets have driven prices so low that fathers are telling their sons \nand daughters not to enter the family business.\n  But immediately after I question their dedication to their \nlivelihood, I'm reminded of the golden, rolling wheat and barley fields \nof the Palouse. I remember my countless visits to Yakima and Wenatchee \nand seeing the lush, vibrant greens of the orchards, rising up out of \nthe dust bowl that was once Central Washington. I think about the \nhearty breakfast I ate that morning and the apples and sandwiches \npacked away in my grandchildren's lunches. So much of what farmers do \nand what they produce is a part of our daily lives, that their \nexistence in this country is paramount and deserves recognition.\n  Farmers are proud, tough, hardworking Americans. Apple growers in the \nState of Washington, for example, don't like to come to my office and \nask for help. In the past few months, however, I have visited with many \ngrowers who are visibly despondent. Washington leads the nation in \napple production, and over the past year, it's estimated that producers \nhave lost at least $200 million in the fresh market. From Tonasket to \nWapato, the message from orchardists was clear--we need help.\n  Over the past two months, I have communicated to my colleagues and \nothers the significance of identifying a mechanism to assist fruit and \nvegetable growers in the disaster assistance package. During debate on \nthe Senate floor in early August, I was able to assist in securing $50 \nmillion specifically for fruit and vegetable relief. In the conference \nreport we're addressing today, potential relief for these very growers \nis incorporated in the $1.2 billion available for crop loss assistance. \nWhile I am frustrated that the specific designation for fruits and \nvegetables was removed, I am particularly pleased that apples were \nmentioned specifically.\n  Apples are not the only commodity produced in Washington that could \nstand to benefit from the crop loss section of the package. Asparagus \ngrowers, hard hit by weather and a lack of labor have lost thousands of \ndollars in fresh product. Potato growers who have also been impacted by \npoor growing conditions can approach the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nfor assistance. Many are surprised to learn that the State of \nWashington produces more than 230 food, feed and seed crops, and I hope \nthat many of these commodities will receive the assistance they \nrequire.\n  Wheat growers in Washington will also benefit from the $5.5 billion \navailable for market loss in the disaster\n\n[[Page S12497]]\n\npackage. The nearly $.60 cent per bushel payment to growers will most \ncertainly ensure that the highly demanded soft white wheat our farmers \nproduce will continue to flow to recovering Asian markets.\n  While the disaster package contained in the Fiscal Year 2000 \nAgriculture Appropriations bill is most certainly the highlight of the \nlegislation, there are other important, annual funding priorities \nincluded. As a member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nhave worked to ensure that the research demanded and deserved as a \nresult of the passage of the Farm Bill is provided for the Pacific \nNorthwest. From research for hops to disease eradication in cherries, \nthis bill provides funding necessary to ensure the longevity of the \nessential public-private investment in our nation's food production.\n  Language and funding in this bill directed at the implementation of \nthe Food Quality Protection Act are also essential. Programs related to \nexport enhancement and market development received the favorable \nattention growers in my state demanded. And the land grant universities \nare secure in knowing that the formula funds necessary for continued \nexcellence in education are available.\n  With all that said, there are many in this body who know I was not \npleased with the removal of Senator Ashcroft's sanctions relief \namendment in the conference report. Sanction relief is essential for \nthe long-term prosperity of agriculture in America. While I received a \ncommitment that the Senate would take up this issue before the \nadjournment of this session, I cannot over-emphasize the absolute \nimportance and sincere necessity in addressing this issue. Food and \nmedicine sanctions do not cripple regimes or dismantle communist \ngovernments. Instead, they hurt our family farmers and keep food out of \nthe mouths of those who cannot provide for themselves. I initially \nrefused to sign the conference report over this issue, and sincerely \nhope the Senate will address this matter in the very near future.\n  I am also not pleased with the manner in which this bill was dealt \nwith in the waning hours of conference. Conferees were literally locked \nout of decisions related to the sanctions issue, dairy, and items \nincluded in the disaster package. This ``top-down'' philosophy is not \nwhat should drive the passage of appropriations bills.\n  All in all, Mr. President, what we have before us today is a good \nbill. Its contents include year-long negotiations on a variety of \nissues related to the essential functions administered by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. While some issues have caused me to struggle \nwith my support or opposition to the legislation, the benefits of its \npassage are overwhelming. It is my hope that the President will give \nhis blessing to the bill so that our struggling farm economy can \nreceive the charge it needs to rejuvenate our agriculture communities.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this \nconference report. The East Coast suffered through months of drought \nthis summer, causing enormous crop losses to our farmers. Then \nHurricane Floyd arrived with severe rains, further affecting farmers \nwith widespread floods. These two acts of nature are serious \nemergencies affecting millions of people, yet this conference report \ndoes not do nearly enough for farmers on the East Coast.\n  In my State of New Jersey, agriculture is a $1 billion a year \nbusiness involving 830,000 acres on over 8,000 farms. This summer's \ndrought caused losses on 406,000 acres affecting 7,000 of those farms. \nAll 21 counties in my State were declared disaster areas. It has taken \na truly devastating toll on our farm community. According to Secretary \nGlickman, the drought alone resulted in a total of $1.5 to $2 billion \nin damages throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. And now, \nwe have the devastation of Hurricane Floyd on top of the drought \ndisaster. If any State has suffered a true farm disaster this year--\nit's New Jersey as well as our neighbors in the Northeast.\n  Unfortunately, although this conference report contains $8.7 billion \nin emergency assistance for farmers, only $1.2 billion of that is for \nweather-related disasters. And this $1.2 billion is spread out over the \n50 States. That will not leave a fair share for New Jersey and other \nnortheastern States that actually suffered a disaster this year. \nNumerous New Jersey farmers have been left with no hay, no crops, and \nno livestock worth taking to market. Without our help, the result of \nthese disasters may force some farmers to end decades of family farming \nand to give up the way of life that they love.\n  This Congress must do more. The situation facing East Coast farmers \nis a true emergency, in every sense of the word. At a time when we are \nwatching entirely predictable activities like the census being declared \nemergencies, we are doing little to assist those who face true acts of \nGod. I cannot support this conference report until the farmers in New \nJersey and up and down the East Coast receive the help they need.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I give due credit to the conferees for \ntheir hard work to complete action on the Agriculture Appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 2000 which supports the nation's farming economy \nand federal programs through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). \nThis year's agriculture appropriations bill is also intended to provide \nneeded government aid to farmers and their families who have suffered \ncritical losses due to severe drought and difficult market conditions. \nHowever, with much regret, I must vote against this legislation.\n  I have several concerns with this final conference agreement.\n  First, it contains $253 million in earmarks and set-asides for towns, \nuniversities, research institutes, and a myriad of other entities that \nwere included in this bill without consideration in the normal merit-\nbased review process. This is $82 million more than was included in the \nSenate version of the bill. Clearly, the House had to get its turn at \nthe trough.\n  For example, $1.75 million is provided for manure handling and \ndistribution in five states, including Mississippi, Iowa, Nebraska, \nTexas and Arizona. Why these five states have a monopoly on manure \nproblems in our nation is not adequately explained in this report, nor \nis a rationale provided as to why an earmark of $200,000 is provided \nfor sunflower research in Fargo, North Dakota. Unless weather \nconditions are anticipated to change dramatically, it is difficult to \nfathom why spending thousands of dollars on sunflower research in a \nstate known for severe weather conditions is more critical than other \nfarming emergencies.\n  No other clear explanations are provided for earmarking $750,000 for \nthe U.S. Plant Stress & Water Conservation Lab in Lubbock, Texas, as \nwell as $1,000,000 for peanut quality research in Athens, GA; $500,000 \nfor fish diseases in Auburn, AL; and, $64,000 for urban pests in \nGeorgia. These may very well be meritorious projects, but I must \nquestion again why these specific projects and localities are singled \nout for direct earmarked funding rather than undergoing a competitive \nreview.\n  In addition to direct earmarked funding, the conferees have included \nvery blatant directive language which singles out specific projects in \nvarious states for special consideration for grant funding, loans or \ntechnical assistance from USDA. With these actions, even the limited \nfunding made available to USDA for competitive grant and loan \nassistance is not fairly distributed since the conferees have included \nsuch directives to steer the agency away from considering many other \nmeritorious projects that are equally in need around the country.\n  Another problem with this spending bill is the inclusion of language \nwhich provides for an exception for a single producer from the state of \nNevada from pending federal milk marketing orders to be implemented by \nthe USDA. This provision will exclude a single dairy producer in Clark \nCounty, Nevada from the proposed new Arizona/Las Vegas Marketing area \nwhen USDA's rules take effect, thereby preventing this single producer \nfrom competing fairly with the rest of the milk industry.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, there are few issues which cause \nas much controversy and divisiveness as proposed milk marketing \nrestructuring proposals. Yet, without any debate, language was included \nin the Senate bill, without notice or debate, to protect this single \ndairy producer while the rest of the nation will be forced to comply. \nRetaining this provision in the conference report is a serious \ninfraction of out obligation to treat all interests fairly and to abide \nby the Senate's\n\n[[Page S12498]]\n\nrules which preclude legislation on appropriations bills except when \napproved by a super-majority.\n  Mr. President, finally, I am concerned that this legislation contains \n$1.2 billion more than the Senate bill in emergency aid for farmers. \nThe House bill contained no such funding at all.\n  Late last year, the Congress provided $5.9 billion in emergency \ndisaster assistance for farmers as part of the FY 1999 Omnibus \nAppropriations bill. Earlier this year, we provided another $574 \nmillion in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. I opposed \nboth of those bills, in part because the bills contained excessive \namounts of pork-barrel spending but also because of the use of the \n``emergency'' designation for large amounts of non-emergency purposes, \nsome of which was included in the farmer aid package.\n  While I understand and sympathize with the plight of America's \nfarmers who face economic hardship due to a wide variety of natural \ndisasters, I cannot support the designation of the entire $8.7 billion \nin assistance to farmers as an emergency.\n  The Congress has certain rules that apply to its budget process. One \nof those rules states that, once a Senate-House conference convenes, \nnegotiations are limited to only the funding and legislative provisions \nthat exist in either bill. Adding funding that is outside the ``scope'' \nof the conference is not in order, nor is the inclusion of legislative \nprovisions that were not in either the Senate- or House-passed bills.\n  Once again, the appropriators have deviated from the established \nprocess in agreeing on the provisions in this conference report by \nadding another $1.2 billion in emergency funding to the bill--funding \nthat was considered by neither the House nor the Senate--just the \nappropriators. That $1.2 billion for crop disaster loss payments that \nwas added to the emergency farm aid package may very well be needed by \nsome of our nation's farmers. But its inclusion at the last minute \ndefeats the entire concept of fiscal responsibility, which is premised \non the full Congress debating budget priorities, not just the \nappropriators.\n  There were other last-minute add-ons in the conference which were not \nincluded in the Senate or House bill, including: $2 million for water \nand waste forgiveness loans; $15 million for Norton Sound Fisheries \nfailure in Alaska; $56 million for administrative costs associated with \nmanaging emergency asssistance programs; and, an entirely new title to \nthe bill, Title IX, which contains 25 pages of legislation to establish \na new mandatory price reporting system for various livestock. While \nthis legislation originated in the Senate, it was never called up for \ndebate or a vote.\n\n  This last provision was never offered as an amendment on the Senate \nfloor during consideration of the Agriculture Appropriations bill, \nprobably because it would have been ruled out of order since it is \nlegislation that is not supposed to be included on an appropriations \nbill. Instead, it was simply inserted into the appropriations bill, \nbehind closed doors, without debate.\n  American taxpayers have to give up their hard-earned tax dollars to \npay for these last-minute tactics by the Appropriations Committees. \nClearly, Congress appears to favor spending that benefits the special \ninterests of a few, rather than spend the taxpayers' dollars \nresponsibly and enact laws and policies that reflect the best interests \nof all Americans.\n  Let me state again that I support federal assistance for farmers and \nothers in need, but only when decisions to spend tax dollars for such \naid are considered fairly and truly help those in need. But when we \ncontinue the shameful and provincial practice of padding appropriations \nbills with excessive amounts of dubious emergency spending and special-\ninterest pork-barrel projects, we are short-changing the taxpayers as \nwell as our agricultural industry. This bill may help some farmers and \nproducers who are truly in dire need of federal assistance, but we are \nharming those in the agriculture industry who are trying to follow \nestablished guidelines to qualify for other types of non-emergency \nassistance.\n  This bill designates $8.7 billion as emergency spending for FY 2000--\nmoney that can only come from the non-Social Security surplus. The \nDefense Appropriations bill contains another $7.2 billion in emergency \nspending, which I will also oppose. Together, we are spending almost \n$16 billion in emergency spending, but, Mr. President, the non-Social \nSecurity surplus is only estimated to be $14 billion. That means, pure \nand simple, that if we approve these two bills with their emergency \nfunding, we will once again be dipping into the Social Security surplus \nto pay for the continued operations of the federal government.\n  Already this year, the Senate has approved appropriations bills or \nconference agreements containing almost $10.5 billion in wasteful and \nunnecessary spending. Surely, among these billions of dollars, there \nare at least a few programs that we could all agree are lower priority \nthan desperately needed aid for America's farmers. Surely, in the \nvoluminous lists of billions of dollars of pork projects, there are a \nfew that the Congress would be willing to give up to ensure that we not \nonce again dip into the Social Security Trust Fund--a Fund financed by \nthe payroll taxes of American workers who are counting on their money \nbeing available to help them through their retirement years.\n  This bill demonstrates that the Congress cares more about taking care \nof special interests than it does about American families. It is the \ntaxpayers who have to shoulder the burden to pay for the pork-barrel \nspending in this appropriations conference report and the others that \nwill follow, and I will not vote to place that burden on American \nfamilies.\n  The full list I have compiled of the objectionable provisions in this \nfinal conference report will be available on my Senate webpage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as may be consumed to \nthe distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I would like to say that the senior Senator from Mississippi \nhas one of the toughest jobs on Capitol Hill, along with the senior \nSenator from Indiana. Chairing the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture and the Agriculture Committee in the Congress are just \nincredibly difficult tasks. The diversity of agriculture and the needs \nof agriculture are historic in this Chamber.\n  Trying to come up with a proper mix of how to solve the needs and the \ndifficulties in farm country is complex. It is difficult.\n  I understand coalitions have to be put together to pass bills. In \nthis case, a coalition was put together to pass a bill that, in my \nmind, did not represent the interests of my area of the country, \nparticularly my State of Pennsylvania. I understand that. I appreciate \nthe difficulty in doing it.\n  I understand that Pennsylvania has a very difficult time \nparticipating for one reason. We are a very diverse State \nagriculturally. We have a tremendous amount of richness in our \nagriculture. It is our No. 1 industry. Pennsylvania's No. 1 industry is \nagriculture. Most people don't know that. Most people don't know that \nthe State of Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, has the \nlargest rural population of any State in the country. We take \nagriculture very seriously. Obviously, our rural population depends \nheavily upon agribusiness for survival.\n  We have been hit this year with an absolutely historic drought that \nhas devastated our farm community. Throw on top of that, sort of adding \ninsult to injury, a big chunk of our State was hit very hard by \nHurricane Floyd. Not only did we have drought on top of drought and the \ncrops burned up, but they had floods. We have a situation where in \nalmost every county of our State crop losses are in the area of at \nleast 30 percent, and in many areas and many counties it is 100 \npercent.\n  I looked at the bill we have before us in the Senate and the one that \ncame out of conference. I was hoping we could focus more of the $8 \nbillion that is in this bill on the area of the country that was \naffected most dramatically by weather this year. In my mind, it has \nnot. I am not just speaking for Pennsylvania. I am talking about all of \nthe Northeastern States\n\n[[Page S12499]]\n\nthat were affected--the Mid-Atlantic States--by drought. The big chunk \nof this bill is for AMTA payments, which are payments to farmers who \nare program farmers.\n  Before we pass this bill, we are going to give $5.5 billion out to \nfarmers who were previous to the Freedom to Farm bill in Government \nprograms. The problem in Pennsylvania is we have a very small \npercentage of those farmers because of our diversity. We have very few \nprogram crops. We have a lot of specialty crops, livestock, and dairy. \nAs a result, a very small percentage of our farmers participate in the \nAMTA payments. A very small percentage of, frankly, most of the Mid-\nAtlantic and Northeastern farmers participate in the AMTA program.\n  When you look at the $8 billion-plus that is in this bill and you see \n$5.5 billion of it going to AMTA, almost none of that is going to the \narea that is most affected by the drought. It is going to the area that \nis having bumper crops.\n  The reason we are providing ``disaster'' help, the disaster in most \nof the country is they have too much harvesttime. As a result, prices \nare low. So we are going to give them money because they have too many \ncrops to sell at too low a price.\n  I can tell you my farmers in Pennsylvania wish they had something to \nsell. So I am a little frustrated when you look at where the bulk of \nthe money is going. It is going to areas that are hardly hit by a \ndisaster, and certainly no weather disaster. It is a disaster of \nrichness, if you will, because of the tremendous amount of harvest that \nhas occurred in that area, and, obviously, the world situation and the \nlike. When you look at what is specifically targeted for my area of the \ncountry, the ``drought relief'' is $1.2 billion. Not all of it goes to \ndrought relief. A lot of it is going to hurricane disaster relief.\n  I can tell you my Governor told us that just the preliminary numbers \nin Pennsylvania are approaching $1 billion in losses for drought. So \n$1.2 billion for drought and hurricane relief doesn't even begin to \ntouch on what the problem is in Pennsylvania.\n  I know some have said we can do a supplemental appropriations bill in \nthe spring to see what the problem is. My farmers can't wait until \nspring. They have to survive the winter. While some folks are getting \ndouble AMTA payments, $11.2 billion worth of money, my farmers are \ngoing to be told to wait until the spring.\n  Our area of the country has come to the table time after time after \ntime after time as the Upper Midwest, the Southeast, and other areas of \nthe country have suffered drought, pestilence, floods, hurricanes, \ntornadoes--I can go on and on--a disaster a year in those areas. We \nunderstand that. Our taxpayers and farmers have come to the table and \nbeen willing to put up money. We are a big country, and we will pitch \nin together to help.\n  When it comes to our farmers being hit with the worst drought in a \ncentury, the answer is: Wait until the spring. We may pass a \nsupplemental if you need it.\n  That doesn't cut mustard. I understand we had a vote here yesterday \non cloture and a group from the Northeast cast our votes on cloture. We \nwere defeated. We will be defeated today. This bill will pass and will \nbecome law. I understand the need for getting assistance to farmers. I \nhave to speak up and say what is in this bill is not enough to take \ncare of the needs of the farmers in my State.\n  A couple of other things happened that were disconcerting. We had \n$134 million in specialty crop money that came out of this bill. We \ngrow a lot of fruits and vegetables in Pennsylvania, specialty crops, \nimportant crops. We had $134 million for that. When it came from \nconference, the money was out and ``specialty crop'' was defined as \nonly tobacco and peanuts. We don't grow a lot of tobacco and peanuts in \nPennsylvania or New Jersey or a lot of other areas hit by the drought.\n  Again, that money was designated to help some of our farmers who are \nnot the farmers who have been at the Government trough for years and \nyears and years with program crops, but folks making it on their own, \nnot coming to Washington asking for money. The one time we ask for \nmoney, the answer is no. I think that is a very sad commentary. We took \nthe money for specialty crops, for fruits and vegetables--again, people \nwho have never gotten Government subsidies--and we give them to two \nprograms that are still getting Government support--tobacco and \npeanuts.\n  That is a misguided policy. I understand the dynamics of trying to \npass a bill. I understand the power and the influence of the peanut \nlobby, the sugar lobby, and the tobacco lobby. I understand now we have \nthe honey program back in place, and the mohair program is back. I \nunderstand all that.\n  I keep looking at what it does to those who have been paying the \nbills for a long time for agriculture in the northeastern part of the \ncountry. What I see is a neglect of a bunch of farmers who work just as \nhard as folks in other areas of the country who don't ask the \nGovernment to help very much. We hardly ever ask the Government to help \nin our agriculture. The one time we get hit with the drought of the \ncentury, the answer is: We will give you a little here, and wait until \nnext year, and maybe we can give you some more. By the way, some of the \nother stuff we were going to give you, we will not.\n  I thank the chairman for the money for crop insurance. That is \nsomething I very much wanted. The $400 million to help try to get \nfarmers into the crop insurance business is very important. We need \nmore farmers covered with risk management tools. Crop insurance is \nimportant. I urge the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator \nLugar, to take that up quickly and move forward on crop insurance to \nput the money to good use.\n\n  I have to oppose this bill, reluctantly. I understand the difficult \njob the Senator from Mississippi had in trying to craft this to pass \nthe Senate and get it signed by the President, but for me it doesn't do \nenough for my area of the country.\n  I will have to vote ``no'' on the bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Specter, for his comments about the work that went into crafting \nthis bill and the challenges we faced along the way. We appreciate very \nmuch his assistance. He is a member of the legislative committee on \nagriculture and has provided valuable advice, counsel, and assistance \nin the crafting of this bill. We thank him for that.\n  As I understand the status of time, we have about 20 minutes \nremaining on the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 26 minutes remaining and 19\\1/2\\ \nminutes on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Grams.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to first commend my colleagues \nfor their overwhelming cloture vote last night that permits the Senate \nto move closer to passing this very important Agriculture \nappropriations conference report. I especially commend my colleagues \nfor stopping an intended filibuster that was designed to apply pressure \nto extend the life of the Northeast Dairy Compact. I look forward to \nthe day when we can talk about the Northeast Dairy Compact in the past \ntense with its detrimental effects on Midwest dairy farmers; that time \nwill be ended.\n  After hearing all the rhetoric about how compacts are necessary to \nsave small family dairy farms, I think it is very important to \nhighlight some information my office recently received. According to \nthe USDA, NASS data regarding 1998 dairy herd size averages, Vermont \ndairy farm herd sizes averaged 85 head and New York farms averaged 81 \nhead. In the Midwest, Minnesota dairy farms averaged 57 head and \nWisconsin farms averaged 59 head. Again, Vermont dairy farms averaged \nin size almost 50 percent larger than Minnesota dairy farms. So much \nfor the idea that the Northeast is competing against corporate farms in \nthe Upper Midwest.\n  I cannot stress this point enough: The Northeast Dairy Compact is \nheavily subsidizing large-scale dairy operations while those small \nfarmers in the region do not receive enough to seriously impact their \nbottom line.\n  We have always known that compacts are bad for consumers, especially \nlow-income consumers. But now we have additional data from the USDA \nshowing they help large-scale dairy farming operations rather than \nhelping what we hear a lot about, the small farm proponents they claim \nto help.\n\n[[Page S12500]]\n\n  Dairy compacts are an economic zero sum game in which there are many \nlosers--most importantly, again, the consumer, and especially low-\nincome consumers. Dairy farmers in the noncompact regions become \nlosers. We hear the rhetoric that somehow the compact is only there for \nthe Northeast and it doesn't have any effect on any other dairy farms \nacross the country. That is completely false. It does have dramatic \neffects and impacts upon prices of farmers in other areas, especially \nin the Upper Midwest.\n  The real winners in this zero sum game, again, are the large dairy \nproducers located in the Northeast that receive literally tens of \nthousands of dollars in subsidies for their already profitable \nbusinesses, not the small dairy farmer who supporters say were the \nfocus of this idea to begin with.\n  The average 6-month subsidy for large Northeast dairy farms is \nprojected to be $78,400--$78,400 in 6 months. Dairy farmers in \nMinnesota would relish that kind of an income if it were spread across \nthe whole year. But Minnesota farmers wisely have rejected this effort \nthat distorts the system and harms their fellow farmers in other \nStates.\n  Compact supporters have chosen a strategy of pitting one region of \nthe country against another, offering the cartel-like protection of a \ncompact to other States to prod them into joining the economic warfare. \nThey say: In order to strengthen our position, let's encourage others \nto set up compacts, let's try to expand these ``cartels,'' and then we \ncan encourage more votes--and then, again, pitting one region of the \ncountry against another, encouraging economic warfare. Then they can \ncarve up the market, they can receive fixed prices for the milk they \nproduce, and they claim this policy does not discriminate against other \nregions of the country.\n  Higher prices promote higher production. It doesn't take a scientist \nto figure this out. That is, production is expanded beyond the compact \nregion's fluid needs, the excess production then goes into nonfluid \ndairy products or nondrinkable milk products, and this depresses the \nnonfluid prices nationwide.\n  The overproduction in the Northeast generated by the compact --the \ncartel, the fixed prices, encouraging overproduction--then is spilt \nover into other regions of the country, which then depresses those \nprices. When they say it has no effect on other dairy farms around the \ncountry, that is completely false. It does. Where does the excess milk \ngo? Again, the prices encourage overproduction, the overproduction then \nis spread out across the country, and that depresses the prices for \ndairy farmers in the Upper Midwest.\n  It is very disappointing to me that colleagues would describe \nthemselves as free marketers, who understand the basic principles of \neconomics would sign on to this protectionist economic power grab. For \nfarmers who raise corn, soybeans, wheat, potatoes, and other \ncommodities, it seems we are willing in this Congress to try to work \nfor their best interests. There is no difference if you raise corn in \nIowa or Illinois or Minnesota or Pennsylvania; the markets treat that \ncorn the same. It is on a competitive basis. The farmers compete on \ntheir productivity. But when it comes to milk, it is completely \ndifferent. If you are in one part of the country, you get more money \nfor your milk than in other parts. Now in the Northeast we want to set \nup a cartel that has price fixing, that encourages overproduction, \nwhich then spills over to the rest of the country.\n\n  Why do we support one part of a national agricultural policy but then \ndistort another part of that policy, and that is dealing with dairy? \nWhy should dairy farmers be treated differently than any other farmer? \nWhy should we take dairy markets from one region of the country and \ngive them to another region of the country? That is exactly, again, \nwhat the cartel does. Because the milk produced in the Northeast that \nis not consumed in fluid form is spilled over into the Midwest as \npowdered milk, cheese, and butter. So they are now competing for those \nmarkets and we are then giving them those markets, or at least a share \nof them. Should large producers in the Northeast be able to thrive at \nthe expense of small farm families in the Midwest?\n  Our farm families in the Midwest are among the most productive in the \ncountry. Yet their fate now depends not on their competitiveness, not \non their ability to produce in a competitive manner but on the raw deal \npresented to them by subsidized dairy farmers in the Northeast.\n  I am always frustrated by the claim from our pro-compact \nspokespersons, and repeated again in a recent Christian Science Monitor \narticle, that compacts are necessary to guarantee customers and \nconsumers ``an ample supply of fresh, locally produced milk.'' I am \nsatisfied this rhetoric is designed to scare consumers into believing \nif they do not support these compacts they will then go to the grocery \nstore and encounter empty milk cases because they cannot get ``fresh, \nlocally produced milk.''\n  The well-known truth is, with the modernization of refrigeration and \ntransportation, we could basically eliminate the entire milk marketing \norders in this country. That is why they were established to begin \nwith, because there was not the refrigeration, there was not the \ntransportation to ensure an adequate supply of milk in other parts of \nthe country. So it has distorted the entire dairy process.\n  But now, with new types of refrigeration and transportation, milk can \nbe shipped all over the country and can go to any consumer from \nanywhere, fresh, just as, say, oranges from Florida, lettuce from \nCalifornia, red meat from down in Texas. But our country's dairy supply \nis more than adequate to produce fluid milk; that is, the class I milk, \nas they call it. That milk can be supplied to any part of the \ncontinental United States. There is no shortage of fluid milk \nproduction in America. It should be built on a competitive basis, not \nprotectionist, not a compact region, not guaranteeing some farmers \nprotection at the expense of other farmers.\n  The country produces three times as much milk as it consumes as a \nbeverage. ``The milk may not be locally produced,'' is what you have \nheard--some of the jargon now, ``fresh, locally produced''--but it will \nbe fresh. To tell consumers they will not get fresh, locally-produced \nmilk, again, is an intentional deception designed to lead people into \nthinking if there are no compacts, the grocers' milk supply will dry up \nor deliveries might be sporadic or frequently interrupted, which \nis simply not true. The perception that somehow Midwest milk is not as \ngood as anything produced locally is also an affront to the hard-\nworking dairy farmers in my State.\n\n  A compact spokesman in the Christian Science Monitor article also \nclaims that locally produced milk will be cheaper to deliver than the \nmilk bought and brought in from outside the area. Not if you live in a \ncompact region, it will not be cheaper. Compacts are designed to \nprotect inefficient producers in one region against the more efficient \nproducers in another--specifically, the efficient farmers in the Upper \nMidwest. When people argue that when dairy products are no longer \nproduced within a region prices to consumers go up within the area, do \nnot believe it. If that were true, why would they need compacts at all?\n  If milk produced locally would be cheaper, why do they need a compact \nat all? The reason they need it is to drive up their prices. Dairy \ncompacts create a minimum price for milk, and they are designed to keep \ncheaper milk out of the region, not in the region. Again, we don't do \nthis with any other farm product. We do not set a floor or a minimum \nprice for corn from one region to another. We don't pit the Northeast \nagainst the Midwest against the Southeast against the South; we do not \ndo that. But in dairy we do.\n  Dairy compacts create a minimum price for milk, and they are designed \nto keep cheaper milk out of a region, not into the region. So, again, \nwhy do they need compacts at all if their arguments are true?\n  Upper Midwest producers can sell class I fluid milk in New England \nfor less than the $16.94 per hundredweight floor price of the compact. \nBut the floor price in New England effectively keeps the cheaper milk \nout of the market. Indeed, after the Northeast Compact was enacted in \n1997, the price of milk rose--this is the price of milk in New \nEngland--from $2.54 all the way up to a high of $3.21 a gallon. Milk \nprices\n\n[[Page S12501]]\n\nthere initially jumped about 20 cents a gallon. In fact, there were \nsome grocers who put up signs along the dairy case that said: Don't \nblame me for the higher prices in milk. Blame the compact. That was \nbecause consumers were complaining about the jump in the price of milk \nin the New England area.\n  So it does drive up the price. They always quote a study that was \ndone. They said the first 6 months the compact went into effect, it had \nbasically no effect. I would like them to take the last 6 months \nbecause the compact had not even geared up in those first 6 months, so \nit had very little chance to distort the market. But now, take a poll, \nnow take a survey, do the report now, and I will bet the 6 months in \nthe last 6 months would be much different than what they are quoting \ntoday.\n  I believe compacts are clearly bad for America. I urge my colleagues \nto reject their extension and insist they not, again, be slipped into \nanother appropriations bill in the dead of night.\n  To wrap up about the dairy bill--I also wanted to talk about the \nAgriculture appropriations conference we are considering. I am pleased \nagain it contains the $8.7 billion in emergency appropriations. I urge \nthe USDA to work to get the assistance to our Nation's farmers without \ndelay.\n  I am also encouraged by conference report language urging the \nPresident to be more aggressive in strengthening trade negotiating \nauthority to help American farmers and also in expressing Congress' \ngoals for the upcoming negotiations. The conference report is not \nperfect but it will give our farmers the help to make it through \nanother year. But it will be imperative that Congress continues to \naddress reforms in our trade sanctions, EPA regulations, crop \ninsurance, and also in the Tax Code for farmers to have an environment \nin which they can truly thrive. I am also glad conferees added \nadditional assistance to farmers who suffered through these natural \ndisasters.\n\n  I urge the USDA, when it is distributing the aid, to remember farmers \nin the northwestern part of my State of Minnesota have been prevented \nfrom planting due to flooding. In fact, some farmers in the \nnorthwestern part of Minnesota have not had crops now for 7 years \nbecause of varying disasters: Flood, drought, disease, et cetera. In \nnorthwestern Minnesota this year, crop agents and FSA crop acreage \nreports show that 70 to 75 percent of the entire area's tillable acres \nwere prevented from being planted in 1999. Only 10 percent of the \nnormal intended acreage of annual crops will be harvested this year at \nall. Rainfall amounted to over 200 percent of normal in the critical \nplanting months of April, May, and June.\n  I know there have been many farmers across the Nation affected by \ndrought this year, just the opposite of the problems we have had. But I \ndo expect USDA to provide sufficient and equitable relief to farmers in \nnorthwestern Minnesota who have been shortchanged in the past by some \nof these relief bills. I now hope Congress will turn to enacting long-\nterm solutions that will make such emergency packages as this one \nunnecessary.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nfulfill our responsibilities to the American farmer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Who yields time? The Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to ask the manager of the bill a \nquestion relative to fiscal provisions within this bill. The context of \nthese questions is when we commenced this session of Congress, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimated the non-Social Security surplus \nfor fiscal year 2000 would be approximately $21 billion. Thus far, we \nhave committed $7 billion of that to the 1999 supplemental \nappropriations bills through the designation of various items as \nemergencies.\n  This bill has additional items designated as emergencies totaling \n$8.7 billion. The effect of this, plus prior action, would be to reduce \nthe estimated non-Social Security surplus to $5.3 billion.\n  We also have in the offing other emergency provisions which will \ntotal approximately $15 billion and thus eliminate the non-Social \nSecurity surplus and place us in a position of having to do what we \nhave all committed not to do, which is to dip into the Social Security \nsurplus by in excess of $10 billion.\n  In that context, I want to ask the manager a short list of questions, \nand I say to my good friend, the Senator from Mississippi, I commend \nhim for the work he has done this year and in previous years on behalf \nof American agriculture. I know the frugality with which he approaches \nhis task. He has been faced, as has happened in the past, with an \nunusual set of circumstances affecting American agriculture and thus \nthe necessity for emergency spending.\n  What is the level of emergency spending included in this conference \ncommittee report?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the amount \nincluded in the conference committee report that is attributable to \nemergencies is $8.7 billion which is for disaster assistance and \neconomic assistance for farmers.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How much has been designated for emergency spending in \nthe Senate bill which this body passed?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, when we passed the bill in the Senate, \nthere was $7.6 billion approved by the Senate as emergency spending for \nagriculture.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And how much had been approved by the House in its \noriginal version of the Agriculture appropriations bill?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the House bill contained no funds for \ndisaster assistance or economic assistance designated as emergencies.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator. The emergency spending items which \nwere included in the fiscal year 2000 conference report, what is their \ndegree of adherence to the statutory criteria for emergency spending, \nwhich are that spending must be necessary, sudden, urgent, unforeseen, \nand not permanent in character?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding there is no \nstatutory test for defining or deciding what is and is not an \nemergency. Even for OMB, it is a matter of policy, as we understand it, \nand that is an executive branch agency under the jurisdiction of the \nPresident of the United States.\n  In the Senate, an emergency is whatever the Senate decides is an \nemergency. A majority of the Senate can designate an event or an \nappropriation as being for an emergency purpose, and that is how we \njudge whether it is an emergency--whether a majority of the Senate \napproves it as such.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To the extent those criteria of emergency being \nnecessary--sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and not permanent--if those were \nthe criteria, what proportion of the $8.7 billion of emergency spending \nwould meet those standards?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I say again, we have no set of criteria. \nThere is no statute that provides any criteria or test against which a \nfinding of emergency need be made. So it would be presumptuous on my \npart to try to answer what part or if all of the emergency spending in \nthe bill would stand the test of the criteria the Senator has \nidentified. All five of the ones you have listed are subjected to--\nthere is no analytical test, in other words, with which one can do \nthis. I do not think there is any substitute for good judgment and \ncommon sense myself, and I think that is what the Senate relies upon.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In the fiscal year 2000 budget, how much is budgeted for \nemergencies that potentially will occur in the fiscal year that began \non October 1?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Appropriations Committee allocations that were made \nto each subcommittee do not contain a designation for emergencies as \nsuch. And as far as I know, the budget resolution did not contain any \nspecific section with an authorization or a designation of funds in the \nbudget for emergencies.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I can editorialize a moment on that question, it seems \nto me this would be analogous to a family which, for instance, in its \nbudget had said: We will estimate the cost of medical care for our \nfamily will be $250. At the end of the year, they found, in fact, it \nwas $1,000. They had to make certain end-of-the-year adjustments in \norder to fill that $750 missing element in their budget. When they \nbegan to write the budget for the next year, one would think prudence \nwould say: Let's include $1,000 as our medical expenses,\n\n[[Page S12502]]\n\nnot a number which has been proven to be inadequate.\n  I suggest somewhat the same analogy would be applicable here. If we \nhave shown there is $8.7 billion of emergency spending and we have \nappropriated zero for those emergencies, for the future it would be \nprudent to begin to incorporate into our ongoing budget some funds to \nrespond to these emergencies. We do not know the characteristics, we do \nnot know the geographic location, we do not know when the emergency \nwill occur, but we are pretty sure there is going to be some kind of \nemergency somewhere in American agriculture that will warrant a \nresponse.\n  Prudence would indicate we ought to have a fund from which to meet \nthose needs so that every year we are not in the position of having \npassed an emergency appropriation which, as we know, has the effect of \nvitiating all of the normal budgetary rules, including budgetary rules \nthat require we offset spending with either reductions in spending \nelsewhere or with additional revenue. The effect of this is to go \ndirectly to the budget surplus.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I think his \npoint is illustrated by the fact we have seen legislation introduced to \nreform and improve the Crop Insurance Program to get at that kind of \nproblem. If farmers find crop insurance both affordable and effective \nto compensate them for losses of this kind, they would buy crop \ninsurance. We have a flawed program now. We are trying to get the \nlegislative committee to act on legislation on that subject.\n  Senator Lincoln from Arkansas and I have cosponsored a bill that we \nthink is needed in order to make that kind of program effective and \nmore attractive in the South. We think the current program does not \nrepresent a reasonable or thoughtful investment of a farmer's funds--at \nleast that is the attitude of most southern farmers with whom we have \ntalked on this subject.\n  One other point on this and that is, there is a Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency appropriation that is made every year. That is a \nsubject in the budget resolution, and we have in the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill funds to appropriate to that agency to respond to \nthe needs of people confronted with disaster. It is not that the budget \nis silent on the subject of disasters. There is the Crop Insurance \nProgram that is subsidized by the Government, and there is the FEMA \nprogram that is funded in the budget each year.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The other two questions relative to the budget relate to \nadvance funding. Is there any advance funding in this conference \nreport, i.e., funds that were normal fiscal year 2000 expenditures \nwhich are delayed to a future fiscal year?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as far as the regular appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2000 funds are concerned, there is no advance funding. \nIn the disaster assistance package, there is $30 million for advance \nfunding of fisheries disaster assistance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Finally, relative to the payment adjustments, is there \nany change in this conference report relative to the timing of payments \nmade to vendors that are beneficiaries which will have the effect of \nmoving fiscal year 2000 costs into future years?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there is none that this Senator knows \nabout.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much? Nine minutes and how much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield myself 4 minutes and hurry.\n  I want to say a few words about both parts of the bill before us. The \nfirst part is the regular fiscal year 2000 Ag appropriations bill. I \ncommend and thank the chairman, Senator Cochran, and thank our ranking \nmember, Senator Kohl, for their hard work and conscientious effort to \ncraft this bill under difficult spending constraints.\n  There are important provisions in the bill providing funding for \nagriculture programs, agricultural research, food safety, nutrition, \nconservation, rural economic development, and in other areas. There are \na number of items in this bill that are especially important to my \nState of Iowa, which I will not list here. I just want to say the \nregular fiscal year 2000 bill is basically a good bill under the \ncircumstances.\n  There is a matter that deserves special mention; and that is, in the \nSenate we had an overwhelming vote of 70-28 to remove sanctions on food \nand medicine. The Senate conferees also voted in the conference to hold \nthe Senate position, but the House conferees adjourned before we could \neven vote on sanctions reform. So after all these years of hearing all \nthe talk about removing embargoes on food and medicine, the Republican \nleadership in the House walked away before we had a chance to reform \nit. So we still have embargoes on food, embargoes to keep our farmers \nfrom selling food to foreign customers.\n  I also want to mention a provision that was stuck in this bill on the \nH2A program. That program allows bringing in foreign agricultural \nworkers if the employer cannot find domestic workers. The provision in \nthis bill will significantly shorten the time during which an employer \nhas to look for U.S. workers before bringing in foreign workers.\n  I recognize that it can be hard to find U.S. workers for agricultural \njobs in some instances, but I do not think that Congress ought to be \nchanging the law to make it easier to cut U.S. workers out of those \njobs and give them to foreign workers.\n  I now will turn to the emergency assistance package, which totals \nabout $8.7 billion. My colleagues and I have been working since last \nMay to get this Congress to pass a farm assistance package. We had to \nfight for too long this summer even to get a recognition here in \nCongress that there is a farm crisis. Then we had to fight to get this \nCongress to take any action. And finally, we had to fight for a package \nthat would be adequate to deal with the severe economic hardship in \nrural America.\n  So, we have come a long way since last spring. This emergency package \nwill provide a good deal of assistance to help farm families survive \nthis crisis. I am disappointed, however, that the bill uses the same \npayment mechanism as the failed Freedom to Farm bill and that it does \nnot contain an adequate amount of assistance to respond to the droughts \nand other natural disasters around the country.\n  The emergency package has far too little in it for livestock \nproducers--particularly for pork producers who have lost $4 billion in \nequity over the past 22 months. And it contains no money for emergency \nconservation work and repairing flood damage. Nor is there any economic \ndevelopment assistance for rural communities that are suffering because \nof the downturn in agriculture.\n  On balance, I am supporting the emergency package because it will get \nsome money out to farm families who are struggling to remain in \nbusiness.\n  As I have said, it is like throwing a leaking liferaft to a drowning \nperson. That is how I feel. I am standing on the shore. Someone is \ndrowning. All I have is a leaking liferaft. Do I throw it to them or \nnot? Of course, I do, in the hopes that shortly we will get something \nbetter. But right now our farmers are drowning. They are sinking. So \nthis emergency bill will help for a little bit, but it is not a long-\nterm solution to the problem.\n  The fact that Congress is passing a stopgap emergency package for the \nsecond year in a row demonstrates that our current farm policy is not \nworking. We must reform the failed Freedom to Farm bill before next \nyear.\n  Unless we reform Freedom to Farm, all the signs indicate farmers are \ngoing to need another emergency package next year, too. Frankly, you \ncan only go to the well so many times.\n  We cannot continue to have a farm policy in this country that lurches \nfrom one crisis to the next. It is time to address the root problem: \nthe lack of a farm income safety net in the Freedom to Farm bill. The \nFreedom to Farm bill has to be changed to restore farm income \nprotections that were eliminated when the bill was enacted.\n  Freedom to Farm is a bankrupt farm policy and it is bankrupting \nAmerica's farm families.\n  As we have said repeatedly, this bill uses a payment mechanism that \nhas\n\n[[Page S12503]]\n\nnothing to do with what farmers planted this year. The Freedom to Fail \nbill is already a proven failure. So why on Earth would we want to go \nright back to the Freedom to Fail bill to try to remedy its \nshortcomings? This bill includes $5.5 billion in Freedom to Farm type \npayments. They would be paid out based on base acres and yields set \nsome 20 years ago. The payments would have nothing to do with this \nyear's planting. In fact, they can go to people who planted nothing.\n  Using the so-called ``three-entity rule,'' an individual could get \n$80,000 of these payments and not have planted anything. Add that to \nthe $80,000 in regular AMTA payments, which they also could get without \nplanting anything. This bill then also doubles the payment limit for \nmarketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments to $150,000. Now in \npractice, that is $300,000 through the use of the three-entity rule. \nThe total that potentially could be paid to one individual then is \n$460,000.\n  This bill does not treat oilseeds fairly. There is a very complicated \nand confusing program for providing direct payments to oilseed \nproducers. It is going to take a long time to get this program sorted \nout and to get the payments out to producers of soybeans and other \noilseeds--and the payments are not going to be fairly distributed among \nproducers. Here is the real irony of this emergency assistance package. \nWith the AMTA type payments, if you did not plant anything this year \nyou can still get as much as an extra $80,000 under this package.\n  I have some examples under the payment scheme we have in this \nemergency package. All of these farmers have 500 acres of land, half \nplanted to corn and half planted to soybeans. Yet the payments range \nanywhere from $19,941 down to $2,040--three neighbors right in a row, \nfarming 500 acres--half in corn and half in soybeans. Or you can have a \nfarmer who decides to go to Palm Beach. He has 500 acres. He did not \nplant anything. He is going to get $17,901 even though he never did \nanything. Yet for farmers in the State represented by my friend from \nNorth Carolina, who have had disaster losses--or farmers in Iowa, the \nDakotas, Minnesota, the Northeast and East who have had drought or \nother disaster losses--they are going to get pennies on the dollar. \nFarmers who worked hard, planted a crop, have hardly anything to show \nfor it. But here is a hypothetical example of a farmer who planted \nnothing, who has 500 acres, and he is going to get $17,900. That is not \nright.\n  Let me run through these examples in a little more detail. I ask \nunanimous consent that a table summarizing the examples be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  Palm\n           Farmer               Smith      Jones      Brown      Beach\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal acres.................        500        500        500        500\nCorn base acres.............        500        250          0        500\nCorn planted................        250        250        250          0\nSoybeans planted............        250        250        250          0\nPayment.....................     19,941     10,990      2,040     17,901\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. For the first farmer, Smith, all 500 acres are corn base. \nThose are the acres on which the direct AMTA-type payments are made. \nAgain, 250 acres planted to corn and 250 acres planted to soybeans. \nThat farmer will receive an additional AMTA type corn payment of \n$17,901 and a soybean payment of $2040, for a total of $19,941. Keep in \nmind this farmer is receiving both a corn payment and a soybean payment \non the very same acre on some of the land.\n  The second farmer, Jones, has 500 acres, but this farmer has only 250 \nacres of corn base. Again, 250 acres in corn and 250 acres in soybeans. \nThis farmer will receive $8950 in AMTA type corn payments and $2040 in \nsoybean payments, for a total of $10,990.\n  Another farmer, Brown, has 500 acres, but no corn base, with half the \nland in soybeans and half in corn. This farmer will receive $2040, \nbecause that is all that would be paid on the soybeans.\n  In summary, 500 acres of land, half planted to corn, half planted to \nsoybeans, and you have a range of payments from $2040 all the way up to \n$19,941. All because the AMTA payments are based on what was planted 20 \nyears ago or more, not on what farmers are planting now.\n  And here is the real kicker, a landowner who chooses to plant nothing \ncan receive a payment. So the owner of that 500 acres could still \nreceive the $17,901 without planting a seed. I call this the Palm Beach \nFarmer example.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot wrong with this bill, but there is an \noverriding need to get assistance out to farmers. Frankly, I have \nlittle confidence that we would get anything better if this bill were \nsent back to conference. I have amendments that I am still prepared to \noffer. But we couldn't even get the House conferees to come back to the \ntable. They were forbidden by their leadership to do so.\n  This bill could have been much better, and I deeply regret that we \nwere foreclosed from improving it. So I will vote for this conference \nreport,with some reluctance, simply because so much is at stake for \nfarm families and rural communities in my state of Iowa and across our \nNation.\n  As I said, it amounts to throwing a leaking liferaft to a drowning \nperson. Let's throw the liferaft out; but let us change the bill next \nyear so we are not back once again trying to pass emergency farm \nassistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend, the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, and the Senator from Wisconsin for all their hard \nwork on this very difficult bill. I intend to support this bill.\n  Let me talk briefly about what this Agriculture Appropriations bill \ndoes for North Carolina and what it will not be able to do for North \nCarolina. In North Carolina, we talk about things in terms of before \nand after Hurricane Floyd, unfortunately.\n  Before Hurricane Floyd, our farmers were struggling, having very \ndifficult times, financially and otherwise. Their crop prices were at \nthe lowest levels they have been in many years. And they needed help; \nthey desperately needed help. One of the things this bill does is \nprovide some of that help in the way of direct market assistance for \nsome of the problems they had before Hurricane Floyd.\n  We have about $328 million in this conference report for North \nCarolina's tobacco farmers. I have to say, for those around the country \nwho are not familiar with North Carolina's farming operations, an awful \nlot of our farmers are tobacco farmers. They may farm a lot of other \ncrops, but tobacco is often the staple that allows them to farm those \nother crops. This money was desperately needed. And they needed it now. \nThey needed it even before Hurricane Floyd hit. Having visited with our \nfarmers, including our tobacco farmers, all over the State of North \nCarolina, we are very pleased and very proud that we were able to get \nthem the assistance which they deserved and which they needed.\n  Sadly, though, I have to also talk about the situation after Floyd. \nThis bill provides $1.2 billion for disaster relief. I have to say, I \nthink this is way short of what we are going to need in North Carolina. \nWe have a real emergency, I think by anybody's standards, in the \nagricultural farming community in North Carolina as a result of \nHurricane Floyd.\n\n  I have been all over North Carolina and have spent a lot of time in \neastern North Carolina, visiting our farms that have been devastated by \nHurricane Floyd. The reality is, this is a loss from which it is going \nto take many years to recover.\n  Of this $1.2 billion, some reasonably sized chunk of that money will \ngo to farmers in North Carolina. It will not ultimately be enough. But \nit is critically important that we get some of that money to them, and \nget it to them quickly. I urge the Secretary of Agriculture to do as \nmuch as he can to get as much of this money as is possible disbursed in \nthe immediate future because these farmers need help. They already \nneeded help before Hurricane Floyd. And they need help now more than \never. They need it immediately.\n  What this photograph I have represents is what I saw all over eastern \nNorth Carolina as a result of Hurricane Floyd and in the wake of \nHurricane Floyd. We can see almost the entire farm--except for the \nfarmhouse--is under water. This property, which has been involved in \nfarming for many years, is now under water. And the crop losses have \nbeen completely devastating.\n\n[[Page S12504]]\n\n  This scene is repeated over and over and over, all over eastern North \nCarolina. We are told the best estimates are, at this point, that there \nis somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion in agricultural losses \nin North Carolina. Obviously, the money in this bill is not going to be \nadequate since it is for the entire country. It is not going to be \nadequate to deal with the loss in North Carolina alone which approaches \n$1 billion. We are going to have to do more.\n  I want the people of North Carolina, and particularly our farmers in \nNorth Carolina, to know that we fully recognize they need help. They \nneed help quickly. They do not need loans. They were already up to \ntheir necks in debt and up to their necks in loans before the hurricane \nhit. They need help. They need direct disaster relief, and they need it \nimmediately.\n  I point out, both for my farmers in North Carolina and to my \ncolleagues, that the money that was recently put in the VA-HUD \nconference report, the approximately $2.48 billion for FEMA, will not \nhelp with the farming problem in North Carolina because that money is \nnot designated and indeed cannot be used specifically for agriculture.\n  We are going to have to have some direct appropriation through some \nvehicle in this Congress--this session--to help our farmers because if \nwe do not they are going out of business. They are the heart and soul \nof North Carolina and to our economy in North Carolina, and \nparticularly to our rural economy in North Carolina. We have to be \nthere for them. They have been there for us. We have to step to the \nplate and provide them with the support they need.\n  Finally, I express my disappointment with the lack of any dairy \nlegislation in this conference report.\n  I supported dairy legislation. I continue to support it. We recognize \nthe plight of dairy farmers in North Carolina. We understand the \ndifficulties and problems they have. We will continue to search and \naggressively pursue ways to solve the problems with which they are \nconfronted.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished managers of this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains for \ndebate on the conference report under the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 53 seconds remain. All time is \nmajority time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Democrats have used all time allocated to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on their side.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I will yield back time if no other \nSenator seeks recognition because I don't need to talk anymore.\n  I have talked enough about the bill, trying to explain that we have \nattempted to identify not only the emergency needs that exist by reason \nof the collapse of prices for commodities for agricultural producers \nbut also the disaster assistance that is needed now to compensate those \nwho have suffered drought-related and other weather-related disasters \non the farm.\n  We have in the conference report a statement by managers indicating \nthat we realize it may be difficult or impossible to ascertain the \nexact dollar amount of losses attributable to disaster during this crop \nyear. For that reason, we call upon the Department of Agriculture, the \nSecretary, to monitor the situation and submit to the Congress, if it \nis justified, a supplemental budget request for any additional funds.\n  We are confident the Senate and the House, as well, will carefully \nconsider any supplemental request for such funds. We think this is a \ngenerous response to the needs in agriculture, but we know it is not \nenough to satisfy every single need of every individual in agriculture. \nI don't know that anybody could design a program that would do that. I \ndon't recall there ever being a more generous disaster assistance \nprogram approved by this Congress than this one--$8.7 billion in \nemergency assistance. We hope that will be helpful.

This bill is within its \nallocation under the Budget Act. It is consistent with the budget \nresolution adopted by this Congress.

Mr. President, I yield back all time under our control with \nthe exception of 54 minutes, which would then put both sides with an \nequal amount of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I have the attention of the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I say what I am about to say without rancor. \nI hope I can.\n  I have been in this body now 41 years at the end of this year. I was \nmajority leader for 4 years, then minority leader for 6 years, and then \nmajority leader for 2 more years.\n  Mr. President, as majority leader, and as minority leader, I never \nonce objected to a Senator's request to speak for a few minutes--15 \nminutes in my case today--nor do I ever expect to object to another \nSenator's request to speak. My request was for only a short amount of \ntime. The distinguished majority leader objected. He has a perfect \nright to object. I don't question his right to object. But, Mr. \nPresident, I think we have come to a very poor pass in this Senate when \nSenators can't stand to hear a Senator speak for 15 minutes. Our \nforefathers died for the right of freedom of speech. I may not agree \nwith what another Senator says, but, as someone else has said, I will \ndefend to the death his right to say it.\n  Mr. Leader, I very much regret that you objected to my request to \nspeak for 15 minutes. I don't get in your way in the Senate often.\n  Mr. President, I want to adhere to the rules. I don't get in the \ndistinguished majority leader's way very often. He doesn't find me \nobjecting to his requests. I know he has great responsibilities as the \nmajority leader of the Senate. He has a heavy burden. Having borne that \nburden, having borne those responsibilities, I try to act as I should \nact in my place and let the two leaders run the Senate. I don't cause \nthe majority leader much trouble here. He will have to say that. He \nwill have to admit that. I don't get in his hair. I don't cause him \nproblems. But, Mr. President, when a Senator, the senior Senator of the \nminority asks to speak for 15 minutes, I think it has to be offensive, \nnot only to this Senator but to other Senators.\n  I would never object, Mr. Majority Leader, to a request from your \nside. Suppose Strom Thurmond had stood to his feet. He is the senior \nMember of this body. I think there has to be some comity. I think it \ncomes with poor grace to object to a senior Member of the Senate who \nwishes to speak before a critical vote.\n\n  Now, the majority leader said in his opinion, or something to that \neffect, that I could speak after the motion had been decided upon, and \nthere would be time allowed under the order, and there would be time \nthen to make a speech. That was his opinion.\n  In this Senator's opinion, this Senator felt that it was important \nfor this Senator to speak at that time. Not that I would have changed \nany votes, but I think I had the right to speak. What is the majority \nleader afraid of? What is the majority leader afraid of?\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will yield in a moment. I will accord the Senator that \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. President, what is the majority leader afraid of? Is he afraid to \nhear an expression of opinion that may differ from his? As majority \nleader, I never did that. When I was majority leader, I sought to \nprotect the rights of the minority. That is one of the great functions \nof this Senate, one of its reasons for being. I would defend to the \ndeath the right of any Senator in this body to speak. Fifteen minutes? \nConsider the time we have spent. We haven't spent a great deal of time \non this treaty. I regret very much the majority leader saw fit to \nobject to my request to speak.\n  Now, I am glad to yield to the distinguished majority leader. Mr. \nPresident, I ask that my rights to the floor be protected. I am not \nyielding the floor now.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me to respond?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me begin by saying the same thing Senator Byrd said at \nthe beginning of his remarks. I respond without any sense of rancor. I \nknow that sometimes in the Senate we get very intent and very \npassionate about issues. I know this issue is one we all are very \nconcerned about, and passions do run high, as they should, because we \nhave very strongly held opinions. Thank goodness, though, we still are \nable to do as we did last night, retire to another building and enjoy \neach other's friendship and company, and then we return to the issues \nat hand. We debate them mightily, with due respect and without rancor.\n  As far as the amount of time that has been spent on debate on this \ntreaty, I went back and checked recent treaties. In fact, the only one \nthat took as much time on the floor of the Senate as this treaty in \nrecent history was the chemical weapons treaty, in which, I remind the \nSenator, I was also involved. Usually treaties are debated a day or \ntwo, 6 hours or 12 hours. I think this one is going to wind up being \nabout 15 or 16 hours. I think we have had time to have the debate that \nwas necessary on this issue. After all, it has been pending in various \nways for at least 2 years, and the treaty was actually signed, I think, \nway back in 1995, if I recall correctly.\n  I understand what Senator Byrd is saying. I, too, have been around \nawhile. I know only Senator Thurmond can match your record. But I have \nbeen in Congress 27 years myself. I served in the House 16 years, where \nI was chairman of the Research Committee. I served 8 years as the whip \nof my party in the House. I have been in the Senate since 1989, where I \nserved as secretary\n\n[[Page S12506]]\n\nof the conference, the whip, and leader. I understand the importance of \nthe differences between the two bodies and the precedents and the \ntradition and the comity and the respect for each other. I have a great \ndeal of respect and love for this institution and, in fact, for the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n\n  Having said all of that, this was a motion, a request. I made a \nmotion to go back to the Executive Calendar, a nondebatable motion. \nThen there was a request in effect to have debate. It wasn't as if \nthere wouldn't be debate on the substance of the treaty. There are \nalmost 3 hours of time remaining on the treaty. But in that extra \neffort to be fair, so the closing debate would be equal, we have \nalready yielded back 54 minutes so there would be 2 hours approximately \non each side.\n  I want to make sure Senators have a chance to be heard and that their \nvoices are not muted. Yours will not be, under the time we have left. \nBut in that case, I thought the time would have delayed getting to a \nconclusion on this very important matter. It was a nondebatable motion, \nand we had time left for debate. I believed it was the correct thing to \ndo. I regret the Senator feels strongly to the contrary.\n  I recognize that he has been not only not an impediment to my trying \nto do my job but quite often has been helpful. I appreciate that. I am \nsorry he feels that way.\n  I knew he was going to make the motion. I knew there was going to be \nan effort to have extended debate on a nondebatable motion to go back \nto a treaty, which I had, frankly, made a mistake, probably, in \ninterrupting it to go to the Agriculture appropriations conference \nreport. I did it because we need to get to these appropriations bills, \nas the Senator knows.\n  Majority leaders have to balance time schedules and views of Senators \nand different bills, appropriations bills, the desire to get to \ncampaign finance reform. I gave my word to more than one Senator that \nwe would begin today on campaign finance reform. I am still determined \nto keep that commitment. But if it is 8 or 9, they will say: Well, you \ndidn't keep your word. It is too late. All of that came into play.\n  I assure you, I would want Senator Byrd's voice to be heard, Senator \nDaschle's, on any nondebatable motion and on this treaty. I am sure the \ntime will come when I will stand up. In fact, I remember one occasion--\nSenator Dodd will remember this because he came to me and said: I \nappreciate your doing that--when there was an effort to cut you off. I \nstood up and said no. I asked unanimous consent that the Senator have \nthat time. I stood up when I thought it was unfair. This time, on a \nnondebatable motion to go back to the Executive Calendar, I thought it \nwas unfair, in fact, to have an extended debate on that.\n  I appreciate your giving me a chance to respond. I hope we can work \nthrough this. We will get to a final vote. Sometimes we come up with \nagreements that allow things to go to another day. Sometimes we strive \nmightily and we can't reach that. And sometimes you just have to \nfulfill your constitutional responsibility and you just vote.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time be \ntaken out of our side and not yours.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I ask \nunanimous consent that, since neither of the statements made by the \nSenators relates directly to the treaty, none of the time be taken out \nof the limited time remaining for debate on the treaty.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will not object.\n  I reiterate that we need to get to a conclusion on the debate and \nhave the vote on this issue, so we can move to campaign finance reform, \nas I committed to Senator McCain, within a reasonable hour tonight. But \nI will not object.\n  Also, I yield the floor because I don't want to eat up any more time \nin the late afternoon.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator doesn't have the floor to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield as far as my comments are concerned back to the \nSenator who has the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time will be reasserted \nto its original agreed period for each side.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the distinguished majority leader will listen, I want \nhis attention. I don't want to say anything behind his back. He might \nbe offended. I want him to hear what I say and be able to respond to \nit.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader spoke about how long \nhe served in the House. That had nothing to do with my request for 15 \nminutes. I served in the Senate 30 years before the distinguished \nmajority leader ever got to the Senate. Two-thirds of the Members of \nthis Senate have never served with me when I was majority leader in \nthis Senate. Two-thirds. I am not interested in what the rules of the \nHouse are. I served over there.\n  I am interested in free speech, freedom of speech. May I say, in \nresponse to the distinguished majority leader, I know what the rules \nare. I know that the motion to return to executive session is not \ndebatable. I know that very well. Mr. President, the distinguished \nmajority leader alluded to an extension of debate on this treaty--\nsomething to the effect that he had heard there were going to be \nefforts to extend that debate. I am not one of those. I wasn't part of \nthat, and I never heard of it. So help me God, I had no desire to \nextend the debate. I wanted to say something about that motion, not \njust about the treaty. I wanted to speak before the motion. I was \ndenied that right--not that I would have changed any votes, but it is \nmy right as a Senator.\n  There is too much of what the House does that we don't need to do in \nthis Senate. I am afraid that too many Senators feel that we need to be \nlike the House. This Senate exists for the protection of the minority, \nfor one thing. It also exists to allow Members to speak freely and to \ntheir heart's content. I understand unanimous consent agreements. I \nhave probably gotten more unanimous consent agreements than any other \nmajority leader that ever was a part of this Senate. I walked in the \nSenator's shoes. I walked in the majority leader's shoes. But never--\nnever--would I object to a Senator asking for 15 minutes to speak on a \nmotion, notwithstanding the fact that the rules preclude debate. That \nis why unanimous consents have to be made. You have to get unanimous \nconsent to speak in a situation like that. I was denied that.\n\n  Mr. President, this Senate needs to remember that we operate here by \ncourtesy. We have to be courteous to one another. We have to remember \nthat we work together for the country, we work for the Senate; and it \nis going to take cooperation and understanding. I try to be a gentleman \nto every Senator in this body. I don't think there is any Senator who \ncan say I have not been a gentleman to him in my dealings with him or \nher. The Senate is for two main purposes; there are two things that \nmake the Senate different from any other upper body in the world--the \nright to amend, which this side is often denied, and which I never \ndenied. If there were 50, 60, or 70 amendments, I said find out from \nboth sides how many Senators wanted to offer amendments and then we \nwill try to get consent that there be no other amendments, and vote. So \nthere is the right to amend and the right to speak--freedom of speech. \nAs long as Senators may stand on their feet and speak as long as they \nwish, the liberties of the American people will be assured.\n  Mr. Leader, I will not carry this. I have said my piece today. I am \noffended by what the majority leader did, but I am going to forgive \nhim. I am. I don't live with yesterday regarding relations in this \nSenate. I think too much of the Senate. That is why I am running again; \nI think too much of the Senate. I could retire and receive $21,500 more \nannually in my retirement than I will earn as a Senator. Besides, I \ncould be free to take another job. But it isn't money that I seek; it \nisn't wealth that I seek. I love this Senate. I am a traditionalist. I \nlive by the traditions of the Senate. I try to live by the rules of the \nSenate. I try to remember that if I offend a Senator today, he may be \nthe very Senator who will help me tomorrow. I try to remember that. I \ntry to make that a practice.\n  The majority leader made a mistake, if I may respectfully say so. But \nI will not hold that against him. I will shake\n\n[[Page S12507]]\n\nhis hand when this is over, because first, last, and always I try to be \na man, one who can look in the eye of my fellow man and, if I have done \nhim wrong, I want to apologize to him before the Sun sets. That is my \ncreed. We need to have better comity than we are having in the Senate--\nnot that I will be a problem. But the American people are watching. \nThey see this. And the majority leader has the votes. He doesn't have \nto be afraid of a motion the minority might make. He doesn't have to \ncare what the minority may say. Nobody needs to be afraid of an opinion \nI might express before a vote. And no time is saved by it, as we now \nsee. No time is saved. (Laughter)\n  If I had any real ill will in my heart, I would take the rest of the \nafternoon to speak, and maybe more. But I thank the majority leader for \nhis kindness to me in the past. I understand his problems. I don't want \nto get in his way. I have said things behind his back that were good. I \nhave talked about the attributes of this leader behind his back. And \nanything I say today, that is all; I am getting it off of my heart. The \nmajority leader, I think, will contemplate what has been done here \ntoday and, in the long run--if I may offer a little bit of wisdom that \nI possess from my 41 years of experience in this body--he will be just \na little less relentless in his drive to have the majority's will \nuncontested.\n  Remember, there will come a day when he will need the help of the \nminority. The minority has been right in history on a few occasions and \nmay be right again. The day may come when the minority in the Senate of \ntoday will be the majority of tomorrow. If I am still living and in \nthis Senate at that time, I will stand up for the rights of the \nminority because that is one of the main functions of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished majority leader if he \nwishes to respond to anything I said.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the offer to yield. \nI think I have said enough. I appreciate what he has had to say. I \nappreciate the fact that he has said his piece and we will move on \nabout our business. That is my attitude, too.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, could the Chair clarify as to the amount \nof time remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 45 minutes 41 seconds on the \nSenator's side, and 54 minutes on the Republican side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Democratic side has 45 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five minutes 41 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Was that what we had \nprior to the motion to go back into executive session?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. The clock was reset. It was timed \naccording to the original agreement, the original time the Democratic \nleader had been allotted.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry: I thought it was 54 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-four minutes, and then the Senator from \nWest Virginia spoke again, and that time was deducted.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that the whole colloquy --all of \nwhat took place--not go against the time of either side because I \nthought that was the request the minority leader made. I hope we can do \nthat. We have a number of Senators wishing to speak. It is only 54 \nminutes on each side. I would appreciate it if there would not be an \nobjection to that unanimous consent request. The clock started, 54 \nminutes per side; ready, get set, go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my friend. I thank him for the courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am going to use my leader time. I \nunderstand I don't have to use a unanimous consent request to obtain \nthe 20 minutes available to me. I will not use the full 20 minutes.\n  My colleagues are going to rise to speak to the treaty itself. Up \nuntil now, I have refrained from talking about the deliberations \nthemselves, but I think for the Record it is important for us to state \nhow it is we got here.\n  We just cast a vote of profound consequence. The choice that vote \npresented the Senate this afternoon was quite simple. It was a choice \nbetween statesmanship or partisanship.\n  This was not just a procedural motion. Let's begin with that \nunderstanding. The motion that just passed on a party line vote was a \nvote to kill the test ban treaty. What is all the more important--and \npeople should understand--was that there was no requirement that we \ncast this vote. This vote was not necessary. We did not have to go to \nexecutive session. We could have precluded that vote. Nothing on the \nExecutive Calendar would have been affected adversely by allowing the \ntreaty to stay on the Executive Calendar.\n  So everyone ought to understand that. This was a voluntary choice \nmade by the majority leader.\n  That is the first point.\n  The second point relates to how it is we got here.\n  This treaty was submitted, as has been repeatedly stated in the \nRecord, on September 22, 1997. Ever since that time, my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle have requested that there be hearings, that \nthere be some thorough consideration of this very important matter.\n  A number of other countries have already made the decision we were \nasking this body to make. One-hundred and fifty have signed it. Fifty-\none countries have voted already to ratify it.\n  We were asking that there be hearings.\n  I don't know where the majority leader got his information about the \nlength of time this treaty has been debated versus all the other \ntreaties. It is interesting. I will submit for the Record all of the \ntreaties and the consideration given them since 1972.\n  But just quickly to summarize, it is important to note that the \nIntermediate Nuclear Force Treaty took 23 days of committee hearings \nand 9 days of floor consideration.\n  The START I treaty took 19 days of hearings and 5 days of floor \nconsideration.\n  The Antiballistic Missile Treaty, approved in 1972, took 8 days of \nhearings and 18 days--more than half a month--of consideration on the \nSenate floor.\n  Mr. President, we have had a couple of days on this particular issue. \nI ask unanimous consent that the entire list of treaties and the amount \nof time given them on the floor and in committee be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSenate Consideration of Major Arms Control and Security Treaties--1972-\n                                  1999\n\n       Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty/SALT I (approved 1972):\n       Eight days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings;\n       Eighteen days of Senate floor consideration.\n       Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty (1988):\n       Twenty-three days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings;\n       Nine days of Senate floor consideration.\n       Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty (1991):\n       Five days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings;\n       Two days of Senate floor consideration.\n       START I Treaty (1992):\n       Nineteen days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings;\n       Five days of Senate floor consideration.\n       START II Treaty (1996):\n       Eight days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings;\n       Three days of Senate floor consideration.\n       Chemical Weapons Convention (1997):\n       Fourteen days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings;\n       Three days of floor consideration.\n       NATO Enlargement (1998):\n       Seven days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings;\n       Eight days of floor consideration.\n       Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (submitted 1997):\n       One day of Foreign Relations Committee hearings \n     (scheduled).\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, what Democrats sought, very simply, was \ncomplete consideration in all the committees for whatever time it may \nhave taken to ensure we have established the kind of record we \nestablished on all the other treaties before we voted on them. That is \nwhat we asked. That is what we sought in our letter to the Majority \nLeader.\n  The Republicans' response was cynical. They proposed we limit debate \nto 14 hours, that there be one amendment on a side, and that no time be \ngiven to\n\n[[Page S12508]]\n\nproper hearings. They left us as Democrats the choice: Filibuster the \ntreaty on which we have called for consideration, or accept a unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  There was one reason that Republicans forced this choice--one reason, \nand one reason only. It was a partisan attempt to embarrass the \nPresident and embarrass Democrats. That was the reason.\n  So it is now clear, based upon a letter being circulated by Senator \nWarner and others, that the President should delay consideration of \nthis treaty. Over 51 Senators have now signed a letter circulated by \nSenators Moynihan and Warner. Nearly 60 Senators--a majority--have now \nsaid we ought to postpone consideration of this treaty.\n  In fact, based upon this clear belief on the part of a majority of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, I encouraged the President to \nsubmit a statement asking the Senate to delay the vote. He did. A \ncouple of days ago, he made a formal request that the Senate delay \nconsideration of this treaty until a later date to allow ample \nconsideration of all the questions raised and the tremendous \nopportunities presented by this treaty.\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff have made similar requests. The Secretary \nof Defense, the Secretary of State, former Secretaries of Defense, \nformer Chairs of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have all recommended \npublicly and privately that this treaty consideration be delayed.\n  I added to the voice yesterday. I submitted a letter to the majority \nleader wherein I was willing personally to commit to hold over on a \nfinal vote for the rest of this Congress, barring any unforeseen and \nextraordinary circumstances as defined by myself and the Majority \nLeader. We may have seen an example just yesterday of just such a \ncircumstance. What happens in Pakistan, what happens in India, what \nhappens in North Korea, what happens in the Middle East, what happens \nin Iraq and Iran, what happens in an awful lot of those countries could \nhave a profound effect on the decisions made in the Senate over the \ncourse of the next 14 months.\n  Yet it was the view expressed by some in the majority, and now \napparently all in the majority, that even in the most extraordinary \ncircumstances, the Senate will not take up this treaty. Now we are left \nwith nothing more than an up-or-down vote on the treaty itself.\n  Now I have heard the latest rumor. In the last couple of hours, we \nare told that it is article 18 of the Vienna Convention that requires \nus to act. Mr. President, nothing could be farther from the truth--\nnothing. Nothing in article 18 requires us to vote. The obligations of \na signatory have already attached to the United States and will \ncontinue to do so until the President, only the President, makes clear \nthe United States' intent not to become a party.\n  The Senate will not change this by voting the treaty down or \nsuspending its consideration today. So don't let anyone mislead this \nbody about the ramifications of article 18.\n  We find ourselves now at the end of this debate with the recognition \non the part of Members in our caucus that, of all of our solemn \nconstitutional responsibilities, there cannot be one of greater import \nthan the consideration of a treaty. And, remarkably, incredibly, no \nconstitutional obligation has been treated so cavalierly, so casually, \nas this treaty on this day. This is a terrible, terrible mistake. If \nit's true that politics should stop at the water's edge, it is also \ntrue that politics should stop at the door to this chamber when we are \nconsidering matters of such grave import.\n  I urge those colleagues who have yet to make up their minds about \nthis treaty to do the right thing; to support it, to recognize the \nprofound ramifications of failure, to pass it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think there was a misunderstanding \nregarding the previous unanimous consent request.\n  My understanding is the Senator from South Dakota asked unanimous \nconsent that the presentation by Senator Byrd and the discussion \nbetween Senator Byrd and the majority leader not come out of the \nallocated time. I think each side had 54 minutes remaining. The Chair \nindicated Senator Byrd spoke twice. Senator Byrd was recognized once \nand did not relinquish the floor. I am not suggesting there was \nanything deliberate, but I think there was a misunderstanding with \nrespect to the time that should exist. I think this side should have \nhad 54 minutes based on the unanimous consent request made by the \nSenator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I also thought we had reached a unanimous \nconsent understanding that there would not be time taken off either \nside for the colloquy that Senators Byrd and Lott encountered.\n  As I understand it, the Chair ruled that the time up until the point \nthat I made the unanimous consent request was not going to be taken \nfrom either side, but the remaining time was counted against us. I was \nmaking the assumption that the entire colloquy would be left outside \nour timeframe, and I again make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I don't object, but I ask the Senator to \nwithhold because I think we have a solution to it that will be \nsatisfactory to both sides.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will withhold the unanimous consent request and look \nforward to that discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, what is the existing time now--post the \nminority leader's request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 54 minutes \nand there are 48 minutes 41 seconds on the other side.\n  Mr. HELMS. The proposal I make is that I yield back all time under \nour control with the exception of 45 minutes. This action again makes \nthe time remaining exactly equal on both sides, or at least I hope it \ndoes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. Is there \nobjection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, if that is the Senator's \nsolution, I am disappointed. We have a number of Senators who have not \nyet had the opportunity to speak. As it is, it is going to be very \ndifficult to divide what remaining time there is.\n  I renew the unanimous consent request that we be given the 54 minutes \nthat we understood we were entitled to when I made the first unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. HELMS. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HELMS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, what is the time the minority leader has \nunder his proposal?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 48 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. We have a 3-minute difference; is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Six minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. The Chair says 48 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am asking for the 54 minutes the Senate was originally \nallotting either side when this debate began.\n  Mr. HELMS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield back all time under the control with the exception \nof 45 minutes. This action, again, makes the time remaining equal on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. HELMS. If they want to object to that, let them try.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am going to ask speakers on both sides to have no \nconversation because we have very little time. I say to the Senators on \nmy side, we are limiting ourselves as far as it will go to 5 minutes \nper Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe distinguished former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S12509]]\n\n\n                                                 October 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Foreign Relations Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, I--together with former \n     National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former CIA \n     Director and Deputy Secretary of Defense John Deutch--had \n     recommended in a letter dated October 5th to Senators Lott \n     and Daschle and in an op-ed in the October 6th Washington \n     Post that a vote on ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear \n     Test Ban Treaty be postponed to permit a further discussion \n     and clarification of the issues now too controversial. This \n     having proved unachievable, I am obliged to state my \n     position.\n       As a former Secretary of State, I find the prospect that a \n     major treaty might fail to be ratified extremely painful. But \n     the subject of this treaty concerns the future security of \n     the United States and involves risks that make it impossible \n     for me to recommend voting for the treaty as it now stands.\n       My concerns are as follows:\n\n\n                     importance of nuclear weapons\n\n       For the entire postwar period, the American nuclear arsenal \n     has been America's ultimate shield and that of our allies. \n     Though we no longer face the same massive threat that we did \n     during the Cold War, new dangers have arisen. Our nuclear \n     arsenal is our principal deterrent to the possible use of \n     biological and chemical warfare against America, our \n     military, and our allies.\n\n\n                              verification\n\n       Almost all experts agree that nuclear tests below some \n     yield threshold remain unverifiable and that this \n     threshold can be raised by technical means. It seems to me \n     highly dangerous to leave such a vacuum regarding a matter \n     fundamentally affecting the security of the United States. \n     And the fact that this treaty is of indefinite duration \n     compounds the problem. The CIA's concerns about recent \n     ambiguous activities by Russia, as reported in the media, \n     illustrate difficulties that will only be compounded by \n     the passage of time.\n       Supporters of the treaty argue that, because of their small \n     yield, these tests cannot be significant and that the treaty \n     would therefore ``lock in'' our advantages vis-a-vis other \n     nuclear powers and aspirants. I do not know how they can be \n     so sure of this in an age of rapidly exploding technology and \n     whether, on the contrary, this may not work to the advantage \n     of nations seeking to close this gap. After all, victory in \n     the Cold War was achieved in part because we kept increasing, \n     and not freezing, our technological edge.\n\n\n                           nuclear stockpile\n\n       I am not a technical expert on such issues as proof \n     testing, aging of nuclear material, and reworking existing \n     warheads. But I find it impossible to ignore the concern \n     about the treaty expressed by six former Secretaries of \n     Defense and several former CIA Directors and National \n     Security Advisers. I am aware that experts from the weapons \n     laboratories have argued that there are ingenious ways to \n     mitigate these concerns. On the other hand, there is a \n     difference between the opinion of experts from laboratories \n     and policymakers' confidence in the reliability of these \n     weapons as our existing stockpile ages. When national \n     security is involved, one should not proceed in the face of \n     such doubts.\n\n\n                               sanctions\n\n       Another fundamental problem is the weakness of the \n     enforcement mechanism. In theory, we have a right to abrogate \n     the treaty when the ``supreme national survival'' is \n     involved. But this option is more theoretical than practical. \n     In a bilateral treaty, the reluctance to resort to abrogation \n     is powerful enough; in a multilateral treaty of indefinite \n     duration, this reluctance would be even more acute. It is not \n     clear how we would respond to a set of violations by an \n     individual country or, indeed, what response would be \n     meaningful or whether, say, an Iranian test could be said to \n     threaten the supreme national survival.\n\n\n                           Non-proliferation\n\n       I am not persuaded that the proposed treaty would inhibit \n     nuclear proliferation. Restraint by the major powers has \n     never been a significant factor in the decisions of other \n     nuclear aspirants, which are driven by local rivalries and \n     security needs. Nor is the behavior of rogue states such as \n     Iraq, Iran, or North Korea likely to be affected by this \n     treaty. They either will not sign or, if they sign, will \n     cheat. And countries relying on our nuclear umbrella might be \n     induced by declining confidence in our arsenal--and the \n     general impression of denuclearization--to accelerate their \n     own efforts.\n       For all these reasons, I cannot recommend a vote for a \n     comprehensive test ban of unlimited duration.\n       I hope this is helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Henry A. Kissinger.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Senate is moving toward the end of an \nhistoric confrontation against the most egregious arms control treaty \never presented to this body for its advice and consent.\n  The CTBT is a dangerous treaty which, if ratified, would do enormous \nharm to our national security. It will not and cannot accomplish its \nhighly exaggerated stated goal of halting the spread of nuclear \nweapons, because as the CIA has repeatedly made clear the CTBT cannot \nbe verified. Moreover, at the same time, it would undermine America's \nsecurity by undermining confidence in the safety and reliability of our \nnuclear arsenal.\n  It is for these reasons that the Senate is prepared to vote down this \ntreaty.\n  Unable--indeed unwilling even to try to respond to these facts, the \nWhite House has spitefully argued that Republicans are ``playing \npolitics'' with the national security of the United States--a spurious \ncharge, which is one of many reasons why the administration has failed \nto convince Senators who have raised substantive concerns.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Republicans' purpose in opposing this \ntreaty is not because we seek to score political points against a lame-\nduck administration.\n  We are opposed because the CTBT is unverifiable, and because it will \nendanger the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Those \nwho support the CTBT have failed to make a compelling case, and that, \nMr. President, is precisely why the CTBT is headed for defeat.\n  The President and his Senate allies have mouthed the charge that the \nprocess has been ``unfair''--that Republicans are ramming this vote \nthrough the Senate in what the White House has falsely asserted as a \n``blind rush to judgment.''\n  Let's examine the record: The Senate has held seven separate hearings \nexclusively on the CTBT--three in the Government Affairs Committee, \nthree in the Armed Services Committee and one final, day-long marathon \nhearing in the Foreign Relations Committee with 11 different witnesses. \nIt is instructive that, after demanding for months that the Foreign \nRelations Committee hold hearings, only a handful of Democrat Senators \neven bothered to show up.\n  As for floor debate, we scheduled 22 hours of debate on the CTBT--\nmore than any other arms control treaty in recent history. By contrast, \nthe Senate held just 6 hours of debate on Conventional Forces in Europe \nTreaty; 9\\1/2\\ hours on the START Treaty; 6 hours on the START II \ntreaty; 18 hours on the Chemical Weapons Convention; and just 2 hours \non the Conventional Forces in Europe Flank Agreement.\n  Well, then, some of them have falsely charged, Republicans pushed \ntheir unanimous-consent request through an unsuspecting Senate, on a \nFriday when few Senators were in town to discuss and consider it--a \ndemonstrably false allegation.\n  The majority leader shared our draft unanimous-consent request with \nthe minority leader on Wednesday, September 29. He offered it on the \nSenate floor the next day, Thursday, September 30. The minority \nobjected, and asked for more time to consider it. After consulting with \nthe White House, with the State Department, and with the Democrat \nCaucus, they came back with a request for more time for the debate.\n  We agreed to give them an additional week before the vote, and 12 \nadditional hours of floor debate. Then on Friday October 1--after 3 \ndays of internal discussion--they finally agreed to a unanimous consent \nfor a vote they had vociferously demanded for two full years. And they \nare complaining that we are rushing to judgment? As my friend, Senator \nBiden has often pleaded during this debate; Give me a break!\n  So the ``politics'' argument failed, and the ``process'' argument \nfailed. Now they are turning in desperation to the ``Chicken Little'' \nargument, warning us of the ``disastrous'' consequences should the \nSenate reject the CTBT.\n  If we vote the CTBT down, they warn, India and Pakistan may well \nproceed with nuclear test. Well, as Senator Biden may plead: Give me a \nbreak! That horse has already left the barn. India and Pakistan have \nalready tested. Why did they test in the first place? Because of the \nClinton administration's failed nuclear nonproliferation policies.\n  For years, India watched as Red China transferred M-11 missiles to \ntheir adversary, Pakistan. They watched as this administration stood \nby--despite incontrovertible evidence from our intelligence community \nthat such transfers were taking place--and refused to impose sanctions \non China that are required by law. As a result,\n\n[[Page S12510]]\n\nthey made an unfortunate but understandable calculation that the \nPresident of the United States is not serious about non-proliferation, \nand that this White House is unwilling to impose a real cost on \nproliferating nations.\n  The fact of the matter is that no matter how the Senate votes on the \nCTBT, nations with nuclear ambitions will continue to develop those \nweapons. Russia and China will continue their clandestine nuclear \ntesting programs.\n  North Korea will not sign or ratify the CTBT, and will continue to \nblackmail the West with its nuclear program. And India and Pakistan \nwill probably test again--no matter what we do today. Because these \nnations know that this administration is unwilling to impose any real \ncosts on such violations.\n  By defeating this treaty, the Senate will not change this calculus \none iota. We will not be giving a ``green light'' for nuclear testing. \nSuch tests by non-nuclear states are already a violation of the \ninternational norm established by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. \nThe proliferation we have witnessed in recent years has been a result \nof the administration's failure to enforce that existing norm, and \nplace a real costs on violations of that norm.\n  Mr. President, only a willingness to impose real penalties on such \nviolations will prevent the expansion of the nuclear club. Papering \nover the problem with a worthless piece of paper like the CTBT will \naccomplish nothing.\n  Let me suggest something that will happen when we defeat this treaty. \nThis administration, and future administrations, will henceforth think \ntwice before signing more bad treaties which cannot pass muster in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  This administration clearly wants the Senate's ``consent'' on \ntreaties, but they are not interested in the Senate's ``advice.'' If \nthey had asked our ``advice'' on the CTBT before they signed it, they \nwould have known well in advance that an unvertifiable, permanent, \nzero-yield ban on all nuclear tests would be defeated. They would have \nnegotiated a treaty that could be ratified.\n  Mr. President, when the debate ends today, there must be no ambiguity \nabout the status of the CTBT. The Senate must make clear that this \ntreaty is dead. Unless we vote today to explicitly reject the CTBT, \nunder customary international law the U.S. will be bound by the terms \nof this treaty. The CTBT will be effectively in force. That is an \nunacceptable outcome.\n  Why must the Senate defeat the CTBT? The answer is clear: Because the \nnext administration must be left free to establish its own nuclear \ntesting and nuclear nonproliferation policies, unencumbered by the \nfailed policies of the current, outgoing administration. We must have a \nclean break, so that the new President can re-establish American \ncredibility in the world on non-proliferation. A credibility not based \non scraps of paper, but on clear American resolve.\n  Mr. President, we must vote on this treaty and we must reject it. It \nis our duty and solemn responsibility under the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as a Member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee I sat through the day of hearings. And even in that short \ntime--and I know you and I were there together--I was thoroughly \nconvinced that our country will be more secure if we sign on and we \nratify this treaty than if we do not.\n  I think we have a very stark choice. We can continue to lead the \nworld in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons by supporting this \ntreaty or we can start a nuclear chain reaction by opposing it. I pray \nthat we will support this treaty.\n  As I said in the committee, when I was a child in grammar school--and \nI think a lot of you might remember this--America faced a real threat \nof nuclear war. In my public school we had emergency drills. We were \ntaught that if we hid underneath our desks and we covered our eyes and \nwe turned away from the windows, we would survive a nuclear strike. We \nwere taught that the wood from our desks would save us from the massive \ndestruction caused by a nuclear weapon. We also were made to wear dog \ntags around our necks. We were so proud of that. We thought we were \nbeing just like the people in the Army. We didn't realize the true \npurpose of the dog tag was so that someone could identify our body \nafter a nuclear strike.\n  The kids in my generation really didn't know that much. But the kids \nin later generations certainly did. When I was in the House, \nCongressman George Miller set up a Select Committee on Children, Youth, \nand Families. One of our first hearings was on the impact of the \nnuclear disaster that was looming ahead of our children. So we had \ntestimony from children that they feared for their lives. I do not want \nto go back to those days when the children of the 1980s feared a \nnuclear strike, or my days, when we feared a nuclear strike.\n  I have heard the concerns raised about the treaty. And, as I see it, \nthe two main arguments against the treaty are verifiability and the \ncondition of our stockpile stewardship program.\n  So like most Members of the Senate, I look at what the experts say on \nthese two issues. Last week, the Secretary of Defense testified on the \nverification issue. He said, ``I am confident that the United States \nwill be able to detect a level of testing and the yield and the number \nof tests by which a state could undermine our U.S. nuclear deterrent.''\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Henry Shelton testified, \n``The CTBT will help limit the development of more advanced and \ndestructive weapons and inhibit the ability of more countries to \nacquire nuclear weapons. In short, the world would be a safer place \nwith the treaty than without it, and it is in our national security \ninterests to ratify the CTBT treaty.'' In fact, four former Chairmen of \nthe Joint Chiefs who served under the Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton \nadministrations have come out in favor of the treaty.\n  On the condition of our nuclear stockpile, I turned to the directors \nof our three national laboratories. They all support ratification of \nthe CTBT saying ``we are confident that the Stockpile Stewardship \nprogram will enable us to maintain America's nuclear deterrent without \nnuclear testing.''\n  I've also received a letter from 32 physics Nobel Laureates in \nsupport of the CTBT. In discussing the stockpile issue, they write,\n\n       Fully informed technical studies have concluded that \n     continued nuclear testing is not required to retain \n     confidence in the safety, reliability and performance of \n     nuclear weapons in the United States' stockpile, provided \n     science and technology programs necessary for stockpile \n     stewardship are maintained.\n\n  Let me also point out that the Senate has passed an amendment to the \nresolution of ratification stating that if ``the President determines \nthat nuclear testing is necessary to assure, with a high degree of \nconfidence, the safety and reliability of the United States nuclear \nweapons stockpile, the President shall consult promptly with the Senate \nand withdraw from the Treaty . . . in order to conduct whatever testing \nmight be required.''\n  If our stockpile is not safe and reliable, the President will \nwithdraw from the treaty. There doesn't have to be a Senate vote. It's \nnot going to get bogged down in rules of the Senate. If there is a \nsupreme national interest in withdrawing from the treaty, we will \nwithdraw.\n  I also think it is important to look at the risks of not going \nforward with this treaty. How can the United States tell Pakistan, \nIndia, and China not to test their nuclear weapons if we don't ratify \nthis treaty? How can we go to our friends and say, don't give Iran the \ntechnology to produce weapons of mass destruction? I fear that our \nfailure to ratify this treaty will set off a nuclear ``chain reaction'' \nthroughout the world that the United States will long regret.\n  An editorial in the San Francisco Chronicle puts it best in saying \n``A global treaty that invites every country to step forward or face \ncondemnation is the only way to corral nuclear danger. If the world \nfeels hostile and uncertain now, wait five years without the ban.''\n  We can turn it around today if we vote for this treaty. I think there \nare many protections in it which allow the President, any President, to \nsay: We should go back to testing.\n\n[[Page S12511]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries)\n  Mr. HELMS. May we have order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in these brief moments, 5 minutes for each \nSenator--I think it is probably not a bad idea because we have had so \nmany hours and hours and hours of debate on this it is becoming \nredundant now--I would like to use this brief period of time only to \nbring out a couple of things that need to be reemphasized.\n  First of all, mistakenly--certainly not intentionally--some of the \nMembers have stood on this floor and have implied that the Directors of \nour labs are in support of this treaty. I think it is very important to \nhear a quote from one of the Directors, C. Paul Robinson, Dr. Robinson, \nfrom Sandia National Lab, speaking in behalf of all three of the \nDirectors.\n  He said:\n\n       I and others [that's the other three] who are or have been \n     responsible for the safety and reliability of the U.S. \n     stockpile of nuclear weapons have testified to this obvious \n     conclusion many times in the past. To forgo that validation \n     through testing is, in short, to live with uncertainty.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       If the United States scrupulously restricts itself to zero \n     yield while other nations may conduct experiments up to the \n     threshold of international detectability, we will be at an \n     intolerable disadvantage.\n\n  I can't think of anything worse than to be at an intolerable \ndisadvantage.\n  Second, it has been implied that all these Presidents have been for \nit in the past, Eisenhower and Bush, and everyone has been for this \ntreaty. In fact, this is not true. I am sure those who stated it \nthought it was true, but it is not true. Only President Clinton has \ncome forth with a treaty that is a zero-yield treaty--that is no \ntesting at all--that is unlimited in duration--not 10 years as it was \nin the case of Eisenhower--and unverifiable. So this is the first time. \nIt would be unprecedented if this were to happen.\n  Third, I hear so many objections as to the unfairness. It doesn't \nreally matter how much time there has been devoted for the debate on \nthis. Everyone out there, Democrats or Republicans, any one person \ncould have stopped this. This was a unanimous consent. It is true we \nhad three times the time that was allocated for debate on the CFE \ntreaty, twice the time on the START I, three times the time that was \nallocated on START II. That is important, of course. It shows that we \ndid give adequate time. But the point is, any Senator could have \nobjected. That means every Senator endorsed this schedule by which this \nwas going to be handled.\n  With the remaining minute that I have, let me just say, as chairman \nof the readiness committee, I have a very serious concern. We have \nstood on the floor of this Senate and have tried to stop the President \nof the United States, this President, Bill Clinton, from vetoing our \ndefense authorization bills going back to and including 1993, stating \nin his veto message that he doesn't want any money for a National \nMissile Defense System. He has fought us all the way. We would have had \none deployed by fiscal year 1998 except for his vetoes. But he has \nvetoed it. That means that there is no deterrent left except a nuclear \ndeterrent. That means if a missile comes over, we can't knock the \nmissile down so we have to rely on our ability to have a nuclear \ndeterrent in our stockpile that works. And all the experts have said \nthey don't work now. We can't tell for sure whether they work now.\n  We have stood on the floor of this Senate with a chart that shows, on \nall nine of the nuclear weapons, as to whether or not they are working \ntoday. We do not really know because we haven't tested in 7 years. \nTesting is necessary. We would be putting ourselves in a position where \nwe have no missile defense so we have to rely on a nuclear deterrent. \nWe don't know whether or not that nuclear deterrent works.\n  Last, I would say I wasn't real sure what the minority leader was \ntalking about when he talked about article 18 of the Vienna Convention. \nI will just read it one more time so we know if we do not kill this and \nkill it now, we are going to have to live under it. It states:\n\n       A State is obliged to refrain from arguments which would \n     defeat the object and purpose of a treaty when it has signed \n     the treaty or has exchanged instruments constituting the \n     treaty subject to ratification, acceptance or approval, until \n     it shall have made its intentions clear not to become a party \n     to the treaty.\n\n  That is what this is all about. We are the Senate that is going to \nreject this treaty.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to ratify the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If two-thirds of this body fails to \nratify the treaty, we are squandering a unique opportunity to make the \nworld a safer place for our children.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is really quite simple: It bans all \nnuclear explosives testing for weapons or any other purposes. This \ntreaty does not ban nuclear weapons. We currently have some 6,000 \nnuclear weapons in our arsenal. Nothing in this treaty requires us to \ngive up these weapons. Nor does the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nrequire us to limit our own nuclear testing in a way that we have not \nalready chosen to do unilaterally. Yet, opponents of the treaty have \npainted a picture of dire consequences and doom that requires a \nresponse.\n  The history of the 20th century is replete with lessons about the \ndanger posed to us by nuclear weapons. Those of us who remember when \nthe United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki \ntowards the end of World War II are vividly aware of the consequences \nof the use of nuclear weapons. Nuclear arms are not a dry topic for \npolicy debate. They are devastating weapons that have been used and \ncould be used again by any nation that currently possesses nuclear \nweapons or the capability to develop them.\n  It was not so long ago that we were in the midst of a nuclear arms \nrace during the Cold War. Those of us who remember the Cuban missile \ncrisis and the palpable fear that swept across the country at that time \nare well aware of the dangerous potential for a crisis to escalate \nbetween nations with nuclear capabilities. Yet in the midst of the Cold \nWar, we were able to negotiate the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty which \nprohibits nuclear explosions for weapons testing in the atmosphere, \nouter space and under water.\n  Must we be on the brink of crisis or engaged in another arms race to \nrecognize the value of a nuclear test ban treaty? The Berlin Wall may \nhave fallen and the Cold War may be over but the possibility of new and \nthreatening nuclear powers emerging in the next century must still \ninform our national security policy. Our formidable stockpile of \nweapons may serve as a deterrent to the current nuclear weapon states, \nbut far more frightening is the prospect of nuclear weapons falling \ninto the hands of a rogue nation or terrorist organization.\n  There is no question that a world without nuclear weapons is a safer \none. However, we have long moved beyond that point. Rather, we have \npursued--for the most part in a bipartisan fashion--arms control \nagreements and policies to stem the spread of nuclear weapons. Thus, it \ndefies logic that the Senate would not embrace this tool to help us \nensure that there are fewer nuclear weapons and fewer advanced nuclear \nweapons. Without nuclear explosive testing, those attempting to acquire \nnew nuclear weapons cannot be confident that these weapons will work as \nintended. Banning testing is tantamount to banning the development of \nnuclear weapons.\n  Since the signing of the CTBT treaty, 154 states have signed the \ntreaty and 51 have ratified it. A smaller group of 44 states which have \nnuclear power reactors or nuclear research reactors and are members of \nthe Conference on Disarmament are required to ratify the treaty for it \nto go into force. Of this group, 41 have signed the treaty and 26 have \nratified it. Today, only five countries are nuclear weapons states and \nonly three countries are considered to be nuclear ``threshold'' states. \nLimiting nuclear explosive testing is the key to keeping the number of \nnuclear weapon states down.\n  For those of my colleagues who see no value in pursuing arms control \nand policies to limit the development of nuclear weapons--weapons that \none day may be directed toward us or our allies I say that you are out \nof step with the American people. Arms control does not compromise our \nnational\n\n[[Page S12512]]\n\nsecurity: it bolsters it. Polling on this issue and other arms control \nissues indicate that the American people recognize that we are safer if \nthere are fewer nuclear arms in the world, especially when we continue \nto have the most robust conventional and nuclear forces in the world.\n  Indeed, the CTBT locks in our nuclear superiority, for it is the U.S. \ngovernment that has conducted more nuclear explosive tests than any \nother nation. We are integrating the knowledge acquired during our \n1000-plus tests with ongoing non-nuclear testing and the science-based \nStockpile Stewardship program to monitor the reliability of our \nweapons. Although some critics have described this approach as risky \nand incomplete, the three directors of our nuclear weapons labs have \nall affirmed that this approach is sufficient to maintain the safety \nand reliability of our stockpile. And, they will continue to review \nthese findings on an annual basis.\n  Should the lab directors be unable to vouch for the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear weapons, I have no doubt that they will \nadvise the President accordingly. For the safeguards package \naccompanying the treaty, and reflecting current U.S. policy relative to \nthe treaty, states that the CTBT is conditioned on:\n\n       The understanding that if the President of the United \n     States is informed by the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Secretary of Energy (DOE)--advised by the Nuclear Weapons \n     Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories \n     and the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command--that a high \n     level of confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear \n     weapon type which the two Secretaries consider to be critical \n     to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified, the \n     President, in consultation with Congress, would be prepared \n     to withdraw from the CTBT under the standard ``supreme \n     national interests'' clause in order to conduct whatever \n     testing might be required.\n\n  In fact, opponents argue that this treaty cannot restrain nations \nfrom testing nuclear weapons because there is nothing to prevent \nnations from withdrawing from the treaty. That is the case, of course, \nfor all international treaties. While there are no guarantees that this \ntreaty will stop nations from testing, signing the CTBT makes it more \ndifficult for a nation to conduct nuclear tests. A nation must balance \nits desire to conduct nuclear tests with the likelihood it will be \nsubject to international condemnation. Will we be able to overcome \ninternational pressure should the President be advised that we need to \nconduct nuclear explosive tests again? I am hopeful we will never reach \nthat point, but given the willingness of some members to reject this \ntreaty today, I don't believe that international pressure will prevent \nus from heeding the advice of our nation's nuclear weapons experts.\n  We have heard much over the last few days from those who say that we \nshould reject the CTBT because the treaty is not verifiable. Yes, there \nare some nuclear tests we will not be able to verify, particularly at \nthe lowest levels. This would be the case whether the treaty was in \nforce or not. There is a strong case to be made, however, that tests \ndifficult to verify are at low enough levels to render them militarily \ninsignificant. Treaty opponents also neglect to mention that we are \nworse off in our ability to monitor nuclear testing around the world \nwithout the CTBT. As Secretary Cohen stated in his testimony to the \nArmed Services Committee last week, ``I think that our capacity to \nverify tests will be enhanced and increased under the treaty by virtue \nof the fact that we'd have several hundred more monitoring sites across \nthe globe that will aid and assist our national technical means.''\n\n  If we fail to ratify the CTBT not only are we squandering an \nopportunity to advance our own national security interests by limiting \nnuclear testing, but we are at risk of undermining everything we have \nachieved until now to stem the spread of nuclear weapons. As Paul \nNitze, President Reagan's arms control negotiator, explained:\n\n       If the CTBT is not ratified in a timely manner it will \n     gravely undermine U.S. non-proliferation policy. The Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the primary tool for \n     preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, was made permanent \n     in 1995 based on a firm commitment by the United States and \n     the other nuclear weapon states to negotiate a CTBT by 1996. \n     Violation of the spirit, if not the letter of this NPT \n     related commitment of 1995 could give nations an excuse to \n     withdraw from the Treaty, potentially causing the NPT regime \n     to begin to erode and allowing fears of widespread \n     acquisition of nuclear weapons by many nations to become \n     reality.\n       By taking away the most significant weapon in the battle to \n     prevent their spread, failure to ratify the CTBT would \n     fundamentally weaken our national security and facilitate the \n     spread of nuclear weapons. Instead of being a leader in the \n     fight against nuclear proliferation, the United States would \n     have itself struck a blow against the NPT.\n\n  Our military leaders have also been advocates for the CTBT. The \ncurrent Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff echoed Mr. Nitze's \nremarks when he said in his testimony last week, ``The CTBT will help \nlimit the development of more advanced and destructive weapons and \ninhibit the ability of more countries to acquire nuclear weapons. In \nshort, the world will be a safer place with the treaty than without it, \nand it is in our national security interests to ratify the CTBT \ntreaty.'' Four of the previous five chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff support our ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  The CTBT is not the product of one administration. Rather it is the \nculmination of the work and ideas of several administrations. The \ndecision to place a moratorium on nuclear testing was first made in \n1992, by President George Bush when he announced a five-year moratorium \non tests to develop new warheads, and then when he signed legislation \ncontaining the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment banning nuclear testing \nfor at least one year. That testing moratorium has been maintained by \nPresident Clinton. And, none of the major presidential candidates have \nsaid that they are prepared to end this moratorium and begin conducting \nnuclear tests.\n  This treaty is not a Democratic treaty: It was President Eisenhower \nwho said that the failure to achieve a nuclear test ban was one of \ngreatest disappointments of his administration. And it was President \nEisenhower who said, ``This Government has stood, throughout, for \ncomplete abolition of weapons testing subject only to the attainment of \nagreed and adequate methods of inspection and control.'' Mr. President, \nthat day has arrived.\n  This treaty is an American achievement. It was American determination \nand leadership that brought the CTBT negotiations to conclusion, and it \nis American leadership which invigorates international arms control \nefforts in general. I support these efforts.\n  The debate we are having is being watched around the world. Our \nallies are dumbfounded that we are on the verge of defeating the CTBT \nand so am I.\n  I deplore the partisanship which has underscored this debate. This \ntreaty is not about politics. I urge my colleagues to review the merits \nof this treaty in a non-partisan fashion. It is clear from the partisan \ndivide that this issue is very much caught up in the politics of this \ninstitution. So, I wish we had put off further debate and a vote on \nratification for another day and give the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nthe unbiased scrutiny it deserves.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have followed the Senate's consideration \nof the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty with great interest, and am \nimpressed particularly with the statement made last Thursday by Senator \nLugar--whose experience and knowledge on matters of foreign affairs and \nnational security is highly respected by both Republicans and \nDemocrats. I associate myself completely with his views.\n  I agree with Senator Lugar that this treaty is unverifiable, \njeopardizes our national security by eliminating our ability to \nmodernize and increase the safety of our existing weapons, and will \nfail to achieve its principal goal: to provoke a roll call of countries \nthat the simple phrase ``rogue nations'' conjures up in the minds of \nall Americans (North Korea, Iraq, and Iran, as well as China, Russia, \nIndia, and Pakistan) to refrain from engaging in nuclear testing.\n  First, I join Senator Lugar in expressing my regret that the Senate \nis considering the treaty at this time. It has been my strong \npreference that consideration of the treaty take place after the \nelection of the next President. President Clinton's record on this \ntreaty has been one of political maneuvering and a legacy quest, with \nshockingly little attention dedicated to how this treaty serves our \nnation's\n\n[[Page S12513]]\n\nsecurity and foreign policy objectives. But the timing of the debate \nand its duration are both the results of demands by the President and \nSenate Democratic leader.\n  My support for allowing a new President, should he or she support the \ntreaty, to make his case to the Senate based upon its merits and that \nadministration's broad foreign policy goals, however, does not mean I \nam not fully prepared to vote against the treaty if the vote takes \nplace at this time.\n  Senator Lugar presented a thoughtful and well-reasoned, though \ndevastating, indictment of the treaty: the treaty will prevent the \nUnited States from ensuring the reliability, effectiveness and safety \nof our nation's nuclear deterrent, which means we will not be able to \nequip our existing weapons with the most modern safety and security \nmeasures available; the treaty is not verifiable--not only due to our \nsimple technical inability effectively to monitor for tests, but due to \nthe lack of agreement on what tests are permitted or not permitted \nunder the treaty and the cumbersome, international bureaucracy that \nmust be forged to conduct an inspection if tests are suspected; and, \nmost importantly, that the treaty is unenforceable, lacking any \neffective means to respond to nations that violate the Treaty's \nconditions. As Senator Lugar  stated, ``This Treaty simply has no \nteeth. . . . The CTBT's answer to illegal nuclear testing is the \npossible implementation of sanctions. . . . For those countries seeking \nnuclear weapons, the perceived benefits in international stature and \ndeterrence generally far outweigh the concern about sanctions that \ncould be brought to bear by the international community.''\n  As I have already said, this debate is premature. It may well be that \nthe passage of years and the development of our own technology might \nmake ratification of the treaty advisable. It is not so today by a wide \nmargin. I must, therefore, vote against ratification in the absence of \nan enforceable agreement to leave the issue to the next President.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I come here today to ask a question, a \nquestion that is a mystery to the vast majority of Americans: Why will \nthe United States Senate not ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty?\n  If there were any issue debated in the history of this Senate that \ncalled for more sober reflection, more independent thought, it is how \nto end the proliferation and testing of nuclear weapons. This may be \nthe greatest burden the United States will carry into the next \nmillennium.\n  The United States was the first nation to develop and test nuclear \narms. More than a half century ago we were the first, and so far only, \nnation to use those arms. Three years ago we were the first nation to \nsign this treaty that takes a step back from a nuclear-armed world.\n  No other nation in the world can possibly gain more than the United \nStates does from this treaty.\n  The treaty holds real promise for putting an end to the international \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons. It removes the ability of belligerent \nnations to enhance their nuclear stockpile. It removes the ability to \nuse nuclear test explosions to bully and threaten their neighbors. It \nremoves the incentive to throw much-needed capital into an insatiable \nand wasteful weapons program.\n  The American people understand this simple logic better than some in \nthis body. Over 84% of the American public understands that ratifying \nthe CTBT is the best way to protect the United States against the \nthreat of nuclear attack by other nations. They are not talking about \ndefensive missiles, they are talking about an America where their \nchildren won't have to grow up as they did; under the shadow of nuclear \nannihilation. This treaty, they understand, is a first step toward that \ngoal.\n  President Dwight D. Eisenhower was a five star general as well as a \ntwo term President of the United States. He led men in wartime against \na real, living threat to the security of the United States. He led \nAmerica at the beginning of the cold war, at the most dangerous time \nfor nuclear confrontation in our history. He had a unique understanding \nof the needs and necessities of national security, an understanding \nthat I don't believe any member of this chamber can pretend to possess. \nHis view of a nuclear test ban treaty was this: that the failure to \nachieve such a ban, when the opportunity presented itself would ``have \nto be classed as the greatest disappointment of any administration, of \nany decade, of any time, and of any party.''\n  Opponents of this treaty say we are letting down our guard, that we \nare leaving ourselves open to be overwhelmed. President Eisenhower \nunderstood clearly and personally the dangers of failing to prepare for \nwar. But it was precisely this experience with war that led him to \nconceive of the test ban as a means of preserving the safety and \nsecurity of the American people.\n  This clear and rational thinking has continued, at least with our \nsenior military leaders. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is \nresponsible for our entire national defense infrastructure. It is his \nduty to the American people to insure that our military forces, nuclear \nand conventional, are strong, prepared and able to provide for the \ncommon defense. Our current Chairman, General Hugh Shelton, and Former \nChairmen General Colin Powell, Admiral William Crowe, General John \nShalikashvili, and General David Jones all believe firmly that, for the \nsafety and security of the American people, the CTBT must be ratified.\n\n  President Bush signed into law a ban on American nuclear testing in \n1992. As a matter of fact, we have not conducted a nuclear test for \nseven years. We have already stopped running this race.\n  Has this test ban, already in place domestically for the better part \nof a decade, harmed our nuclear stockpile? The President says no, our \nmilitary leaders say no, and the men whose responsibility it is to \nmaintain the weapons say no. The CTBT has the support of all of the \ndirectors of our national labs whose first responsibility is to ensure \nthat our nuclear weapons stockpile functions safely and reliably far \ninto the future. They confidently believe this treaty, and the \ncontinuation of the test ban, is in our national interest.\n  It's been seven years since we have conducted a nuclear test. We are \nno less safe then we were a decade ago. No one who is qualified to make \nthe judgment believes that we need to resume testing in the future.\n  What would passage of this treaty mean? Without test explosions, a \nnew nuclear state cannot know that their crude bombs will work. Only \nvery recently, after decades, over one thousand tests, and thousands of \nnuclear bombs manufactured, did our bomb making experts feel confident \nenough to proceed without testing. Without testing no other state can \nachieve that level of confidence.\n  While testing continues there is always the possibility that a nation \nwill develop a bomb that is smaller and more easily concealed, the \nperfect weapon with which to attack a superpower like the United \nStates, perhaps even without fear of relation. Missile defenses cannot \nstop a bomb carried over our borders, but an end to testing can stop \nthat bomb before it is even made.\n  What would the failure of Senate ratification of the CTBT mean? \nFailure by the Senate to ratify the Treaty would mean a future full of \nnew and more dangerous weapons. It would make infinitely more difficult \na new effort to prevent the proliferation and use of nuclear arms. \nThose states that are currently non-nuclear trust that, in exchange for \nnot attempting to acquire or develop nuclear arms, the current nuclear \nstates will cease using their own.\n  The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the cornerstone of our efforts \nto prevent the worldwide spread of nuclear weapons, was indefinitely \nextended in 1995. It was extended with the promise that the CTBT would \nbe ratified by the worlds' nuclear powers. If we defeat this treaty, we \nwill be breaking that promise, and putting our entire world-wide non-\nproliferation strategy in jeopardy.\n  If we cannot commit to cease testing, we cannot expect other nations \nto adhere to their commitments on nuclear non-proliferation. When one \nnation tests nuclear arms, their neighbors get nervous. They are \njustifiably concerned for their defense and security. The natural \nresponse to this threat, for which there is no real defense, is to \nacquire a threat of ones own.\n\n[[Page S12514]]\n\n  A rejection of this treaty by the U.S. Senate would send a chilling \nmessage around the world. The tests by India and Pakistan earlier this \nyear highlight another, more sinister motivation for nuclear tests, the \ndesire to threaten and intimidate. How do we expect nations like India \nand Pakistan to react to the Senate's rejection of this treaty?\n  For 50 some years we have lived under a gruesome umbrella known as \nMutual Assured Destruction. This grim strategic relationship between \nthe Soviet Union and the United States meant that the entire world \nlived under constant threat of global thermonuclear war. In times of \ngreat international tension we were a hair trigger away from unleashing \nthat destruction. If the treaty fails we must contemplate the prospect \nof dozens of states facing each other in the same insane standoff--in \nAsia, in the Middle East, in Africa--over disputed borders, scarce \nresources and ancient hatreds.\n  The opponents of this treaty say we cannot afford the risk that \nanother nation might have the skill and luck required to sneak a couple \nof nuclear tests under a world-wide monitoring regime. They believe \nthat possibility is a mortal danger to the United States and the \nadvances we have made in over 1,000 nuclear tests. I say we cannot \nafford the risk of another 50 years of the unfettered development of \nnuclear weapons around the world.\n  Our stockpile is secure, our deterrent is in place. The United States \ndoes not need to test as we have witnessed over the past seven years.\n  We unleashed the nuclear genie that has hung over the world for the \nlast 50 years. But in that moment of leadership, when we signed the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, we took a strong step toward making the \nworld a safer place. Let us today take the next step toward a safer, \nmore secure future.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senator from Illinois \nclaimed that President Bush supported a moratorium on nuclear testing. \nThis assertion is inaccurate. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record President Bush's statement upon signing the Fiscal Year \n1993 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, on October 2, \n1992.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement on Signing the Energy and Water Development Appropriations \n                       Act, 1993, October 2, 1992\n\n       Today I have signed into law H.R. 5373, the ``Energy and \n     Water Development Appropriations Act, 1993,'' The Act \n     provides funding for the Department of Energy. The Act also \n     provides funds for the water resources development activities \n     of the Corps of Engineers and the Department of the \n     Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, as well as funds for \n     various related independent agencies such as the Appalachian \n     Regional Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and \n     the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n       I am pleased that the Congress has provided funding for the \n     Superconducting super collider (SSC). This action will help \n     us to maintain U.S. leadership in the field of high-energy \n     physics. SSC-related research has spawned, and will continue \n     to spawn, advances in many fields of technology, including \n     accelerators, cryogenics, superconductivity, and computing. \n     The program serves as a national resource for inspiring \n     students to pursue careers in math and science. SSC related \n     work will support 7,000 first tier jobs in the United States. \n     In addition, 23,000 contracts have been awarded to businesses \n     and universities around the country.\n       I must, however, note a number of objectionable provisions \n     in the Act. Specifically, Section 507 of H.R. 5373, which \n     concerns nuclear testing, is highly objectionable. It may \n     prevent the United States from conducting underground nuclear \n     tests that are necessary to maintain a safe and reliable \n     nuclear deterrent. This provision unwisely restricts the \n     number and purpose of U.S. nuclear tests and will make future \n     U.S. nuclear testing dependent on actions by another country, \n     rather than on our own national security requirements. \n     Despite the dramatic reductions in nuclear arsenals, the \n     United States continues to rely on nuclear deterrence as an \n     essential element of our national security. We must ensure \n     that our forces are as safe and reliable as possible. To do \n     so, we must continue to conduct a minimal number of \n     underground nuclear tests, regardless of the actions of other \n     countries. Therefore, I will work for new legislation to \n     permit the conduct of a modest number of necessary \n     underground nuclear tests.\n       In July 1992, I adopted a new nuclear testing policy to \n     reflect the changes in the international security environment \n     and in the size and nature of our nuclear deterrent. That \n     policy imposed strict new limits on the purpose, number, and \n     yield of U.S. nuclear tests, consistent with our national \n     security and safety requirements and with our international \n     obligations. It remains the soundest approach to U.S. nuclear \n     testing.\n       Sections 304 and 505 of the Act also raise constitutional \n     concerns. Section 304 would establish certain racial, ethnic, \n     and gender criteria for businesses and other organizations \n     seeking Federal funding for the development, construction, \n     and operation of the Superconducting super collider. A \n     congressional grant of Federal money or benefits based solely \n     on the recipient's race, ethnicity, or gender is \n     presumptively unconstitutional under the equal protection \n     standards of the Constitution.\n       Accordingly, I will construe this provision consistently \n     with the demands of the Constitution and, in particular, \n     monies appropriated by this Act cannot be awarded solely on \n     the basis of race, ethnicity, or gender.\n       Section 505 of the Act provides that none of the funds \n     appropriated by this or any other legislation may be used to \n     conduct studies concerning ``the possibility of changing from \n     the currently required `at cost' to a `market rate' or any \n     other noncost-based method for the pricing of hydroelectric \n     power'' by Federal power authorities.\n       Article II, section 3, of the Constitution grants the \n     President authority to recommend to the Congress any \n     legislative measures considered ``necessary and expedient.'' \n     Accordingly, in keeping with the well-settled obligation to \n     construe statutory provisions to avoid constitutional \n     questions, I will interpret section 505 so as not to infringe \n     on the Executive's authority to conduct studies that might \n     assist in the evaluation and preparation of such measures.\n                                                      George Bush.\n       The White House.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I emphasize the following excerpt from President Bush's \nstatement:\n\n       Despite the dramatic reductions in nuclear arsenals, the \n     United States continues to rely on nuclear deterrence as an \n     essential element of our national security. We must ensure \n     that our forces are as safe and reliable as possible. To do \n     so, we must continue to conduct a minimal number of \n     underground nuclear tests, regardless of the actions of other \n     countries.\n\n  The moratorium on testing to which the Senator from Illinois referred \nwas not requested by President Bush. It was enacted by Congress as the \nHatfield, Exon, Mitchell prohibition on testing, over President Bush's \nobjections. In a subsequent report to Congress, the President responded \nto this prohibition as follows:\n\n       * * * the administration has concluded that it is not \n     possible to develop a test program within the constraints of \n     Public Law 102-377 [the FY '93 Energy and Water \n     Appropriations Act] that would be fiscally, militarily, and \n     technically responsible. The requirement to maintain and \n     improve the safety of our nuclear stockpile and to evaluate \n     and maintain the reliability of U.S. forces necessitates \n     continued nuclear testing for those purposes, albeit at a \n     modest level, for the foreseeable future. The administration \n     strongly urges the Congress to modify this legislation \n     urgently in order to permit the minimum number and kind of \n     underground nuclear tests that the United States requires, \n     regardless of the action of other States, to retain safe, \n     reliable, although dramatically reduced deterrent forces.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has far \nreaching domestic and international security implications, and it \ndeserves the most thorough and thoughtful consideration by the Senate. \nLike my colleagues, I have followed the CTBT, and have paid close \nattention to the number of hearings that have taken place in recent \ndays, and over the last few years.\n  Let me begin by saying that if I thought supporting this treaty would \nmake the threat of nuclear war disappear, and give us all greater \nsecurity from these lethal weapons, I would not hesitate in giving my \nsupport. Unfortunately, the facts do not demonstrate this; indeed, \nimplementing this treaty will very likely increase danger to U.S. \ncitizens and troops. For that reason, I am obligated to oppose \nratification.\n  Ratification of the CTBT would prohibit the United States from \nconducting explosive tests of nuclear weapons of any kind. In spite of \nCTBT's goal of curbing the proliferation and development of nuclear \nweapons by prohibiting their testing, it is a dangerous and flawed \nagreement that would undercut U.S. national security.\n  American foreign policy must be based on decisions and actions that \nunquestionably enhance the national security interests of the United \nStates, and nothing less. Our foreign policy cannot be based on a view \nof the world through rose colored glasses. Decisions must be made on \nthe assessment of the clear and present dangers to the United States \nnow and in the future. Let me reiterate some of those dangers \nconfronting U.S. citizens today.\n\n[[Page S12515]]\n\n  There are twenty-five to thirty countries that have sought or are \nseeking and developing ballistic missiles. Last August, North Korea \nflight-tested a long-range missile over Japan, demonstrating its \npotential to strike Alaska or Hawaii in the near future. Although our \ndecisive victory in the Gulf War demonstrated to many of our \nadversaries that a challenge on the battlefield would be foolish, \nhostile states now seek to offset our conventional force strength \nthrough the development of their own nuclear weapons programs. Does \nthis Administration really believe that if the U.S. ceased to test, \nnations like North Korea, Libya, or Iran would end nuclear development? \nThe dangers to the United States are very real and threats continue to \ngrow.\n  The center of U.S. defense policy is deterrence. Key to that \ndeterrence is the credible threat of retaliation against those who \nwould harm the U.S. and her citizens. This threat can only remain \ncredible if our stockpile of weapons is reliable and modernized. CTBT \nruns counter to this objective.\n  Nuclear tests are the only demonstrated way to assure confidence in \nthe reliability and safety of our nuclear weapons. The CTBT will \ndiminish our ability to fix problems within the nuclear stockpile and \nmake safety improvements. We have long relied on testing these \nextremely complicated weapons to demonstrate both their safety and \neffectiveness.\n  The Clinton Administration falsely claims that every Administration \nsince Eisenhower has supported CTBT. What the President fails to say is \nthat no other Administration has sought a test ban at zero yield like \nthe current Administration. Frankly, this is a dangerous proposition \nfor the reliability and safety of our arsenal. Former Secretary of \nDefense, James Schlesinger, explained the problem:\n\n       * * * new components or components of slightly different \n     materials must be integrated into weapon designs that we \n     deployed earlier. As this process goes on over the years, a \n     simple question arises: Will this design still work?\n       That is why reliability testing is essential. As time \n     passes, as the weapon is retrofitted, we must be absolutely \n     confident that this modified device will still induce the \n     proper nuclear reaction. That is why non-nuclear testing, as \n     valuable as it is, is insufficient. It is why talk of a test \n     ban with zero nuclear yield is irresponsible.\n\n  Mr. Schlesinger's point is well taken. Make no mistake, the effects \nof a zero yield test ban will be catastrophic for U.S. security \ninterests.\n  The CTBT would also make it very extremely difficult to meet new \nweapons requirements. Throughout American military history, advances in \nair defense and anti-submarine warfare have created a need for new \nweapons, and testing has saved the lives of U.S. airmen. For example, \nnuclear testing was required to make the B83 bomb of the B-1B aircraft \nto allow the plane to drop its payload at a low altitude and high speed \nand escape the pending explosion. The bottom line is a test ban would \nharm modernization efforts, and jeopardize the lives of our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  Furthermore, the CTBT will do nothing to stop proliferation, even if \ntesting is thwarted. This treaty is based on the flawed assumption that \nprohibiting nuclear testing will stop rogue nations from developing \nnuclear weapons. However, this assumption fails to acknowledge that \nrogue nations could likely be satisfied with crude devices that may or \nmay not hit intended targets. Killing innocent civilians does not seem \nto be a concern of leaders like Saddam Hussein of Iraq or Kim Jong-Il \nof North Korea. The only thing predictable about rogue nations is their \nunpredictability. Lack of testing is not a security guarantee. South \nAfrica and Pakistan long maintained an untested arsenal, in spite of \nbold nuclear aspirations. To presume that absence of nuclear test \nequals enhanced security is dangerous proposition.\n  It is also very disturbing that ratification of this treaty would \nabandon a fundamental arms control principle that has been insisted \nupon for the last two decades--that the United States must be able to \n``effectively verify'' compliance with the terms of the treaty. \nVerification has meant that the United States intelligence is able to \ndetect a breach in an arms control agreement in time to respond \nappropriately and assure preservation of our national security \ninterests.\n  Because the CTBT bans nuclear test explosions no matter how small \ntheir yield, it is impossible to verify. Low-yield underground tests \nare very difficult to detect with seismic monitors. In previous \nAdministrations, CTBT negotiations focused on agreements that allowed \nexplosions below a certain threshold because it is impossible to verify \nbelow those levels. As the CTBT is impossible to verify, cheating will \noccur, and U.S. security will be undermined.\n  Mr. President, I stand with all Americans today in expressing concern \nabout the growing nuclear threat across the globe. The real question \nbefore us is whether ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nwill increase our own national security. Unfortunately, the answer is \nno. The sad truth about the CTBT is that it would be counterproductive \nand dangerous to America's national security. Moreover, I think the \nSenate must recognize that the implications of ratification of the CTBT \nis ultimate nuclear disarmament of the United States. If the U.S. \ncannot maintain a safe and reliable stockpile, and is barred from \ntesting them, disarmament will be the de facto policy. The United \nStates cannot afford this dangerous consequence. Nuclear deterrence has \nprotected America's national and security interests in the midst of a \nvery hostile world. I urge my colleagues to vote against this treaty.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the United States Senate has the \nopportunity to take another important step in ridding the world of the \nthreat of nuclear war by ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty (CTBT). It was three years ago when the United States joined \nnations from around the world in signing a treaty banning nuclear \nexplosives testing. It is up to the Senate to ratify this treaty and \nre-establish the United States as the world leader in efforts to stop \nnuclear proliferation.\n  Over forty years ago, President Dwight D. Eisenhower began an effort \nto end nuclear testing. During this time, the United States and five \nother nations conducted 2,046 nuclear test explosions--or an average of \none nuclear test every nine days. The United States has not tested a \nnuclear weapon since 1992 when Congress and President Bush agreed to a \nmoratorium on nuclear testing.\n  Countries who sign the CTBT agree to stop all above-ground and under-\nground nuclear testing. The treaty also sets up an extensive system of \nmonitors and on-site inspections to help ensure that countries adhere \nto the treaty. Finally, the treaty includes six ``safeguards'' proposed \nby the President; the most important of which, allows the United States \nto remove itself from the conditions of the treaty at any point the \nCongress and the President determine it would be in the Nation's \ninterest to resume nuclear testing. The current Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nnumerous former military leaders, and an equal number of acclaimed \nnuclear scientists and nobel laureates support ratification of the \nCTBT.\n  My support for the CTBT comes with an understanding of the \nlimitations associated with stopping countries and rogue nations from \ndeveloping, testing, and deploying nuclear weapons. Opponents of the \nCTBT claim that it is not a perfect document and therefore threatens \nthe security of our Nation. While I agree that the CTBT is not the \ndefinitive answer in stopping nuclear proliferation, I contend that it \nis an important step in the ongoing process to prevent nuclear war in \nthe future.\n  The CTBT will not threaten our national security. Most importantly, \nthe treaty bans the ``bang'', not the ``bomb.'' The United States \nalready possesses the largest and most advanced nuclear weapons \nstockpile in the world. I agree that maintaining a strong nuclear \ndeterrent is in our country's national security interest. Data \ncollected from over 40 years of nuclear testing, coupled with advanced \nscientific computing will ensure the reliability and safety of our \nnuclear weapons without testing. As I mentioned before, the United \nStates can also withdraw from the CTBT at any time to conduct whatever \ntesting our country feels is necessary.\n  In fact, the CTBT will enhance our national security. The CTBT will \nlimit the ability of other countries to acquire nuclear capabilities, \nand it will\n\n[[Page S12516]]\n\nseverely constrain the programs of countries that currently have \nnuclear weapons. With or without the CTBT, the United States has a \ncritical national security requirement to monitor global testing \nactivities. Verification requirements built into the CTBT will provide \nour country with access to additional monitoring stations we would not \notherwise have. For example, the CTBT requires the installation of over \n30 monitoring stations in Russia, 11 in China, and 17 in the Middle \nEast. These are in addition to the on-site inspections of nuclear \nfacilities that are also allowed under the treaty.\n  Additional monitoring stations and on-site inspections are only \neffective if the countries we are most concerned with actually ratify \nthe treaty. Granted, there is no guarantee that the United States' \nratification of the CTBT will automatically mean that India, Pakistan, \nChina, and Russia will follow suit. However, it is an even greater \nchance that these countries will be less inclined to ratify the treaty \nif our country does not take the lead. For those who doubt the \nlikelihood of other countries ratifying the CTBT, I point to the \nexample of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). It can not be refuted \nthat the United States ratification of the CWC facilitated ratification \nby Russia, China, Pakistan, and Iran. Ratification by the United States \nis required to bring the CTBT into force, and ratification by the \nUnited States will strengthen our diplomatic efforts to influence other \nstates to sign and ratify the treaty.\n  The CTBT will not rid the world of nuclear weapons and it may not \neven prevent all nations from conducting some kind of nuclear tests. \nHowever, the CTBT provides the best tool available for the United \nStates to continue its efforts to combat nuclear proliferation without \njeopardizing our own national security. I urge my Senate colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this important treaty and restoring America's \nleadership on this issue.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the Senate's responsibility for advice and \nconsent on treaties places a grave responsibility on the institution \nand its members. There is a very high bar that treaties have to meet, a \ntwo-thirds vote in the Senate. That is for good reason. Our nation \ntakes our treaty obligations seriously, and the Senate is the final \ncheck on flawed or premature commitments. While I support the goal of \ncontrolling nuclear proliferation, it is becoming clear the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is not in the best interests of \nthis nation.\n  After a meeting with the President, personal discussions with some of \nour nation's top diplomats, including former Secretary of State Henry \nKissinger, and participation in hearings held by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I harbor reservations about this treaty in its current form \nand question if it would truly be in the nation's best strategic \ninterest as we move into the 21st Century.\n  Specifically, the treaty fails to address the key questions of \nverifiability and reliability: can the results that treaty supporters \nhope to achieve be verified, and can the treaty ensure the continued \nreliability of our nation's stockpile?\n  Since I have been in the Senate, I have voted for three arms control \ntreaties. However, in my judgment, this zero-yield test ban is not in \nour best interest. We would not be able to verify compliance with the \nTreaty or ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. Six \nformer Defense Secretaries, two former CIA Directors from the Clinton \nAdministration, and two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nincluding Minnesota's General Vessey, have concluded that ratification \nof the CTBT would be incompatible with our nation's security interests.\n  The original official negotiating position of the Clinton \nAdministration was to have a treaty with a finite duration of 10 years \nthat permitted low-yield nuclear tests and would have forced countries \nsuch as Russia and China into a more reliable verification monitoring \nregime. If the Administration had negotiated a treaty along those \nlines, I think it would have had a workable result with a good chance \nof being ratified.\n  Instead, the Administration agreed to a treaty of unlimited duration \nand a zero-yield ban that prohibits all nuclear tests; a treaty which \nis clearly unverifiable and a clear departure from the positions of all \nprevious Administrations, both Democratic and Republican. For instance, \nPresident Eisenhower insisted that low-yield nuclear tests be \npermitted. President Kennedy ended a three-year moratorium on nuclear \ntests, saying the U.S. would ``never again'' make that kind of error. \nPresident Carter opposed a zero-yield test ban while in office because \nit would undermine the U.S. nuclear deterrent. No other Administration \nhas ever supported a zero-yield ban which prohibits all nuclear tests.\n\n  Ronald Reagan's words, ``Trust but verify,'' remain a guiding \nprinciple. But a zero-yield ban is not verifiable. While the exact \nthresholds are classified, it is commonly understood that the United \nStates cannot detect nuclear explosions below a few kilotons of yield. \nWe know that countries can take advantage of existing geologic \nformations, such as salt domes, to decouple their nuclear tests and \nrender them undetectable. Also, advances in commercial mining \ncapability have enabled countries to muffle their nuclear tests, \nallowing them to conduct militarily significant nuclear explosions with \nlittle chance of being detected.\n  Should technical means of verification fail, the onsite inspection \nregime is extremely weak. If we suspect a country has cheated, thirty \nout of fifty-one nations on the Executive Council have to agree to an \ninspection. It will be extremely difficult to reach this mark given \nthat the Council established under the treaty has quotas from regional \ngroups and the U.S. and other nuclear powers are not guaranteed seats. \nIf an inspection is approved, the suspected state can deny access to \nparticular inspectors and can declare a 50-square kilometer area off \nlimits. These are exactly the type of conditions we rejected in the \ncase of UNSCOM in Iraq.\n  As to the question of reliability, we all recognize that our nuclear \ndeterrent is effective only if other nations have confidence that our \nnuclear stockpile will perform as expected. A loss of confidence would \nnot only embolden our adversaries, it would cause our allies to \nquestion the usefulness of the U.S. nuclear guarantee. We could end up \nwith more nuclear powers rather than fewer.\n  There is a very real threat the credibility of our nuclear deterrent \nwill erode if nuclear testing is prohibited. Historically, the U.S. \noften has been surprised by how systems which performed well in non-\nnuclear simulations of nuclear effects failed to function properly in \nan actual nuclear environment. Indeed, it was only following nuclear \ntests that certain vulnerability to nuclear effects was discovered in \nall U.S. strategic nuclear systems except the Minuteman II.\n  The Stockpile Stewardship Program is advertised as an effective \nalternative to nuclear testing. I hope it will enable us to avoid \ntesting in the near future. However, many of the critical tools for the \nStockpile Stewardship Program have not been developed. For example, the \nhigh-powered laser system which supposedly will have the capacity to \ntest the reliability and safety of our nuclear stockpile was scheduled \nto come on line in 2003, but has now been pushed back two years later. \nWe should make sure that alternatives to nuclear testing are fully \ncapable before we commit to abandoning testing.\n\n  There also are very real safety concerns which we must address when \ndealing with aging materials and components of weapons that can degrade \nin unpredictable ways. Right now, only one of the nine types of weapons \nin our nuclear stockpile have all available safety features in place, \nbecause adding them would have required nuclear testing. It doesn't \nmake sense to effectively freeze our stockpile before all of our \nweapons are made as safe as possible. We must make sure that the \nmembers of our armed forces who handle these weapons are not placed in \njeopardy, and the communities which are close to nuclear weapons sites \nare not endangered.\n  Furthermore, this treaty would not ensure U.S. nuclear superiority. \nAs John Deutch, Henry Kissinger and Brent Scowcroft stated in a recent \nop-ed, ``no serious person should believe that rogue nations such as \nIran or Iraq will give up their efforts to acquire nuclear weapons if \nonly the United States ratifies the CTBT.'' There is already a\n\n[[Page S12517]]\n\nnuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Any threshold state that is \nready to test has already broken the norms associated with that treaty. \nThere is no reason to believe that the CTBT regime, which has no real \nenforcement mechanism, will succeed where the NPT has failed. Nations \nthat are habitual violators of arms control treaties will escape \ndetection, building new weapons to capitalize upon the U.S. \ndeficiencies and vulnerabilities created by the CTBT.\n  While I support continuing the current moratorium on nuclear testing, \nit seems premature for the United States to consider ratifying the \nCTBT. I can envision a time, however, when ratification of a much \nbetter negotiated treaty could benefit our nation--but not until we \nhave developed better techniques for verification and enforcement, and \nthe advanced scientific equipment we need for the stockpile stewardship \nprogram.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are about to begin a new century--a \nnew millennium with new opportunities to make the world a safer place. \nThe United States must be taking the lead in pursuing those \nopportunities. Which will be possible when this Senate ratifies the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty which is our best hope for containing the \nthreat of nuclear war.\n  Unchecked testing of nuclear weapons is the single greatest threat to \nworld peace--and to the security of the United States--as we enter the \n21st century. I know none of my colleagues want nuclear weapons falling \ninto the hands of hostile people. None of us want emerging nuclear \npowers to develop advanced weapons of mass destruction.\n  The CTBT is not a magic wand, but it would make it more difficult for \nother countries to develop sophisticated nuclear weapons. But unless we \nact now to ratify this treaty, those remain very real possibilities--\nwith potentially catastrophic consequences.\n  Most of us here grew up during a time when the threat posed by \nnuclear weapons manufactured by the former Soviet Union were a day-to-\nday, ever-present reality. That particular danger, of course, is part \nof history now. But that doesn't mean the United States or any other \ncountry can rest easy. In fact, in some ways, the dangers are even \ngreater today.\n  Forty years ago, we at least knew who the enemy was. We knew where to \ntarget our defenses. Unless we ratify this treaty and play a role in \nenforcing it, we won't be completely sure which countries are moving \nahead with a nuclear weapons program.\n  Over just the last year and a half, India and Pakistan have conducted \nmissile tests, and Pakistan's elected government has just been \noverthrown by a military coup. These developments make it more urgent \nthan ever that we hold the line on any further nuclear weapons testing \nworld-wide.\n  That is exactly what this treaty promises to do. In fact, it \nrepresents the sort of historic opportunity that was only a dream \nduring the Cold War. An opportunity to create an international \nmonitoring system that would be our best assurance that no country's \nnuclear testing program moves any further than it already has. But that \nwon't happen without this country's participation.\n  The United States must take the lead in transforming the CTBT from a \npiece of paper into a force for global security. Our decision to ratify \nwill have a profound effect on the way this treaty is perceived by the \nrest of the world. 154 nations have signed the CTBT, but many of those \ncountries will ratify it only if the United States leads the way. And \nevery nation with nuclear technology must ratify this agreement before \nit comes into force.\n  Every President since Dwight D. Eisenhower has stressed the \nimportance of controlling nuclear weapons worldwide. And I hope \neveryone here will remember that this treaty has strong support from \nmilitary weapons experts, religious groups, scientists and world \nleaders.\n  Even more importantly, the American people support ratification of \nthis document. They know how important it is and prove it in polls when \nthey say 82% view the treaty ratification as essential. They will \nremember how we vote on this issue. And it has to be pretty tough to \nexplain to voters who want their families protected why you didn't vote \nto ban testing of nuclear weapons.\n  I know the argument has been made that this treaty will somehow \ncompromise our own defenses. But that's a pretty shaky theory. The \nUnited States can maintain its nuclear stockpile without testing, using \nthe most advanced technology in the world. So ratifying this treaty \nwon't leave us without a nuclear edge, it will preserve it. At the same \ntime, it will signal our commitment to a more secure and lasting world \npeace.\n  A number of our colleagues and other people as well have suggested \nthat we don't have the required two-thirds majority to ratify this \ntreaty. As a result, President Clinton has asked that we delay this \nhistoric vote a little longer. I am prepared to support that approach \nwith great reluctance because rejecting this essential treaty outright \nwould be the worst possible outcome. But a delay should give my \ncolleagues who are skeptical of this treaty the chance to better \nunderstand how it will enhance our nation's security and why it has the \nsupport of the American people.\n  I hope that, sometime within the next year, we will have the \nopportunity to continue this debate and provide the necessary advice \nand consent to ratify a treaty that would create a more peaceful world \nin the next century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  First, let me say I do believe my colleagues and I share the goal of \ndecreasing the number of weapons of mass destruction found throughout \nthe world. With that aside, my utmost concern is for the safety of each \nAmerican, and I take very seriously my constitutional responsibility to \nreview the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as it relates to the security \nof American citizens. I must take into consideration not only the \npresent state of the world, but the future as well.\n  I have, in the past, supported moratoriums on nuclear testing. In \n1992, I voted in favor of imposing a 9-month moratorium on testing of \nnuclear weapons with only limited tests following the moratorium. Since \nthe Eisenhower Administration, each President has sought a ban on \nnuclear testing to some degree. However, never before has an \nadministration proposed a ban on nuclear testing with a zero-yield \nthreshold and an unlimited time duration.\n  The goal of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, also known as CTBT, is \nto ban all nuclear testing. However, I have not been convinced this \ntreaty is in the best interests of the United States. From the lack of \nclear definitions to the incorrectness of underlying assumptions to the \nverification and enforcement provisions, I believe the treaty is \nfundamentally flawed. And, these flaws cannot be changed by Senate \namendment.\n  I want to take a few moments to discuss my concerns regarding the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Verification is critical to the enforcement of any treaty. Without \nverification, enforcement cannot truthfully occur. The Clinton \nAdministration has called for zero-yield under the CTBT. No yield. This \nmeans there should be no nuclear yield released when an explosion \noccurs. There is agreement among the Administration, the intelligence \ncommunity and the Senate that a zero-yield threshold cannot be \nverified.\n  The issue of zero yield takes on another level of importance when it \nbecomes clear that zero-yield is not the standard defined in the \nTreaty. It is the standard interpreted by President Clinton. Nowhere in \nthe Treaty is there a definition of what is meant by a ``test.'' Other \ncountries, notably Russia, have not interpreted the Treaty in the same \nmanner. We don't know how China has interpreted the ban on ``tests.'' \nWe don't know because we cannot verify that China and Russia are not \ntesting. Therefore, not only do we have a potential standard that is \nimpossible to verify, but other countries have the ability to interpret \nthe Treaty differently and act upon their interpretation, and the \nUnited States will not be able to enforce the higher standard.\n  A second major concern of mine involves our existing nuclear \nstockpile. The cold war may be a thing of the past, but threats to our \nnation's security exist today. Our nuclear stockpile\n\n[[Page S12518]]\n\nexists for a reason, and not only are new weapon technologies essential \nto our defense, it is also critical to maintain the security and safety \nof existing weapons.\n\n  Proponents of the CTBT maintain the United States does not need to \nconduct nuclear tests to maintain the integrity of our existing \nstockpile because of President Clinton's Stockpile Stewardship Program. \nThe Stockpile Stewardship Program relies upon computer modeling and \nsimulations as a substitute for testing. I believe the intent of the \nStockpile Stewardship Program is good. However, I am not confident in \nthe ability of the Stockpile Stewardship Program to keep our existing \nstockpile safe. One-third of all weapons designs introduced into the \nU.S. stockpile since 1985 have required and received post-deployment \nnuclear tests to resolve problems. In three-fourths of these cases, the \nproblems were discovered only because of ongoing nuclear tests. In each \ncase, the weapons were thought to be reliable and thoroughly tested.\n  I see three problems with the Stockpile Stewardship Program as it \nexists today. First, the technology has not been proven. In 1992 \nlaboratory scientists proposed a series of tests to create the data \nbases and methodologies for stockpile stewardship under a ban on \nnuclear testing. These tests were not permitted. At the very least, \nactual nuclear tests are necessary to produce an accurate computer \nsimulation. Second, data from past tests don't address aging, which is \na central problem in light of the highly corrosive nature of weapon \nmaterials. Shelf life of U.S. nuclear weapons is expected to be 20 \nyears, and many weapons are reaching that age. Without testing we will \nnot have confidence in refurbished warheads. My third concern relates \nto China. Apparently, China has acquired the ``legacy'' computer codes \nof the U.S. nuclear test program. The Clinton administration proposes \nto base its efforts to assure stockpile viability on computer \nsimulation which is highly vulnerable to espionage--and even to \nsabotage--by introducing false data. There is no such thing as a secure \ncomputer network.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will not go into effect until 44 \nspecific countries both sign and ratify the Treaty. In addition to the \nUnited States, China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, India and Pakistan \nhave yet to ratify, and India and Pakistan have not even signed the \nTreaty. The argument is made that U.S. ratification would quickly lead \nto ratification by these other countries. I would reply by saying \nthat--as the Treaty is constructed--each of these countries could \nindeed sign and ratify the Treaty. Then, they could proceed with low-\nyield nuclear testing which cannot be verified.\n  Even if nuclear testing is suspected, under the terms of the CTBT, \nany inspection must be supported by 30 of the 51 members of an \nExecutive Council elected by all State Parties to the Treaty. And, the \nUnited States is not even guaranteed a position on the Executive \nCouncil. Furthermore, onsite inspections are subject to a number of \nlimitations. First, inspection activities are subject to time limits \n(25 days.) Any collection of radioactive samples must be accompanied by \nan approval by a majority of the Executive Council. No State Party is \nrequired to accept simultaneous on-site inspections on its territory. \nAnd finally, the State party under inspection may refuse to accept an \nobserver from the State party requesting the inspection. There is \ncurrently a supporter of inspection limitations similar to these; his \nname is Saddam Hussein.\n  Effective arms control treaties can be extremely helpful in limiting \nthe spread of weapons of mass destruction. Moratoriums on nuclear \ntesting and limiting the yield of tests have highlighted the ability of \nthe United States and other responsible countries to shape the current \nenvironment while protecting against the intentions of rogue states. I \nremain hopeful that our technology will one day rise to the level of \nverifying a zero-yield nuclear test ban. I remain hopeful that China, \nRussia, India and Pakistan may one day commit themselves--in both words \nand actions--to cease developing and testing nuclear weapons. Until \nthat day, or until a Treaty is brought before the Senate that can be \nverified and fairly enforced, I will continue to support policy that \nprotects American citizens. And in this case, it means opposing the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in voicing \nmy strong support for Senate ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  I joined many of my colleagues in calling for Senate consideration of \nthe CTBT. But I must say, I am very disappointed in the process put \ninto place for the consideration of this hugely important issue.\n  This Senate is failing our great tradition of considering treaties \nwithout partisan political influences. So many giants in American \nhistory have argued for and against treaties right here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson from my own State of Washington was \none of these giants. Following his death in 1983, Charles Krauthammer \nwrote the following in Time magazine:\n\n       The death of Senator Henry Jackson has left an empty \n     stillness at the center of American politics. Jackson was the \n     symbol, and the last great leader, of a political tradition \n     that began with Woodrow Wilson and reached its apogee with \n     John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Hubert Humphrey. That \n     tradition--liberal internationalism--held that if democratic \n     capitalism was to have a human face, it had to have a big \n     heart and strong hand.\n\n  Scoop believed in that strong hand. Senator Jackson was one of the \nSenate's workhorses on defense issues. Few had the intimate knowledge \nof defense and foreign policy matters that Scoop did. And this \nexpertise extended to arms control issues as well. Jackson was famous \nfor taking apart arms control agreements and forcing the Executive \nBranch and his congressional colleagues to understand fully the matter \nat hand. And, Jackson was a leader at perfecting arms control \nagreements that fully protected U.S. interests.\n  Senator Jackson was a defense giant throughout the cold war. He \nchampioned his country's defense from the days of FDR to Ronald \nReagan's first term as President. Yet, he managed to vote for every \nsingle arms control treaty that came before the Senate. He tackled the \nissues and he protected U.S. interests and national security with \nabsolute devotion to country free from partisan politics. Jackson \nepitomized the Senate at its best; senators working together without \ntime constraints; senators holding the Administration accountable; \nsenators engaged to strengthen U.S. foreign and defense policy.\n  Sadly, this Senate has taken a different course. Few can argue with \nany sincerity that the Senate has given the CTBT a thorough \nconsideration. The treaty's certain defeat was dictated by partisanship \nbefore a single hearing was held on the issue. Advise and consent, the \nSenate's historical and constitutional duty has been laid aside by a \nmajority party currying favor with extremist political forces.\n  In spite of the pre-determined fate of the CTBT, I want to take a few \nminutes to briefly explain my strong support for the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty.\n  The arguments used to end nuclear testing in 1992 are just as valid \ntoday.\n  My service in the Senate has largely mirrored the U.S. moratorium on \nnuclear weapons tests. President Bush wisely halted U.S. nuclear \nweapons testing after a thorough review of our nuclear weapons arsenal \nand particularly the safety, reliability and survivability of our \nstockpile.\n  The directors of our nuclear weapons laboratories, numerous \nprestigious weapons scientists, prominent military leaders and many \nothers remain convinced that the United States can safely maintain its \nnuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing.\n  The CTBT freezes in place U.S. supremacy in nuclear weaponry.\n  The United States maintains a 6,000 warhead nuclear arsenal. This \narsenal is the result of more than 1,000 nuclear weapons tests. Our \nnuclear weapons program is without equal in the world.\n  Dr. Hans Bethe, Nobel Prize winning physicist and former Director of \nTheoretical Division at the Los Alamos Laboratory wrote the President \non this very point in early October. Dr. Bethe's letter states:\n\n       Every thinking person should realize that this treaty is \n     uniquely in favor of the United States. We have a substantial \n     lead in atomic weapons technology over all other countries.\n\n[[Page S12519]]\n\n     We have tested weapons of all sizes and shapes suitable for \n     military purposes. We have no interest in and no need for \n     further development through testing. Other existing nuclear \n     powers would need tests to make up this technological gap. \n     And even more importantly, a test ban would make it \n     essentially impossible for new nuclear power to engage.\n\n  Here's a leading nuclear scientist, a Nobel Prize winning physicist, \nand he says the CTBT is ``uniquely in favor of the United States.'' To \nme, this is an immensely powerful argument in favor of CTBT.\n  Failure to ratify the test ban treaty will send a disastrous message \nto the international community.\n  Already our closest allies are calling upon the United States to \nratify the CTBT. Many countries urging the U.S. to ratify the treaty \nare the same countries covered by the U.S. nuclear umbrella including \nour closest NATO allies.\n  Given our unmatched nuclear superiority, is the United States' \nnational interest advanced by working with the global community to \ncombat potential nuclear threats? The answer to me is a resounding yes.\n  The United States is safer if the world is working together to combat \nany proliferation threats. Without the CTBT, the global effort to \ncombat proliferation will be seriously undermined and U.S. credibility \nand sincerity will be jeopardized.\n  Our efforts to contain and control a nuclear arms race in South Asia \nwill be undermined. The global resolve to contain proliferation in the \nMiddle East in countries like Iran and Iraq will diminish. Rogue states \nlike North Korea will not face the same international resolve on \nweapons experimentation and development. It will be easier for nations \nlike China to modernize its nuclear weapons program if the CTBT does \nnot enter into force. Our already difficult efforts to work with a \nfraying nuclear establishment in Russia will also be setback by the \nU.S. failure to lead the effort to end nuclear weapons testing once and \nfor all.\n  The CTBT is largely a creation of the United States. For more than 40 \nyears, Republican and Democratic Administrations have pushed the world \nto end nuclear weapons testing. President Clinton signed the CTBT upon \nits successful negotiation in 1996. More than 140 countries have signed \nthe treaty. Some 40 countries have ratified the treaty. U.S. \nratification of the CTBT is one of the last remaining hurdles to the \ntreaty entering in force.\n  Mr. President, I will cast my vote with absolute confidence for \nratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we live in dangerous and uncertain times. \nThe global threats to peace and security known well to us during the \nCold War have been replaced by terrorist states and rogue nations with \ngrowing nuclear arsenals. Historically, existing international arms \ncontrol agreements have made our nation, and our world, a safer place. \nThe United States has been a world leader to reduce global nuclear \ntests. Several nuclear test ban treaties already are in effect, \nincluding the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), which banned nuclear \nblasts in the atmosphere, space, and underwater; the 1974 Threshold \nTest Ban Treaty (TTBT), which banned tests on devices above 150 \nkilotons; and the 1990 Peaceful Nuclear Explosion Treaty.\n  Unfortunately, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will not provide the \nsame protections as these other weapons treaties. That is why I cannot \nsupport it.\n  I am against the CTBT for two fundamental reasons: 1. The Treaty does \nnot guarantee us an ability to maintain a safe, viable, and advanced \nnuclear stockpile; and 2. The Treaty does not provide effective \nverification and enforcement if other nations violate the Treaty.\n  The Clinton administration has proposed replacing our testing system \nwith a computer simulated Stockpile Stewardship Program. Right now, we \nsimply do not know if this program can serve as a reliable surrogate \nfor testing. We do not know if computer simulations can mimic \naccurately the functions of actual testing. We do not know if computer \nsimulations can provide adequate information so we can modernize and \nour devices in response to changing threats and new weapons systems. \nWhat we do know is that in order for our own nuclear defenses to be an \neffective deterrent, they must be able to work. Ratification of the \nCTBT would close off the only means that currently can ensure the \nreliability, safety, and security of our nuclear defense stockpile.\n  I also am opposed to the CTBT because it does not provide adequate \nverification and enforcement mechanisms. Nations will be able to \nconduct nuclear tests well below the detection threshold of the \nTreaty's current monitoring system. If a rogue nation, like Iraq, \nconducts a nuclear test, and the United States insists on an on-site \ninspection, the treaty first would require 30 of 51 nations on the CTBT \nexecutive council to approve the inspection. If approved, the country \nto be inspected could still declare up to 50 square kilometers as being \n``off limits'' from the inspection. How can measures like this ensure \nother nations will comply with the CTBT? They simply can't.\n  The national security of our nation would not be served with the \nadoption of the current CTBT. I believe ratification of the CTBT could \ncompromise our national security. The Senate should defeat its \nratification.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test-Ban Treaty.\n  This is a sad day for the Senate. Despite limited debate on this \nissue, the appeal of the President and bi-partisan pleas of over 51 \nSenators to delay consideration of this treaty, the Majority Leader has \ndecided to force our vote on this treaty. The very nature and timing of \nthe issue requires that we come together and act in a responsible, non-\npartisan manner. We are faced with an historic opportunity to send \nnations around the world an important, powerful message--let's make \nsure it is the right message and that we vote to ratify this important \ntreaty.\n  Ratification will strengthen--not weaken--America's national \nsecurity. We must remember that ratification will not force America to \nabandon or alter its current practice regarding nuclear testing--we \nstopped nuclear testing seven years ago. And why did we stop nuclear \ntesting? Because we have a robust, technically sophisticated nuclear \nforce and because nuclear experts affirm that we can maintain a safe \nand reliable deterrent without nuclear tests. This is also one reason \nwhy we should ratify the CTBT.\n  Another reason to ratify the CTBT is that it will strengthen our \nnational security by limiting the development of more advanced and more \ndestructive nuclear weapons. As we all know, we have the most powerful \nnuclear force in the world. Thus, limiting the development of more \nadvanced and destructive nuclear weapons limits the power of rogue \nnations around the world from strengthening their own nuclear arsenal. \nIt allows America to maintain its nuclear superiority.\n  Full ratification and implementation of the CTBT will also limit the \npossibility of other countries from acquiring nuclear weapons. \nFurthermore, it will provide us with new mechanisms to monitor \nsuspicious activities by other nations. For example, it provides for a \nglobal network of sensors and the right to request short notice, on-\nsight inspections in other countries.\n  But failure to ratify the CTBT will jeopardize our national security \nas well as the security of countries around the world. If we fail to \nact, the treaty cannot enter into force for any country. Let us not \nforget that nuclear competition led Pakistan and India to conduct \nunderground nuclear testing over one year ago. Without this treaty, \nnuclear competition will only continue to grow and to spread. Without \nthis treaty, underground nuclear testing will not only continue but \nwill be carried out by even more countries--not by our allies, but \nrather, by our enemies.\n  I am dismayed that we are even forced to consider this vital treaty \nin light of the current unrest in Pakistan and India. Now, more than \never, we must demonstrate national unity.\n  We must listen to the experts who urge us to ratify the treaty--the \nSecretaries of Defense and Energy, the Directors of the National \nWeapons Laboratories and the Nobel laureates. We must listen to \nnational leaders around the world beseeching us to ratify the treaty--\nasking us to act as a responsible international leader and to serve as \na positive example for other nations to follow. And most important, we\n\n[[Page S12520]]\n\nmust listen to the American people--the majority of whom are pleading \nwith us to make our world a safer place and to ratify this treaty.\n  Let us not forget that 152 countries have signed the CTBT. America \nled these countries by being the first to sign the treaty. Other major \nnuclear powers, such as Britain, France, Russia and China followed our \nlead. To date, 41 countries have ratified. Although we will not be the \nfirst country to ratify, let us not be the first country to jeopardize \nits very existence.\n  We live in a dangerous world--where terrorists and rogue nations are \ndeveloping the most repugnant weapons of mass destruction. We need to \nthink clearly about what message we are sending today to the rest of \nthe world--to our allies and to our adversaries. Our actions today will \ninfluence action by countries around the world. If we ratify, other \ncountries will follow suit and ratify. Our failure to ratify will go \nbeyond encouraging other nations to follow suit. It will prevent the \nvery entry into force of this historic agreement.\n  Let us send a powerful message to our neighbors around the world and \nratify this historic treaty. Let us ratify the treaty and guarantee a \nsafer future for our children by strengthening the security of our \ncountry and of the world.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, there are few responsibilities of the \nSenate more important than the constitutional duty to offer our advise \nand consent on treaties.\n  After long deliberation and after a series of classified and \nunclassified hearings, I have determined that I cannot support \nratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. There are serious \nflaws in this document that could endanger our national security in the \nfuture.\n  Make no mistake, the world is a dangerous place. We must deal with \nthe world as it is, not as we wish it were. And we must approach \nratification of this treaty with only one view; does it advance the \ncause of world peace without jeopardizing our own security.\n  The treaty fails on both counts.\n  First, this treaty is not verifiable. I cannot vote for a treaty that \nwill bind the United States, but which will be ignored by other nuclear \nnations.\n  There are differing opinions concerning the ability to detect nuclear \ntesting. But the issue is more complex than just detecting a detonation \nof a nuclear device with a yield greater than allowed by the treaty. \nIf, for example, if a detonation occurred and we decided that we should \ninspect the site, how would we do the inspection?\n  First, 31 nations have to agree that a violation has occurred before \nsite inspections would be authorized. The chances of 31 nations \nagreeing a violation has occurred are remote. But why do proponents of \nthe treaty think a nation that has just violated the treaty will allow \nan inspection? You need to look no further than Iraq to appreciate the \ndifficulty in inspecting a nation that wants to obfuscate such testing.\n  Just a quick review of the significant events that escaped our \nintelligence community in the recent past do not give confidence that \nthey will uncover violations of this treaty. Our intelligence officers \nmissed the development of the advanced missile development by North \nKorea, they failed to recognize the signs that both India and Pakistan \nwere going to test nuclear weapons, they provided incorrect information \nresulting in our bombing the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, and they \nfailed to provide sufficient information to prevent us from conducting \na missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum.\n  Additionally, there was confusion over the exact number of nuclear \ntests conducted by India and Pakistan.\n  Secondly, ratification of this treaty will not reduce development or \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. A basic truth for any nation is that \nit will act in a manner that best suits its national interests. The \ndownside of our military dominance compared to the rest of the world is \nthat it forces weaker nations to rely on weapons of mass destructions \nas a counter to our conventional strength. Russia and China have both \npublicly stated that a new reliance on nuclear weapons is necessary to \n``balance'' our dominance. Rogue nations cannot possibly challenge us \nwith conventional weapons and therefore feel compelled to acquire or \ndevelop non-conventional weapons.\n  This treaty will not stop or slow down the development of nuclear \nweapons if a nation deems these weapons as vital to their national \ninterests. Russia and China will not be deterred from enhancing their \nnuclear weapon performance simply because they have signed this treaty.\n  Yet, our own nuclear defense program would be limited under the \ntreaty.\n  Third, the Stock Pile Stewardship program as outlined will not \nguarantee safe and reliable nuclear weapons. This is a technical area. \nBut there is considerable differences of opinion between impressive \nscientists about whether we can maintain our stock pile as safe and \nreliable without nuclear testing. Without such assurance of safety and \nreliability and with the knowledge that the United States will maintain \na nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future, I cannot support such a \ntreaty that would potentially put our stockpile at risk.\n  Treaty proponents will argue that any time the appropriate leaders of \ndefense, energy and the scientific community say we must test to insure \nreliability and safety, we can withdraw from the treaty. I have little \nconfidence that once this treaty is approved, ``pulling the sword \nExcaliber from the stone'' would seem a trivial task compared to \nwithdrawal from a nuclear test ban treaty.\n  The point is that once the treaty is signed, we need to be confident \nthat we can maintain a safe, reliable nuclear stockpile. We have no \nsuch confidence today--perhaps the technology will be in place in 5-15 \nyears--and therefore we should not jeopardize our nuclear deterrent by \nagreeing to this treaty.\n  Because we cannot verify whether other nations are following the \ntreaty, because the treaty does not halt or prevent proliferation of \nnuclear weapons and because the treaty could lead to reduced \nreliability and safety of our nuclear stockpile, I cannot support its \nratification.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senate finds itself in a very \nuncomfortable position today. We have before us one of the most \nimportant treaties negotiated this decade, the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty. It is not perfect. It does not do everything we wish it would. \nIts verification provisions are not air-tight, and its sanctions for \nviolators are not particularly stiff.\n  I understand many of my colleagues' uneasiness about the treaty. \nPrior to last week, there had been no deliberate consideration of the \nCTBT before any Senate committee. Members have had little opportunity \nto learn about the treaty and have their questions addressed. A \nsignificant portion of the Senate has just in the last two weeks begun \nto carefully examine the details of the treaty. This is no way to \nconduct the ratification process on a matter of such importance to \nnational security, and puts Senators in a very uncomfortable position. \nFor some time, I have urged the Foreign Relations Committee to hold \nhearings on this treaty and allow this debate to begin. But for better \nor worse, this is the situation we find ourselves in, and having \nexhausted appeals for a delay in the vote, I trust my colleagues will \ndo their best to thoroughly evaluate what is now before them.\n  Implementation of the CTBT would bring, however, a significant \nimprovement in our ability to stop the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons. The Test Ban Treaty would constrain the development of new and \nmore deadly nuclear weapons by nations around the globe by banning all \nnuclear weapon test explosions. It would also establish a far-reaching \nglobal monitoring system and allow for short-notice on-site inspections \nof suspicious events, thereby improving our ability to detect and deter \nnuclear explosions by other nations. The fact that the CTBT was signed \nby 154 nations is a major tribute to American diplomacy. Many of these \nnations are now looking to America for leadership before they proceed \nto ratification of the treaty, and under the provisions of the treaty, \nit will not enter into force until the United States has ratified.\n  Rejection of the test ban treaty could give new life to dormant \nnuclear testing programs in countries like Russia and China. It could \nalso renew dangerous, cold war-era nuclear arms competitions. And we \nwould have a very\n\n[[Page S12521]]\n\ndifficult time asserting our leadership in urging any nation to refrain \nfrom testing. Not only would we lose an historic opportunity to lock in \nthis agreement among nations, we would undermine the power of our own \ndiplomacy by not following through on an initiative that we have \nspearheaded.\n  Critics charge that we cannot be 100 percent certain that we can \ndetect any test of any size by any nation. I would concede that is \ntrue. But when it comes to national defense, nothing is 100 percent \ncertain. We can never be sure any weapon will work 100 percent of the \ntime. We can be certain, however, that this treaty will improve our \nability to constrain the nuclear threat today and in the future. We owe \nit to our children and our grandchildren to add this important weapon \nto our defense arsenal.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for ratification of the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to inform my colleagues on this \nside--I apologize for it--the most I can give any colleague is 2 \nminutes. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, with this fateful vote tonight the world \nbecomes a more dangerous place. That is what our top military leaders \nare telling us. To quote General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs:\n\n       The world will be a safer place with the treaty than \n     without it. And it is in our national security interest to \n     ratify the treaty.\n\n  Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen says that this treaty will ``help cap \nthe nuclear threat.''\n  Mr. President, we no longer have standing, when we defeat this \ntreaty, to tell China or India or Pakistan or any other country: Don't \ntest nuclear weapons.\n  We will have lost our standing, and I believe will have lost our \nbearings. By rushing headlong into this vote tonight and defeating a \ntreaty which 150 nations have signed--it was said a few moments ago \nthat our lab Directors say that the treaty would endanger their safety \nand reliability testing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a joint statement of the lab Directors \nbe printed in the Record saying that ``we are confident that a fully \nsupported and sustained Stockpile Stewardship Program will enable us to \ncontinue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent without nuclear \ntesting.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nJoint Statement by three Nuclear Weapons Laboratory Directors: C. Paul \n  Robinson, Sandia National Laboratories, John C. Browne, Los Alamos \n National Laboratory, and C. Bruce Tarter, Lawrence Livermore National \n                               Laboratory\n\n       ``We, the three nuclear weapons laboratory directors, have \n     been consistent in our view that the stockpile remains safe \n     and reliable today.\n       ``For the last three years, we have advised the Secretaries \n     of Energy and Defense through the formal annual certification \n     process that the stockpile remains safe and reliable and that \n     there is no need to return to nuclear testing at this time.\n       ``We have just forwarded our fourth set of certification \n     letters to the Energy and Defense Secretaries confirming our \n     judgment that once again the stockpile is safe and reliable \n     without nuclear testing.\n       ``While there can never be a guarantee that the stockpile \n     will remain safe and reliable indefinitely without nuclear \n     testing, we have stated that we are confident that a fully \n     supported and sustained stockpile stewardship program will \n     enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent \n     without nuclear testing.\n       ``If that turns out not to be the case, Safeguard F--which \n     is a condition for entry into the Test Ban Treaty by the \n     U.S.--provides for the President, in consultation with the \n     Congress, to withdraw from the Treaty under the standard \n     ``supreme national interest'' clause in order to conduct \n     whatever testing might be required.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our three allies, in an unprecedented move, \nhave directly appealed to this Senate to ratify this treaty. Great \nBritain, France, Germany, directly appealed to this Senate.\n  Finally, it is unprecedented that this Senate would defeat a treaty \nof this magnitude with this speed without a report even from the \nForeign Relations Committee. I think we are doing a real disservice to \nworld peace and stability by defeating this treaty.\n  I thank my friend for the time he has yielded me.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If when the vote occurs on the Resolution of Ratification \nit does not achieve 67 votes, what happens to the treaty?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The treaty would then stay on the calendar \nuntil the end of the Congress.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Further parliamentary inquiry: At the end of the Congress, \nwhat would then happen to the treaty?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The treaty would then be returned to the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to be notified at 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes. I am going to split my time with Senator Shelby who has not \narrived. I will take my 2\\1/2\\, and then when he arrives, he will use \nthe other 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  If America does not form a nuclear umbrella to protect world peace, \nwho will? To whom will our allies look to protect them from an incoming \nballistic missile? Only America can do that, and there are only two \nways we have to deter a rogue nation from lobbing a nuclear missile \ninto some other country. The first is a missile defense system which \nbelatedly we are now deploying. It is not yet ready, but we are on the \nway. That is No. 1. No. 2 is the ability to be sure we have a safe and \nsecure and viable nuclear arsenal.\n  This is not a treaty that has been debated for 20 years. It is not \nthe same treaty that preceding Presidents negotiated. It is different \nin this respect: Every other President held firm for the United States \nto test at a low level. President Clinton gave that up. That is part of \nthe reason this treaty is before us and why the other countries came in \nbecause the low-level testing is not able to be detected. No other \nPresident gave in on that issue.\n  Secondly, no other President gave in on the issue of permanence. The \nidea that we would unilaterally disarm ourselves in perpetuity is \nirresponsible.\n  I do not like the fact we are taking up this treaty now. I do not \nwant to send a bad signal. But most of all, I do not want to leave \nourselves and our allies unprotected from some rogue nation that has \nnuclear capabilities, and we know there are many.\n  I want to go back and look at the record, and let's talk about peace \nthrough strength. It was not peace through weakness and unilateral \ndisarmament that stopped the Cold War. It was peace through strength. \nWe cannot let that go away by signing a treaty that is not in our \ninterests. There are other avenues. There is renegotiating the treaty \nso we can test at a low level, so we will be able to say to the world: \nWe have a nuclear arsenal, so do not even think about lobbing a nuclear \nmissile at us or any of our allies. We could renegotiate the treaty so \nit has a term or a timetable. There are alternatives. I hope we will \nnot be rammed into doing something that is wrong for our country \nbecause there are alternatives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an excerpt of testimony \nfrom General Shalikashvili in a March 1997 appropriations hearing be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Excerpts--Senate Appropriations Hearing, March 1977\n\n\n                        nuclear weapons testing\n\n       Senator Hutchison. Second, I am always interested in the \n     Department of Energy's role in the maintenance and storage of \n     our nuclear stockpile. I would like to ask you a general \n     question.\n       Are you confident that they are doing everything that you \n     think is prudent in maintaining and storing our weapons? Do \n     you think we are maintaining and storing enough? And do you \n     think we can rely on a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile \n     when we have banned any testing?\n       General Shalikashvili. The answer is yes, and let me tell \n     you what I base this on.\n       I think it is 2 years ago that the President established a \n     system where each year the Secretary of Defense, the \n     Secretary of Energy, and the Commander of our Strategic \n     Forces, now General Habiger in Omaha, have to certify that \n     the stockpile is safe and reliable. The system is such that \n     if any one of\n\n[[Page S12522]]\n\n     them reports that it is not so, then the President has to \n     consult with Congress on that issue.\n       Senator Hutchison. How do they tell when you cannot \n     actually test? Do you think the computer modeling is \n     sufficient? Do you think the testing is sufficient when you \n     can't test?\n       General Shalikashvili. The Energy Department has proposed \n     and the Secretary of Defense has agreed with the \n     establishment of a science-based stockpile verification \n     program. It is a very costly program. To stand it up--and I \n     might have my number off but not by much--it is about $4 \n     billion a year, to establish the laboratories, the computer \n     suites, and all of that, to establish it.\n       What I monitor is whether--this year, for instance, in the \n     energy budget there is approximately $4 billion toward the \n     science-based stockpile verification program. Just 10 days \n     ago I was in Omaha to get a briefing from General Habiger on \n     how he is coming along on making the judgment that this year \n     the stockpile is still safe and reliable.\n       Not only is he in constant communications with the nuclear \n     laboratory directors who work that issue, he also has a panel \n     of prominent experts on the subject who report to him. Based \n     upon his observations, because he monitors what is on the \n     missiles and so on, his discussions with the labs and the \n     report that he gets from the panel that is established just \n     to answer that question, last year, for the first time, he \n     made the judgment that it was safe. He tells me that, unless \n     something comes up before he reports again, he is going to \n     again certify this year.\n       With each year that goes by and we are further and further \n     away from having done the last test, it will become more and \n     more difficult. That is why it is very important that we do \n     not allow the energy budget to slip, but continue working on \n     this science-based stockpile verification program and that we \n     get this thing operating.\n       But even then, Senator, we won't know whether that will be \n     sufficient not to have to test. What we are talking about is \n     the best judgment by scientists that they will be able to \n     determine the reliability through these technical methods.\n       Senator Hutchison. Do you think we should have some time at \n     which we would do some testing just to see if all of these \n     great assumptions are, in fact, true?\n       How can we just sit here and say gee, we really hope this \n     works and then be in a situation of dire emergency and have \n     them fizzle?\n       General Shalikashvili. I don't know. I won't pretend to \n     understand the physics of this enough. But I did meet with \n     the nuclear laboratory directors and we talked about this at \n     great length.\n       They are all convinced that you can do that. But when I ask \n     them for a guarantee, they cannot give it to you until all of \n     the pieces are stood up. Obviously, if we stand it up, and we \n     cannot do that, then we will have to go back to the President \n     and say we will have to test.\n       Hopefully, it will work out. But we are still a number of \n     years away before we will have that all put together so that \n     we can tell you for sure whether it will work or not.\n       Senator Hutchison. Well, mark one Senator down as \n     skeptical.\n       General Shalikashvili. Mark one Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff joining you in that skepticism. I just don't \n     know.\n       But I know that if you do not help us to make sure that \n     energy puts that money against it and does not siphon it off \n     for something else, then I can assure you we won't get there \n     from here.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. I reserve 2\\1/2\\ minutes for \nSenator Shelby.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is with regret, after 25 years in this \nChamber, a Chamber I love so much, that I say it is a travesty the \nSenate is on the verge of rejecting the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty. The idea of a treaty banning all nuclear tests has been around \nsince President Dwight Eisenhower called for one more than 40 years ago \nwhen I was 19 years old.\n  Today, there is broad agreement around the world that a test ban \ntreaty is necessary and, I point out to my colleagues, we have not \nconducted a nuclear test since President Bush signed legislation to \nestablish a moratorium on nuclear testing in 1992.\n  Mr. President, 152 nations have signed this treaty. They are abiding \nby its terms, but if we vote against ratification, if we vote against \nadvising and consenting, the Senate will abdicate our Nation's role as \nthe world leader in support of nonproliferation. The 100 people in this \nbody representing a quarter of a billion people will abdicate our \nNation's responsibility to ourselves and the world.\n  I am bewildered at the arguments made by some of my colleagues \nbecause the United States, which enjoys an immense global nuclear \nadvantage over all other countries, will only find that position eroded \nif a global ban on testing is not realized.\n  Treaty opponents make two main arguments: that it is unverifiable and \nthat the safety and reliability of our own weapons will be endangered \nwithout testing. In my judgment, both arguments fail miserably.\n  As I said before, no treaty is 100% verifiable, and the fact is that \nany nation bent on developing a nuclear weapon can fashion a crude \ndevice, with or without this treaty. But without the explosive testing \nthat this treaty prohibits, it will be extremely difficult to build \nnuclear weapons small enough to be mounted on delivery vehicles.\n  The critical question we should be asking is if this treaty will make \nit significantly harder for potential evaders to test nuclear weapons. \nThe answer is a resounding yes. This treaty establishes a monitoring \nsystem that includes over 300 stations that will help locate the origin \nof a test. Last year, when India tested two nuclear devices \nsimultaneously, the seismic waves that they created were recorded by 62 \nof these prototype stations.\n  Once a test has been detected, the treaty has a short-notice on-site \ninspection regime so questionable incidents can be resolved quickly. In \nshort, the treaty makes it much more difficult for signatory nations to \ntest nuclear weapons without alerting the international community and \nincurring their collective condemnation.\n  The argument that the CTBT will somehow undermine the safety and \nreliability of our own stockpile is likewise flawed. We have conducted \nover 1,000 nuclear tests during the last 54 years, the most of any \ncountry in the world. We have extensive knowledge of how to build and \nmaintain nuclear weapons reliably. Moreover, the Clinton Administration \nis planning a 10 year, $45 billion Stockpile Stewardship Program that \nwill develop unprecedented supercomputing simulations that will further \nensure the continued reliability of our weapons.\n  I question whether we need to spend that much money, but I find it \nironic that many of the voices who are questioning the technical merits \nof Stockpile Stewardship Program are the same people who want to spend \ntens of billions more on a National Missile Defense System that has \nshown modest technical progress, to say the least.\n  We have a treaty before us which will curb the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons. It should have been ratified years ago. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in setting aside short-term politics. Vote for \nthe instruments of ratification. The Senate should be the conscience of \nour Nation, the conscience of the world. If we vote this down, it is \nnot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am not opposed to the concept of a \ncomprehensive test ban treaty.\n  If we are able to maintain our own nuclear deterrent and the umbrella \nof nuclear protection we have extended to our allies, a ban on testing \nunder a fair treaty could be very much in our national interest.\n  Clearly we do not want other countries to develop sophisticated \nnuclear weapons, the sort that are light enough to go on ICBMs that \ncould reach our country. A verifiable test ban would seriously hinder \nother countries from developing those sophisticated weapons.\n  However, today we cannot indefinitely maintain with certainty the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear weapons. So while proponents of \nthe treaty make valid points about the benefits that may be obtained \nwith regard to nonproliferation, we are not yet prepared to assume the \nrisks that would be imposed upon us if we give up the ability to test \nour own weapons.\n  As Paul Robinson, the Director of the Sandia National Laboratory, put \nit:\n\n       Confidence in the reliability and safety of the U.S. \n     nuclear weapons stockpile will eventually decline without \n     nuclear testing * * * Whether the risk that will arise from \n     this decline in confidence will be acceptable or not is a \n     policy issue that must be considered in light of the benefits \n     expected to be realized by a universal test ban.\n\n  I have considered the risks on both sides of the this issue, and I \ncome to\n\n[[Page S12523]]\n\nthe conclusion that a test ban should remain our goal, but we are not \nyet in a position to enter into an indefinite ban.\n  We hope over time to reduce the risks of maintaining our stockpile \nwithout testing using a science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program. \nBut that program is not yet ready.\n  Our lab Directors believe it will take another 5 to 15 years to prove \nthe program can be a success.\n  As John Browne, the Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory \nhas said, he is ``concerned about several trends that are reducing \n[his] confidence. These include annual shortfalls in the planned \nbudgets, increased numbers of findings in the stockpile that need \nresolution, an augmented workload beyond our original plans, and \nunfunded mandates that cut into the program.''\n  I hope the Senate can delay a vote on this treaty. It is in our \nnational interest to ask others to abide by a ban as we are doing, and \nour ability to make that request will be reduced if we vote against \nratification today.\n  However, on whole, the risk to our national security is greater if we \nprematurely agree to an indefinite ban. For that reason, I hope we will \nput off the vote on this treaty, but, if we have to vote, in the \ninterest of national security, I will vote against the ratification of \nthis treaty at this time.\n  I thank the Senator for the time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes out of our time to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, I regret that the Senate has arrived at this juncture, \nthat we are forging ahead with a vote that many, if not most, of us \nbelieve is ill-timed and premature. The outcome is a foregone \nconclusion--the Senate will reject the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I \nsincerely hope that this vote is being driven by something other than \npure partisan politics, but for the life of me, I fail to see it. \nNevertheless, here we are, and vote, it appears, we will.\n  In the consideration of a matter as important as a major arms control \ntreaty, we need, at a minimum, sufficient time to examine the issue, \nsufficient opportunity to modify the treaty, and last, but not least, \nthe answers to a few basic questions.\n  First, do we support the objectives of the treaty? In the case of the \nCTBT, I think it is quite possible that a large majority of the Senate \ndoes support the goal of banning live nuclear weapons tests worldwide. \nI suspect that the 80 percent or more approval ratings that we hear in \nreference to this treaty are based on that question.\n  Second, is the treaty in the national security interests of the \nUnited States? Would the security of the United States be enhanced if \nwe could flash-freeze the practice of nuclear weapons testing \nworldwide, or are we leaving ourselves frozen in time while other \nnations march forward? Given our vast superiority in both numbers and \ntechnology over other nations, including Russia, it would seem that a \nfreeze on testing could be an advantage to the United States, if--and \nit is a big if--other nations fully respect the treaty.\n  Third, does the treaty accomplish its objectives? This is where the \nquestions become more difficult. Verification is a legitimate issue, as \nis the security of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. What will the \nimpact be on our national security if some countries cheat on the \ntreaty, and others simply refuse to ratify it? Can we really trust an \nuntested Stockpile Security Program to maintain our arsenal of nuclear \nweapons, and what signal will we be sending to the rest of the world if \nwe find flaws in the program or in our weapons, flaws that mandate live \ntesting to fix the weapons? These types of questions require time and \nresearch to fully explore. We have neither the time nor the information \nwe need on this treaty.\n  Finally, can the treaty be improved by the addition of amendments, \nreservations, understandings or the like? Few documents that come \nbefore this body are perfect, and treaties are no exception. It is easy \nto criticize, easy to find fault, easy to point out the flaws--it is \nmuch easier to renounce a piece of legislation or a treaty than to \nimprove it. We have heard a fair amount of discussion about the \nsafeguards to be attached to this treaty. That is all well and good, \nbut I wonder if they are good enough. I wonder how much scrutiny \nSenators have really given those safeguards. Could they be improved, or \nperhaps expanded? Maybe we need more safeguards. The point is, under \nthese circumstances, we do not have the ability to fully explore ways \nto strengthen this treaty, and perhaps make it acceptable to more \nSenators.\n  A treaty of this nature--one that would bar the United States from \ntesting its stockpile of nuclear weapons in perpetuity--deserves \nextensive study, careful debate, and a floor situation that allows for \nthe open consideration of amendments, reservations, or other motions.\n  Treaties of this importance, of this impact on the Nation, are not to \nbe brushed off with a political wink and a nod. Treaties of this \nimportance must be debated on the basis of their merits, not calibrated \nto the ticking of the legislative clock.\n  As the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Biden, noted on Friday, in comparison with Senate \nconsideration of other national security treaties, the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty has been given short shrift indeed. The 1988 \nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), which was considered \nduring a time in which I served as Majority Leader, was the subject of \n20 hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 12 hearings \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee, a number of hearings in the \nIntelligence Committee, and eventually, nine days of Senate floor \ndebate. The SALT II Treaty, which again was considered when I was \nMajority Leader, was the subject of 21 hearings by the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and nine hearings by the Armed Services Committee \nbefore President Carter and I reached agreement in 1980 that, as a \nresult of the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, consideration of \nthe treaty should be suspended.\n\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is of equal importance and deserves \nthe same consideration as those earlier treaties affecting our national \nsecurity. Senator Warner and Senator Levin, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committees, and their respective \nstaffs, did a yeoman's job in scheduling three back-to-back days of \nhearings on the Treaty last week. They managed to wedge an enormous \namount of information into a remarkably brief window of opportunity. \nThey deserve our thanks and our commendations.\n  But what are we left with at the end of the process? What we are left \nwith is a cacophony of facts, assessments, and opinions. Few in this \nchamber are steeped in the intricacies of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty. I am not. Few of us have a full enough understanding of the \ntreaty to sift the competing opinions that we have heard this week and \nto draw informed conclusions.\n  It is often said that the devil is in the details. To accept or \nreject this treaty on the basis of such flimsy understanding of the \ndetails as most of us possess is a blot on the integrity of the Senate, \nand a disservice to the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I refer now to the Federalist No. 75 by Alexander \nHamilton. Let me quote a bit of what he says in speaking of the power \nof making treaties.\n\n       Its objects are contracts with foreign nations, which have \n     the force of law, but derive it from the obligations of good \n     faith. They are not rules prescribed by the sovereign to the \n     subject, but agreements between sovereign and sovereign. The \n     power in question seems therefore to form a distinct \n     department, and to belong properly neither to the legislative \n     nor to the executive. . . .\n       However proper or safe it may be in government where the \n     executive magistrate is an hereditary monarch, to commit to \n     him the entire power of making treaties, it would be utterly \n     unsafe and improper to entrust that power to an elective \n     magistrate of four years duration. . . . The history of human \n     conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue \n     which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests of \n     so delicate and momentous a kind as those which concern its \n     intercourse with the rest of the world to the sole disposal \n     of a magistrate, created and circumstanced, as would be a \n     president of the United States.\n       . . . It must indeed be clear to a demonstration, that the \n     joint possession of the power in question by the president \n     and senate would afford a greater prospect of security, than \n     the separate possession of it by either of them.\n\n\n[[Page S12524]]\n\n\n  In The Federalist Essays, Number 75, Alexander Hamilton lays out a \ncompelling case for the fundamental and essential role that the Senate \nmust play in the ratification of a treaty.\n  Mr. President, in accordance with what Hamilton said, in these words \nthat I just spoke, we should pause to take his words to heart. He \nleaves no room for quibble, no margin for question. The Senate is a \nvital part of the treaty-making equation. And yet, on this treaty, \nunder this consent agreement, the Senate has effectively abdicated its \nduty.\n  This is an extraordinary moment. The Senate is standing on the edge \nof a precipice, approaching a vote that is, by all accounts, going to \nresult in the rejection of a nuclear arms control treaty. All of us are \nby now aware of a coup d'etat which has occurred in one of the more \nunstable nuclear powers in the world--Pakistan--a state that conducted \nunderground tests of nuclear weapons just last year, but which in \nrecent weeks, sent signals that it would sign the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty.\n  While the two events are not necessarily related, the Senate's \nrejection of this treaty, coming on the heel of this coup d'etat, could \nsend a powerful message to the as-yet-unfamiliar government in \nPakistan. Would it not be prudent to assess this new situation, with \nall of its potential ramifications to our own security situation, \nbefore we act on this treaty? I believe all of us know that it would.\n  But, Mr. President, I fear that what is driving the Senate at this \nmoment instead of prudence or the security interests of the United \nStates, is political agenda. Indeed, it is political agenda that has \nbrought us to this uncomfortable place, and it is political agenda \nwhich blocks our exit from it, despite the desire of most members to \npull back.\n  Once we have disposed of this vote, if the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty is returned to the Senate at some future date, I urge the \nleaders to work together to re-examine it in a bipartisan fashion. We \nhave a number of ready made vehicles to do so--the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, \nand the National Security Working Group, of which both leaders are \nmembers. Our leaders should sit down with the experts whose opinions \nrepresent both sides of the Treaty debate. They should talk to the \nRussians, eyeball to eyeball. They should talk to our allies, eyeball \nto eyeball. An opinion piece in the New York Times is no substitute for \nface-to-face talks with the leaders of Britain, France and Germany. We \nhave made the effort on other treaties, and we should do no less for \nthis Treaty.\n  And above all, we should undertake this examination of the treaty on \na bipartisan basis. No treaty of this importance is going to receive \nthe consideration that it deserves without the cooperation of the \nleaders of both parties. It is just that simple.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the day when we can deliberate the \nfull implications of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. What we do on \nthis treaty will affect national--and international--security for \ngenerations to come. We owe it to the Senate and to the Nation to give \nthis Treaty thorough and informed scrutiny, to improve it if needed, to \napprove it if warranted, or to reject it if necessary. That is our \ncharge under the Constitution, and that is the course of action that I \nhope we will be given another opportunity to pursue.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I cannot vote today either to approve or \nto reject the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I will \ndo something that I have never before done in my 41 years in the United \nStates Senate. I will vote ``Present.'' I will do so in the hope that \nthis treaty will sometime be returned for consideration, under a \ndifferent set of circumstances, in which we can fully and \ndispassionately explore the ramifications of the treaty and any \namendments, conditions, or reservations in regard to it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senate now has acquired two documents which are \nvery revealing in this debate, new information. I have a memorandum \nhere which makes clear that neither the Department of Defense nor the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff were privy to the Department of Energy's lobbying \neffort vis-a-vis the White House to forgo all nuclear testing under the \nCTBT. This was never--in the words of a senior DOD official--\ncoordinated with the Defense Department or the military.\n  These documents make it very clear that the Clinton administration \nignored national security concerns expressed directly to the President \nof the United States in negotiating the CTBT and a further reason that \nthe treaty should be rejected.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na memorandum, dated September 8, 1994, to the President of the United \nStates from Hazel O'Leary.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 1994.\n\n\n                     Memorandum for: The President.\n\n     From: Hazel R. O'Leary.\n     Subject: Hydronuclear Experiments at the Nevada Test Site \n         Under the Moratorium on Nuclear Testing.\n     I. Summary\n       After careful and extended debate within the executive \n     agencies, you are to be presented with a decision memorandum \n     on whether the United States should conduct hydronuclear \n     experiments at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) under the \n     moratorium on nuclear testing. Although the views of the \n     Department of Energy on this matter are reflected in that \n     decision memorandum, I want to take this opportunity to \n     strongly urge you to decide that the U.S. should not conduct, \n     nor prepare to conduct, hydronuclear experiments during the \n     existing moratorium. At the very least, the U.S. should \n     decide to defer a decision on whether to conduct hydronuclear \n     experiments until after the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \n     (NPT) Extension Conference next spring and not take any \n     actions which prejudice an ultimate decision on whether to \n     conduct these experiments.\n     II. Discussion\n       Under your leadership, the United States has taken a world \n     leadership role in enacting and maintaining a nuclear testing \n     moratorium and actively pursuing a test ban treaty. These \n     efforts are essential elements of the comprehensive approach \n     this Nation has undertaken to prevent the proliferation of \n     nuclear weapons. We must be vigilant to ensure that actions \n     are not taken which could undermine these essential \n     objectives.\n       The reasons to, at a minimum, defer a decision on \n     conducting hydronuclear experiments are compelling.\n       It is not technically essential to conduct hydronuclear \n     experiments at this time. The Department of Energy has \n     determined that the existing nuclear stockpile of the United \n     States is safe and reliable and; that technical means other \n     than hydronuclear testing can maintain the stockpile in this \n     robust condition for the near term. Additionally, the JASON \n     group, a high-level, independent technical evaluation team \n     assessing the Stockpile Stewardship program for the U.S. \n     Government, weighed the limited technical value of \n     hydronuclear experiments against the costs, the impact of \n     continuing an underground testing program at the NTS, and \n     U.S. non-proliferation goals and determined that on balance \n     they opposed these experiments.\n       Publicly affirming the U.S. commitment to conduct \n     hydronuclear experiments would highlight the issue at the \n     Conference on Disarmament. This could undermine the \n     comprehensive nuclear test ban negotiations by providing \n     nations that are not fully committed to a comprehensive \n     nuclear test ban an opportunity to use U.S. conduct as a \n     convenient excuse for their opposition. Significant progress \n     on the test ban treaty is essential if the priority objective \n     of achieving an indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty is to be successful in spring 1995.\n       A request for funding in fiscal year 1996 to preserve the \n     hydronuclear experiment option will be difficult to defend to \n     the Congress since it is not technically essential to conduct \n     these experiments to preserve stockpile reliability and \n     safety. Additionally, because of the controversial nature of \n     hydronuclear experiments, a request for funding at this time \n     may invite the Congress to enact legislation restricting \n     funding for this purpose. This would tie the hands of the \n     Executive Branch in the negotiation of a comprehensive test \n     ban treaty and may force a change in the Administration's \n     current negotiating position and strategy. Alternatively, if \n     the Congress withheld its approval of funding, this will \n     create ambiguity concerning U.S. policy and intentions on \n     this sensitive issue, further complicating the comprehensive \n     test ban negotiations.\n       As a member of your cabinet, with responsibility, with \n     others, for carrying out your non-proliferation and national \n     security agenda, I believe strongly that a decision to\n\n[[Page S12525]]\n\n     conduct, or to prepare to conduct, hydronuclear experiments \n     under a nuclear testing moratorium is tactically unwise and \n     substantively unnecessary at this time. I urge you to decide \n     not to authorize preparations for these experiments in the \n     fiscal year 1996 budget request and also not to conduct these \n     experiments under a moratorium.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record a memorandum for Dr. John Deutch, \nchairman of the Nuclear Weapons Council, from Dr. Harold Smith, staff \ndirector of the Nuclear Weapons Council.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     For: Dr. John Deutch, Chairman NWC.\n     From: Dr. Harold Smith, Staff Director NWC.\n     Subject: Secretary O'Leary's Letter to the President on \n         Hydronuclear Experiments (HN).\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       Letter dated September 8, 1994 from Secretary O'Leary to \n     the President was received in my office today by FAX as a \n     bootleg copy from Los Alamos National Laboratory--copies were \n     not distributed to OSD, DoD, JS, NSC or the Deputies.\n       Letter clearly circumvents the established IWG process \n     being pursued through the NSC.\n\n\n               The O'Leary Letter (sent as an attachment)\n\n     Section I.\n       ``. . . strongly urge you to . . . not conduct, or prepare \n     to conduct hydronuclear experiments during the existing \n     moratorium''--circumvents the IWG Deputies forum established \n     by NSC to decide this issue in an Interagency process\n     Section II.\n       ``. . . not technically essential to conduct hydronuclear \n     experiments at this time''--HNs must be conducted while the \n     stockpile is safe and reliable to acquire baseline data, \n     otherwise HN as a diagnostic for stockpile problems is of \n     limited value\n       ``. . . technical means other than hydronuclear testing can \n     maintain the stockpile in this robust condition for the near \n     term''--HNs provide direct experimental testing of an \n     unaltered (real) pit--no other technique provides this \n     capability\n       ``. . . the JASON group . . . opposed these \n     experiments.''--The JASON's draft report indicated that HN \n     experiments have limited technical value, but their \n     assessment was lacking in scope and depth--the JASONs \n     received one briefing and asked no questions in developing \n     their position--NRDC white paper was the basis for their \n     conclusions\n       ``. . . could undermine the CTBT negotiations . . .''-- \n     speculative\n       ``A request for funding in FY 1996 . . . difficult to \n     defend to the Congress . . .''--ability to justify funding \n     for HNs with Congress should be based on the need to maintain \n     a safe and reliable stockpile\n       ``As a member of your cabinet with responsibility with \n     others for carrying out your nonproliferation and national \n     security agenda''--the national security agenda should \n     include Stockpile Stewardship that includes the ability to \n     conduct a meaningful experimental program\n       AE opinion--HNs will provide unique data to be combined \n     with other experimental and analytical data to significantly \n     improve confidence in the safety and reliability of the \n     stockpile\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in the summary of the \ndocument to the President of the United States from Hazel O'Leary, the \nEnergy Secretary, she said:\n\n       After careful and extended debate within the executive \n     agencies, you are to be presented with a decision memorandum \n     on whether the United States should conduct hydronuclear \n     experiments at the Nevada test site (NTS) under the \n     moratorium on nuclear testing. Although the views of the \n     Department of Energy on this matter are reflected in that \n     decision memorandum, I want to take this opportunity to \n     strongly urge you to decide that the U.S. should not conduct, \n     nor prepare to conduct, hydronuclear experiments during the \n     existing moratorium.\n\n  In other words, the Secretary of Energy is asking the President of \nthe United States to ignore the recommendations of the experts.\n  She states further in this memorandum to the President:\n\n       It is not technically essential to conduct hydronuclear \n     experiments at this time. The Department of Energy has \n     determined that the existing nuclear stockpile of the United \n     States is safe and reliable and that technical means other \n     than hydronuclear testing can maintain the stockpile in this \n     robust condition for the near term.\n\n  She concludes in the memo to the President:\n\n       As a member of your cabinet with responsibility, with \n     others, for carrying out your nonproliferation and national \n     security agenda, I believe strongly that a decision to \n     conduct, or to prepare to conduct, hydronuclear experiments \n     under a nuclear testing moratorium is technically unwise and \n     substantively unnecessary at this time. I urge you to decide \n     not to authorize preparations for these experiments in the \n     fiscal year 1996 . . . .\n\n  That is a very interesting memorandum from the Secretary of Energy to \nthe President of the United States.\n  Now let us hear what the experts had to say. This is very \ninteresting. In a memorandum from Dr. Harold Smith to John Deutch, \nNuclear Weapons Council: Background, letter dated September 8 from \nSecretary O'Leary to the President was received in my office today by \nfax as a bootleg copy from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Copies \nnot distributed to OSD, DOD, Joint Staff, NSC or the Deputies, not \ndistributed and not copied.\n  Then the subject, and it begins to analyze the O'Leary memo. Let me \nquote a couple of items. In the memo from O'Leary to the President, she \nsays: Strongly urge you to not conduct or prepare to conduct \nhydronuclear experiments. They say: This circumvents the IWG deputies \nforum established by the NSC to decide this issue in an interagency \nprocess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 4 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HELMS. One more minute.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has been yielded 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The second point in the O'Leary memo \nsays: not technically essential to conduct hydronuclear experiments at \nthis time. Hydronuclear experiments must be conducted while the \nstockpile is safe and reliable to acquire baseline data, otherwise HN, \nor hydronuclear, testing, as a diagnostic for stockpile problems, is of \nlimited value.\n  These are the experts saying this in response.\n  Finally: Hydronuclear tests provide direct experimental testing of an \nunaltered real pit. No other technique provides that capability. This \nis what the experts in the Clinton administration believed. They were \nend run by the Secretary of Energy on a political decision, which \nbasically said, don't worry about the science, just move forward with \nthe policy.\n  This is outrageous. It flies in the face of every single point the \nPresident has made in saying we should pass this treaty.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I have a strong sense of deja vu today.\n  On September 22, 1963, the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, ratified \nthe Limited Test Ban Treaty by a vote of 80-19. I was present in the \nChamber, in the gallery, as a young 21-year-old student observing my \ncountry in action and studying government and politics. I was very \nproud of the Senate on that day.\n  I was very proud of President Kennedy when, on October 7, 1963, he \nsigned the instruments of ratification of the Limited Test Ban Treaty \nin the treaty room at the White House.\n  Today I am saddened. I am saddened by our rush to judgment. I am \nsaddened that our Nation may see a rejection by this Senate of the \nfirst real treaty in terms of arms limitation in 70 years.\n  We are in the strongest military posture I think we have been in as a \nnation. As such, we are certainly more secure today than when John F. \nKennedy sought ratification of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, \ncertainly more secure than when President Ronald Reagan sought approval \nof the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1988, and certainly more \nsecure than when President Bush submitted the START I treaty for Senate \nratification in 1992. Of all the nations in the world, we have the most \nto gain from slowing the development of more capable weapons by others \nand the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries.\n  The treaty cannot enter into force unless and until all 44 nuclear-\ncapable states, including China, India, Iran, North Korea, and \nPakistan, have ratified it. Should any one of these nations refuse to \naccept the treaty and its conditions, all bets are off. Finally, even \nif\n\n[[Page S12526]]\n\nall the required countries ratify, we will still have the right to \nunilaterally withdraw from the treaty if we determine that our supreme \nnational interests have been jeopardized.\n  President Kennedy said, when he signed our first real nuclear test \nban treaty: In the first two decades, the age of nuclear energy has \nbeen full of fear, yet never empty of hope. Today the fear is a little \nless and the hope a little greater.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that at the end of today's work, this \nSenate can say the same.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Resolution of \nAdvice and Consent to the Ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  Last Thursday, I testified before the Senate Committee on Foreign \nRelations, in my capacity as chairman of the Select Committee on \nIntelligence, to present my views on the ability of the Intelligence \nCommunity to monitor compliance with the CTBT. Today, I would like to \nmake certain general observations, in addition to addressing issues \ninvolving CTBT monitoring and verification. By the way: monitoring and \nverification are different. Monitoring is objective. Verification is \nsubjective; it involves determining the significance of information \nobtained through monitoring.\n  First, as a general matter, I believe that the treaty will serve as a \nstalking horse for denuclearization. I do not accuse all of the \ntreaty's supporters of seeking that goal. Yet, a test ban agreement \nwhose first operative sentence appears on its face to outlaw the \nexplosion of nuclear weapons, even in a war of self-defense, surely \nraises profound questions about the long-term viability of any nuclear \ndeterrent.\n  I fear that the treaty will both undermine and delegitimize our \nnuclear deterrent. When I say ``undermine,'' I refer to the effect of \nratification of, and adherence to, this treaty on the weapons in our \nnuclear stockpile.\n  Senators Kyl, Warner, and others have ably addressed this issue in \nthe course of the debate. I will not belabor it further, other than to \ncite, as others have, the conclusion of former Secretaries of Defense \nRumsfeld, Cheney, Schlesinger, Weinberger, Laird, and Carlucci. These \nhighly regarded public servants have determined that ``over the decades \nahead, confidence in the reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile \nwould inevitably decline, thereby reducing the credibility of America's \nnuclear deterrent.'' This alone is reason for the Senate to withhold \nits advice and consent to the treaty.\n  With respect to delegitimizing our nuclear deterrent, Article I of \nthe treaty prohibits ``any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other \nnuclear explosion.'' I understand that the U.S. Government does not \nview that prohibition as applying to the use of nuclear weapons.\n  The President's 1997 transmittal message to the Senate included an \narticle-by-article analysis of the treaty. This analysis explains that \nthe U.S. position in the negotiations was that ``undertakings relating \nto the use of nuclear weapons were totally beyond the scope'' of the \nCTBT. The analysis does not make clear whether all other signatories \nagreed with the U.S. view or whether they acquiesced in it or did \nsomething else. It is unfortunate that the CTBT text does not \nincorporate the U.S. understanding. We are asked to give our advice and \nconsent to that text and only that text.\n  Article 15 of the treaty bars reservations, even one clarifying the \nmeaning of Article I. Because the U.S. understanding of the scope of \nthe prohibition on other nuclear explosions cannot be incorporated in a \nreservation to the treaty, the U.S. position may be subject to \nchallenge as a matter of law. After all, one normally looks at \nnegotiating history only if the treaty text is unclear. I hope the \nadministration will address this issue to my satisfaction.\n  In the meantime, along with many other concerns about this treaty, I \nquestion the wisdom of negotiating an agreement that relegates our \nright of self-defense to the fine print.\n  I would also draw the attention of Senators to the language of the \npreamble to the CTBT. The administration points to the preamble for \nsupport for its narrow reading of the open-ended language of Article I. \nThe administration notes, correctly, that the preamble does not refer \nto the ``use'' of nuclear weapons. In the administration's view, the \ntreaty therefore cannot be read to apply to the use of nuclear weapons. \nYet, a close reading of the preamble raises more questions than it \nanswers over the ultimate purpose of the CTBT. I hope everybody shares \nmy abhorrence of nuclear weapons. But merely wishing to put the nuclear \ngenie back in the bottle will not accomplish that goal.\n  The one certainty about the CTBT is that, if ratified, the United \nStates will obey it to the letter. Other countries' record of deception \nand denial with respect to nuclear testing is such that we cannot have \nthe same confidence. And, in the world of the blind, the one-eyed is \nking.\n  I have supported well-negotiated, well-considered reductions in our \nnuclear forces. But it is a fact that the American nuclear deterrent \nhas served our Nation well and has served the world well. The United \nStates, under Democratic and Republican administrations, backed by a \nstrong and credible nuclear deterrent, faced down the Soviet threat and \nserved as a force for peace and stability around the world.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I would not start down this path. Even if \nthe Senate approved the CTBT today, it would be years before the treaty \ntook effect. And by then, decisions would have been made affecting the \nfuture of our nuclear deterrent that may be irrevocable.\n  The second reason I intend to vote against advice and consent is that \nI am convinced that the treaty cannot achieve the goals its proponents \nhave described: to prevent the nuclear powers from developing new \nnuclear weapons and to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  While I cannot go into classified details, as my colleagues are \naware, the Washington Post recently reported that Russia continues to \nconduct what may be low-yield nuclear tests at its Arctic test site. \nRussia reportedly is undertaking this action in order to develop a new \nlow-yield weapon that will be the linchpin of a new military doctrine. \nThese Russian activities are of particular concern. There is evidence, \nincluding public statements from the Russian First Deputy Minister of \nAtomic Energy, Viktor Mikhailov, that Russia intends to continue to \nconduct low-yield hydro-nuclear tests--that is, nuclear tests--and does \nnot believe that these are prohibited by the treaty.\n  With respect to proliferation, Acting Undersecretary of State John \nHolum has stated that, with the CTBT in effect, it will be ``very \ndifficult for new countries to develop nuclear weapons.'' Yet, Director \nof Central Intelligence George Tenet has stated that ``[n]uclear \ntesting is not required for the acquisition of a basic nuclear weapons \ncapability . . . [and] is not critical for a first-generation weapon.'' \nNorth Korea, Iraq, and Iran are seeking this kind of weapon.\n  Third, it is my considered judgment, as Chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, that it is impossible to monitor compliance with this treaty \nwith the confidence that the Senate should demand--I repeat, demand--\nbefore providing its advice and consent to ratification.\n  Simply put, I am not confident that we can now, or, in the \nforeseeable future will be able to, detect any and all nuclear \nexplosions prohibited under the treaty.\n  I have a great degree of confidence in our ability to monitor higher \nyield explosions at known test sites. I have markedly less confidence \nin our capabilities to monitor lower yield and/or evasively conducted \ntests, including tests that may enable states to develop new nuclear \nweapons or improve existing weapons.\n  I should also repeat in this context North Korea, Iran, and Iraq can \ndevelop and deploy nuclear weapons without any nuclear tests at all.\n  With respect to monitoring, in July 1997, the intelligence community \nissued a National Intelligence Estimate entitled ``Monitoring the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty Over the Next 10 years.'' While I cannot \ngo into classified details, I can say that the\n\n[[Page S12527]]\n\nNIE was not encouraging about our ability to monitor compliance with \nthe treaty--nor about the likely utility of the treaty in preventing \ncountries like North Korea, Iran, and Iraq from developing and fielding \nnuclear weapons.\n  The NIE identified numerous challenges, difficulties, and credible \nevasion scenarios that affect the intelligence community's confidence \nin its ability to monitor compliance.\n  Because the details are classified, and because of the inherent \ndifficulty of summarizing a highly technical analysis covering a number \nof different countries and a multitude of variables, I recommend that \nMembers review this document with the following caution: I believe that \nnewly acquired information and other developments require a \nreevaluation of the 1997 estimate's assumptions and underlying analysis \non certain key issues. I believe such a new analysis will increase \nconcern about monitoring the CTBT. A preliminary summary of the \nIntelligence community's revised judgment was provided to the committee \nlate last Friday. This document, along with the NIE and the transcript \nfrom last week's hearing is available to Members in S-407.\n  Proponents of the treaty argue, in essence, that we will miss no test \nof strategic significance. Despite the U.S. inability to monitor \ncompliance at any test level, proponents place their faith in \nmultilateral monitoring aids provided under the treaty: the \nInternational Monitoring System, a multinational seismic, infra-sound, \nhydro-acoustic, and radio-nucleide detection system; and the CTBT's on-\nsite inspection regime.\n  Based on a review of the structure, likely capabilities, and \nprocedures of these multilateral mechanisms, which will not be \noperational for a number of years, and based on the intelligence \ncommunity's own analysis, I believe that these mechanisms will be of \nlittle value. For example, the IMS will be technically inadequate to \nmonitor the most likely forms of noncompliance.\n  The IMS seismic system was not designed to detect ``evasively'' \nconducted tests. These are precisely the kind of tests Iraq or North \nKorea are likely to conduct.\n  In addition, the IMS suffers from having been designed with \ndiplomatic sensitivities rather than effective monitoring in mind. \nUnder the so-called ``non-discriminatory'' framework, no country will \nbe singled out for attention. All countries--Iraq and Ireland, North \nKorea and Norway--will receive the same level of verification.\n  Lastly, it will be 8 to 10 years before the system is complete.\n  Because of these shortcomings, and for other technical reasons, I am \nafraid that the IMS is likely to muddy the waters by injecting \nquestionable data into what will inevitably be highly charged debates \nover possible violations.\n  With respect to OSI, I believe that the onsite inspection regime \ninvites delay and deception. For example, U.S. negotiators originally \nsought an ``automatic green light'' for on-site inspections. Yet, \nbecause of the opposition of the People's Republic of China, the regime \nthat was adopted allows inspections only with the approval of 30 of the \n51 countries on the Executive Committee. Proponents of ratification, \nespecially, will appreciate the difficulty of rounding up the votes for \nsuch a super-majority.\n  I am troubled by the fact that if the United States requested an \ninspection, no U.S. inspectors could participate in that inspection, \nand we could send an observer only if the inspected party approved. I \nam also disturbed by the right of the inspected party to declare areas \nup to fifty square kilometers off-limits to inspection or to impose \nsevere restrictions on inspectors in those areas.\n  I understand that these provisions mirror limitations sought by \nSaddam Hussein on UNSCOM inspectors. This leads me to believe that OSI \nstands for ``Option Selected by Iraq.'' Even if inspectors do \neventually get near the scene of a suspicious event, the evidence--\nwhich is highly perishable--may well have vanished.\n  The recently-reported activity at Russia's Arctic test site raises \nquestions both as to our monitoring capabilities and Russian intentions \nunder the CTBT. The Washington Post reported that Russia continues to \nconduct possible low-yield nuclear tests at its Arctic test site. The \nWashington Post also reported that the CIA cannot monitor such tests \nwith enough precision to determine whether they are nuclear or \nconventional explosions.\n  Mr. President, I have tried to convey some serious concerns about the \npracticality of this treaty, and that is extremely difficult to do in \nan unclassified forum and in such a short time.\n  I urge my colleagues, as they consider their position on this treaty, \nto immerse themselves in the details. For further information on treaty \nmonitoring and the reported activities at the Russian test site, I urge \nMembers to review the materials available in S-407.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to make some general points.\n  First, I believe that, when foreign and national security policies \ncome before the Senate, we must put the Nation's interests first.\n  Second, while arms control agreements may be useful to the extent \nthey advance our national interests, they are not a substitute for \nsound policy. Good agreements are an instrument of good policy. Bad \nagreements, pursued for agreement's sake, do not serve our Nation's \ninterests.\n  Lastly, some of my colleagues have held out the option of withdrawal \nfrom the treaty, should it be ratified yet somehow fail to lead to the \nGolden Age that proponents envision.\n  Let me be clear. If this treaty is ratified, there will be no turning \nback.\n  The history of cold war arms control agreements is instructive. In \n1972, the United States signed the Interim Agreement on the Limitation \nof Strategic Offensive Arms, generally known as SALT I, together with \nthe SALT I Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.\n  On May 9, 1972, Ambassador Gerard Smith unilaterally declared that \n``[i]f an agreement providing for more complete strategic offensive \narms limitations were not achieved within five years, U.S. supreme \ninterests could be jeopardized.'' He continued, ``Should that occur, it \nwould constitute a basis for withdrawal from the ABM Treaty.''\n  In fact, no such agreement was reached in five years or in ten years \nor in 15 years. Not until 1991, almost 20 years after SALT I, when \nSTART I was signed, did the United States and the Soviet Union reach \nsuch an agreement. At no point did the United States invoke the Supreme \nInterest clause to withdraw from the ABM Treaty.\n  It is difficult to imagine the circumstances in which an \nadministration would withdraw from the CTBT.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I believe that there are many reasons to \noppose this treaty. The effect on our nuclear stockpile, the inability \nof the treaty to achieve its goals, and our inability to monitor \ncompliance are each sufficient reason to withhold advice and consent to \nratification.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. \nPresident, I rise today to express my support for the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty. Unfortunately, the vote outcome today looks to \nbe a tragedy of major proportions. It will leave the world a far less \nsafe place and means the United States relinquishes its imperative as a \nleader in nuclear nonproliferation. I would like to take a few minutes \nto explain why I support this treaty, and to address some of the \narguments presented by those who are opposed to this Treaty.\n  I support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty because I believe it \nstrengthens the U.S. ability to play a leadership role in global \nnuclear non-proliferation. The treaty is a key element of the global \nnon-proliferation regime, and if the U.S. fails to ratify the CTBT, it \nsends a clear message around the world that the development and \npossession of nuclear weapons are acceptable. As former U.S. Ambassador \nto India Frank Wisner expressed in a letter earlier this year, if the \nU.S. walks away from the CTBT ``I do not want to contemplate treaty \nfailure here followed by a breakdown with India and Pakistan and the \neffect these moves will have on rogue states like Iraq, Libya, Iran and \nNorth Korea.''\n  Second, the CTBT will constrain the development of nuclear \ncapabilities by rogue states, as well as the development of more \nadvanced weapons by declared nuclear states. Any significant nuclear \nprogram requires extensive testing, and while a rogue state might \ndevelop a primitive first generation\n\n[[Page S12528]]\n\nweapon without testing, that testing would not be adequate to develop a \nsophisticated weapon. And, because new types of weapons also require \ntesting, the CTBT will also curb the ability of states which already \npossess nuclear weapons from developing more advanced designs. As John \nHolum, Acting Undersecretary of State and the former Director of the \nArms Control and Disarmament Agency, has noted, the United States does \nnot need tests; proliferators need tests.\n  Third, the CTBT will improve the U.S. ability to detect and deter \nnuclear tests. The American Geophysical Union and the Seismological \nSociety of America, in a joint statement issued on October 6, found \nthat when the International Monitoring System--with over 300 seismic, \nhydroacoustic, infrasound, and radionuclide monitoring stations--is in \noperation, no nation will be able to elude them, even with a small-\nyield test.\n  And, finally, the CTBT will make the world a safer place and \nsafeguard U.S. national security interests. The treaty constrains the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons by other states. That is good. It \nprovides the United States with additional means to detect nuclear \nactivities of other countries. It provides the United States with means \nand leverage to act if we discover that other states are, in violation \nof the treaty, developing nuclear weapons. And, given the size and \nsophistication of the U.S. nuclear arsenal--second to none in every \nrespect--it preserves U.S. nuclear superiority and our deterrent \ncapability. It will help make the world a safer place. It is in the \nnational interest.\n  The Joint Chiefs believe that this Treaty safeguards U.S. interests. \nFormer Chiefs, including Generals Colin Powell, John Shalikashvili, \nDavid Jones, and Admiral Crowe all endorse the treaty. Presidents of \nboth parties, from Eisenhower and Kennedy to President Clinton have \nworked for a ban on nuclear test explosions. The NATO alliance has \nendorsed the Treaty. And other leading U.S. military and diplomatic \nfigures--including Paul Nitze, Admiral Turner, Admiral Zumwalt--all \nsupport this treaty and believe that it makes the U.S. more secure in \nthe world, not less.\n  Let me now address several of the arguments that have been raised by \nopponents of this treaty: That it is not verifiable; that it will \ncompromise the reliability and integrity of the U.S. nuclear arsenal; \nthat the U.S. needs to maintain the ability to improve our nuclear \narsenal and that we can only do so with additional tests; and that \nothers, such as North Korea and Iran, will develop nuclear weapons \nunder the CTBT while our hands are tied.\n  First, several opponents of this treaty have commented that it is \nimpossible for the CTBT to offer a 100% fool-proof means of detecting \nlow-yield tests.\n  It is true that the CTBT will not provide the means for 100% \nverification of low-yield tests--those tests less than one kiloton in \nsize. But it is undeniable that the additional seismic monitors, \nincluding a system that will be well-calibrated to pick up tests \nsmaller than one kiloton (in areas of interest) and the treaty's on-\nsite verification provisions, will increase our current verification \ncapabilities. As the statement of the American Geophysical Union and \nthe Seismological Society of America asserts, the CTBT will add \nsignificant capabilities to what we can now detect, and the increased \nlikelihood of detection will serve as a real deterrent to any state \ncontemplating a test.\n  In addition, as physicist and arms control expert Sidney Drell has \nnoted, ``very low yield tests are of questionable value in designing \nnew nuclear weapons or confirming that a new design will work as \nintended.'' In other words, even if the CTBT is not 100% verifiable for \nsmall-yield tests, tests of this size are only of a limited utility to \na state seeking to develop nuclear weapons.\n  Second, questions have been raised about the adequacy of the Science \nBased Stockpile Stewardship Program to maintain the reliability and \nintegrity of U.S. weapons systems.\n  Simply put, according to General Shalikashvili in testimony before \nCongress, ``our warheads, having been adequately tested in the past, \ncontinue to be safe and reliable.'' With the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram, further nuclear testing is not necessary to maintain the \nsafety and reliability of the U.S. arsenal. The U.S. has conducted over \n1,000 nuclear tests. We have a high level of knowledge and \nsophistication and sufficient data to maintain the safety and \nreliability of our weapons. The U.S. does not need to conduct further \nnuclear tests--it is other states that need to test if they seek to \ndevelop nuclear programs, and it is precisely tests by other states \nthat the CTBT will constrain or prevent.\n  In fact, because the U.S. does not need to continue to test, in 1992 \nPresident Bush signed into law legislation that established a \nmoratorium on U.S. testing, and we have not tested a weapon in six \nyears.\n  Each year the heads of Los Alamos, Sandia, and Lawrence Livermore \nhave certified that the U.S. stockpile is safe and reliable. There is \nevery indication that, aided by sophisticated computer modeling and \nother stockpile stewardship initiatives, they will be able to continue \nto make these certifications. In fact, in a February 2, 1998 statement, \nthe three lab heads stated that ``We are confident that the Stockpile \nStewardship program will enable us to maintain America's nuclear \ndeterrent without nuclear testing.''\n  Critically--and this point should not be overlooked or ignored by \nopponents of the treaty--if at any point the United States finds that \nit can not continue to certify the safety and reliability of our \nnuclear weapons, under the President's safeguards package incorporated \nin the Democratic Amendment, the U.S. will maintain the prerogative to \npull out of the CTBT and conduct tests or take whatever measures are \nnecessary to maintain stockpile integrity. In other words, our very \nability to maintain stockpile safety is a condition of U.S. \nparticipation in the CTBT.\n  Third, questions have been raised as to whether the U.S. needs to \ncontinue to test to maintain the ability to improve our nuclear arsenal \nto face the security challenges that lie ahead.\n  While the CTBT might constrain our ability to develop whole new \nclasses of weapons, the CTBT does allow us to make modifications to our \nweapons, including casings, detonators, batteries, and arming systems. \nIn a letter to President Clinton, Dr. Hans A. Bethe, head of the \nManhattan Project's theoretical division and professor of physics \nemeritus at Cornell University, states that ``If any component shows \nsigns of deterioration it will be refabricated. If the fuel itself is \ndegrading, it will be refreshed.''\n  Parts that wear out can be replaced, and modifications can be made \nthat will improve the capabilities of our nuclear arsenal. Thus, for \nexample, in 1996 a B-61-7 nuclear bomb was modified to a B-61-Mod V \nearth penetrating weapon by hardening the outer casing. Unlike the B-\n61-7, the B-61-Mod V has additional capability to penetrate hardened \ntargets.\n\n  In other words, the CTBT, while effectively preventing other states \nfrom developing nuclear weapons, will still allow the United States to \nmodify its arsenal to meet the challenges that we may face in the years \nahead.\n  Finally, there is the argument that under the CTBT other states--\nespecially such states as North Korea or Iran--will do what they want \nwhile our hands will be tied.\n  In the final analysis some states will do what they want in violation \nof the norm established by the international community anyway. In other \nwords, they will seek to develop nuclear weapons whether or not the \nCTBT is in force.\n  The real question, then, is if the CTBT will make it easier or more \ndifficult for these states to develop nuclear weapons.\n  For example, with or without the CTBT the U.S. will face problems \nverifying small-yield tests. And the fact of the matter is that without \nthe CTBT, relying only on national intelligence means, we will have \ngreater difficulty in detecting any tests and less leverage to do \nanything about it if we do.\n  Again, to quote General Shalikashvili,\n\n       On the issue of verification we have concluded that a \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will actually put us in a \n     better position to obtain effective verification than we \n     would have without the Treaty. The Treaty does not provide \n     ``perfect verification,'' but that\n\n[[Page S12529]]\n\n     level of verification that would allow us to detect, to \n     identify and to attribute that level of testing that could \n     undercut our nuclear deterrent.\n\n  The CTBT may thus deter some from going forward with nuclear \ndevelopments entirely--India and Pakistan have indicated that they \nwould adhere to a test ban, for example--and for those it will not \ndeter, it will make the development of nuclear weapons that much more \ndifficult, and perhaps impossible.\n  I do not believe the CTBT, or any treaty for that matter, can prevent \na determined state from doing what the treaty forbids. But that is \nneither the right nor the fair standard to measure the treaty against. \nOne cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n  The bottom line is that by any measure the CTBT will make the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons by other states more difficult, will add \nto the U.S. ability to detect tests, and will enhance U.S. national \nsecurity by preventing the spread of nuclear weapons while assuring \nthat the U.S. maintains a strong and capable nuclear deterrent second \nto none. And we also know that failure of the U.S. to ratify the CTBT \nwill have disastrous repercussion.\n  The United States has led the international effort to keep the \nnuclear genie in the bottle for the past five decades. As we prepare to \nenter a new century we should not now uncork that bottle, and make our \nlegacy to the twenty-first century the unleashing of a global nuclear \nweapons race.\n  Although I do not believe that this is the appropriate time for this \nSenate to vote on this treaty, I urge my colleagues to support \nratification of the CTBT.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I intend to vote \nagainst the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). I think that the \nwords of President Ronald Reagan serve as the most appropriate and \npowerful way to begin this discussion. President Reagan frequently \nreminded us, ``We must always remain strong, so that we will always be \nfree.'' The first question we must ask ourselves as we consider this \nvote is whether the CTBT jeopardizes the strength that the American \npeople have relied upon for 50 years to ensure that this Nation remains \nfree and at peace. Unfortunately, after careful consideration, I have \nconcluded that the CTBT does jeopardize our strength by causing real \nharm to the very backbone of America's security--its safe, reliable, \nand credible, nuclear deterrent.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that the Senate should postpone \nfinal action on the CTBT, that defeating the treaty today sends the \nwrong message to the world, that somehow the Senate would be signaling \nto rogue states and others that the United States thinks it is \nacceptable to develop nuclear weapons. I could not disagree more. The \nSenate will reject this treaty because it harms America's nuclear \ndeterrent and because it does nothing meaningful to ensure that the \nspread of nuclear weapons is halted. Regardless of the outcome of the \nCTBT vote, the world should know that this Senate remains committed to \npreventing the spread of nuclear weapons, and that we will continue to \nsupport the strongest possible actions against proliferant states.\n  Nor should the rest of the world misinterpret another aspect of the \nSenate's rejection of the CTBT. The main message of the Senate's action \ntoday is that our constitutional democracy, with its cherished checks \nand balances, is alive and well. Through the wisdom of our Founding \nFathers, the Constitution makes the treaty-making power a shared power. \nThe Senate, through its obligation to provide advice and consent to \ntreaties, acts as the ``quality control mechanism'' to ensure that the \nPresident does not bind the Nation to an international commitment that \nis not in its best interests. Before the United States is bound by the \nterms of an international agreement such as the CTBT, the President and \nthe Senate must both agree to its terms. In rejecting the CTBT, the \nSenate is sending an explicit message that the United States does not \nhave an international legal obligation to adhere to the provisions of \nthe treaty. If the President were to determine that the United States \nmust conduct tests to ensure the safety or reliability of our nuclear \narsenal, the United States would be entitled to do so.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the Senate's rejection of the CTBT will \nsend a clear message that the United States will not sign up to flawed \ntreaties that are not in the nation's interest. And the men and women \nwho represent the United States in international negotiations will know \nthat when they stand up to negotiating partners in order to protect \nAmerica's interests in future treaty negotiations, the Senate will not \nonly support them, it will expect them to forcefully advocate a \nposition that protects those interests.\n  Supporters of the CTBT would have the American people believe that to \ncast a vote against the treaty is merely a political act designed to \nembarrass the President. I do not see how anyone who has actually \nwatched the Senate's careful deliberations--both in its committees and \nthe floor--in recent weeks can honestly reach such a conclusion. I \nthink that what the Senate had done through its thorough hearings and \nfloor debate is to demonstrate beyond any reasonable doubt that this \ntreaty faces certain defeat because of the substantive arguments \nagainst it that have been persuasively been presented to this body. \nThe inescapable fact about the CTBT is that it is a fatally flawed \ntreaty--it jeopardizes this Nation's nuclear deterrent, it will not \ncontribute to the cause of nonproliferation, and it is unverifiable and \nunenforceable.\n\n  Although these arguments have already been made in depth here on the \nfloor, they bear reinforcement as Senators prepare to cast their votes.\n  First, the CTBT threatens the Nation's nuclear deterrent--the very \nbackbone of America's security for the past 50 years. To have an \neffective nuclear deterrent, we must have absolute confidence in the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear weapons. This requires periodic \nnuclear tests to ensure that we understand, for example, the effects of \naging on our weapons and the best way to mitigate those effects. Again, \nas with the maintenance of any complex weapon, we must be able to test, \nto detect technical or safety problems that arise in our nuclear \nstockpile.\n  The administration's Stockpile Stewardship Program may well help the \nUnited States to better understand our nuclear arsenal, but it is \nunproven, it may never be an adequate substitute for actual tests, and \nit is already behind schedule.\n  A week's worth of expert testimony bears this out. As C. Paul \nRobinson, the current Director of Sandia National Laboratory, testified \nbefore the Armed Services Committee last week:\n\n       I and others who are, or have been, responsible for the \n     safety and reliability of the U.S. stockpile of nuclear \n     weapons have testified to this obvious conclusion [that \n     testing is the preferred methodology] many times in the past. \n     To forego that validation through testing is, in short, to \n     live with uncertainty.\n\n  Second, the CTBT will not contribute to the cause of \nnonproliferation. Countries will make decisions about whether to pursue \nnuclear weapons based on hard-headed calculations of their security \ninterests. This fact has been demonstrated time and again. The \nexistence of an ``international norm'' against the pursuit of nuclear \nweapons, created by the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), \nhas not stopped a number of states, including Iran, Iraq, and North \nKorea from attempting to develop nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the \nUnited States has not tested in 8 years, yet in that same timeframe, \nfive other nations have tested.\n  Third, the CTBT is unverifiable, meaning that states who choose to \nviolate the CTBT may never be caught, and it is unenforceable, meaning \nthat violators who are caught will likely go unpunished. As the October \n3 Washington Post pointed out, a recent assessment by the Central \nIntelligence Agency concluded that the CIA ``cannot monitor low-level \ntests by Russia precisely enough to ensure compliance with the CTBT.''\n  And as C. Paul Robinson, the Director of Sandia National Laboratory, \nsaid in testimony before the Armed Services Committee on October 7:\n\n       . . . [c]ompliance with a strict zero-yield requirement is \n     unverifiable. The limitations of verifiability introduce the \n     possibility of inconsistent observance of the ban under the \n     threshold of detectability.\n\n  Speaking to the issue of lack of enforceability, our colleague \nRichard Lugar recently noted:\n\n\n[[Page S12530]]\n\n\n       This treaty simply has no teeth . . . . The CTBT's answer \n     to illegal nuclear testing is the possible implementation of \n     sanctions. It is clear that this will not prove particularly \n     compelling in the decisionmaking processes of foreign states \n     intent on building nuclear weapons. For those countries \n     seeking nuclear weapons, the perceived benefits in \n     international stature and deterrence generally far outweigh \n     the concern about sanctions that could be brought to bear by \n     the international community.\n\n  Mr. President, for all the reasons my colleagues and I have cited \nthroughout this debate, I believe the only prudent course is for the \nSenate to demonstrate strength and good sense worthy of Ronald Reagan \nby rejecting this flawed CTBT.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from Dr. Henry Kissinger to the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Henry A. Kissinger,\n\n                                                 October 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, I--together with former \n     National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former CIA \n     Director and Deputy Secretary of Defense John Deutch--had \n     recommended in a letter dated October 5th to Senators Lott \n     and Daschle and in an op-ed in the October 6th Washington \n     Post that a vote on ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear \n     Test Ban Treaty be postponed to permit a further discussion \n     and clarification of the issues now too controversial. This \n     having proved unachievable, I am obliged to state my \n     position.\n       As a former Secretary of State, I find the prospect that a \n     major treaty might fail to be ratified extremely painful. But \n     the subject of this treaty concerns the future security of \n     the United States and involves risks that make it impossible \n     for me to recommend voting for the treaty as it now stands.\n       My concerns are as follows.\n\n\n                     importance of nuclear weapons\n\n       For the entire postwar period, the American nuclear arsenal \n     has been America's ultimate shield and that of our allies. \n     Though we no longer face the same massive threat that we did \n     during the Cold War, new dangers have arisen. Our nuclear \n     arsenal is our principal deterrent to the possible use of \n     biological and chemical warfare against America, our \n     military, and our allies.\n\n\n                              verification\n\n       Almost all experts agree that nuclear tests below some \n     yield threshold remain unverifiable and that this \n     threshold can be raised by technical means. It seems to me \n     highly dangerous to leave such a vacuum regarding a matter \n     fundamentally affecting the security of the United States. \n     And the fact that this treaty is of indefinite duration \n     compounds the problem. The CIA's concerns about recent \n     ambiguous activities by Russia, as reported in the media, \n     illustrate difficulties that will only be compounded by \n     the passage of time.\n       Supporters of the treaty argue that, because of their small \n     yield, these tests cannot be significant and that the treaty \n     would therefore ``lock in'' our advantages vis-a-vis other \n     nuclear powers and aspirants. I do not know how they can be \n     so sure of this in an age of rapidly exploding technology and \n     whether, on the contrary, this may not work to the advantage \n     of nations seeking to close this gap. After all, victory in \n     the Cold War was achieved in part because we kept increasing, \n     and not freezing, our technological edge.\n\n\n                           nuclear stockpile\n\n       I am not a technical expert on such issues as proof \n     testing, aging of nuclear material, and reworking existing \n     warheads. But I find it impossible to ignore the concern \n     about the treaty expressed by six former Secretaries of \n     Defense and several former CIA Directors and National \n     Security Advisers. I am aware that experts from the weapons \n     laboratories have argued that there are ingenious ways to \n     mitigate these concerns. On the other hand, there is a \n     difference between the opinion of experts from laboratories \n     and policymakers' confidence in the reliability of these \n     weapons as our existing stockpile ages. When national \n     security is involved, one should not proceed in the face of \n     such doubts.\n\n\n                               sanctions\n\n       Another fundamental problem is the weakness of the \n     enforcement mechanism. In theory, we have a right to abrogate \n     the treaty when the ``supreme national survival'' is \n     involved. But this option is more theoretical than practical. \n     In a bilateral treaty, the reluctance to resort to abrogation \n     is powerful enough; in a multilateral treaty of indefinite \n     duration, this reluctance would be even more acute. It is not \n     clear how we would respond to a set of violations by an \n     individual country or, indeed, what response would be \n     meaningful or whether, say, an Iranian test could be said to \n     threaten the supreme national survival.\n\n\n                           non-proliferation\n\n       I am not persuaded that the proposed treaty would inhibit \n     nuclear proliferation. Restraint by the major powers has \n     never been a significant factor in the decisions of other \n     nuclear aspirants, which are driven by local rivalries and \n     security needs. Nor is the behavior of rogue states such as \n     Iraq, Iran, or North Korea likely to be affected by this \n     treaty. They either will not sign or, if they sign, will \n     cheat. And countries relying on our nuclear umbrella might be \n     induced by declining confidence in our arsenal--and the \n     general impression of denuclearization--to accelerate their \n     own efforts.\n       For all these reasons, I cannot recommend a vote for a \n     comprehensive test ban of unlimited duration.\n       I hope this is helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Henry A. Kissinger.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will read excerpts from the letter. It is \ninstructive that Henry Kissinger has written the following:\n\n       As a former Secretary of State, I find the prospect that \n     major treaty might fail to be ratified extremely painful. But \n     the subject of this treaty concerns the future security of \n     the United States and involves risks that make it impossible \n     for me to recommend voting for the treaty as it now stands.\n\n  He then went on to talk about the experts who believe the treaty to \nbe unverifiable, and then the concerns expressed by the CIA about \nrecent ambiguous activities with respect to Russia; the impossibility, \non his part, to ignore the concerns expressed by people such as the \nformer Secretaries of Defense, CIA Directors, and National Security \nAdvisers; and the weakness of the enforcement mechanism of the treaty.\n  He concludes in the following fashion:\n\n       I am not persuaded that the proposed treaty would inhibit \n     nuclear proliferation. Restraint by the major powers has \n     never been a significant factor in the decisions of other \n     nuclear aspirants, which are driven by local rivalries and \n     security needs. Nor is the behavior of the rogue states such \n     as Iraq, Iran, or North Korea likely to be affected by this \n     treaty. They either will not sign or, if they sign, will \n     cheat. And countries relying on our nuclear umbrella might be \n     induced by declining confidence in our arsenal--and the \n     general impression of denuclearization--to accelerate their \n     own efforts.\n       For all these reasons, I cannot recommend a vote for a \n     comprehensive test ban of unlimited duration.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think this is a most important \nletter, but the date makes it unique.\n  Mr. KYL. The date of the letter is today, October 13, 1999, on the \neve of our vote.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by thanking all of the people who have \ntestified on both sides of this, especially Dr. James Schlesinger, Jim \nWoolsey, and people who came early to the Senate and helped inform \nthose of us who were eager to learn what we needed to know about this. \nI am especially grateful, as I said, to Dr. Schlesinger for his \nwillingness to do that, as well as to testify before the committee.\n  I also thank Senator John Warner and Senator Jesse Helms, both of \nwhom have spent a great deal of time conducting extremely informative \nhearings. I also thank Senator Joe Biden from Delaware, who has \nconducted himself very well on his side of the debate.\n  I reserve any additional time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  I strongly believe that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty--or CTBT--\nis in our nation's national security interests. But before I discuss my \nreasons for supporting the Treaty, let me first say why the Senate--\neven those who are unsure of the Treaty--should support the Resolution. \nThe past week of debate over the issue has only underscored the \narguments for its ratification.\n  I have spoken before about the history of the CTBT. Let me reiterate \nsome of its history and why it is important to Iowans.\n  On October 11, 1963, the Limited Test Ban Treaty entered into force \nafter being ratified by the Senate in an overwhelming, bipartisan vote \nof 80-14 just a few weeks earlier. This treaty paved the way for future \nnuclear weapons testing agreements by prohibiting tests in the \natmosphere, in outer space, and underwater. This treaty was signed by \n108 countries.\n  Our nation's agreement to the Limited Test Ban Treaty marked the end\n\n[[Page S12531]]\n\nof our nation's above ground testing of nuclear weapons, including \nthose at the U.S. test site in Nevada. We now know, all too well, the \nterrible impact of exploding weapons over the Nevada desert. Among \nother consequences, these tests in the 1950's exposed millions of \nAmericans to large amounts of radioactive Iodine-131, which accumulates \nin the thyroid gland and has been linked to thyroid cancer. ``Hot \nSpots,'' where the Iodine-131 fallout was the greatest, were identified \nby a National Cancer Institute report as receiving 5-16 rads of Iodine-\n131. The ``Hot Spots'' included many areas far away from Nevada, \nincluding New York, Massachusetts and Iowa. Outside reviewers have \nshown that the 5-16 rad level is only an average, with many people \nhaving received much higher exposure levels, especially those who were \nchildren at the time.\n  To put that in perspective, federal standards for nuclear power \nplants require that protective action be taken for 15 rads. To further \nunderstand the enormity of the potential exposure, consider this: 150 \nmillion curies of Iodine-131 were released by the above ground nuclear \nweapons testing in the United States, about three times more than from \nthe Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in the former Soviet Union.\n  It is all too clear that outlawing above-ground tests were in the \ninterest of our nation. I strongly believe that banning all nuclear \ntests is also in our interests. This is a view shared by many leading \nIowans. I request unanimous consent that a recent editorial from the \nDes Moines Register be placed in the Record.\n  October also marked some key steps for the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty or CTBT. On October 2, 1992, President Bush signed into law the \nU.S. moratorium on all nuclear tests. The moratorium was \ninternationalized when, just a few years later, on September 24, 1996, \na second step was taken--the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or CTBT, \nwas opened for signature. The United States was the first to sign this \nlandmark treaty.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton took a third important step in \nabolishing nuclear weapons tests by transmitting the CTBT to the United \nStates Senate for ratification. Unfortunately, the Senate has yet to \ntake the additional step of ratifying the CTBT. I am hopeful that we in \nthe Senate will ratify the Treaty, and continue the momentum toward the \nimportant goal of a world wide ban on nuclear weapons testing.\n  Many believed we had conquered the dangerous specter of nuclear war \nafter the Cold War came to an end and many former Soviet states became \nour allies. Unfortunately, recent developments in South Asia remind us \nthat we need to be vigilant in our cooperative international efforts to \nreduce the dangers of nuclear weapons. This weeks coup in Pakistan only \nmakes clearer the need for a nuclear test ban treaty.\n  The CTBT is a major milestone in the effort to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. It would establish a permanent ban on \nall nuclear explosions in all environments for any purpose. Its ``zero-\nyield'' prohibition on nuclear tests would help to halt the development \nand deployment of new nuclear weapons. The Treaty would also establish \na far-reaching verification regime that includes a global network of \nsophisticated seismic, hydro-acoustic and radionuclide monitoring \nstations, as well as on-site inspection of test sites to deter and \ndetect violations.\n  It is vital to our national security for the nuclear arms race to \ncome to an end, and the American people recognize this. In a recent \npoll, more than 80 percent of voters supported the Treaty.\n  It is heartening to know that the American people understand the \nrisks of a world with nuclear weapons. It is now time for policymakers \nto recognize this as well. There is no better way to honor the hard \nwork and dedication of those who developed the LTBT and the CTBT than \nfor the U.S. Senate to immediately ratify the CTBT.\n  It's ratification is clearly in America's and the worlds security \ninterests. It would make the world a safer place for our children and \ngrandchildren. Its defeat could well trigger a major new arms race in \nAsia--a prospect that should send chills down the backs of us all.\n  The choice is clear.\n  Mr. President, I have read through the treaty as best I could and \nlooked at some of the annexes and protocols thereto. In there, there is \na list of about 317 monitoring stations that would be put in place if \nwe ratify this treaty. Right now, I understand there are about 100. So \nwe will have three times more monitoring stations than we have right \nnow. So to those who say we might not be able to absolutely detect \nevery explosion over a certain amount, or under a certain amount, quite \nfrankly, we will have a lot more monitoring stations by ratifying this \ntreaty than we have right now.\n  Secondly, if the explosions are so small as to be undetectable, there \nare provisions in the treaty that allow for a state to have an onsite \ninspection. So there is a whole process it goes through so we can have \nan onsite inspection to determine whether or not it was a nuclear \nexplosion.\n  Lastly, the treaty does contain a supreme interest clause in \naccordance with which a state party may withdraw from the treaty upon 6 \nmonth's notice, et cetera, if it determines that extraordinary events \nrelated to the subject matter of the treaty have jeopardized its \nsupreme interest. So, at any time, if the United States, or any other \nsovereign nation, decides it is in their supreme interest to withdraw \nfrom the treaty, they can do so by giving 6 month's notice.\n  Lastly, if anybody ever had any doubt about why we ought to be \nratifying this treaty, the headline in this morning's paper ought to \nsay it all: Army Stages Coup In Pakistan. Troops Arrested Prime \nMinister.\n  In part, it says:\n\n       India expressed deep concern with the government's ouster \n     and put its army on high alert.\n\n  If nothing else, this ought to tell us to ratify this treaty, or else \nwe are going to have more nuclear explosions in South Asia. It is a \npowder keg waiting to happen. We ought to ratify the treaty.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I said earlier this week, I oppose \nthis treaty for two major reasons: (1) the treaty cannot be considered \napart from other major arms control agreements in to which the United \nStates has entered; and (2) Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship has not \nyet been given enough time to prove whether or not it will give us the \nassurance we need in the reliability and safety of our nuclear weapons \nwithout physical testing.\n  However, the vote by the Senate today to reject this treaty was ill-\ntimed and this poor timing could have adverse consequences in the \nworld. No need exists now for a vote; after all, the United States is \nnot now testing and has no plans in the immediate future to do so. This \nhas been recognized by proponents and opponents of this treaty who have \nasked for delay in the vote.\n  I have attempted, with many others, during the last 2 weeks to help \nforge some path out of the parliamentary impasse in which the Senate is \ncurrently involved. Nonetheless, that has not been successful. We have \nnot found any such path. I think that is unfortunate. Nonetheless, I \nmight say treaties don't really die, even when they are defeated; they \nare returned to the Executive Calendar of the Senate. Therefore, we \nwill have another chance to debate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in \nthe next Congress, or years thereafter. It may very well be that, by \nthen, my concerns about the overall strategic arms strategies and their \nrelationship to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty can be alleviated. \nAnd if the potential for stockpile stewardship during that decade can \nbe realized, perhaps I will be able to vote for the treaty in the \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to my friend from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my father, over a half century ago, \nwrote an article the day after Hiroshima, and he focused on the problem \nof a proliferation of atomic bombs and nuclear weaponry. He was worried \nabout his children, and he was worried about his grandchildren to come.\n\n  Today I come to the floor of the Senate, and I say I really was \nhoping this\n\n[[Page S12532]]\n\nSenator would be a part of a vote that would ratify the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty. I think it would be an enormous step forward for our \nchildren and our grandchildren in our effort to put a stop to the \nproliferation of these weapons of mass destruction.\n  I will say very honestly and truthfully to my colleagues that I don't \nunderstand why we didn't put this vote off. I don't understand why \nSenators, on a procedural vote, voted to essentially go forward with \nthis vote today. I think the defeat of this agreement is an enormous \nstep backward for humankind. I think it is a profound mistake.\n  I think now I have to say to the people in Minnesota and to the \npeople in our country I am saddened that this treaty is going to be \ndefeated. I don't think we should have this vote. But to the American \npeople and Minnesotans, hold each and every Senator accountable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia, the Old Dominion State, Mr. Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I \nthank the distinguished ranking member.\n  This has been, under the limitations, an excellent debate for the \nSenate. This is my 21st year in the Senate, and I can think of few \ndebates in that time that have been as informed as this one. I strongly \ndisagree with a very dear friend, Brent Scowcroft, who described this \ndebate otherwise. While not a Member of the Senate, he is one whom I \nrespect. His remarks were reported widely in the newspapers this \nmorning.\n  This has been a good debate. Senators on both sides have stood up and \ndisplayed courage. Our two leaders, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, \nhave displayed the courage of their convictions. In the many \nconsultations over the past week that I have had with the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member, and our leadership, I have always left \nwith the belief that they placed the security interests of this country \nforemost, as each day decisions had to be made regarding this treaty.\n  I also say to my dear friend, Senator Moynihan, I thank him for the \nleadership he has shown. We embarked together on a bipartisan effort, \nand we were joined by a very significant number of our colleagues--\nwhose names will be a part of the Record at a later time--in an effort \nsimply to recognize that in the course of the hearings and in the \ncourse of conversations and consultations with so many people not only \nhere in the United States but across the seas, that there were clearly \nhonest differences of opinion from individuals who have spent much of \ntheir lifetime on this subject--honest differences of opinion.\n  But lacking is that burden of proof, some would say beyond a \nreasonable doubt, that this treaty would not put at risk the security \nof this country by virtue of the terms of the treaty as presently \nwritten.\n  This treaty requires that we put at risk in perpetuity--not just \ntoday, not just tomorrow, but in perpetuity--a stockpile which today is \nsafe and credible, which tomorrow will be safe and credible--for the \nforeseeable next few years to come. Let there be no doubt in anyone's \nmind of that fact. But can we say that that will be the case forever?\n  As our military examined this treaty, it is clear that they said we \nsupport the treaty, but only if the safeguard is in place which says we \ncan get out of the treaty if the President makes that determination, \nand only if the Stockpile Stewardship Program--the computer simulations \nwhich are to replace actual testing--can be put in place and proven to \nensure that our nuclear stockpile remains credible and safe.\n  The Record before the Senate today does not justify that support. It \ndoes not say that each of the components of the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram will be in place and will work in a way that will put our \nstockpile, in the future, in the same category that it is in today. We \ndo not know. There is a reasonable doubt. We simply do not know. For \nthat reason, regrettably, I shall have to vote--that vote occurs \nshortly--against this treaty.\n  But I say that honest individuals have done their very best in this \nSenate, and I thank all those beyond the Senate who have made very \nvaluable contributions to this debate.\n  I shall put in the Record, by unanimous consent, further \ndocumentation on the laboratory directors. Of all the testimony that \ncame before the Armed Services Committee, the testimony of the lab \ndirectors was the most compelling. And indeed, that of the intelligence \ncommunity, which, in a sense, asked for more time to do the work they \nthought necessary in assessing our ability to monitor this treaty. And \nmany former Secretaries of Defense had an honest difference of opinion.\n\n  As Senator Kyl, who has worked so hard on this treaty and probably \nknows it better than anyone else, has said clearly--Secretary \nKissinger, one of several Secretaries of State who have expressed their \nopinions--has now indicated his opposition. These are men and women who \nhave spent their lifetime on this subject. Reasonable doubt is to be \nfound there.\n  Lastly, the laboratory Directors: I would like to respond to some of \nmy colleagues and the media's mis-portrayal of the testimony given at \nlast Thursday's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee by \nthe Directors of the three National Labs--Dr. Paul Robinson of Sandia \nNational Laboratory, Dr. C. Bruce Tarter of the Lawrence Livermore \nLaboratory, and Dr. John C. Browne of Los Alamos National Laboratory. \nIt is important to have a full picture of what was said at our hearing \nlast week Many of these statements used by my colleagues and the media \nwere taken out of context. For instance, the line of questioning that \nthe Ranking Member engaged in with the Lab Directors on whether they \nwere ``on board'' with the treaty, I believe has been mis-\ncharacterized. I'd like to read from the transcript the exchange that \noccurred between the Ranking Member and the Lab Directors.\n\n       Senator Levin. What you are telling us is that if this \n     safeguard and the other safeguards are part of this process \n     that you can rely on, that in your words, Dr. Robinson, you \n     are on board in terms of this treaty; is that correct?\n       Dr. Robinson. I am on board that science-based stockpile \n     stewardship has a much higher chance of success and I will \n     accept it as the substitute.\n       Senator Levin. For what?\n       Dr. Robinson. I still had other reservations about the \n     treaty----\n\n  At this point, Dr. Robinson was cut off and was unable to finish his \nanswer. In response to this line of questioning, a Senator from the \nminority side, said that he ``detected an uneasiness on the part of \nsome of those who testified'' and expressed concern that Dr. Robinson's \nresponse that he had other concerns with the treaty was ``blurred''.\n  Senator Levin then asked Dr. Tarter, Director of Lawrence Livermore \nLabs, to respond to the same question, Dr. Tarter responded:\n\n       A simple statement again: It is an excellent bet, but it is \n     not a sure thing.\n       Senator Levin. My question is, are you on board, given \n     these safeguards?\n       Dr. Tarter. I can only testify to the ability of stockpile \n     stewardship to do the job. It is your job about the treaty.\n       Senator Levin. Are you able to say that, providing you can \n     rely on safeguard F and at some point decide that you cannot \n     certify it, that you are willing under that condition to rely \n     on this stewardship program as a substitute for actual \n     testing?\n       Dr. Tarter. Yes.\n\n  Dr. Tarter never said that he was ``on board with the treaty.'' In \nfact, he attempted to avoid directly answering Senator Levin's \nquestion. Clearly, Dr. Tarter was uncomfortable with this line of \nquestioning. It was only after Senator Levin significantly modified the \nquestion by adding certain qualifications that Dr. Tarter finally \nresponded affirmatively.\n  Senator Levin asked Dr. Browne whether he was on board with the \ntreaty and Dr. Browne responded:\n\n       Senator Levin, if the government provides us with the \n     sustained resources, the answer is yes, and if safeguard F is \n     there, yes.\n\n  Dr. Browne said that he was ``on board with the treaty'' but only if \ncertain conditions were met.\n  In examining the complete record and considering the manner in which \nthe responses were elicited, it is clear that the labs directors had \nreservations about the treaty. They were clearly uneasy with the \nquestion and the manner in which they were questioned. They were \ncertainly not enthusiastic in indicating any support for the treaty--\neven with the qualifications (i.e., safeguards) that were added.\n\n[[Page S12533]]\n\n  In addition to the previous line of questioning the transcript \nincludes numerous statements by the Lab Directors which I believe, \ntaken together, indicate that these experts have serious issues with \nthis treaty as well as the Stockpile Stewardship program. I note that \nthe endorsement in January 1998 of the CTBT by Generals Colin Powell, \nJohn Shalikashvili, David Jones, and Admiral William Crowe, former \nchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was conditioned, like that of \nthe Lab Directors, on the six safeguards submitted by the President \nalong with the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent which \nincluded a Stockpile Stewardship program to ensure a high level of \nconfidence in the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons in the \nstockpile.\n  Here are some of the statements by the Lab Directors on the Stockpile \nStewardship program:\n  Dr. Browne, Director of Los Alamos stated:\n\n       Each year, through a comprehensive program of surveillance \n     of the stockpile, we find one or more problems in each \n     weapons system that may require attention. . . . we have \n     identified several issues that, if they had occurred when \n     testing was active, most likely would have been resolved by \n     nuclear testing.'' He went on to state: ``The issue that we \n     face is whether we will have the people, the capabilities, \n     and the national commitment to maintain . . . confidence in \n     the stockpile in the future, when we expect to see more \n     significant changes. Although we are adding new tools each \n     year, the essential tool kit for stockpile stewardship will \n     not be complete until some time in the next decade.\n\n  Dr. Tarter, Director of the Lawrence Livermore stated:\n\n       I think we have a challenging program [stockpile \n     stewardship], one that is very difficult to achieve. I think, \n     although both the administration and the Congress have had \n     increasing levels of support for the stewardship program over \n     these past years, they have not quite met what we said was \n     necessary to achieve the program on the time scale that we \n     believed was necessary in view of the aging of the designers \n     and of the weapons. I think we all feel under a great deal of \n     stress to try to make those deadlines with the current \n     resources. . . . So I think to date I would give the program \n     a--I think we have done a good job. I think we have learned \n     things. It is not a perfect job, but I think it has been a \n     very, very good start. I think the challenge lies in the \n     longer term, and I think . . . if I had one simple phrase \n     I think that the stewardship program with sustained \n     support is an excellent bet, but it ain't a sure thing.\n\n  Dr. Robinson, Director of Sandia, stated:\n\n       I question the expectations many claim for this treaty. . . \n     . I think we have got to specify with a lot more character \n     what is the real purpose of the treaty. I secondly discuss \n     [in his written statement] a lot of the important technical \n     considerations as we have tried to substitute other \n     approaches, which has come to be known as the science-based \n     Stockpile Stewardship Program, for the value that tests had \n     always provided us in previous decades. I can state with no \n     caveats that to confirm the performance of high tech \n     devices--cars, airplanes, medical diagnostics, computers, or \n     nuclear weapons--testing is the preferred methodology. . . . \n     My statement describes the work involved in attempting to \n     substitute science-based stockpile stewardship. It is an \n     enormous challenge, but I agree, much very good work has been \n     done. Much has been accomplished. But we still cannot \n     guarantee that we will ultimately be successful. Science-\n     based stockpile stewardship is the best way we know of to \n     mitigate the risk to the extent that is possible.\n       . . . But the question and where we (those who support or \n     oppose testing and the treaty) differ the greatest is what is \n     the best way to achieve that peace with stability. At least \n     two very dichotomous approaches. Is the world better off with \n     nuclear weapons in the hands of those who value peace the \n     highest, who will maintain their nuclear arsenals in order to \n     deter aggression and to prevent major wars, or would the \n     world be better off it there were no more nuclear weapons, \n     and is there really a sound plan for how you might ever \n     achieve that?\n\n  In addition, an exchange between Senator Reed and Dr. Robinson on the \nStockpile stewardship Program occurred as follows:\n\n       Senator Reed. Let me just ask another question, which, as I \n     understand it, part of the effort on the Stockpile \n     Stewardship Programs is massive computational projects. \n     Which, if carried out, will allow you to go back and analyze \n     data that we have accumulated for years and years and years, \n     which has never been fully analyzed. Does that offer any \n     additional sort of opportunities to increase your sense of \n     reliability that, without testing, we can go ahead and more \n     accurately protect the stockpile?\n       Dr. Robinson. You are quite correct. The legacy data that \n     we have, the correct statement is not that it has not been \n     analyzed, it has not been successfully predicted by the \n     models. We have gaps in our understanding. As we improve the \n     codes, as we add the third dimension--we are presently going \n     from two dimensional calculations to three-dimensional \n     calculations--a key test of the success of these simulation \n     codes will be how well does it predict those things we could \n     not understand in the past. So that is a very key part of the \n     science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program.\n\n  There were also statements on the value of testing. One of the most \npowerful statements was given by Dr. Robinson from Sandia. He said:\n\n       . . . there are black issues, white issues, but mostly a \n     lot of gray. But, I can say from my own experience over the \n     years, I have seen that same kind of scientific debate. But \n     when you then carried out a test and looked at the \n     predictions of various people in the debate, the answer \n     became very clear. The test has a way of crystallizing \n     answers into one or the other and ending that grayness. And \n     that is something that will be missing in a future state.\n       . . . the President presented to you with the treaty and \n     which he and certainly we believe are conditions for \n     ratification. The most important of those by far is Safeguard \n     F. We kept stressing to the White House, we cannot be sure \n     that science-based stockpile stewardship will mature in time \n     to handle a serious safety or reliability problem as these \n     weapons age. Without it, without the ability at that point to \n     test, we would be powerless to maintain the U.S. first line \n     of defense, its strategic deterrent force.\n\n  After hearing their testimony first hand, I do not know how anyone \ncould state that the Lab Directors vigorously supported this treaty. \nWhen you examine the entire record it is clear that the Lab Directors--\nthe experts on the safety and reliability of America's nuclear \nstockpile--have reservations about the treaty and the Stockpile \nStewardship Program. Their support for this treaty is tempered by \nspecific qualifications and stipulations. I urge each and every one of \nyou to review the full testimony of these most important witnesses.\n  Lastly, the laboratory Directors:\n  The lab Directors have said, based on their careers of 15 or 20 \nyears, they cannot guarantee that the present Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram will match or even approach in, say, 5, 10, or 15 years the \nsound data that we have gotten through 50 years of testing--actual \ntesting. We are not about to resume actual testing. We don't have to at \nthis point in time, but we might in the future.\n  But every Senator should think about the fact that they are casting a \nvote that commits the United States in perpetuity. The road to arms \ncontrol, whatever the goal is at the end--peace in the world--building \nblocks and steps have been laid both by Republicans and Democrats. \nEvery President, and others, has worked on these agreements. Neither \nside should take the majority of the credit; it has been shared \nequally. And a hope and a prayer of this Senator is that we continue as \na nation to lead in taking positive, constructive steps in arms \ncontrol.\n  So it is with regret that I believe this treaty has that degree of \nreasonable doubt, imposing restriction in perpetuity on one of our most \nvalued strategic assets, and I cannot support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New York 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank, above all Members in \nthis body, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nWarner, who is opposed to this treaty, as I am in support.\n  Together we have addressed a letter to our distinguished leaders, \nSenator Lott and Senator Daschle, asking that the matter be put off \nuntil the next Congress, as the President has requested be done.\n  Sir, this morning I don't think we had a handful of signatures on \nthat letter. At this moment, we have more than half the Members of this \nbody--as the day has gone by, the realization of what an enormous \ndecision we are making with so very little consideration has sunk in.\n  Sir, we spent in my time in this body 38 days debating the Panama \nCanal Treaty. The Treaty of Versailles--equally important--was debated \n31 days in 1919 and 24 days in 1920.\n  Note that it was passed over, because a treaty does not die once it \nhas simply been voted down; it remains on the calendar.\n  But I would like to express the hope that before the debate is over, \nthe distinguished Senator from Virginia might place in the Record the \nletter\n\n[[Page S12534]]\n\nwhich we addressed to the leaders and perhaps, if he wishes, the \nsignatures we have so far received. He indicates he would be willing to \ndo that. I thank him and I thank my leader, Senator Biden.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. After consultation with the chairman of the committee, \nthey are going to reserve the remainder of their time so we will not go \nback and forth with proponents and opponents until they indicate they \nwant to.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Delaware for yielding. I \nsupport the treaty because I think the balance of risks are in favor of \nratifying this treaty. It is not without risk, but it is not in \nperpetuity. The United States may withdraw at any time that it chooses. \nIf we reject this treaty, it is an open invitation to other nations to \ntest. I think that is a greater risk than the risks involved in \nratifying the treaty. The events of the last 24 hours in Pakistan show \nthe undesirability of having the Pakistanis test in their race with the \nnation of India, not to speak of the other nations, Iran, Iraq, North \nKorea.\n  I suggest the President of the United States call the majority leader \nof the Senate and try to work this out. More than that, of the Senators \nhere, many who are opposed to the treaty think we should not vote it \ndown. It is not over until it is over. I believe it is possible for the \nPresident to say to the majority leader what would satisfy the majority \nleader to take this treaty out of the next Congress. And I believe the \nmajority leader could convene the Republican caucus--and we can do that \nyet this afternoon or into the evening on this momentous matter. I \nthink it is still possible to avoid this vote to give extra time for \nsecurity measures, to give extra time for testing, but not to cast a \nvote which will be a vote heard around the world to the detriment of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I support the Comprehensive Test-Ban \nTreaty, CTBT, a treaty which I believe is in our national security \ninterests.\n  Although it appears regrettably that the required votes of two-thirds \nof the Senate do not exist at this point, I nonetheless hope that as \nmany of my colleagues as possible will vote to ratify this treaty since \nwe cannot procedurally seem to be able to set the treaty aside.\n  Since 1992, the United States has abided by a unilateral moratorium \non nuclear weapons testing. Despite the absence of testing during these \npast 7 years, our nuclear weapons stockpile has been maintained, our \nnuclear deterrent has remained formidable, and our national security \nhas not been threatened. Because our nuclear arsenal remains safe and \nreliable today, the United States has no plans to test these weapons \nany time soon.\n  Also during these past 7 years of our moratorium on nuclear testing, \nthe United States negotiated and signed the CTBT. We signed this treaty \nrecognizing that discouraging other nuclear powers and would-be nuclear \npowers from testing these weapons would lessen the unthinkable \npossibility that the nuclear option would ever be employed. In fact, \nhalting advancement in nuclear weapons development and limiting the \nnumber of nuclear-capable military states, locks in a status quo in \nwhich the United States has an enormous military advantage. This treaty \nmakes the United States militarily stronger, not weaker.\n  One of the wisest aspects of the CTBT is its requirement that all of \nthe world's 44 nuclear capable nations ratify the treaty for it to \nenter into force. This means that North Korea, Iran, and others that \npose the greatest potential threat to the United States and our allies \nmust join us in being a party to this treaty before the United States \nrelinquishes the option of nuclear testing.\n  Another strong aspect of the CTBT is that it is accompanied by 6 \ncritical safeguards that the Joint Chiefs of Staff insisted upon before \nagreeing to support it. I would note that the sixth and most \nsignificant to these safeguards is included in the resolution which is \nbefore us today. It requires the United States to withdraw from the \nCTBT under the supreme national interests clause if the Secretaries of \nEnergy and Defense cannot certify the reliability of our nuclear \narsenal. This safeguard gives Americans the assurance that they will \ncontinue to be protected by a robust and credible and nuclear deterrent \nunder the CTBT.\n  I believe this treaty is very much in the interests of the United \nStates. It will help prevent the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide, \nwhile ensuring a huge U.S. advantage in nuclear weaponry that has \ndeterred would-be aggressors for many years. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport ratification of this treaty.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I inquire of the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee if I could make a brief statement.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, deterrence has long been a primary component \nof U.S. security policy. In the cold war, nuclear weapons were the \nbackbone of our national deterrent. The threat of unacceptable damage \nin response to aggression was central to inhibiting the Soviet Union's \nexpansionist aims. Moreover, the credibility of the U.S. nuclear \nguarantee provided for ``extended deterrence'' against attacks on our \nfriends and allies.\n  While the conditions today are much different from the past, our \nnuclear weapons continue to serve as an essential hedge against a very \nuncertain future with both Russia and China, two states that highly \nvalue their own nuclear forces. Equally important, deterrence--backed \nby credible nuclear forces--remains the first line of defense against \nan even broader range of threats than in the past, including rogue \nstates armed with weapons of mass destruction.\n  The nuclear balance of terror that once defined our relationship with \nthe Soviet Union is no longer central in our relations with Russia. \nYet, even as we work to achieve a more democratic and open Russia, \nnuclear weapons appear to play a growing role in Moscow's security \nstrategy, including declaratory policy and defense planning. Whether to \novercome conventional weakness or as a means to retain one of its last \nvestiges of superpower status, Russia is continuing to modernize its \nnuclear forces. The retention of thousands of theater nuclear weapons, \nthe deployment of the new mobile SS-27 ICBM, and the continuing \ninvestment in its massive nuclear weapons infrastructure demonstrate \nhow important these weapons are to Moscow and lend credence to the \nconcerns that Russia may have recently tested new nuclear weapons to \nprovide the foundation for its future security strategy.\n  There are many fundamental questions about Russia's political and \neconomic future that today can not be answered with certainty. What is \nclear, however, is that Russia will continue to possess formidable, \nmodern nuclear forces no matter how these questions are answered over \ntime. For this reason, it remains imperative for us to retain a \ncredible nuclear deterrent capability to guard against the reversal of \nour relations with a potentially hostile and nuclear-armed Russia.\n  The strategic uncertainties associated with China are even greater \nthan those with Russia. There are clear indications of qualitative \nimprovements and quantitative increases to the Chinese nuclear arsenal. \nThe Cox committee found that China is actively pursuing miniaturized \nnuclear warheads and MIRV technology, developing more accurate and \nballistic missiles, and building a larger arsenal. Recent Chinese tests \nof a new medium-range ballistic missile, the DF-31 and public \ndeclarations of its development of enhanced radiological weapons serve \nto reinforce these findings. Similarly, a recent National Intelligence \nEstimate forecasts increases in the Chinese strategic arsenal and \ninvestment in technologies, such as penetration aids, designed to \ndefeat any United States missile defense.\n  Perhaps most disturbing, the strategic intentions of both Russia and \nChina appear increasingly antagonistic toward the United States. This \npast August they jointly announced a strategic partnership as a \ncounterweight to what they termed U.S. ``hegemonic ambitions.'' As he \nmet with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, President Yeltsin declared \nhimself ``in fighting form, ready for battle, especially with \nWesterners,'' and complained that ``some\n\n[[Page S12535]]\n\nnations are trying to build a world order that would be convenient only \nfor them, ignoring that the world is multi-polar.'' Given the \nuncertainties surrounding the future political and military \ndevelopments in these two states, experience and prudence suggest the \nneed for a hedge that only credible nuclear forces can provide.\n  While deterrence of rogue states armed with weapons of mass \ndestruction is very different than deterrence as we understood it in \nthe cold war, an overwhelming retaliatory capability--and the fear of a \npossible nuclear repsonse--remains critical to countering this new set \nof ever more dangerous threats. Despite sustained and determined \nefforts to de-legitimize our nuclear weapons, and assertions that their \nutility ended with the cold war, our nuclear weapons are essential in \nthis context. Conventional superiority alone is not sufficient. Looking \nat the only real world experience we have in deterring the use of \nchemical and biological by rogue leaders--the Desert Storm case--it \nappears that the threat of a nuclear response was a major factor in the \nIraqi decision to forego the use of their weapons of mass destruction.\n  An in-depth study of United States security policy in the 21st \ncentury, conducted last year by the National Defense University and \nLivermore National Laboratory, concluded that nuclear weapons would \nremain critical both to hedge against Russia and China, as well as to \ndeter rogue states that will seek to challenge us in regions of vital \ninterest. This same study concluded that: ``Retaining the safety, \nreliability, security, and performance of the nuclear weapons stockpile \nin the absence of underground nuclear testing is the highest-risk \ncomponent of the U.S. strategy for sustaining deterrence.'' For over 40 \nyears, testing was seen as essential to the credibility of our \ndeterrent forces and our commitments to friends and allies. The CTBT, \nif ratified by the United States, would call into question the \neffectiveness and reliability of this essential component of our \nnational security strategy.\n  In the annual statement of U.S. National Strategy, President Clinton \nhas affirmed the view of his predecessors for more than half a \ncentury--nuclear weapons are vital to the security interests of the \nUnited States. It is not surprising then that one of the safeguards \noffered by the White House to diminish the risk inherent in accepting a \npermanent ban on nuclear weapons testing through the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty CTBT is to attempt to sustain the existing inventory of \nnuclear weapons through what is known as the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram, SSP. The aim of the SSP is to utilize the data from more than \n1,000 U.S. atmospheric and underground nuclear tests legacy code \ncombined with advanced diagnostic and experimental facilities now under \ndevelopment in the SSP to assess the aging properties of nuclear \nweapons. It is hoped that the SSP will enable U.S. nuclear weapon \nscientists and engineers to model and simulate nuclear phenomena with \nsufficient fidelity and reliability to permit judgements to be made \nabout whether or not a particular weapon or class of weapons will \ncontinue to be safe and reliable. In short, whether or not U.S. nuclear \nweapons will remain a credible deterrent.\n  The administration's approach is an extraordinarily risky one--far \nmore so than can be discerned from administration statements on the \nsubject. This is so because the way risks are multiplied in the \nprogram. First, the CTBT prevents the United States from using the \ntechnique for assuring the reliability of stockpile--the detonation of \nthe nuclear weapon to be confident that the aging of the nuclear \ncomponents have not diminished confidence in its safety and \nreliability. Second, the CTBT prevents the United States from testing \nnew weapon designs--the approach we have taken over the past half \ncentury to make sure our nuclear weapon stockpile kept pace with what \nwas required to deter. Third, the CTBT offers as an alternative to \ntesting, the SSP. Let's examine each of these elements of risk in turn.\n  First, the design of nuclear weapons is a highly empirical process. \nVast computer networks and theoretical physicists notwithstanding, \ntesting has been an indispensable dimension of nuclear weapon \ndevelopment, production, and deployment. This is so because the \nenvironment within a nuclear weapon is unlike anything in nature. \nMaterials exposed to decades of nuclear radiation behave in ways \nscientists do not know how to predict. Gold, for example, corrodes in a \nnuclear environment--a property not evident in nature. We do know know \nwhat will happen over time to the nuclear components of a weapon and \nhow the aging process will affect the weapon. This has been addressed \nin the past by detonating weapons after a fix has been installed in a \nweapon that appears to be adversely affected by age. Because there is \nno theoretical basis that has been validated through testing to certify \nweapon safety and reliability, testing has been indispensable. The \nUnited States ceased its nuclear weapon testing program in 1992, but \nhad never undertaken an effort to ascertain whether or not it could \nmodel and simulate the aging properties of nuclear weapons with \nsufficient reliability to permit the certification of the weapons in \nthe stockpile.\n  Nuclear weapons now in the stockpile--eight types plus one additional \ntype in reserve--means that we have concentrated our deterrent in \nrelatively few weapon designs. In the mid-1980s, we had 32 types of \nnuclear weapons in the stockpile. The average age of the weapons in the \nstockpile is 15 years--more than has ever been the case in the past, \nand well beyond U.S. experience. We simply do not know what the long-\nterm implications of aging are on nuclear weapons. We do know that \nthere are consequences from the aging process, because problems \nresulting from aging have been identified in the past. However, as we \nwere able to conduct underground tests, the aging process did not \ndegrade the safety and reliability of the stockpile. If the CTBT is \nratified, we may not have an opportunity to do this in the future \nbecause the process for utilizing the supreme national interest \nprovisions of the treaty to withdraw are themselves an impediment to \nsustaining deterrence.\n  Second, the CTBT will prevent the United States from testing new \nnuclear weapon designs should the need to sustain deterrence call for \nnew designs. Many new designs were required during the cold war to \nsustain deterrence. Identifying some circumstances that could give rise \nto a requirement for new weapon designs is not difficult. The weapons \nretained in the U.S. inventory after the cold war are primarily \ndesigned to strike urban-industrial targets (reflecting the policy of \nmutual assured destruction) and hardened targets on or near the earth's \nsurface. The change in the technology of underground construction has \nfundamentally changed the economics of locating military targets in \ndeep underground locations. In Russia, for example, despite its \nseverely depressed economic circumstances, has invested $6 billion \nsince 1991 in a deep underground military facility in the southern end \nof the Ural Mountains. The underground facility at the site is located \nunder nearly 1,000 feet of granite--one of scores of deep underground \nsites--that could not be held at risk with the current nuclear weapon \nstockpile. Similar underground facilities exist in other declared or \nundeclared nuclear weapon states. It is possible that some future \nPresident may decide that new weapon design(s) are needed to sustain \ndeterrence. He will be prevented from doing so if the CTBT is ratified.\n  Third, the alternative to testing, the SSP, is an extraordinarily \nrisky approach to sustaining deterrence. The United States has not \nconducted a testing program to verify that the modeling and simulation \nof the existing stockpile or new designs can be maintained or \nimplemented using the experimental and diagnostic facilities of the \nSSP. No testing has taken place since 1992, but the SSP will not be \nfully operational until 2010 or beyond. One of the most important of \nthese facilities--the National Ignition Facility, NIF--has proven to be \nboth a technical and cost challenge. Last month the Congress was \nconfronted by a one-third jump in the cost of this program. The entire \nSSP--budgeted at $4.5 billion--is certainly underfunded, as the NIF \nexperience demonstrates. For the SSP to be successful, all of its \nnumerous experimental and diagnostic facilities have to work perfectly \nto assure that the safety and reliability of the stockpile can be \ncertified indefinitely. It is one\n\n[[Page S12536]]\n\nthing to take such a technical and financial risk in an environment \nwhere testing is unconstrained. It is quite another to bet on the \nenduring success of a program--the SSP--that has already been shown to \nhave unforeseen cost, technical, and schedule difficulties. The extent \nof these difficulties has not yet even been ascertained by the \nexecutive branch--much less an independent determination by the \nCongress. The risks to the ability to sustain deterrence under the CTBT \nare simply too large for the Congress to accept. The CTBT should not be \nratified.\n  CTBT proponents claim that the treaty is an important tool in the \nfight against nuclear proliferation. This is simply inaccurate.\n  A test ban will provide no obstacle to a proliferator who seeks a \nfirst-generation-or even a second-generation-nuclear weapon. One of the \ntwo bombs the United States dropped on Japan to end WWII was an \nuntested design. South African built and deployed six nuclear weapons \nwithout testing the design. Pakistan obtained a workable design from \nChina, and thus needed no nuclear tests of its own.\n  Faced with these facts, treaty proponents often resort to the claim \nthat the CTBT will establish an international norm against nuclear \nproliferation. Again, history teaches us differently. There is already \nan international norm against proliferation embodied in the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty--the NPT. Over 130 nations have signed the NPT \nand, by doing so, have forsworn nuclear weapons development. As an \naside here, I guess we can say the CTBT is to get nations to promise \nnot to test the weapons that they promised not to develop under the \nNPT.\n  The international norm of nuclear nonproliferation-the one supposedly \nestablished by the NPTB was broken by Iraq, which tried to develop \nnuclear weapons clandestinely. And, the norm is violated even today by \nNorth Korea, which remains in noncompliance with the NPT. Two nations \nnot party to the NPT, India and Pakistan, also broke the international \nnorm.\n  Other arms control norms are readily and repeatedly broken as well. \nThere are too many examples to cite here today, but let me give you \none. The United States forswore biological weapons and led the world in \nsigning the Biological Weapons ban. The Soviet Union signed too, but \nsecretly kept inventing and manufacturing ever more potent biological \nweapons. Other nations, including Iraq, have also made such weapons.\n  The point here is that norms do nothing to prevent development of \nheinous weapons by nations that view it in their security interests to \ndo so. They are driven by their own perceptions of threat, not by a \ndesire to adhere to a norm established by the United States or the \ninternational community.\n  Ironically, the CTBT might actually promote nuclear proliferation. I \nsay this for two reasons.\n  First, it my promote proliferation by damaging the U.S. nuclear \numbrella. United States allies such as Japan, South Korea, Germany, and \nItaly have long depended on United States nuclear strength to provide \nthem the ultimate protection. Indeed, the United States persuaded South \nKorea and Taiwan to give up their own nuclear weapons programs by \npromising them protection.\n  U.S. nuclear testing has signaled to allies, and to potential \nenemies, that the United States nuclear arsenal is effective and that \nthe United States is committed to using such weapons if absolutely \nnecessary. Without nuclear testing, there is no question that United \nStates confidence in the stockpile will decline. Our enemies and allies \nalike will read this silent signal as a local of commitment to \nmaintaining-and using, if necessary-the nuclear deterrent.\n  As U.S. confidence in the stockpile declines over time, it is likely \nthat our allies confidence in the nuclear umbrella will similarly \ndecline. This could head to allies reevaluating their own security \nneeds. (If the U.S. umbrella appears insufficient, might they not \nconsider developing their own nuclear deterrents?\n  The second reason that I say that the CTBT may promote proliferation \nis that it will result in significantly increased interactions between \nthe U.S. weapons design community and the international academic \ncommunity. This could, and probably will, result in the transfer of \nweapons-relevant data. Let me explain.\n  The U.S. stockpile stewardship program, the one intended to take the \nplace of nuclear testing, relies on markedly increased collaboration \nbetween nuclear weapons specialists and the open scientific community. \nThe program encourages open exchange of new nuclear research between \nthe U.S. weapons laboratories and the international scientific \ncommunity. The role that the stewardship program envisions for \nunclassified researchers extends far beyond peer review and the \noccasional preventatives meeting. Bit involves U.S. highly likely that \nthese Occasional presentations meeting energy the quit involves \nProgram, to participate in attempt to develop tool sot replace\n  There will be five university research centers and a host of other \nresearchers funded by 5 year grants totaling tens of millions of \ndollars. It is highly likely that these researchers in the unclassified \nworld, working closely with nuclear weapons scientists on the \nstewardship program, will gain an improved understanding of nuclear \nexplosives phenomena. And, of course, there will be no way to prevent \nthe further dissemination this understanding.\n  In summary, the CTBT will not further the cause of nuclear \nnonproliferation. Quite the opposite, it will likely result in \npromoting nuclear proliferation.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty submitted to this Senate by \nPresident Clinton is not verifiable. This means that, despite the vast \narray of expensive sensors and detection technology being established \nunder the treaty, it will be possible for other nations to conduct \nmilitarily significant nuclear testing with little or no risk of \ndetection.\n  What is militarily significant nuclear testing? Our definitions of \nthe term might vary, but I think we'd all agree that any nuclear test \nthat gives a nation information to develop newer, more effective \nweaponry is militarily significant.\n  In the case of the United States, nuclear tests with yields between \n1,000 tons and 10,000 tons are generally large enough to provide \n``proof'' data on new weaponry designs. Other nations might have \nweaponry that could be assessed at even lower yields. For the sake of \nargument, however, let's be conservative and assume that other nations \nwould also need to conduct tests at a level above 1,000 tons to develop \na new nuclear weapon design.\n  The verification system of the CTBT is supposed to detect nuclear \nblasts above 1,000 tons, so it would seem at first glance that it will \nbe likely that most cheaters would be caught. We need to look at the \nfine print, however. In reality, the CTBT system will be able to detect \ntests of 1,000 tons or more if they are nonevasive. This means that the \ncheater will be caught only if he does not try to hide his nuclear \ntest. But, what if he does want to hide it? What if he conducts his \ntest evasively?\n  It is a very simple task for Russia, China, or others to hide their \nnuclear tests. One of the best known means of evasion is detonating the \nnuclear device in a cavity such as a salt dome or a room mined below \nground. This technique called ``decoupling'' reduces the noise, or the \nseismic signal, of the nuclear detonation.\n  The change in the signal of a decoupled test is so significant--it \ncan be by as much as a factor of 70--that it will be impossible for any \nknown technology to detect it. For example, a 1,000-ton evasive test \nwould have a signal of a 14-ton non-evasive test. This puts the signal \nof the illicit test well below the threshold of detection.\n  Decoupling is a well-known technique and is technologically simple to \nachieve. In fact, it is quite possible that Russia and China have \ncontinued to conduct nuclear testing during the past 7 years, while the \nUnited States has refrained from doing so. They would have been able to \ntest, without our knowing, by decoupling.\n  There are also other means of cheating that can circumvent \nverification. One is open-ocean testing. A nation could put a device on \na small seaborne platform, tow it to the middle of the ocean, and \ndetonate it anonymously. It would be virtually impossible to attribute \nthe test to the cheater.\n  If the CTBT were not going to affect U.S. capabilities, it would not \nbe important whether the treaty is verifiable\n\n[[Page S12537]]\n\nor not. The fact is, however, the CTBT will freeze the U.S. nuclear \nweapons program and will make it impossible to assess with high \nconfidence whether the current stockpile is reliable. And, because the \ntreaty is not verifiable, it will not effectively constrain other \nnations in the same way. That means that they will ultimately be able \nto gain advantage.\n  Let me stress here that my assessment is not based on partisan \nopinions. The non-verifiability of the CTBT is well-known and has been \naffirmed by the U.S. intelligence community. We have no business \nsigning up to an unverifiable treaty, particularly one that could so \nadversely affect the strength and effectiveness of our nuclear \ndeterrent.\n  Mr. President, seismology has come a long way in the past half-\ncentury, but it still measures only earth vibrations, not Treaty \ncompliance. Let's save time by stipulating that earth vibrations caused \nby most nuclear explosions will be detected by the CTBT's International \nMonitoring System (IMS). Then we can focus discussion on the political \nprocess by which detection of ``events'' lead to identification of \nnuclear tests, and by which identification of tests leads to \nverification of noncompliance with a Treaty.\n  In combination, the United States and IMS will reliably detect \nthousands of seismic events every year. But that does not mean that \neither system, independently or in combination, can reliably identify \nlow yield nuclear explosions.\n  Seismic networks are scientific tools that must be calibrated against \nreal world occurrences of what they measure. Once seismologists know \nthat a given seismic signal was a nuclear test of a given yield at a \ngiven location, their network is calibrated for nuclear explosions of \ncomparable magnitude at that location. For events of different \nmagnitudes and/or in different locations, seismic signal identification \nis subjective. Like a few dozen CPAs interpreting the same IRS rule, \neach event will be interpreted differently depending on who is making \nthe judgment and who their client is. This is particularly true, of \ncourse, for smaller events and those that occur in parts of the world--\nwhere nuclear explosions have not previously been recorded.\n  The fact of such uncertainty is not in dispute. No one can specify \nnow, or in the foreseeable future, how large a nuclear test must be \nbefore it can be reliably identified as a nuclear test by the IMS. The \nbest case would involve fully decoupled tests in locations where \nseismologists know both the precise magnitude of previous tests and the \nconsequent seismic reading generated by those tests. The worst case \nwould involve clandestine tests in uncalibrated regions that are \ndecoupled. Even in best case circumstances no one disputes the \nuncertainty of identifying low yield nuclear events--no matter where \nthey are conducted. Some believe these uncertainties extend to events \nof several kilotons, fully decoupled. In any case, no improvements of \nthe United States and IMS systems that can be expected in the \nforeseeable future will alter those judgments.\n  Mr. President, that is why CTBT proponents stress seismic \ncapabilities in terms of detection capability, which, unlike \nidentification capabilities, can be calculated. But detection relates \nexclusively to the seismic network's ability to sense events, and again \nI stress it is identification, not detection that underpins \nverification.\n  A violator can decrease even a detected seismic magnitude by \n``decoupling''--that is, conducting a nuclear test in an underground \ncavity that muffles an explosion. Treaty proponents will argue that \nconstruction of such cavities is a nontrivial engineering task. It is \nhard to measure such difficulty because our experience in decoupling is \nmore limited than, say, Russia's. But to decouple a 10-kiloton \nexplosion so that it cannot be identified requires a cavity that \ncountries of greatest concern are certainly capable of constructing.\n  To help resolve such uncertainties, the CTBT includes the right to \nconduct on-site inspections (OSI). But decisions to exercise that right \nwill be based on the level of voting countries' confidence in events \nidentified by the IMS seismic network.\n  Thirty current members of the rotating 51-member CTBT Executive \nCouncil must agree that an OSI should be conducted. It is clear from \nthe negotiating record that some countries, including China, would view \na request for OSI as a hostile act.\n  The fact, coupled with identification uncertainties for low yield \nevents, makes it very unlikely that the Executive Council will ever get \nthe votes needed to request OSI for lower yield tests. For larger \nyields, in calibrated regions, where event-identification would be less \nambiguous, OSI requests would be more likely to get the required \nsupport, but hardly needed to identify the event.\n  For seismic events that could be low yield tests, the precise \nlocation of that event will be very uncertain, and the area that would \nneed to be examined with OSI would be prohibitively large. Impression \nin locating an event, coupled with the inspected state's rights under \nthe CTBT's ``managed access'' principle, assures that an approved OSI \nwill never conclusively identify an event.\n  Past experience has shown that to achieve consensus--even within the \nUnited States--on the identification of low yield events will be very \ndifficult. Past experience has also shown that other countries--most of \nwhom do not have the detection resources the United States has--will \nweigh OSI decisions against the political reality that target state \nwill perceive OSI as a hostile action.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that OSI approval will be most \nlikely in cases where they are needed least, least likely in cases \nwhere they are needed most, and of marginal utility when they are \nconducted.\n  Even if a detected seismic event is categorized as a nuclear test, it \nstill has to be attributed to a CTBT party. What if it takes place in \ninternational waters? What if a suspected government feigns surprise \nand attributes the undertaking to a non-state actor, known or unknown, \nacting within its borders? What if the precise location cannot be \nspecified and the suspect state has sensitive facilities in the area \nsurrounding the event's apparent epicenter? In short, the IMS is \ndesigned to support a bulletproof CTBT regime. It will generate lots of \nsuspecting, very little detecting, still less identifying, little or no \nattributing, and a virtual absence a verified noncompliance.\n  Mr. President, none of this would matter except that the United \nStates will never conclude that the accumulated uncertainties are \nsufficient to justify our abrogation of the treaty. Anti-nuclear \ninterests, knowing full well that a foreign nuclear test has occurred, \nwill always be able to obscure the evidence or moderate the U.S. \nresponse. That is true already, of course, but Treaties reside in a \nrarefield political and legal atmosphere in the U.S. from which \nabrogation is never taken lightly.\n  These are the weapons the United States relied on defeat two \nmonstrous twentieth century tyrannies and to deter threats for over a \nhalf-century. I do not wish to subordinate their deterrent power, their \nsafety, their modernization, or their reliability to the vagaries of \nthis detection-identification-verification conundrum. The IMS system \nwas not, and could not have been, designed to verify clandestine tests. \nThus, to whatever extent our ratification of the CTBT relies on the \nintegrity of verification it should be soundly defeated.\n  CTBT proponents are fond of saying that this treaty is the longest \nsought, hardest fought arms control agreement. They point out that \nnegotiation of a nuclear test ban first began with President \nEisenhower, and continued on-and-off through the administrations of \nseveral presidents.\n  In truth, the Clinton CTBT is very different from the test bans \nsought by past presidents. An old name has been put on a new treaty. We \nneed only look at history to see that what President Clinton's \nadministration negotiated is not at all consistent with the treaty \nsought by his predecessors.\n  When President Eisenhower undertook negotiations for a test ban, he \npurposefully excluded low-yield nuclear testing for at least two \nreasons. First, he knew that the United States would need to conduct \nsuch low-level tests to assure that the U.S. stockpile was as safe and \nreliable as possible. Second, he knew that such testing is readily \nconcealed, so banning them would not be verifiable. And, like \nEisenhower, subsequent U.S. Presidents\n\n[[Page S12538]]\n\nheld fast to the position that any test ban must allow for low-yield \ntesting.\n  President Clinton, separating himself from past presidents, declared \nthat the United States would undertake a zero-yield nuclear test ban. \nHe made this decision against the advice of the majority of his \ncabinet, including the Secretaries of Defense and State, and against \nthe advice of the leaders of the national laboratories. That is, \nPresident Clinton unilaterally determined that the U.S. would deny \nitself the ability to conduct the low-level testing necessary to assure \nus that the weapons in our stockpile are functional and usable.\n  President Clinton's decision is particularly astounding when you \nrealize that other nations will not be similarly constrained. They will \nbe able to test low-yield devices. Why? Because the CTBT does not \ndefine what is meant by a nuclear test. In other words, the treaty does \nnot say that it is a zero-yield ban. That is something that President \nClinton imposed on the United States as its own interpretation of the \ntreaty. Thus, when Russia conducts low-yield tests to assure \nreliability of its own arsenal, it will not be technically in violation \nof the CTBT.\n  A second reason that Clinton's CTBT is quite different from the test \nbans sought by past presidents is duration. Clinton's treaty is of \nunlimited duration. All previous presidents understood that it was very \nimportant to limit the length of the treaty to a few years, thus \nrequiring renewal periodically. This would place the burden upon those \nwho want a test ban to prove that it is in the security interests of \nthe United States to continue the ban. Instead, Clinton's treaty does \nthe opposite: it makes getting out of the treaty very difficult. And, \nas we have seen from the ABM Treaty, it is politically very difficult \nto leave a treaty, even when it is no longer relevant or in your \nsecurity interests.\n  A third major difference that makes Clinton's CTBT different from \npast test bans is its lack of verifiability. All past presidents stated \nthat they would only support a treaty that is effectively verifiable.\n  Verifiability may not seem to be a very significant issue, but it is \nindeed terribly important. We all know that the United States will \nadhere scrupulously to the CTBT is we in the Senate give our advice and \nconsent to ratification. Other nations, however, have repeatedly \ndemonstrated that they are willing to violate their arms control \ncommitments. North Korea is currently in violation of the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty, under which it promised not to pursue nuclear \nweapons. Russia has violated a host of arms agreements, including the \nban on production of biological weapons.\n  If the United States abides by a test ban, whereas other nations are \nable to continue testing undetected, the United States will ultimately \nbe disadvantaged. Others will be able to assure confidence in their \nstockpiles, but the United States will not. Others will be able to \ncontinue to develop newer, more modern nuclear weapons, whereas the \nU.S. program will be frozen. Others will be able to test any fixes to \nproblems that develop with their stockpiles, whereas the United States \nwill not be able to do so.\n  This treaty is not well-thought-out and contains provisions that will \nultimately harm the U.S. nuclear deterrent. Furthermore, the zero-yield \ninterpretation by President Clinton is unacceptable. We should reject \nthis treaty in the interests of our own security.\n  CTBT proponents assert that the DOE's Science Based Stockpile \nStewardship Program (SSP) can maintain the safety and reliability of \nthe nation's nuclear weapon stockpile without nuclear testing. I \nemphasize that this is an assertion, an unproven, undemonstrated \nassertion. Dr. Seigfried Hecker, as Director of Los Alamos National \nLaboratory in 1997, in response to a question from Senator Kyl, has \nstated ``. . . we could not guarantee the safety and reliability of the \nnuclear stockpile indefinitely without nuclear testing.'' By agreeing \nto ratification of the CTBT the Senate would accept abandoning nuclear \ntesting, the only proven method for assuring the safety and reliability \nof our nuclear deterrent, to embrace the unproven, unvalidated SSP.\n  Nuclear deterrence is a vital element of our national security \nstructure. President Clinton, in sending us this treaty reaffirmed that \nhe views the maintenance of a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile to be \na supreme national interest of the United States. If this is the case, \nhow we can accept an unproven SSP as the basis for our confidence in \nthe nuclear stockpile? If SSP were an established capability, and a not \na set of research programs, most of which will not reach fruition for \nyears, and the predictions of SSP had been thoroughly compared with the \nresults of nuclear tests specifically designed to validate the new SSP, \nwith positive results, then and only then could I consider abandoning \nnuclear testing in favor of SSP.\n  Can you imagine any reputable company abandoning one accounting \nsystems for another without making sure that the new system's results \nagreed with the old? Can you imagine any reputable laboratory \nabandoning one calibration tool for another before ensuring that the \nnew tool agreed with the old tool? But this is what we are being asked \nto do if we give our advice and consent to the CTBT. In an area where \nthe supreme national interest of the United States is at stake we are \nbeing asked to endorse SSP as a replacement for nuclear testing without \nknowing if SSP works. Clearly the sensible course of action is to \npursue SSP but calibrate its predictions, validate its new computer \nmodels, step-by-step, year-by-year by direct comparison with the \nresults of nuclear tests specifically designed to test SSP. Then, if \nthe SSP is shown to be a reliable replacement for nuclear testing, we \ncould consider whether we would wish to be a party to a treaty banning \nnuclear testing. We must retain the ability to conduct underground \nnuclear tests to ensure the reliability and safety of our existing \nweapons and to establish whether SSP works.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that this body, in 1987, \nrequired the Department of Energy to design a program very like what I \nhave described, but even more encompassing. The Senate Armed Services \nCommittee language for the fiscal year 1998 authorization bill required \nthat DOE prepare a report on a program which would prepare the country \nfor further limitations on nuclear testing beyond the 150 kiloton yield \ncap then in place. The committee recognized that the sophisticated \nweapons in the U.S. inventory might not be sustainable under further \ntest limitations and required DOE to describe a program that would ``. \n. . prepare the stockpile to be less susceptible to unreliability \nduring long periods of substantially limited testing.'' DOE was also \nrequired to ``. . . describe ways in which existing and/or new types of \ncalculations, non-nuclear testing, and permissible but infrequent low \nyield nuclear testing might be used to move toward these objectives.'' \nThis latter requirement might be viewed as the progenitor of SSP. DOE \nresponded to this requirement by designing a test-ban readiness program \nwhich anticipated a ten year, ten nuclear test per year program which \nwould address the objectives required by the Senate, which included the \ndevelopment and validation, by comparison with nuclear tests, of new \ncalculational tools and non-nuclear testing facilities. I must hasten \nto add that this program described by DOE was never fully funded \nbecause throughout the Reagan and Bush administrations further \nlimitations on nuclear testing were not viewed as necessary or \ndesirable. A CTBT was stated to be a long term goal.\n  The stark differences between the Senate's requirement and the DOE \nresponse and the path taken by the Clinton administration could not be \nmore stark. There was no period of preparation for this CTBT before us. \nThe DOE was not instructed to implement the design and testing of \nrobust replacement warheads. The DOE was not funded to procure and \nvalidate new calculational and non-nuclear testing facilities. Instead, \nnuclear testing stopped without warning. Even the few nuclear tests \nthat might have allowed some preparation were denied. Dr. Hecker wrote \nto Senator Kyl, ``We favored conducting such tests with the objective \nof preparing us better for a CTBT.'' However all tests were ruled out \nby the Clinton administration for policy reasons. This was years before \nthe President signed the CTBT.\n\n[[Page S12539]]\n\n  Nuclear weapon safety has always been a paramount concern of the \nUnited States. Throughout the history of its nuclear weapons program \nthe United States has made every effort to ensure that even in the most \nviolent of accident situations there would be the minimum chance of a \nnuclear explosion or radioactive contamination. The adoption of the \nCTBT will abandon this important commitment.\n  I am very concerned that a CTBT will stand in the way of improving \nthe safety of U.S. nuclear weapons. All experts agree that nuclear \nweapon safety cannot be improved without the ability to conduct nuclear \ntests to confirm that the weapons, once new safety features are \nincorporated, are reliable. The CTBT makes pointless any attempts to \ninvent new, improved safety feature because they could never be adopted \nwithout nuclear testing. Of even greater concern is that the CTBT even \neliminates the possibility of improving the safety of current weapons \nthrough the incorporation of existing, well understood safety features.\n  Unfortunately, few people know that many of our current weapons do \nnot contain all the safety features that already have been invented by \nthe DOE Laboratories. A White House Backgrounder issued July 3, 1993, \nin conjunction with President Clinton's decision to stop all u.S. \ntesting, acknowledges ``Additional nuclear tests could help us prepare \nfor a CTBT and provide some additional improvements in safety and \nreliability.'' President Clinton thought it was more important not to \nundercut his nonproliferation goals!\n  I am less ready to ignore the safety of the American people. If we \naccept the CTBT, we will be accepting a stockpile of nuclear weapons \nthat is less safe than it could be. I, for one, want no part in \nsettling for less than the best safety that can be had. Should a U.S. \nnuclear weapon become in evolved in a violent accident which results in \ndeaths and damage due to the spread of radioactive plutonium, I do not \nwant to be in the position of explaining how I, by consenting to \nratification of the CTBT, prevented the incorporation of safety \nmeasures that would have prevented these tragic consequences.\n  CTBT proponents will cite certifications of safety by the laboratory \ndirectors and the administration that the stockpile is safe. They \napparently believe that procedures will make up for the lack of safety \nfeatures. The Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident provides us with an \nexample of what happens when procedures are counted on to ensure safety \nrather than putting safety mechanisms in place. Chernobly is not the \nonly example where counting on human operators to follow procedure for \nensuring safety has failed. It had been DOE's objective to install \nsafety features which were inherent to guarantee, to the maximum extent \npossible, that neither through accident nor malevolent intent could \nhuman actions cause unacceptable contamination. Has this policy been \nabandoned because it is inconvenient to an administration determined to \nhave a CTBT at any cost?\n  We have spent considerable money to incorporate advanced safety \nfeatures in some existing weapons. Were we wasting our money? Is there \nsome reason why it is OK to have some weapons less safe than others? I \nam not challenging that each weapon may be as safe as it could have \nbeen made at the time it was built. But safety standards change and now \nwe may have to live without current weapon systems for a very long \ntime. The American people deserve the safest weapons possible. We have \ngone from expecting seat belts, to expecting antilocking brakes and air \nbags in our automobiles. We know we could have insensitive high \nexplosive and fire-resistant pits and enhanced nuclear detonation \nsafety devices in every stockpile weapon. But we do not! We know each \nadditional safety features decreases the probability of catastrophic \nresults from an accident involving a nuclear weapon. We have no \nbusiness entering into a CTBT until every weapon in our inventory is as \nsafe as we know how to make it. I cannot justify a lesser standard and \nI hope you join me in this view and not give advice and consent to the \nratification of the CTBT.\n  Mr. President, there are numerous reasons to oppose this treaty, many \nof which have been discussed here already. But I would like to focus on \none feature of this agreement that is, in my view, sufficient reason by \nitself for rejecting ratification, and that is the treaty's duration.\n  This is an agreement of unlimited duration. That means that, if \nratified, the United States will be committing itself forever not to \nconduct another nuclear test.\n  Think of that--forever. Are we so confident today that we will never \nagain need nuclear testing--so certain that we are willing to deprive \nall future commanders-in-chief, all future military leaders, all future \nCongresses, of the one means that can actually prove the reliability of \nour nuclear deterrent?\n  Now, proponents of this treaty will say that this is not the case--\nthat this commitment is not forever--because the treaty allows for \nwithdrawal if our national interest requires it. And proponents of the \ntreaty promise that if we reach a point where the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear deterrent cannot be guaranteed without \ntesting, well then all we need do is exercise our right to withdraw and \nresume testing. This so-called ``supreme national interest'' clause, \nalong with Safeguard F, in which President Clinton gives us his solemn \nword that he will consider a resumption of testing if our deterrent \ncannot be certified, is supposed to reassure us.\n  But the fact, Mr. President, is that this reassurance is a hollow \npromise, and supporters of the treaty know it.\n  The fact is that if the critical moment arrives and there is \nirrefutable evidence that we must conduct nuclear testing to ensure our \ndeterrent is safe, reliable, and credible, those same treaty supporters \nwill be shouting from the highest mountain that the very act of \nwithdrawing from this treaty would be too provocative to ever be \njustified, that no narrow security need of the United States could ever \noverride the solemn commitment we made to the world in agreeing to be \nbound by this treaty.\n  And if you don't believe that will happen, Mr. President, you need \nonly look at our current difficulties with the 1972 ABM Treaty. It \nprovides a chilling glimpse of our nuclear future, should we ratify \nthis ill-conceived test ban.\n  Like the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the ABM Treaty is of \nunlimited duration. It, too, includes a provision allowing the United \nStates to withdraw if our national interests so demand. It's difficult \nto imagine a situation in which national security interests and treaty \nobligations are more clearly mismatched than with the ABM Treaty today, \nbut its supporters insist that withdrawal is not just ill-advised but \nactually unthinkable. And the voices wailing loudest about changing \nthis ossified agreement are the same ones urging us today to entangle \nourselves in another treaty of unlimited duration.\n  Think of the ways in which the ABM Treaty is mismatched with our \nmodern security needs. The treaty was conceived in a strategic context \nutterly unlike today's, a bipolar world in which two superpowers were \nengaged in both global rivalry and an accompanying buildup in strategic \nnuclear forces. Today, one of those superpowers no longer exists, and \nwhat remains of it struggles to secure its own borders against poorly \narmed militants.\n  The arms race that supposedly justified the ABM Treaty's perverse \ndeification of vulnerability has not just halted, it's reversed, and no \nthanks to arms control. Today Russian nuclear forces are plummeting due \nnot to the START II agreement--which Russia has refused to ratify for \nnearly 7 years--but to economic constraints and the end of the cold \nwar. In fact, their forces are falling far faster than treaties can \nkeep up; arms control isn't controlling anything--economic and \nstrategic considerations are. Similar forces have led the United States \nto conclude that its forces can also be reduced. Thus, despite a \nstrategic environment completely different from the one that gave birth \nto the ABM Treaty, its supporters stubbornly insist that we must remain \na party to it.\n  In 1972, only the Soviet Union had the capability to target the \nUnited States with long-range ballistic missiles. Today, numerous rogue \nstates are\n\n[[Page S12540]]\n\ndiligently working to acquire long-range missiles with which to coerce \nthe United States or deter it from acting in its interests, and these \nweapons are so attractive precisely because we have no defense against \nthem--indeed, we are legally prohibited from defending against them by \nthe ABM Treaty.\n  Technologically, too, the ABM Treaty is obsolete. The kinetic kill \nvehicle that destroyed an ICBM high over the Pacific Ocean on October 2 \nwas undreamed of in 1972. So was the idea of a 747 equipped with a \nmissile killing laser, which is under construction now in Washington \nstate, or space-based tracking satellites like SBIRS-Low, so precise \nthat they may make traditional ground-based radars superfluous in \nmissile defense. Yet this ABM Treaty, negotiated three decades ago, \nstands in the way of many of these technological innovations that could \nprovide the United States with the protection it needs against the \nworld's new threats.\n\n  These new threats have led to a consensus that the United States must \ndeploy a National Missile Defense system, and a recognition that we are \nbehind the curve in deploying one. The National Missile Defense Act, \ncalling for deployment of such a system as soon as technologically \nfeasible, passed this body by a vote of 97-3, with similar support in \nthe House. Just as obvious as the need for this capability is the fact \nthat the ABM Treaty prohibits us from deploying it. Clearly, the ABM \nTreaty must be amended or jettisoned; the Russians have so far refused \nto consider amending it so withdrawal is the obvious course of action \nif United States security interests are to be served.\n  But listen to the hue and cry at even the mention of such an option. \nFrom Russia to China to France and even to here on the floor of the \nUnited States Senate, we have heard the cry that the United States \ncannot withdraw from the ABM Treaty because it has become too important \nto the world community. Those who see arms control as an end in itself \ninveigh against even the consideration of withdrawal, claiming \npassionately that the United States owes it to the world to remain \nvulnerable to missile attack. Our participation in this treaty \ntranscends narrow U.S. security interests, they claim; we have a higher \nobligation to the international community. After all, if the United \nStates is protected from attack, won't that just encourage others to \nbuild more missiles in order to retain the ability to coerce us, thus \nthreatening the great god of strategic stability? That phrase, \ntranslated, means that citizens of the United States must be vulnerable \nto incineration or attack by biological weapons so that other nations \nin this world may do as they please.\n  Even though the ABM Treaty is hopelessly outdated and prevents the \nUnited States from defending its citizens against the new threats of \nthe 21st century, supporters of arms control insist that withdrawal is \nunthinkable. Its very existence is too important to be overridden by \nthe mere security interests of the United States.\n  Absurd as such a proposition sounds, it is the current policy of this \nadministration and it is supported by the very same voices who now urge \nus to ratify this comprehensive test ban. The Clinton administration \nhas been reluctantly forced by the Congress into taking serious action \non missile defenses. It admits that the system it needs to meet our \nsecurity requirements cannot be deployed under the ABM Treaty. Yet, so \npowerful are the voices calling on the United States to subjugate its \nown security interests to arms control that the administration is \nproposing changes to the ABM Treaty that--by its own admission--will \nnot allow a missile defense system that will meet our requirements. It \nhas declared what must be done as ``too hard to do'' and intends to \nleave the mess it has created for another administration to clean up. \nAll because arms control becomes an end in itself.\n  That sorry state of affairs, Mr. President, is where we will end up \nif the Senate consents to ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty. Those treaty supporters who are saying now, ``don't worry, \nthere's an escape clause'' will be the same ones who, 5 or 10 years \nfrom now--when there's a problem with our stockpile and the National \nIgnition Facility is still not finished and we find out that we \noverestimated our ability to simulate the workings of a nuclear \nweapon--will be saying we dare not withdraw from this treaty because we \nowe a higher debt to the international community.\n  Mr. President, I don't represent the international community, I \nrepresent the people of my state. Our decision here must serve the best \ninterests of the United States and its citizens. Our experience with \nthe ABM Treaty is a perfect example of how arms control agreements \nassume an importance well beyond their contribution to the security of \nour nation. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty's unlimited duration is a \nvirtual guarantee that this agreement will prevent us from conducting \nnuclear testing long past the point at which we decide such testing is \nnecessary, should we so decide. As our ABM experience shows, we should \ntake no comfort from the presence of a so-called ``supreme national \ninterest'' clause.\n  I urge the defeat of this treaty.\n  Mr. President, the CTBT is nothing less than an ill-disguised attempt \nto unilaterally disarm the U.S. nuclear arsenal. We have repeatedly \nconfirmed the need for nuclear weapons in the U.S. defense force \nposture. According to this administration's Secretary of Defense, \n``nuclear forces are an essential element of U.S. security that serve \nas a hedge against an uncertain future and as a guarantee of U.S. \ncommitments to allies.'' Most of us recognize this as a necessary, but \nawful, responsibility. Unfortunately, the CTBT actively undermines the \nSecretary of Defense's stated rationale for the U.S. nuclear arsenal.\n  For nuclear weapons to serve as a hedge against an uncertain future, \nthey must be relevant to the threats we may face. As Iraq demonstrated \nduring the gulf war, that threat is often a rogue regime armed with \nweapons of mass destruction. Hopefully, the threat of nuclear \nretaliation will deter a rogue regime from using WMD against United \nStates forces and allies in the theater, as it did in the Iraqi case. \nHowever, some rogue regimes may not be moved by such concerns. Would \nNorth Korea, which appears otherwise content to let its people starve, \nbalk at the prospect of United States nuclear retaliation/ and for that \nmatter, is a United States threat to kill hundreds of thousands of \noppressed North Korean civilian the proper response to North Korean WMD \nuse? Is it a proportionate, morally acceptable threat to make? If it is \nnot a threat we would carry out, how credible can it be? The answer to \nthese questions lies in making sure that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is \nand remains relevant to the sorts of threats we will encounter in the \n``uncertain future.''\n  Making the U.S. nuclear arsenal relevant to a world of rogue actors \nwith dug-in, hardened shelters and WMD capabilities will likely require \nnew weapons designs. In addition to improving the safety and \nreliability of our arsenal, new weapons designs tailoring explosive \npower to the threat will be crucial. For example, in some settings, \nbiological weapons can be even more deadly than nuclear weapons. By \nreleasing the agent into the atmosphere, a conventional attack on a \nbiological weapons storage facility might cause more innocent deaths \nthan it averted. It is possible that only a nuclear weapon is capable \nof assuring the destruction of a biological agent in some \ncircumstances. The U.S. development of the B61-11 bunker buster nuclear \nweapon is evidence that, absent the political pressure for arms \ncontrol, the U.S. arsenal needs these capabilities.\n  The CTBT will stop the United States from developing and deploying \nfourth generation nuclear weapons. Further, it will slowly degrade and \ndestroy the nuclear weapons design infrastructure needed to produce new \nweapons designs. Thus any promise to withdraw from the CTBT in time of \nneed becomes irrelevant; the capabilities we need won't be there. \nWithout these new designs, nuclear weapons will ultimately cease to be \na credible option for U.S. decisionmakers in all but a few very \nspecific cases. Denying the United States the nuclear option is the \ntrue intent of the CTBT.\n  Do other countries recognize the utility of new weapons designs? \nCertainly.\n\n[[Page S12541]]\n\nRussia increasingly relies on its nuclear weapons for national security \nbecause its conventional forces are failing. Russia is almost certainly \ninterested in developing what one Russian senior academic identified as \n``ultralow-yield nuclear weapons with little effect on the \nenvironment.'' Our ability to detect and identify these sorts of test, \nwhich may resemble conventional explosions or small seismic events, \nwith any degree of certainty is limited, and the cost of evading \ndetection through decoupled underground tests, masking chemical \nexplosions, etc., is not prohibitive. While the CTBT's proposed \nInternational Monitoring System (IMS) will add to the capabilities \navailable through U.S. national technical means (NTM), it will still \nnot provide definitive answers.\n  While less sophisticated than the Russian program, China has \ndemonstrated that modernized and new weapons designs are on its agenda. \nIts aggressive intelligence-gathering operation aimed at the U.S. \nnuclear weapons complex should be clear evidence of that. China's \nwillingness to freeze its nuclear modernization program simply to \ncomply with a treaty should also be suspect--China has repeatedly \ndemonstrated that it is willing to act contrary to its international \ncommitments in areas of keen United States interest like the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime (MTCR). ``Norms'' and diplomatic peer \npressure will not dissuade China from nuclear testing. Based on these \nobservations, what the CTBT will create is a frozen, degrading U.S. \nnuclear weapons program, improving Russian and Chinese arsenals, and a \nhost of rogue regimes increasingly aware that the United States nuclear \nthreat is deficient.\n  Let me conclude my remarks. I think as we close this debate, it is \nimportant to reflect for a moment on what the constitutional \nresponsibilities of the Senate are. In binding the American people to \ninternational treaties, the Senate is a coequal partner with the \nPresident of the United States, whose people negotiate treaties which \nhe signs and then sends to the Senate for its advice and consent.\n  It would help if he asked the Senate's advice before he requested our \nconsent, but in this particular case his negotiators tried in certain \ncircumstances to gain provisions in this treaty which eventually they \nconcluded they could not get, and as a result, negotiated what Senator \nLugar of this body has called a treaty not of the same caliber as \nprevious arms control treaties; a treaty that is flawed in a variety of \nways he pointed out, including the fact it is not verifiable and it \nlacks enforceability.\n  My view is that the Senate can fulfill its constitutional \nresponsibility not by being a rubber stamp to the administration but by \nin effect being quality control by sending a message that the U.S. \nGovernment, embodied in the Senate, will insist on certain minimum \nstandards in treaties that will bind the American people. Particularly \nwith respect to our national security, when we are talking about arms \ncontrol, we will insist on those standards regardless of world opinion \nor what the lowest common denominator of nations may request.\n  This administration had the opportunity to negotiate a treaty of less \nthan permanent duration. They originally tried a 10-year, opt-out \nprovision but failed in that. They originally, at the request of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, were trying not to agree to a zero yield but to \npermit hydronuclear tests. But eventually they agreed to a zero yield. \nThere were requests for better monitoring sites around the world, but \nour negotiators gave up on that as well.\n  My point is, in rejecting this treaty tonight the Senate will be \nstrengthening the hand of our future negotiators who, in talking to \ntheir counterparts in the world, will be able to say the Senate is \ngoing to insist on certain minimum standards: That it be verifiable, it \nbe enforceable, that it take the U.S. security interests seriously, and \nunless that is done we cannot possibly agree to these terms.\n  By rejecting this treaty this evening, I believe we will be sending a \nvery strong message that as the leader of the world, the United States \nwill insist on certain minimal standards to the treaties. Our \nnegotiators in the future will be better able to negotiate the \nprovisions. And in the future, the Senate will be in a position to \nratify a treaty rather than having to reject what is clearly an \ninferior treaty.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the good-faith efforts of people on \nboth sides of the aisle to avoid a vote, knowing that there were not \nvotes in the Senate to ratify this treaty, have obviously failed. The \nvote will occur soon, and the votes are not there to ratify the treaty. \nThat, in my opinion, is profoundly unfortunate. There is plenty of \nblame to be passed all around for that result.\n  I think at this moment we all should not look backward but look \nforward, and particularly say to our friends and allies and enemies \naround the world that this vote tonight does not send a signal that the \nmajority of the American people and their Representatives in Congress \nand in the Senate are not profoundly concerned about nuclear \nproliferation and are not interested in arriving at a treaty that \ngenuinely will protect future generations from that threat.\n  At times in this debate I was heartened by statements, including \nthose made by the current occupant of the Chair, the Senator from \nNebraska, saying if the vote occurred, you would vote against the \nratification tonight, but more work ought to be done and more thought \nought to be given. I hope in the days ahead we will be able to reach \nacross the partisan aisle, work together without time limitation or \neven timeframe, to see if we can find a way to build adequate support \nfor the ratification of this treaty, or a treaty which will control the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons by prohibiting the testing of those \nweapons. I invite my colleagues from both parties to join with us in \nthat effort in working together with our administration. I hope we can \ntake from this experience the lessons of what we did not do this time \nand should do next time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time remains in my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 16 minutes 54 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time remains in control of my friend?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator forgive me; I overlooked Senator Warner.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleagues.\n  My dear friend and partner in the venture for a letter, Senator \nMoynihan, addressed the letter in his remarks. First, we expressed it \nwas an effort in bipartisanship by a large number of Senators--I but \none; Senator Moynihan two. This letter will be printed in the Record \nfollowing the vote.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have spoken to our leader. I am going to \nclose the debate on our side. I will use any time up to the amount of \ntime that I have available.\n  My friend from North Carolina knows--I guess when people listen to us \non the air they must wonder. We go through this, ``my friend from North \nCarolina'' and ``distinguished Senator from.'' I imagine people, \nespecially kids or youngsters in high school and college, must look at \nus and say: What are they talking about, unless they understand the \nneed for good manners in a place where there are such strong \ndifferences, where we have such deep-seated differences on some issues, \nwhere I must tell you--and I am not being melodramatic--my heart aches \nbecause we are about to vote down this treaty. I truly think, I \nhonestly believe that, in the 27 years I have been here, this is the \nmost serious mistake the Senate has ever made--or is about to make.\n  But that does not detract from my respect for the Senator from North\n\n[[Page S12542]]\n\nCarolina, who not only is against the treaty, but wants to bring it up \nnow, now, and vote it down. So I think it is important for the American \npeople to understand. We have deep differences on this floor. In other \nplaces they have coups and they shoot each other. Because of the \ntraditions of this body and the rules of the Senate, we live to fight \nanother day.\n  My friend knows we came the same year; we came the same date; we came \nat the same time. I will promise him, and he will not be surprised, I \nwill use every remaining day of this Congress to try to fight him on \nthis issue--even though I am about to lose, we are about to lose, my \nposition is about to lose--to try to bring this back up, try to push \nit, try to keep it alive. Because as the Parliamentarian pointed out, \nwhen you vote this treaty down today, it doesn't die; it goes to sleep. \nIt goes back to bed. It jumps over that marble counter there, back over \nthe desk to the Executive Calendar to be called up again.\n  I warn you all, I am going to be a thorn in your side, not that it \nmatters much, but I am going to keep harping at it. I am going to keep \nbeating up on you; I am going to keep talking about it; I am going to \nkeep at it, keep at it, keep at it.\n  When we started this off, my objective was to get the kind of \nhearings--I know my friend says we have had hearings--the kind of \nhearings we have had on other significant treaties--10, 12, 15, 18 days \nof hearings. The ``sense of the Senate'' amendment that I was prepared \nto introduce two weeks ago called for Foreign Relations Committee \nhearings beginning this fall and final action by March 31, 2000.\n\n  That is what I was looking for because I truly believe that, were the \nAmerican people and our colleagues able to hash this out in the way we \ndesigned this body to work, we would, in fact, find accommodation for \nall those concerns that 67 Senators might have; not 90, but probably \n67, 68--70. I truly believe that. I truly believe that.\n  Instead, we got one quick week of hearings, with the Committee on \nForeign Relations holding only one day of hearings dedicated to this \ntreaty, the day after the committee was discharged of its \nresponsibility.\n  That abdication of committee responsibility was perhaps only fitting, \nas most Republicans appear prepared to force this great country to \nabdicate its responsibility for world leadership on nuclear non-\nproliferation.\n  But let me say that in this floor debate, I have attempted at least \nto answer attacks leveled by treaty opponents. Neither side has been \nable to delve very deeply, however, given the time constraints and lack \nof balanced, I think, detailed knowledge on the part of our Senate.\n  For example, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island and the \nSenator from Virginia are both friends. They are World War II vets. \nThey have served a long time and they are among the two most honorable \npeople I know. Senator Chafee--I assume he will forgive me for saying \nthis--came up to me and said: Joe, check what I have here. Is this \naccurate, what I have here?\n  I said what I am about to say: It is absolutely accurate.\n  He said: But it is different from what my friend from Virginia said, \nSenator Warner said.\n  I said: I love him, but he is flat wrong. He is flat wrong.\n  I don't think anybody is intentionally misleading anybody. I do think \nwe haven't hashed this out.\n  For example, there is a condition that we have adopted by unanimous \nconsent, part of this resolution of ratification we are about to vote \non, the last section of which says:\n\n       Withdrawal from the treaty: If the President determines \n     that nuclear testing is necessary to assure with a high \n     degree of confidence the safety and reliability of the United \n     States nuclear weapons stockpile, the President shall consult \n     promptly with the Senate and withdraw from the treaty.\n\n  He has no choice. He must withdraw.\n  My friend from Virginia characterizes this treaty as having no way \nout. If, however, the President is told by the National Laboratory \nDirectors, by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, ``We \ncan't guarantee any more, boss,'' he must inform us and he must \nwithdraw.\n  That is an illustration of what I mean. Here are two honorable men, \ntwo men of significant experience, asking one another and asking each \nof their staffs: Which is right?\n  In one sense, it is clear what is right: we haven't had much time to \ntalk about it. We haven't had much time to talk about it.\n  The debating points and counterpoints are too many to summarize in a \nshort statement in the probably 12 minutes I have left. But the themes \nof this debate are clear and so are the fallacies that underlie the \narguments of those who oppose the treaty, at least the arguments made \nmost repeatedly on the floor.\n  The first theme of the treaty opponents is that, while our nuclear \nweapons stockpile may be--they don't say ``may'', they say ``is''--safe \nand is reliable today, there is no way to do without nuclear testing \nforever. That is the first theme that is promoted by the opponents.\n\n  This argument is based on a fallacy rooted in our nuclear weapons \nhistory. The history is that our nuclear testing has supported a trial-\nand-error approach to correcting deficiencies, rather than rooting our \nweapons in detailed scientific knowledge of how a nuclear reaction \nworks.\n  The fallacy is that nuclear weapons must be subjected to full-up, \n``integrated'' testing. That is a fallacy. The truth is, rarely do we \nfully test major systems. Rather, we test components or conduct less \nthan full tests of complete systems.\n  As my colleagues know, a truly full test of a nuclear weapon would \nrequire that it be tested as a bomb or as a warhead, as it is intended \nto be, and exploded in the atmosphere. All the experts tell you that. \nThat is the only true, absolute way you know what is going to happen: \ntest it in the atmosphere.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we have done without atmospheric \ntesting for 36 years. We accepted the supposedly degraded confidence in \nour nuclear stockpile that results from this lack of full-blown \ntesting.\n  Why have we accepted that? Because we balanced the benefits of full-\nup atmospheric testing against its disadvantages, and it was clear that \nthe benefits outweighed the negatives.\n  When listing the benefits, we also noted how well we could assure the \nsystems performance without these full-up tests. When listing the \ndisadvantages, we included cost, risk of collateral damage, \nenvironmental risk, radioactive fallout, and the diplomatic or military \ncosts that would have been incurred if we had rejected or withdrawn \nfrom the Limited Test-Ban Treaty which was signed in 1963.\n  Similarly today, we have to consider both the benefits and the \ndisadvantages of insisting upon the right to conduct underground \nnuclear testing. We should include in our calculus the fact that the \nResolution of Ratification of this treaty requires the President to \nwithdraw from the treaty if he ``determines that nuclear testing is \nnecessary to assure, with a high degree of confidence, the safety and \nreliability of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile.''\n  Guess what? Every year now, under the law, the Secretary of Energy \nand the Secretary of Defense must not only go to the President, but \nmust come to the Senator from Nebraska, the Senator from Delaware, the \nForeign Relations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, and they \nmust tell us, as well as the President, whether they can certify the \ncontinued safety and reliability of the stockpile. If they cannot \ncertify, and if we adopt this Resolution of Ratification, the President \nhas to withdraw from the treaty.\n  We will likely differ in our calculations of the balance between \nadvantages and disadvantages of foreswearing underground nuclear \ntesting. But we should all reject the fallacy that there is no \nsubstitute for continuing what we did in the past.\n  The second theme that opponents of the treaty keep putting out is \nthat we have to reject this treaty because it is not perfectly \nverifiable. This argument is based upon a fallacy rooted in slogans and \nfear. The fear relates to the history of arms control violations by the \nRussians and the Soviet Union. The slogans are Ronald Reagan's \nelection-year demand: Effective verification. And his later catch \nphrase: Trust but verify.\n  This body has never demanded perfect verification.\n\n[[Page S12543]]\n\n  Consider the vote we had on the INF Treaty that eliminated land-based \nintermediate-range missiles. That treaty was signed by President \nReagan. President Reagan, the same man who signed the treaty, also \ncoined the phrase ``trust but verify.''\n  Was the INF Treaty perfectly verifiable? No. Nobody in the world \nsuggested it was perfectly verifiable. Listen to what the Senate \nIntelligence Committee said before we voted on Ronald Reagan's INF \nTreaty. They said:\n\n       Soviet compliance with some of the treaty's provisions will \n     be difficult to monitor. The problem is exemplified by the \n     unresolved controversy between the Defense Intelligence \n     Agency and other intelligence agencies over the number of \n     SS-20s in the Soviet inventory.\n\n  We did not even know how many SS-20s, intermediate-range missiles, \nthey had. The Intelligence Committee went on to say:\n\n       Ground-launched cruise missiles pose a particular difficult \n     monitoring problem as they are interchangeable long-range, \n     sea-based launch cruise missiles.\n\n  Which the INF Treaty did not ban. This was not verifiable. Where were \nall you guys and women when the Reagan treaty was up here? God love \nhim: Trust but verify. I challenge anyone to come to the floor in the \nremaining minutes and tell me that the INF Treaty was perfectly \nverifiable.\n  I love this double standard. You wonder why some of us on this side \nof the aisle think this is about politics.\n  The fallacy is clear: Nobody really believes in perfect verification. \nThe Senate approved Ronald Reagan's INF Treaty by a vote of 93-5, \ndespite the fact that we knew the INF Treaty was far from verifiable. \nThe legitimate verification questions are how well can we verify \ncompliance and whether our national security will be threatened by any \nundetected cheating that could occur.\n  I say to my colleagues, we should end the pretense that only a \nperfectly verifiable treaty is acceptable. The only perfectly \nverifiable treaty is one that is impossible to be written.\n  Each side in this debate has agreed that the approval or rejection of \nthis treaty could have serious consequences. I suggest that we pay some \nattention to each side's worst-case scenarios.\n  Opponents of the treaty have warned that a permanent ban on nuclear \nweapons tests could result in degraded confidence in the U.S. \ndeterrent, perhaps leading other countries to develop their own nuclear \nweapons. Treaty supporters have warned that rejection of this treaty \ncould lead to a more unstable world in which all countries were freed \nof any obligation to obey the Test-Ban Treaty.\n  Neither of these worst-case outcomes is very palatable. Any degraded \nforeign confidence in the U.S. deterrent would be limited, however, \neither by annual certification of our own high confidence in our \nnuclear weapons, or by prompt action to fix any problems--including \nmandatory withdrawal from this treaty if the President determined that \ntesting was necessary.\n  Rejection of this treaty would not greatly increase the speed with \nwhich a nuclear test could be conducted, if one were necessary. The \nnuclear stockpile certification process already forces an annual \ndecision on whether to resume testing, and the treaty would impost only \na six-month delay after notice of our intent to withdraw. That means a \ntotal lag of 6 to 18 months between discovering a problem and being \nfree to test--roughly what officials say is the minimum time that it \ntakes to mount a serious nuclear weapons test, anyway.\n  By contrast, however, the worst-case scenario of Treaty supporters \nmight not be so limited. As Larry Eagleburger, who served as Secretary \nof State at the end of the Bush Administration, wrote in Monday's \nWashington Times:\n\n       The all-important effort of the United States to stem the \n     spread of nuclear weapons around the world is about to go \n     over a cliff unless saner heads in Washington quickly \n     prevail.\n\n  Eighty years ago, this body rejected the Treaty of Versailles that \nended the First World War. Woodrow Wilson's vision of a League of \nNations to keep the peace was turned down by a Senate that did not want \nto accept such a U.S. responsibility in the world. While that vote was \nunderstood to be significant at the time, nobody could foresee that our \nrefusal to take an active role in Europe's affairs would help lead to a \nSecond World War only two decades later.\n  Today, eight years after the Cold War's end, the Senate is presented \nwith a different kind of collective security proposition--an \ninternational treaty that can meaningfully reduce the danger that \nnuclear weapons will spread, a treaty enforced by an army of inspectors \nand a global system of sensors.\n\n  We cannot tell what the precise consequences of our actions are going \nto be this time, but the world will surely watch and wonder if we once \nagain abdicate America's responsibility of world leadership, if we once \nagain allow the world to drift rudderless into the stormy seas of \nnuclear proliferation.\n  World War II was a time of horror and heroism. A world of nuclear \nwars will bring unimagined horror and little room for the heroism of \nour fathers. We all pray that our children and grandchildren will not \nlive in such a world.\n  Will the votes today have such a major, perhaps awful, consequence? \nWe cannot say for sure, but I end by suggesting to all that the chance \nbeing taken by those who are worried about our ability to verify \ncompliance and our ability to verify the stockpile is far outweighed by \nthe chance we take in rejecting this treaty and saying to the entire \nworld: We are going to do testing and we do not believe that you can \nmaintain your interests without testing, so have at it.\n  We should all consider that this may be a major turning point in \nworld affairs. If we should reject this treaty, we may later find that \n``the road not taken,'' in Robert Frost's famous phrase, was, in fact, \nthe last road back from the nuclear brink.\n  I heard, in closing--the last comment I will make--my friend say: Our \nallies will lose confidence in us if we ratify this treaty. The fact \nis, however, that Tony Blair called today and, to paraphrase, said: For \nGod's sake, don't defeat this treaty. He is the Prime Minister of \nEngland, our No. 1 ally.\n  The German Chancellor said: Please ratify, in an open letter. The \nPresident of France, Jacques Chirac, said: Please ratify. So said our \nallies.\n  Larry Eagleburger's conclusion is one with which I shall end. His \nconclusion was:\n\n       The whole point of the CTBT from the American perspective \n     is get other nations to stop their testing activities and \n     thereby lock-in--in perpetuity--the overwhelming U.S. \n     advantage in weaponry. There is no other way to interpret a \n     vote against this treaty than as a vote in favor of nuclear \n     testing of other nations. It would stand on its head the \n     model of U.S. leadership on nonproliferation matters we have \n     achieved for over 40 years.\n       If the Senate cannot bring itself to do the right thing and \n     approve the treaty, then senators should do the next best \n     thing and pull it off the table.\n\n  As I used to say in a former profession, I rest my case, but in my \nformer profession, when I rested my case, I assumed I would win. I know \nI am going to lose here, but I will be back. I will be back. I yield \nthe floor and reserve the remainder of time, if I have any.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, how much time do we have left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 9 minutes \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, my friend, Senator Biden, began with an \nallusion to the young people listening by television about how we call \neach other distinguish Senators and various other good things, and that \nis called courtesy. I call him a distinguished Senator, and I admire \nJoe Biden. He knows I do. I cannot outshout him. He has far more volume \nthan I. I have used my windpipes a little bit longer than he has.\n  Let me tell you about Joe. He is a good guy. He is a good family man. \nHe goes home to Delaware every night. He comes back in the morning. \nSometimes he is not on time for committee meetings and other \nthings, but we take account of that. But you can bank on Joe Biden in \nterms of his vote. He is going to vote liberal every time. I have never \nknown him--and I say this with respect--to cast a conservative vote. \nAnd that is the real difference.\n\n  I believe it is essential that the Senate withhold its consent and \nvote to\n\n[[Page S12544]]\n\ndefeat the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. President, in the post-cold-war world, many of us have assumed \nthat the U.S. nuclear deterrent is less relevant than before. I contend \nthat it is more important than ever.\n  The level of threat posed by another nation has two parts--the \nnation's capabilities to inflict damage upon us, and the intent to do \nso. Since the end of the cold war, Russia's intent, clearly, is \npeaceful. This has not changed Russian nuclear capabilities, however. \nIf Russia's government were to change to a hostile one tomorrow, the \nlevel of threat posed by Moscow would be even greater than it was \nduring the cold war.\n  Unlike the United States, Russia has not stopped improving on its \nnuclear arsenal. The Russians have continued to modernize their nuclear \narsenal with new warheads and new delivery systems, despite the end of \nthe cold war. This modernization has been at tremendous economic \nexpense and has probably entailed continued nuclear testing. I might \nalso add that Russian nuclear doctrine has continued to evolve since \nthe end of the cold war, and now Moscow relies even more on its nuclear \ndeterrent for defense than it did before.\n  But, Russian is not the only potential threat. The greater danger may \ncome, ultimately, from China. As you know, Chinese espionage has \nyielded great fruit, including United States nuclear weapons designs \nand codes, as well as intelligence on our strategic nuclear submarine \nforce. China continued nuclear testing long after the United States \nundertook a self-imposed nuclear test moratorium in 1992. And, \nundoubtedly, it can continue secret nuclear testing without our being \nable to detect it.\n  Other threats also abound. One of the most serious is from North \nKorea, which remains in noncompliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty and is continuing to build missiles that can be used for nuclear \nweapons delivery.\n  In this uncertain world, it is not enough to simply retain a nuclear \narsenal. We need a true nuclear deterrent. A nuclear arsenal becomes a \nnuclear deterrent only when we have convinced potential enemies that we \nwill use that arsenal against them if they attack us or our allies with \nweapons of mass destruction. This means we must do two things. First, \nwe must maintain the arsenal in workable, reliable condition. Second, \nwe must clearly communicate our willingness to use the arsenal. We must \nnot forget: a weapon does not deter if your enemy knows that you won't \nuse the weapon.\n  Nuclear testing, historically, has performed both the maintenance and \ncommunications functions. Testing kept the arsenal reliable and modern. \nVery importantly, it also signaled to potential enemies that we were \nserious about nuclear deterrence.\n  Some people might argue that our nuclear arsenal is as modern as it \nwill ever need to be. I am not willing to make that argument because I \nknow I can't predict the future. I have no way of knowing what \ntechnological advances our potential enemies may make. Perhaps they \nwill make discoveries of countermeasures that make our delivery systems \noutmoded. Or, perhaps they will acquire ever more potent offenses, just \nas Iraq, Russia, and North Korea have acquired highly virulent \nbiological weapons.\n  If the future does bring new challenges to our existing arsenal, I \nthink we ought to be in a position to modernize our stockpile to meet \nthose challenges. The directors of our nuclear weapons design \nlaboratories have told us that we cannot modernize our weapons, for \nexample, to take on the threat of biological weapons unless we can \ntest. It therefore seems reasonable that we not deny ourselves the \nability to test.\n  Again, some people may argue that we should join the CTBT and then \npull out if we need to test. That would be terribly foolish. We all \nknow how politically difficult it is to pull out of a treaty, no matter \nhow strong the arguments are for doing so. It is better to not join in \nthe first place.\n  In conclusion, let me reiterate my support for keeping our nuclear \ndeterrent strong. The nuclear arsenal protects us against attacks from \nother nations that might use weapons of mass destruction against us. It \ntells them silently that the cost of any aggression is too high. We \nneed to keep sending that signal to them, and nuclear testing will help \nus do that.\n  Mr. President nuclear deterrence was crucial to U.S. and allied \nsecurity throughout the cold war, and it will be no less important in \nthe future. The enormous benefit of America's nuclear deterrent is that \nit protects U.S. interests and safeguards the peace without the use of \nforce.\n  It is clear that on several occasions, notably during the Cuban \nmissile crisis, nuclear deterrence kept the cold war from becoming a \nshooting war. Now that the cold war is over, has nuclear deterrence \nbecome less important? The answer is no. During the first conflict of \nthe post-cold-war period, the 1991 gulf war with Saddam Hussein, \nnuclear deterrence undoubtedly saved thousands, possibly tens of \nthousands of lives. How? Saddam Hussein was deterred from using his \nchemical and biological weapons because he feared the United States \nwould retaliate with nuclear weapons. That is not my interpretation of \nthe gulf war; it is what senior Iraqi leaders have said. The gulf war \nexperience illustrates that as chemical, biological and nuclear weapons \ncontinue to proliferate, the U.S. nuclear deterrent will become even \nmore vital to our security.\n  While Washington must be prepared for the possibility that nuclear \ndeterrence will not always safeguard the peace, we must safeguard our \ncapability to deter. President Clinton recognized this continuing value \nof nuclear deterrence in the White House's most recent presentation of \nU.S. national security strategy. A National Security Strategy for A New \nCentury, I quote: ``Our nuclear deterrent posture is one of the most \nvisible and important examples of how U.S. military capabilities can be \nused effectively to deter aggression and coercion . . .'' And, quote \n``The United States must continue to maintain a robust triad of \nstrategic forces sufficient to deter any hostile foreign leadership . . \n.''\n  The strategy of nuclear deterrence that for decades has played such a \ncrucial role in preserving peace without resort to war would be \ndamaged, perhaps beyond repair, in the absence of nuclear testing. Make \nno mistake, the CTBT would harm U.S. security by undermining the U.S. \nnuclear deterrent.\n  For the nuclear stockpile to underwrite deterrence it must be \ncredible to foes. That credibility requires testing. To deter hardened \naggressors who are seemingly impervious to reason, there is no \nsubstitute for nuclear testing to provide the most convincing \ndemonstration of the U.S. nuclear stockpile and U.S. will to maintain \nnuclear deterrence.\n  The strategy of nuclear deterrence also requires that U.S. leaders \nhave confidence that the nuclear stockpile will work as intended, is \nsafe and reliable. Only testing can provide that confidence to U.S. \nleaders, and to our European and Asian allies who depend on the U.S. \nnuclear deterrent for their security. In the past, nuclear testing has \nuncovered problems in given types of weapons, and also assured that \nthose problems were corrected, permitting confidence in the reliability \nof the stockpile.\n  The absence of testing would undermine both the credibility of the \nU.S. nuclear deterrent in the eyes of would-be aggressors and the \nconfidence of U.S. leaders in the strategy of nuclear deterrence.\n  In addition, an effective strategy of nuclear deterrence requires \nthat the nuclear stockpile be capable of deterring a variety of \naggressors and challenges. New and unprecedented threats to United \nStates security are emerging as a variety of hostile nations, including \nNorth Korea and Iran, develop mass destruction weapons and their \ndelivery means. The U.S. nuclear deterrent must be capable against a \nwide spectrum of potential foes, including those who are desperate and \nwilling to take grave risks. The nuclear stockpile inherited from the \ncold war is unlikely to be suited to effective deterrence across this \ngrowing spectrum of potential challengers. America's strategy of \nnuclear deterrence will become increasingly unreliable if the U.S. \nnuclear arsenal is limited to that developed for a very different time \nand challenger. Nuclear weapons of new designs inevitably will be \nnecessary; and as the directors of both nuclear weapons design\n\n[[Page S12545]]\n\nlaboratories have affirmed, nuclear testing is necessary to provide \nconfidence in the workability of any new design. In short, nuclear \ntesting is the key to confidence in the new weapons design that \ninevitably will be necessary to adapt our nuclear deterrent to a \nvariety of new challengers and circumstances.\n  Finally, the U.S. strategy of nuclear deterrence cannot be sustained \nwithout a cadre of highly trained scientists and engineers. That \ngeneration of scientists and engineers that served successfully during \nthe cold war is passing rapidly from the scene. Nuclear testing is \ncritical to recruit, train, and validate the competence of a new \ngeneration of expert to maintain America's nuclear deterrent in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, there is no credible evidence that the CTBT will \nreduce nuclear proliferation. None of the so-called ``unrecognized'' \nnuclear states--India, Pakistan and Israel--will be convinced by this \nTreaty to give up their weapons programs. Most important, those states \nthat are currently seeking nuclear weapons--including Iran, Iraq and \nNorth Korea a state that probably already has one of two nuclear \nweapons--will either not sign the Treaty or, equally likely, will sign \nand cheat. These countries have demonstrated the value they ascribe to \nall types of weapons of mass destruction and are not going to give them \nup because others pledge not to test. They also know that they do not \nneed to test in order to have confidence in first generation weapons. \nThe United States did not test the gun-assembly design of the ``little \nboy'' weapon in 1945; and the South Africans and other more recent \nproliferators did not test their early warhead designs.\n  Contrary to its advertised purpose, and in a more perverse and \nbizarre way, the CTBT could actually lead to greater proliferation not \nonly by our adversaries but also by several key allies and friends who \nhave long relied on the American nuclear umbrella as a cornerstone of \ntheir own security policy. In other words, if the CTBT were to lead to \nuncertainties that called into question the reliability of the U.S. \nnuclear deterrent, which it certainly will, the result could well be \nmore rather than less proliferation.\n  The United States has for many years relied on nuclear weapons to \nprotect and defend our core security interests. In the past, our \nnuclear weapons were the central element of our deterrent strategy. In \ntoday's world--with weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles \nincreasingly available to rogue states--they remain an indispensable \ncomponent of our national security strategy. While serving as a hedge \nagainst an uncertain future with Russia and China, United States \nnuclear weapons are also essential in meeting the new threat of \nregional states armed with weapons of mass destruction. In fact, in the \nonly contemporary experience we have with an enemy armed with chemical \nand biological weapons, there is strong evidence that our nuclear \nweapons played a vital role in deterring Saddam from using these \nweapons in a way that would have changed the face of the gulf war, and \nperhaps its outcome.\n  While the U.S. nuclear deterrent today inspires fear in the minds of \nrogue-type adversaries, U.S. nuclear capabilities will erode in the \ncontext of a CTBT. Inevitably, as both we and they watch this erosion, \nthe result will be to encourage these states to challenge our \ncommitment and resolve to respond to aggression. Much less concerned by \nthe U.S. ability--and therefore its willingness--to carry out an \noverwhelming response, they will likely pursue even more vigorously \naggression in their own neighborhoods and beyond. To support their \ngoals, these states will almost certainly seek additional and ever more \ncapable weapons of mass destruction--chemical, biological and nuclear--\nto deter American intervention with our conventional superiority. They \nmay also be more willing to employ weapons of mass destruction on the \nbattlefield in an effort to disrupt, impede, or deny the United States \nthe ability to successfully undertake military operations.\n  By calling into question the credibility of the ``extended \ndeterrent'' that our nuclear weapons provided for key allies in Europe \nand Asia, the CTBT could also spur proliferation of nuclear weapons by \nthose states who have long relied on the U.S. nuclear guarantee. For \nover half a century, the United States has successfully promoted non-\nproliferation through the reassurance of allies that their security and \nours were inseparable. U.S. nuclear weapons have always been a unique \npart of this bond. Formal allies such as Germany, Japan and South Korea \ncontinue to benefit from this protection. Should the U.S. nuclear \ndeterrent become unreliable, and should U.S. allies begin to fear for \ntheir security having lost faith in the U.S. guarantee, it is likely \nthat these states--especially those located in conflict-laden regions--\nwould revisit the question of whether they need their own national \ndeterrent capability.\n  Maintaining a reliable and credible nuclear deterrent has also \ncontributed to the reassurance of other important friends in regions of \nvital interest. For instance, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia have to date \nshown considerable restraint in light of the nuclear, chemical and \nbiological weapons proliferation in their region, in large part because \nthey see the United States as committed and capable of coming to their \ndefense. While strong security relations have encouraged Taipei and \nRiyadh to abstain from their own nuclear programs, an unreliable or \nquestionable U.S. nuclear deterrent might actually encourage nuclear \nweapons development by these states.\n  In summary, by prohibiting further nuclear testing--the very \n``proof'' of our arsenal's viability--the CTBT would call into question \nthe safety, security, and reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons, as well \nas their credibility and operational utility. Consequently, should the \nUnited States move forward with ratification of the Treaty, it is \nlikely to have the profound adverse effect of encouraging further \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This would be in the most \nfundamental way detrimental to U.S. national security objectives.\n  Mr. President, a cornerstone of arms control is the ability of the \nU.S. government to verify compliance. In U.S. bilateral agreements such \nas the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, and the Intermediate Nuclear \nForces Treaty, the Senate has insisted on provisions in the treaty that \nwould provide for a combination of cooperative measures including on-\nsite inspection, as well as independent national technical means of \nverification to monitor compliance. Such provisions have been almost \nentirely absent in multinational arms control agreements. It is not \nsurprising that international agreements such as the Biological Weapons \nConvention, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime, and the Chemical Weapons Convention are \nignored by nations whose security calculation drives them to acquire \nweapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. The CTBT is \nlikely to sustain the tradition of non-compliance we have so widely \nobserved with other multilateral arms control agreements. The problem \nwith the CTBT is particularly acute because national technical means of \nverification do not exist to verify compliance. There is some relevant \narms control history on this point.\n  In the 1980's, the United States negotiated a threshold test ban \ntreaty with the former Soviet Union, FSU. This agreement limited \nnuclear tests to a specific yield measured in equivalent explosive \nenergy in tons of TNT. Compliance with this agreement could not be \nverified by national technical means of verification. Very specific \ncooperative measures were required to render the agreement vulnerable \nto verification of compliance. Specifically, underground nuclear tests \nwere limited to designated sites, and each side was required to permit \nthe deployment of sensors in the region where tests were permitted to \nmonitor such testing. These extraordinary measures emphasize the \nlimitations of underground nuclear test monitoring. Tests that were not \nconducted at designated sites could not be reliably monitored. \nMoreover, even when we are confident we know where a test will be \nconducted, unless we have detailed knowledge of the local geological \nconditions and are able to deploy our own sensors near the site, the \nlimits of modern science--despite the billions of dollars invested in \nvarious technologies for nearly half a century--cannot verify \ncompliance with national undertakings concerning underground nuclear \ntesting.\n\n[[Page S12546]]\n\n  Since the early 1990's, Russian nuclear weapons scientists and \nengineers have been conducting experiments at a test site on the Novaya \nZemlya Island in the Russian Arctic. Because these tests are conducted \nin underground cavities, it is beyond the limits of modern scientists \nto be certain that a nuclear test has not been conducted. Two such \ntests were carried out in September according to the Washington Post in \nits report on Sunday, October 3, 1999. No one in the Department of \nEnergy, the Department of Defense, the CIA, or the White House knows \nwhat those tests were. Nor can they know. These could have been nuclear \ntests using a technique for emplacing the nuclear device in \ncircumstances that will deny us the ability to know whether or not a \nnuclear test has been carried out.\n  A technique known as ``decoupling'' is a well understood approach to \nconcealing underground nuclear tests. By suspending a nuclear device in \na large underground cavity such as a salt dome or hard rock, the \nseismic ``signal'' produced by the detonation is sharply reduced as the \nenergy from the detonation is absorbed by the rock or salt. The \nresulting ``signal'' produced by the blast of the detonation becomes \ndifficult to distinguish from natural phenomena. Because decoupling is \na simple, cheap, and reliable means of concealing nuclear tests, the \nUnited States insisted on a provision in the Threshold Test Ban Treaty \nthat underground nuclear tests could only be undertaken in specific \nagreed-upon sites. The unfeasibility of monitoring compliance with a \nCTBT if a nation decides to use decoupling techniques to conceal \nnuclear tests. This has been acknowledged by the Intelligence \nCommunity. The Community's chief scientist for the Arms Control \nIntelligence Staff, Dr. Larry Turnbull stated last year.\n  The decoupling scenario is credible for many countries for at least \ntwo reasons: First, the worldwide mining and petroleum literature \nindicates that construction of large cavities in both hard rock and \nsale is feasible with costs that would be relatively small compared to \nthose required for the production of materials for a nuclear device; \nsecond, literature and symposia indicate that containment of \nparticulate and gaseous debris is feasible in both sale and had rock.\n  The reduction in the seismic ``signal'' can diminish the apparent \nyield of a nuclear device by as much as a factor of 70. The \neffectiveness of concealment measures means that potential \nproliferators can develop the critical primary stage of a thermonuclear \n(hydrogen) weapon. It can do so with the knowledge that science does \nnot permit detection of a decoupled nuclear test in a manner that will \npermit verification of compliance with a CTBT or any other bilateral or \nmultilateral arms control agreement intended to restrain nuclear \ntesting.\n  How much risk must the United States continued to be exposed by these \nill-thought out multilateral arms control agreements? We have been \nreminded of this problem recently. The Biological Weapons Convention \nhas been advertised by the same people now advocating the CTBT to be a \nsuccessful example of a universally subscribed codification of the \nrejection of biological weapons by the international community. What \nhas happened in the three decades since its ratification? The treaty \nhas in fact, been widely violated. Two dozen nations have covert \nbiological weapons programs. The arms control community--recognizing \nthe treaty's fundamentally flawed character--is now seeking to ``put \ntoothpaste back in the tube'' by attempting to negotiate verification \nprovisions 30 years after the fact. We know from the report of the \nRumsfeld Commission last year that the technology of nuclear weapons \nhas been widely disseminated--abetted by the declassification policies \nof the Department of Energy. The problem of nuclear proliferation is \nnow beyond the grasp of arms control. Other measures to protect \nAmerican security and the security of its allies from its consequences \nnow must be identified, considered, and implemented. We simply have to \nface the fact that compliance with the CTBT cannot be verified and no \n``fix'' is possible to save it. The scope and pace of the consequences \nof nuclear proliferation will be magnified if the CTBT is verified.\n  Mr. President, when Ronald Reagan said ``trust but verify'' he \nexpressed what most Americans feel about arms control treaties that \nlimit the tools of U.S. national security. They know we will abide \nscrupulously by our legal obligations and would like to live in a world \nwhere others do the same. But since we do not live in such a world, \nthey expect us to avoid treaties whose verification standards are less \ndemanding than our own compliance standards.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty now before us for advice and \nconsent would be a radical departure from traditional U.S. approaches \nto the cessation of nuclear testing. Despite its superficial \nattractiveness there are two enduring reasons why no previous \nadministration has ever advocated a permanent, zero-yield test ban. The \nfirst is that we've never apologized for relying on low yield \nunderground tests to assure the safety and reliability of our nuclear \ndeterrent.\n  Others and I will have more to say about that issue, but right now I \nwill focus on the second reason we've never catered to the anti-nuclear \nsentiments behind a zero-yield test ban. In the 1950's--when \ninternational nuclear disarmament really was a stated objective of U.S. \npolicy--President Eisenhower's ``comprehensive'' test ban applied to \ntests above four or five kilotons. But after studying it for a few \nyears he turned instead to nonproliferation and limited test ban \nproposals because he realized he could not assure verification of a \ntest ban even at that threshold.\n  We understood back then that cheating would allow an adversary to \nmodernize new weapons and confirm the reliability of existing ones. We \nknew we would never exploit verification loopholes for military \nadvantage but were less sanguine about the forbearance of others. We \nknew that monitoring, detecting, and identifying noncompliance, let \nalone verifying it under international legal standards, was beyond our \ntechnical, diplomatic, and legal limits, and we were honest enough to \nsay so.\n  And yet today we are told verification methods are good enough to \nenforce compliance by others with a permanent zero-yield test ban while \nwe pursue unconstrained nuclear weapons modernization by other means \nourselves. Mr. President, I know that science has not stood still over \nthe past 40-plus years. Our monitoring methods have no doubt improved. \nBut does that mean that from now until forever we can verify any \nnuclear test of any magnitude, conducted by anyone, anywhere? And--if \nwe could--that we would be equipped to do something about it? The \nadministration wisely stops short of such absolute claims, but asserts \nnevertheless that international verification methods are adequate for \nthis treaty.\n  So I have to ask is it our means of detection and verification or our \nstandards of foreign compliance that have ``evolved'' over the past 44 \nyears? I realize that perfect verification is unachievable. The U.S. is \nparty to many treaties--some good, some bad--that are less than 100% \nverifiable. But the administration's belief--that this CTBT is so \nimportant that we should bind ourselves forever to its terms anyway--\ndoes not flow logically from that premise.\n  Previous administration have proposed bans on nuclear tests above \ncertain yields despite sub-optimal means of monitoring compliance by \nappealing to their ``effective'' rather than ``foolproof'' verification \nprovisions. The Carter administration employed that standard to promote \na ten-year ban on tests above two kilotons. They knew a lower threshold \nwould stretch credulity despite the seemingly infinite elasticity of \n``effective verification.''\n  Mr. President, ``effective verification'' is an intentionally vague \npolitical term-of-art, but as the old saying goes, we all ``know it \nwhen we see it.'' for the CTBT, it should mean we have high confidence \nthat we can detect within hours or days any clandestine nuclear test \nthat would provide a cheater with militarily significant weapons \ninformation.\n  If the administration attaches a different meaning to the term, we \nare entitled to know that. If not, we are entitled to know precisely \nwhat nuclear tests yields do provide militarily significant \ninformation, and whether the CTBT's verification system can detect them \ndown to that level.\n\n[[Page S12547]]\n\n  As they are pondering those questions, permit me to offer some \nassistance. Those who test new weapons and track the deterioration of \nold ones will tell you that Carter's two-kiloton threshold would have \npermitted scientifically valuable U.S. nuclear tests (which Clinton's \nCTBT would disallow) bearing directly on the reliability of our nuclear \ndeterrent.\n  So, let me rephrase the question. Let's say evidence suggests a \nforeign test in, say, Novaya Zemlya, North Korea, Iran's territorial \nwaters, or somewhere near the Tibetan mountains. Let's say it indicates \nan explosion of five kilotons--250 percent of what Carter would have \nallowed. Let's say the test did not take place in a ``decoupled'' \ncavity and, unlike the Pakistani test of May 1998, that the suspect \nstate did not disable in-country seismic stations.\n  Now, will the IMS reliably detect that test within hours or days with \nhigh confidence? Will is promptly identify the test and its precise \nlocation? Will it quickly differentiate it from mining excavations and \nplant disasters?\n  And if it does: Will the requisite 30 members of the 51-member CTBT \nExecutive Council immediately support an on-site inspection on the \nbasis of that IMS input?\n  Will the Executive Council issue an inspection request even if the \nstate in question was the last one inspected and cannot be challenged \nconsecutively?\n  With the alleged cheater welcome a team of top caliber experts and \nescort them to the suspected location promptly on the basis of that \ninput?\n  Will inspectors be allowed to use state-of-the-art inspection \nequipment in and around all suspect facilities on the basis of that \ninput?\n  Let's say the IMS and Executive Council overcome all of those \nimpediments and call for an on site inspection of the suspected state. \nNow, do you suppose a state that conducted a clandestine nuclear test \nmight be prepared to exercise any of the following rights explicitly \ngranted under the CTBT's ``managed access'' principle:\n  Deny entry to the inspection team [88(c)]? Refuse to allow \nrepresentatives of the United States (as the challenging state) to \naccompany the inspectors [61(a)]? Delay inspectors' entry for up to 72 \nhours after arrival [57]? Permanently exclude a given individual from \nany inspections [22]? Veto the inspection team's use of particular \nequipment [51]? Declare buildings off-limits to inspectors [88(a); \n89(d)]? Declare several four-square-kilometer sites off-limits to \ninspectors? [89(e); 92; 96]? Shroud sensitive displays, stores, or \nequipment [89(a)]? Disallow collection/analysis of samples to determine \nthe presence or absence of radioactive products [89(c)]?\n  Mr. President, even if we truly believe that in certain cases, \nworking diligently under CTBT rules, each of these impediments can be \nsurmounted, I must ask:\n  Would it really be worth it for 5 kilotons? What if comparable events \narise days, weeks, or months apart? What if new information bearing on \nthe event arises after the elaborate inspection process has run its \ncourse? What if we develop comparable suspicions of the same state \nfrequently? How many of these would it take before the United States is \nbranded as a ``pest'' by the anti-nuclear crowd that is pushing this \ntreaty? What if only our friends agree with our judgments? Or, perish \nthe thought, if even our ``friends'' don't? How many pointless, \nfrustrating, inconclusive OSI exercises would have to proceed our \nexercise of ``Safeguard F'' withdrawal rights?\n  In short, Mr. President, the CTBT is long on President Reagan's \n``trust'' requirement, but fatally short on his ``verify'' requirement. \nI don't see how a single Senator can vote in favor of its ratification.\n  Mr. President, I want to clarify a point in regard to the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and to set the record straight \nconcerning the heritage of the treaty that the Senate is now \nconsidering.\n  The treaty before the Senate is not, as some have led us to believe, \nthe product of nine administrations. Certainly Ronald Reagan, George \nBush, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, and Dwight D. Eisenhower have no ties \nto this treaty. And, the administrations of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon \nJohnson and Jimmy Carter's never proposed this treaty. The fact is, no \nother administration has any tie whatsoever to the treaty that is being \nconsidered by the Senate. The administration would like you to think \nthat the treaty has had decades of support. Not so. This treaty is all \nBill Clinton's. No other administration has ever supported a zero \nyield, unlimited duration nuclear test ban treaty barring all tests.\n  Well, they'll say, the idea of limiting nuclear testing has been \nendorsed since the Eisenhower administration. Well, that may be, but \nsupporting an idea and endorsing the specifics of a concrete proposal \nare two different things. President Clinton and I both support tax \ncuts. We both support missile defense. We even both say we're for \nmaintaining a strong nuclear deterrent. It's in examining the specific \ntax cuts, missile defense proposals, and methods of maintaining our \nnuclear security that we differ.\n  President Eisenhower's name has been invoked here a number of times \nby Members supportive of the treaty. The implication is that Eisenhower \nis somehow the father of the CTBT. A review of the historical record \nreveals that President Eisenhower's administration proposed a test ban \nonly of limited duration. Eisenhower only supported the test moratorium \nthat began in 1958 because he was assured that the moratorium would \nretain American nuclear superiority and freeze the Soviets in an \ninferior position. He was very clear that the United States had to \nmaintain a nuclear edge both in quality and quantity. I believe \nPresident Eisenhower would not have supported a treaty that gave others \nan advantage, as this treaty clearly does.\n  President Kennedy's views of a nuclear test ban were much the same as \nEisenhower's. He did not support a zero yield test ban. In fact, \nhydronuclear tests were conducted secretly in the Nevada desert during \nPresident Kennedy's administration. He also did not support a ban of \nunlimited duration. Kennedy broke out of the testing moratorium after \nthe Soviet Union tested on September 1, 1961. At that time the world \nwas shocked that the Soviets were able to begin an aggressive series of \n60 tests within 30 days. Equally shocking was the realization that the \nSoviets had been planning for the tests for at least six months, while \nat the same time negotiating with the United States to extend the test \nmoratorium. The Kennedy and Johnson administrations did agree to the \nLimited Test Ban Treaty which banned nuclear blasts in the atmosphere, \nspace, or under water, but not underground as the CTBT does.\n  President Nixon did not seek to ban nuclear tests, although he agreed \nto limit tests above 150 kilotons.\n  James Schlesinger, President Jimmy Carter's Secretary of Energy tell \nus that President Carter only sought a 10-year treaty and sought to \nallow tests of up to two kilotons.\n  Presidents Reagan and Bush did not pursue a comprehensive test ban of \nany kind or duration. Some point to President Bush's signing of the \nHatfield/Exon/Mitchell legislation limiting the United States to a \nseries of 15 underground tests before entering a ban on testing as \nevidence that President Bush supported this comprehensive test ban \ntreaty. This is not correct. On the day he left office, President Bush \nrepudiated the Hatfield legislation and called for continuation of \nunderground nuclear testing. He said, I quote,\n\n       The administration strongly urges Congress to modify this \n     legislation urgently in order to permit the minimum number \n     and kind of underground nuclear tests that the United States \n     requires, regardless of the action of other states, to retain \n     safe, reliable, although dramatically reduced deterrent \n     forces.\n\n  That brings us to the Clinton administration. Only President Clinton \nhas sought a zero yield, unlimited duration treaty, and he has not even \nheld that position for the entirety of his administration. For the \nfirst 2\\1/2\\ years, this administration pursued a treaty that would \nallow some level of low yield testing. As recently as 1995, the \nDepartment of Defense position was that it could support a CTBT only if \ntests of up to 500 tons were permitted. As a concession to the non-\nnuclear states, the Clinton administration dropped that proviso and \nagreed to a zero yield test ban.\n  This treaty has no historical lineage. It is from start to finish \nPresident Clinton's treaty.\n\n[[Page S12548]]\n\n  Mr. President, proponents of the CTBT are fond of pointing out that \npublic opinion is strongly in favor of the treaty. This is not \nparticularly a surprise because, in general, Americans support treaties \nthat have been signed by their President. They assume that the U.S. \nGovernment would not participate in a treaty that is not in the \nnation's interest.\n  In this regard, I would like to make two points. First, the American \npublic overwhelmingly supports maintenance of a strong U.S. nuclear \ndeterrent. If people are given the facts about the importance of \nnuclear testing to that deterrent, I believe that their view of the \nCTBT would change dramatically. Second, the CTBT indeed is not in the \nnation's interests and it is up to us, as leaders, to explain to the \npeople why. Let me first address Americans' attitudes toward their \nnuclear deterrent.\n  In June, 1998, the Public Policy Institute of the University of New \nMexico truly non-partisan and professional groups conducted a \nnationwide poll on public views on security issues. Let me give you a \nfew results of that poll:\n  Seventy-three percent view it as important or extremely important for \nthe U.S. to retain nuclear weapons today.\n  Sixty-six percent view U.S. nuclear weapons as integral to \nmaintaining U.S. status as a world leader.\n  Seventy percent say that our nuclear weapons are important for \npreventing other countries from using nuclear weapons against our \ncountry.\n  More than 70 percent say that it is important for the U.S. to remain \na military superpower, with 45 percent saying that it is extremely \nimportant that we remain so.\n  Now, we all know that the measure of commitment to a given aim can \nsometimes best be gauged by willingness to spend money to achieve it. \nThe poll asked, ``Should Government increase spending to maintain \nexisting nuclear weapons in reliable condition?'' Fifty-seven percent \nsupport increased spending and 15 percent support present spending \nlevels.\n  I will return to the subject of public opinion in a moment, but let \nme turn briefly to the issue of whether this treaty is in the nation's \ninterest. If there were a test ban, we would not be able to know with \ncertainty whether our nuclear weapons are as safe and reliable as they \ncan be. On the other hand, Russia, China, and others might be able to \ncontinue nuclear testing without being detected. This is because the \nCTBT is simply not verifiable. What do you think the American people \nwould think about that? Well, we have some data to tell us.\n  The University of New Mexico's poll asked: ``If a problem develops \nwith U.S. nuclear weapons, is it important for the United States to be \nable to conduct nuclear test explosions to fix the problem?'' Fifty-\nfour percent of the people said yes. Only 15.5 percent said no. The \nrest were undecided.\n  The poll also asked, ``How important do you think it is for the \nUnited States to be able to detect cheating by other countries on arms \ncontrol treaties such as the comprehensive nuclear test ban? Over 80 \npercent said that it was important, with 40 percent saying that it is \nextremely important.\n  The bottom line here is that the American people want us to retain a \nstrong nuclear deterrent. While they will also support good arms \ncontrol measures, they expect the American leadership to do whatever is \nnecessary to keep the deterrent strong. Let's not be fooled by \nsimplistic yes-or-no answers to questions about the CTBT. This issue is \nmore complex than that. We must simply give people the facts about this \ntreaty. The CTBT would imperil our security.\n  I urge a vote against this treaty.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Does the Senator from Delaware have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 1 minute 6 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I do not wish to be the last to speak. I would like to use \nthat 1 minute and ask unanimous consent that my friend be allowed to \nuse any additional time he may want to use after that, because it is \nappropriate he should close.\n  I want to make a point in the minute I have.\n  This is about, as the Senator has honestly stated, more than the CTBT \nTreaty. It is about ending the regime of arms control. That is what \nthis is about. If this fails, I ask you the question: Is there any \npossibility of amending the ABM Treaty? Is there any possibility of the \nSTART II or START III agreements coming into effect with regard to \nRussia? Is there any possibility of arms control surviving?\n  I think this is about arms control, not just about this treaty. I \nappreciate my friend's candor. That is one of the reasons I think it is \nsuch a devastating vote.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time. And I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator from North Carolina be given an appropriate amount of \ntime to respond, if he wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the yeas and nays have been ordered; is \nthat right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, they have.\n  Mr. HELMS. Let's vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution \nto advise and consent to ratification of Treaty Document No. 105-28, \nthe Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. On this question, the yeas \nand nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD (when his name was called).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Warner-\nMoynihan letter to the Majority and Minority leaders dated October 12, \n1999, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott\n     Majority Leader.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle\n     Democratic Leader.\n\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leaders: The Senate Leadership has received a \n     letter from President Clinton requesting ``that you postpone \n     consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on the \n     Senate Floor.'' We write in support of putting off final \n     consideration until the next Congress.\n       Were the Treaty to be voted on today, Senator Warner and \n     Senator Lugar would be opposed. Senator Moynihan and Senator \n     Biden\n\n[[Page S12549]]\n\n     would be in support. But we all agree on seeking a delay. We \n     believe many colleagues are of a like view, irrespective of \n     how they would vote at this point.\n       We recognize that the Nation's best interests, the Nation's \n     vital business, is and must always be the first concern of \n     the Presidency and the Congress.\n       But we cannot foresee at this time an international crisis \n     of the magnitude, that would persuade the Senate to revisit a \n     decision made now to put off a final consideration of the \n     Treaty until the 107th Congress.\n       However, we recognize that throughout history the Senate \n     has had the power, the duty to reconsider prior decisions.\n       Therefore, if Leadership takes under consideration a joint \n     initiative to implement the President's request--and our \n     request--for a delay, then we commit our support for our \n     Leaders taking this statesmanlike initiative.\n\n\n                              republicans\n\n       Warner, Lugar, Roth, Domenici, Hagel, Gordon Smith, \n     Collins, McCain, Snowe, Sessions, Stevens, Chafee, Brownback, \n     Bennett, Jeffords, Grassley, DeWine, Specter, Hatch, \n     Voinovich, Gorton, Burns, Gregg, Santorum.\n\n\n                               democrats\n\n       Moynihan, Biden, Lieberman, Levin, Feingold, Kohl, Boxer, \n     Cleland, Dodd, Wyden, Rockefeller, Bingaman, Inouye, Baucus, \n     Hollings, Kennedy, Harry Reid, Robb, Jack Reed.\n       Mikulski, Torricelli, Feinstein, Schumer, Breaux, Bob \n     Kerrey, Evan Bayh, John Kerry, Landrieu, Murray, Tim Johnson, \n     Byrd, Lautenberg, Harkin, Durbin, Leahy, Wellstone, Akaka, \n     Edwards.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate can and should always act as the \nconscience of the Nation. Historians may well say that we did not vote \non this treaty today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the United States Senate fulfilled its \nconstitutional responsibility by voting on the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest Ban Treaty. Under the Constitution, the President and the Senate \nare co-equal partners when it comes to treaty-making powers. Positive \naction by both branches is required before a treaty can become the \nsupreme law of the land. All Americans should know that I and my \ncolleagues take this solemn responsibility with great pride, and we are \nvery diligent in making sure that our advice and consent to treaties is \ntreated with the utmost consideration and seriousness.\n  The Senate does not often refuse to ratify treaties, as borne out by \nthe historical record. But the fact that the Senate has rejected \nseveral significant treaties this century underscores the important \n``quality control'' function that was intended by the Framers of the \nConstitution. The Founding Fathers never envisioned the Senate would be \na rubber stamp for flawed treaties. I and my colleagues would never \nallow this venerable institution to be perceived as--much less actually \nbecome--a mere rubber stamp for agreements negotiated by this or any \nother President. Instead, the Senate must dissect and debate every \ntreaty to ensure that it adequately protects and promotes American \nsecurity interests. The American people expect no less.\n  As has been pointed out by numerous experts before the Foreign \nRelations, Armed Services, and Intelligence Committees, and by many \nSenators in extended floor debate, this treaty does not meet even the \nminimal standards of previous arms control treaties. That is, it is \nineffectual--even dangerous, in my judgment; it is unverifiable; and it \nis unenforceable. As one of my distinguished colleagues put it: ``the \nCTBT is not of the same caliber as the arms control treaties that have \ncome before the Senate in recent decades.''\n  This treaty is ineffectual because it would not stop other nations \nfrom testing or developing nuclear weapons, but it could preclude the \nUnited States from taking appropriate steps to ensure the safety and \nreliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. That it is not effectively \nverifiable is made clear by the intelligence community's inability to \nstate unequivocally the purpose of activities underway for some number \nof months at the Russian nuclear test site. Just last week, it was \nclear that they could not assure us that low-level testing was not \ntaking place. The CTBT simply has no teeth.\n  Had the President consulted with more Senators before making the \ndecision in 1995 to pursue an unverifiable, unlimited-duration, zero-\nyield ban on testing, he would have known that such a treaty could not \nbe ratified. If he had talked at that time to Senator Warner, to \nSenator Kyl, to Senator Lugar, to any number of Senators, and to \nSenator Helms, he could have been told that this was not a verifiable \ntreaty and that it was not the safe thing to do for our country.\n  I know some will ask, so what happens next? The first thing that must \nbe done is to begin a process to strengthen U.S. nuclear deterrence so \nthat no one--whether potential adversary or ally--comes away from these \ndeliberations with doubts about the credibility of the U.S. nuclear \narsenal.\n  To this end, I have written to Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen asking \nthat he initiate a comprehensive review of the state of the U.S. \nnuclear weapons stockpile, infrastructure, management, personnel, \ntraining, delivery systems, and related matters. The review would \nencompass activities under the purview of the Department of Defense and \nthe new, congressionally mandated National Nuclear Security \nAdministration. The objective of this review would be to identify ways \nthe administration and Congress jointly can strengthen our nuclear \ndeterrent in the coming decades, for example, by providing additional \nresources to the Stockpile Stewardship Program on which Senator \nDomenici is so diligently working, and that exists at our nuclear \nweapons labs and production plants. I have offered to work with \nSecretary Cohen on the establishment and conduct of such a review, and \nI hope Secretary Cohen will promptly agree to my request.\n  Second, the Senate should undertake a major survey of the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and associated means of \ndelivery as we approach the new millennium. A key aspect of this review \nshould be an assessment of whether or to what extent U.S. policies and \nactions (or inactions) contributed to the heightened proliferation that \nhas occurred over the past 7 years. We know that from North Korea to \nIran and Iraq, from China to Russia, and from India to Pakistan, the \nnext President will be forced to confront a strategic landscape that in \nmany ways is far more hostile and dangerous than that which President \nClinton inherited in January, 1993. I call upon the relevant committees \nof jurisdiction in the Senate to properly initiate such a survey and \nplan to complete action within the next 180 days.\n\n  Finally, I am aware that the administration claims that rejection of \nthe CTBT could damage U.S. prestige and signal a blow to our \nleadership. American leadership is vital in the world today but with \nleadership comes responsibility. We have a responsibility to ensure \nthat any arms control agreements presented to the Senate for advice and \nconsent are both clearly in America's security interests and \neffectively verifiable. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty failed on \nboth of these crucial tests.\n  Today, among many other telephone conversations I had, I talked to \nformer Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, a man for whom I have the \nhighest regard, a man who gave real leadership when he was at the \nDepartment of Defense, a man who would never advocate a position not in \nthe best national security interests of the United States or in support \nof our international reputation. He told me he was convinced the treaty \nwas fatally flawed, that it should be defeated, and in fact it would \nsend a clear message to our treaty negotiators and people around the \nworld that treaties that are not verifiable, that are not properly \nconcluded, will not be ratified by the Senate. We will take our \nresponsibility seriously and we will defeat bad treaties when it is in \nthe best interest of our country, our allies, and more importantly for \nme, our children and their future.\n  I think we have taken the right step today. I note that this vote \nturned out to be a rather significant vote: 51 Senators voted against \nthis treaty. Not even a majority was for this treaty. To confirm a \ntreaty or ratify a treaty takes, of course, a two-thirds vote, 67 \nvotes. They were not here. They were never here. This treaty should not \nhave been pushed for the past 2 years. It was not ready for \nconsideration and it was unverifiable and therefore would not be \nratified.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \nparticipation. I\n\n[[Page S12550]]\n\nthought the debate was spirited. It was good on both sides of the \naisle. I appreciate the advice and counsel I received on all sides as \nwe have gone through this process. It has not been easy but it is part \nof the job. I take this job very seriously. I take this vote very \nseriously. For today, Mr. President, we did the right thing for \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12550-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, before I yield the floor to the managers of \nthis legislation, let me announce that there will be no further \nrollcall votes this evening. Tomorrow morning we hope to consider the \nDefense appropriations conference report under a short time agreement. \nHowever, that rollcall vote will be postponed to occur at 4 p.m. We \nwill then resume consideration of the campaign finance reform bill on \nThursday, and I hope that substantial progress can be made on that bill \nduring tomorrow's session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I mention to the majority leader it is now \nnearly 7:25 p.m. and at the request of the majority leader and the \nSenator from Kentucky, he wants to begin the debate and discussion on \nthis very important issue. The agreement that the majority leader and I \nhave is we will have 5 days of debate and discussion. I certainly hope \nhe doesn't consider starting at 7:25 as a day of the debate and \ndiscussion. I ask him that.\n  Second, this is a very important issue. Even the staff is gone. Most \nMembers have gone. The Senate majority leader knows that. Tomorrow we \nhave scheduled a DOD discussion and vote which would be the first \ninterruption--although we have just gotten started--followed by a vote \non the Department of Defense appropriations bill. That could have been \nscheduled tonight and the vote have taken place.\n  I hope the majority leader will understand that I will not make an \nopening statement tonight. I will wait until tomorrow so I have the \nattention of my colleagues. If the Senator from Kentucky wants to make \nhis statement, that is fine. I know from discussions with the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin he chooses to do the same thing.\n  I don't think an issue such as this should be initiated at 7:30 in \nthe evening. However, I want to assure Senator Lott that, once we have \nopening statements and once we get into the amending process and votes, \nI will be glad to stay as late as is necessary every night including \nall through the weekend, if necessary.\n  I don't think it is appropriate for anyone to say we demand opening \nstatements tonight on the issue, and then tomorrow morning we go back \nto another bill off of the issue at hand. I hope the majority leader, \nwho has been very cooperative in helping me and has been very \ncooperative in bringing up this issue, understands my point of view on \nthis particular issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona, all I was hoping we \ncould do, since this session of Congress is getting short and we have, \nin response to the requests of both the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Wisconsin, taken this issue up this year in a way in which \npeople can offer amendments, maybe we could at least get an amendment \nlaid down tonight. Maybe there is a possibility of getting some kind of \ntime agreement on an amendment for tomorrow so we can get into the \ndebate.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona; I don't think there is any \nneed for opening statements tonight. I am not planning on making one, \nbut we desire to get started because we have a lot of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle desiring to offer amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. So I can respond to comments of both Senators, and \nparticularly for questions I was asked by Senator McCain, I had a \nfixation on trying to get started on this bill today because I had \ncommitted to do so. I realize it is late, but I am sure the Senator \nunderstands how difficult it is to juggle the schedule.\n  We had originally thought the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would be \nvoted on not today but last night or certainly earlier today. I am \ntrying to juggle the appropriations conference reports, too. I was \nspecifically asked by a couple of Senators to have the debate in the \nmorning and then to have the vote at 4 o'clock.\n\n  Later this week, we have to have an interruption for the HUD-VA \nappropriations conference report. Next week, we will have to have \ninterruptions for the Interior appropriations conference report. I have \nto keep bringing in the appropriations bills. I realize that it \ninterrupts the flow of the debate. However, that is why I have learned \naround here the best thing to do is to get something going and just get \nstarted, get it up so it is the pending business, and we go about our \nbusiness.\n  I took particular interest in the Senator's offer that maybe we even \nconsider doing this on the weekend or maybe a Saturday. I think it \nwould get a lot of attention. We are getting down to the end of the \nsession and I have a lot of people pulling on me to do the Religious \nPersecution Act, the nuclear waste bill, bankruptcy, and trade bills. I \nneed to try to take advantage even of a couple of hours on Wednesday \nnight if we possibly can.\n  If both Senators are willing to at least get started, see if we can \nget an agreement, see if we can have opening statements, let's get \nstarted and we will be back on it at 10:30 in the morning. I will work \nwith both or all sides to make sure this is fully debated and \namendments are offered. Remember, we are going to have amendments and \nwe are going to have a lot of discussion. We are going to have a lot of \nvotes. I think it is time to go forward. I hope the Senator will \ncooperate with me as we try to get that done.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me say to the majority leader, I am in \ndeep and sincere appreciation of his efforts to resolve all of these \nissues and the pending legislation. I remind him, however, that some \nmonths ago we did enter into an agreement that we would have 5 days of \ndebate and amending on the bill. I know the majority leader will stick \nto that agreement. Starting at 7:30 at night is not, obviously, a day \nof debate and discussion. I understand we may have to be interrupted. \nHowever, I also say again we expect to have the agreement adhered to.\n  I am deeply concerned about nuclear waste and religious freedom and \nall of the other issues, but we did have an agreement on this \nparticular issue. I intend to see that we can do our best to adhere to \nthat agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. I say to the Senator, we will proceed on Carroll County, \nMS, time. Do you understand that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi. I am glad to \nentertain whatever proposal the Senator from Kentucky has at this time. \nI intend, along with the Senator from Wisconsin, to wait until tomorrow \nfor our\n\n[[Page S12551]]\n\nopening statements. I know there are a number of other Senators who \nwant to make opening statements on this very important issue.\n  I am sure whatever agreement the Senator from Kentucky and I, along \nwith the Senator from Wisconsin, might want to enter into would clearly \ntake into consideration that there will be a number of opening \nstatements that a number of Senators will have to make.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I certainly have no objection to the Senator from \nKentucky laying down an amendment. Before he does that, I do make one \ncomment on the colloquy I just listened to.\n  It is my understanding, based on the agreement we have with the \nmajority leader--I just want to reiterate what Senator McCain said--\nthat this was to be a 5-day debate. The critical issue here is on what \nday the cloture motion can be filed. It is certainly my understanding, \nbased on the discussion we just had, the cloture motion can't be filed \nuntil Monday, meaning the cloture vote couldn't occur before Wednesday. \nThat is how I am going to proceed, and I assume that is the good faith \nunderstanding.\n  This agreement was not hammered out of pure good faith. This was \nbased, as it should be in the Senate, on our willingness to withdraw an \namendment from a piece of legislation at another critical time when the \nSenate's business was pressing.\n  I certainly intend to give an opening statement. This bill is not \ndifferent from any other major piece of legislation. In fact, I argue \nit is one of the most important bills we can take up. It is important \nit be set out properly, and I certainly intend to make an opening \nstatement tomorrow as well.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent the following staff members be \npermitted the privilege of the floor during the consideration of S. \n1593, campaign finance reform legislation: Bob Schiff, Mary Murphy, \nKitty Thomas, Tom Walls, Sumner Slichter, and Marla Kanemitsu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the interest of moving this \nappropriations bill forward, I will withdraw my amendment to increase \nthe funding for the successful GEAR-UP program. However, I urge the \nconferees to fund this program at $240 million--- $60 million over the \nSenate bill--so that now needy students can get the support they need \nto attend college.\n  More than 130,000 students will be denied services if GEAR UP is \nfunded at $180 million rather than at the President's request of $240 \nmillion. $154 million is needed just to fully fund continuation grants \nfor this year's grantees. We must uphold our commitment to these \nstudents, and extend the opportunity that this program offers to every \nneedy student.\n  This year, 678 applications for both state and local partnerships \nwere received and we were only able to fund 185--only 1 out of 4 \napplications. We have to do more to help children early so that college \nis accessible for every child.\n  Many low-income families do not know how to plan for college, often \nbecause they have not done it before. We should do more to ensure that \nschools and communities can provide the academic support, early college \nawareness activities, and information on financial aid and scholarships \nso that students and their families can plan for a better future. We \nmust encourage our young people to have high expectations, to stay in \nschool, and to take the necessary courses so that they can succeed in \ncollege. We cannot abandon the five-year commitment that we made to \nthese families last year.\n  I commend my colleagues on the appropriations committee for making \nhard choices between important programs.

A bill for the relief of Mrs. Ruth Hairston of Carson, \nCalifornia by the waiver of a filing deadline for appeal from a ruling \nrelating to her application for a survivor annuity; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today legislation \nto assist Mrs. Ruth Hairston, of Carson, California. Identical \nlegislation has passed the House without objection under the \nsponsorship of Representative Juanita Millender-McDonald. I am pleased \nto support this effort in the Senate.\n  Mrs. Hairston requires this extreme step in order to be able to \npursue a federal court appeal of the Merit Systems Protection Board (# \nCSF 2221413), which denied Mrs. Hairston's eligibility for an annuity \nfollowing the retirement and untimely death of her former husband. The \nlegislation does not require the annuity, but will only permit the \nfiling of an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals. As a \nresult, Mrs. Hairston will be permitted to challenge the denial on the \nmerits, rather than accept the denial due to the failure to file an \nappeal within thirty days.\n  I would briefly like to describe the facts that warrant this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Paul Hairston retired in 1980, electing a survivor annuity for \nMrs. Hairston to receive one-half the retirement benefit under the \nsettlement terms. Mr. and Mrs. Hairston began receiving benefits in \n1988.\n  The Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews Civil Service \nretirement claims, concluded Mr. Hairston had failed to register Mrs. \nHairston for survivors benefits following passage of 1985 law, renewing \nthe survivor annuity previously selected in 1985. As a result the \nspousal survivor benefits for Mrs. Hairston were canceled. Following \nMr. Hairston's death in 1995, Mrs. Hairston's benefits, her portion of \nhis retirement benefit under the divorce settlement, ceased. Mrs. \nHairston was denied eligibility as a surviving spouse, but did not \nchallenge or appeal the denial of eligibility, due to hospitalization \nand poor health.\n  I am pleased to introduce this private legislation to assist my \nconstituent Mrs. Ruth Hairston. While this legislation represents an \nextraordinary measure, the step is necessary in order to permit her to \nappeal the denial of eligibility by the Merit Systems Protection Board \nin federal court. As I have previously stated, this legislation does \nnot require any specific outcome. The federal court will review the \nappeal with all the rigor the case deserves. However, Mrs. Hairston \nwill receive her day in court and the opportunity to challenge the \ndecision by the Merit Systems Protection Board to deny her eligibility.\n  I understand Mrs. Hairston is under considerable financial pressure \nand could face foreclosure on her home. I am pleased to try to assist \nMrs. Hairston in her appeal. Mr. President, I hope you and the \nsubcommittee will support this bill so that Mrs. Hairston may begin to \nrebuild her life.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL:\n  S. 1721. A bill to provide protection for teachers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the teacher liability protection act of 1999\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nTeacher Liability Protection Act of 1999. This legislation provides \nlimited immunity for teachers, principals and other education \nprofessionals who take reasonable measures to maintain order and \ndiscipline in America's schools and classrooms in order to create a \npositive education environment. In other words, it allows teachers to \ndo what is necessary to provide an environment conducive to learning \nwithout fear of being sued. This bill allows teachers to control their \nclassrooms. It allows teachers to teach.\n  The ability of teachers and principals to teach, inspire and shape \nthe intellect of our Nation's students is hindered by frivolous \nlawsuits and litigation. By creating a national standard for protecting \nteachers and education professionals through limited civil liability \nimmunity, we allow teachers to teach, and we help our children to \nlearn.\n  Mr. President, we must give educators the resources they need to \neducate our children, and these resources include the legal protection \nnecessary to do their job and maintain a safe classroom. Principals \nmust be able to control the schools, teachers must be able to control \nclassrooms. Unruly and unmanageable children must not be allowed to \nendanger, intimidate or harm other students. It is our responsibility, \nas members of the United States Senate, to give teachers the legal \nprotections necessary to provide a safe learning environment for all \nchildren in their care. We must give teachers the freedom they need to \nresponsibly handle potentially dangerous situations without the fear of \nfrivolous legal reprisals.\n  Based on the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, which I introduced and \nwhich was signed into law, the Teacher Liability Protection Act would \ncreate a national standard to protect every teacher in the country, but \nwould not override any state law that provides greater immunity or \nliability protection. This bill recognizes the authority of the states \non these matters and allows them to opt out of the coverage and provide \nteachers with a higher or lower level of liability protection if they \nso choose.\n  This bill also recognizes that millions of parents across the nation \ndepend upon teachers, principals and other school professionals for the \neducational development of their children. it affirms the fact that \nmost teachers are hard-working professionals who care deeply for our \nchildren and go to extraordinary lengths to help them learn. However, \nthis bill does not protect a teacher when he or she engages in wanton \nand willful misconduct, a criminal act or violations of State and\n\n[[Page S12556]]\n\nFederal civil rights laws. It simply protects teachers who undertake \nreasonable actions to maintain order, discipline and an appropriate \nlearning environment as the public and society expect them to do.\n  I invite my colleagues to support this important and meaningful \nlegislation and to give our Nation's teachers the freedom they need to \neducate our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1722. A bill to amend the Mineral Leasing Act to increase the \nmaximum acreage of Federal leases for sodium that may be held by an \nentity in any 1 State, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  trona market competition act of 1999\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nrevises an outdated and constricting statute for the number of federal \nsodium leases which can be held by any single producer within a state. \nThis limitation is damaging the economic viability of an environmental \nresponsible and critical mining industry for our country. The soda ash \nindustry has been operating under the present acreage limitation for \nfive decades. This cap for lease holdings is the oldest acreage \nlimitation under the Mineral Leasing Act. In fact, sodium is the only \nmineral subject to the Act which has not had an increase since the law \nwas amended in 1948. It is out of date with the competitive and \ntechnological advances in the industry and needs to be changed as we \nmove into the next century.\n  Specifically this legislation provides the Secretary of the Interior \nwith discretion to increase the federally held acreage of individual \nsodium producers; the same additional discretionary authority he has \nhad for some time for other mineral categories affected by this law. It \nwould increase the current limitation from 15,360 acres per producer, \nto 30,720 acres.\n  The Mineral Leasing Act set forth these limits to ensure that no \nsingle entity can control too much of any single mineral reserve. This \nremains an important objective. A lease limitation ensures that there \nis sufficient competition, while providing an incentive for development \nof these reserves and ensures a reasonable rate of return to the \nFederal Treasury. My bill is consistent with these objectives and seeks \nonly to conform the present limitation to current economic and \ninternational conditions. Indeed I am pleased that this bill has the \nfull support of the Wyoming Mining Association, including smaller \nsodium lease holders, who have traditionally been concerned increasing \nacreage.\n  Mr President, I offer this bill after carefully reviewing the need \nfor it in light of current conditions affecting the soda ash industry \nin my state. In my examination, I have been reminded that U.S. soda ash \nproducers, four (of five) of which are in our state, are extremely \ncompetitive with one another for a relatively flat domestic market. \nAnd, they are also faced with stiff international competition.\n  I believe this legislation is necessary to sustain the global \ncompetitiveness of the U.S. soda ash industry. Since our state is \nblessed with the largest known deposits of trona in the world, I am \nproud to say that the United States sodium industry is also the world's \nlow cost supplier of soda ash. U.S. produced soda ash, critical to \nglass manufacture, is accountable for a $400 million positive \ncontribution to our balance of trade. Today, the U.S. soda ash industry \ncomprises five active producers--four in my home state--generating some \n12 million tons of soda ash per year, or approximately a third of the \nworld's demand.\n  But I have learned we cannot take these producers for granted. Like \nso many other industries basic to our economy such as steel, paper, \naluminum, copper, and so on, the soda ash mines must take the measures \nnecessary to stay competitive. I know, as Chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, that many \ncountries have make it difficult to export U.S. soda ash. They have \nerected tariff and non-tariff barriers to support their own less \nefficient domestic producers.\n  For this season, U.S. producers have formed the American Natural Soda \nAsh Corporation (ANSAC), in recognition that the growth of U.S. soda \nash is dependent on its ability to effectively export. ANSAC is the \nsole authorized exporter of soda ash and is wholly owned by the six \nU.S. sodium producers. It accounts for the employment of some 20,000 \npeople in the U.S. and exports more than $400 million in soda ash to 45 \ndifferent countries.\n  This is but one example of how our domestic industry has taken the \nsteps necessary to compete effectively abroad. In addition, the \nproducers in my state are making major investments in moderizing their \nfacilities and sustaining the level of capital investment necessary to \ncontinue to be competitive both at home and abroad. The start-up cost \nfor a new soda ash operation is estimated to be at least $350 million, \nand to develop a world class mine, $150 million. This is largely due to \nthe fact that soda ash is mined underground and thus requires a \nsophisticated processing plant to turn raw ore into the finished \nproducts. This is simply the reality of what is required to stay \ncompetitive.\n  At this cost a new entrant, as well as existing producers, must have \na predictable ``mine plan.'' A primary component of such a plan is a \npredictable level of reserves that will last several decades. The \nlegislation I am introducing today would help provide this \npredictability by giving the Secretary the discretion to raise lease \nlimits on a case-by-case basis if the producer can show it is in need \nof additional reserves to maintain its operations.\n  Producers need to know of mine expansion is possible in order to \ndevelop structural design plans which are safe, efficient and maximize \nthe large economic outlays. This is the predictability that any \nmanufacturer needs when contemplating a major capital investment. And \nin the end, it is the capital required, rather than the acreage \navailable, the must be weighed by new entrants.\n  I would like to note that despite consolidated in the Wyoming trona \npatch, there is an anticipated new entrant to the soda ash business in \nour neighboring state of Colorado. Moreover, in Wyoming, six other \nleaseholders have substantial holdings that could be translated into \nactive production. This bill does not discourage their entry. In fact, \nby raising the current cap on acreage holdings, it creates an incentive \nfor additional purchase by these holders, one of whom already exceeds \nthe existing limitation.\n  Raising the acreage limitation for trona is also consistent with good \nenvironmental and safety practices followed by this industry. Much of \nthe currently mined out acreage is essential to proper ventilation of \nongoing operations and therefore critical mine safety. In addition, the \nmechanically mined out sections are also available for proper tailings \ndisposal, thus avoiding environmental degradation elsewhere. This is a \npractice encouraged by our Wyoming State Department of Environmental \nQuality.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today provides \ncritical changes in existing statutes in order to sustain the economic \nviability of an environmental responsible and critical mining industry \nin our country. The current sodium lease limitation is approximately \none-third of the per state Federal lease cap for coal potassium, and \none-sixteenth the lease acreage cap for oil and gas. After passing the \nMineral Leasing Act in 1948, Congress and the Bureau of Land Management \nhave revised acreage limits for other minerals to meet the needs of \nthese industries consistent with good mining and environmental \npractices. In light of the conditions I have described, I believe it is \ntime we recognize the need to update the lease limitation for the trona \nindustry as well.\n  I thank you for the time and opportunity to discuss this important \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1722\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TITLE.\n\n       This Act shall be entitled the ``Trona Market Competition \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SODIUM MINING ON FEDERAL LAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal land contains commercial deposits of trona, the \n     world's largest deposits\n\n[[Page S12557]]\n\n     of trona being located on Federal land in southwestern \n     Wyoming;\n       (2) trona is mined on Federal land through Federal sodium \n     leases under the Act of February 25, 1920 (commonly known as \n     the ``Mineral Leasing Act'') (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.);\n       (3) the primary product of trona mining is soda ash (sodium \n     carbonate), a basic industrial chemical that is used for \n     glassmaking and a variety of consumer products, including \n     baking soda, detergents, and pharmaceuticals;\n       (4) the Mineral Leasing Act sets for each leasable mineral \n     a limitation on the amount of acreage of Federal leases any 1 \n     producer may hold in any 1 State or nationally;\n       (5)(A) the present acreage limitation for Federal sodium \n     leases has been in place for over 5 decades, since 1948, and \n     is the oldest acreage limitation in the Mineral Leasing Act;\n       (B) over that time, Congress or the Bureau of Land \n     Management has revised the acreage limits applicable to other \n     minerals to meet the needs of the respective industries; and\n       (C) currently the sodium lease acreage limit of 15,360 \n     acres per State is approximately \\1/3\\ of the per-State \n     Federal lease acreage limit for coal (46,080 acres) and \n     potassium (51,200 acres) and \\1/16\\ of the per-State Federal \n     lease acreage limit for oil and gas (246,080 acres);\n       (6) 3 of the 4 trona producers in Wyoming are operating \n     mines on Federal leaseholds that contain total acreage close \n     to the sodium lease acreage ceiling;\n       (7) the same reasons that Congress cited in enacting \n     increases per State lease acreage caps applicable in the case \n     of other minerals--the advent of modern mine technology, \n     changes in industry economics, greater global competition, \n     and the need to conserve Federal resources--apply to trona;\n       (8) existing trona mines require additional lease acreage \n     to avoid premature closure, but those mines cannot relinquish \n     mined-out areas to lease new acreage because those areas \n     continue to be used for mine access, ventilation, and \n     tailings disposal and may provide future opportunities for \n     secondary recovery by solution mining;\n       (9) to enable them to make long-term business decisions \n     affecting the type and amount of additional infrastructure \n     investments, trona producers need certainty that sufficient \n     acreage of leasable trona will be available for mining in the \n     future; and\n       (10) to maintain the vitality of the domestic trona \n     industry and ensure the continued flow of valuable revenues \n     to the Federal and State governments and of products to the \n     American public from trona production on Federal land, the \n     Mineral Leasing Act should be amended to increase the acreage \n     imitation for Federal sodium leases.\n       (b) Amendment.--Section 27(b)(2) of the Act of February 25, \n     1920 (30 U.S.C. 184(b)(2)), is amended by striking ``fifteen \n     thousand three hundred and sixty acres'' and inserting \n     ``30,720 acres''.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I join Senator Thomas in the \nintroduction of S. 1722, a bill to increase the federal statutory \nacreage limitation for domestic trona producers. This legislation will \nbring the federal statutory acreage limitation for trona more in line \nwith acreage limitations for other mineral commodities and will allow \nAmerican trona producers to remain competitive in the international \nmarketplace well into the twenty-first century.\n  This legislation will make a small but important change in the \nfederal Mineral Leasing Act that would allow the Secretary of the \nInterior, at his discretion, to permit a person or corporation to hold \nsodium leases on federal land of up to 30,720 acres in any one State. \nThis is a two-fold increase over the current discretionary acreage \nlimitation of 15,360 acres. The current limit was established over 50 \nyears ago while the acreage limitation of other minerals, including \ncoal, potassium, and oil and gas, have been increased considerably \nduring that same time in order to meet the needs of these industries. \nBy increasing the federal acreage limitation for trona, Congress will \ntake an important step to ensure future productivity and international \ncompetitiveness of an industry that has great importance for the State \nof Wyoming and the United States. This legislation will in turn benefit \nthe federal government through continued royalties derived from soda \nash mined on federal land.\n  Mr. President, the State of Wyoming has long depended on the mineral \nindustry as a vital part of its economy. Since one-half of our state is \ncomprised of federal land, private companies must temporarily lease \nportions of this land in order to extract minerals that benefit the \nentire country, and indeed, the entire world. The mining of natural \nsoda ash, or trona, is an integral part of the state's economy, \nespecially for those who live in southwestern Wyoming. This trona is \nmined and converted to refined soda ash (sodium carbonate) which is \nused in the production of glass, detergents, pharmaceuticals, and other \nsodium chemicals. Currently, three of the four trona producers in \nWyoming are operating mines on federal leaseholds that contain total \nacreage close to the discretionary sodium lease acreage ceiling. By \nincreasing this federal limit, we will give Wyoming producers the \ncertainty they need to continue and expand their substantial capital \ninvestments in the State of Wyoming and allow America to remain \ncompetitive in this important mineral industry. This acreage increase \nrepresents a modest, responsible modification to the Mineral Leasing \nAct that takes modern economic realities into account without deterring \nthe entry of new companies into the domestic market for mineable trona.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the swift passage of this \nmodification to the Mineral Leasing Act in order to ensure stability, \ngrowth, and continued international competitiveness of America's trona \nindustry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 1724. A bill to modify the standards for responding to import \nsurges under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, to establish \nmechanisms for agricultural import monitoring and the prevention of \ncircumvention of United States trade laws, and to strengthen the \nenforcement of United States trade remedy laws; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                the agriculture import surge relief act\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Agriculture \nImport Surge Relief Act of 1999.\n  This year's harvest is nearly over in Montana and the rest of the \ncountry. But instead of breathing a sigh of relief after a summer of \nhard work, many of our farmers are holding their breath, wondering \nwhether they will even be able to farm next year. With prices at a 50-\nyear low, global oversupply and unpredictable surges in imports, our \nrural communities continue to face crisis.\n  We in the Senate have been working hard to address this triad of \nproblems. Today, I would like to offer a partial solution to the trade \nangle--the Agriculture Import Surge Relief Act. This Act addresses \nsurges in agricultural imports.\n  For a variety of reasons, including overcapacity overseas, misaligned \nexchanges rates, and low international commodity prices, we may find a \nsudden, sharp, and unpredictable increase in import levels of \nparticular agricultural product. This type of sudden rise in import \nlevels damage the heart of our economy and our farm communities.\n  We must do a better job of monitoring these surges so that we see \nthem as soon as they start. And we must do a better and faster job of \nresponding to these surges to provide relief to our producers before \nthey go out of business.\n  The Agriculture Import Surge Relief Act targets these goals by making \nseveral critical improvements in Section 201 of U.S. trade law.\n  Section 201 is the so-called ``safeguard'' provision that is designed \nto prevent serious disruption of our domestic industry because of \nimports. It is also the very provision that was used by U.S. lamb \nproducers earlier this year to find relief from a surge in lamb imports \nfrom Australia and New Zealand. I am pleased that U.S. lamb producers \nprevailed; but it cost them dearly--in both time and money. Unlike \nother industries, agriculture is extraordinarily time sensitive. A \nyear-long case can find many producers driven out of business before it \nends.\n  It is also important to note that Section 201 is not a protectionist \nmeasure. It is a short-term mechanism used to get an ``injured'' \nAmerican industry back on its feet and competing again. I consider \nSection 201 as a ``breathing room'' provision. That is, it gives \ntemporary relief to a domestic industry by providing for a short-term \nrestraint on imports that have surged into the United States.\n  My bill proposes four changes to the way we anticipate and respond to \nsurges in agriculture.\n  First, the Act amends Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 to be more \nresponsive to import surges--for any industry.\n  Like the Import Surge Relief Act I introduced last May, co-sponsored \nby\n\n[[Page S12558]]\n\nSenator Levin, this bill eases Section 201's overly strict injury \nstandard. No longer will American industry have to comply with a \nstandard higher than that of our international trading partners. They \nwill simply have to prove an increase in imports over a short period of \ntime which cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic \nmarket.\n  The Act also speeds up the process for addressing import surges. \nRecently, I hosted a town hall meeting in Kalispell, Montana. Many \nagriculture leaders expressed their concern that the process of \nresponding to surges is just too long. The same message came through \nloud and clear last week when a record number of us in the Congress \ntestified before the International Trade Commission regarding imported \nCanadian cattle. Relief that is too late can mean the devastation of an \nindustry--and the devastation of Rural America.\n  My bill would cut the time in half for this process and give the ITC \nCommissioners the ability to make decisions on an expedited basis.\n  It will also bring credibility to the final decision-making process. \nAs we learned in the lamb case, the President has the ultimate \ndecision-making authority. This means he can accept, change or reject \nrecommendations from the International Trade Commission based on \ninformation above and beyond the evidence presented during the \nlaborious hearings.\n  My bill requires that the President, in deciding whether to take \naction, focus more than he has in the past on the beneficial impact of \na remedy, rather than on the negative impact on other industries. And \nin do so, he must make provisional relief available on an urgent basis.\n  Second, the Act establishes an Agricultural Products Import \nMonitoring and Enforcement Program. The program shall: Promote and \ndefend US policy with respect to import safeguards and countervailing \nor antidumping duty actions if challenged in the World Trade \nOrganization, identify foreign trade-distorting measures, and develop \npolicies and responsive actions to address such measures.\n  Finally, the bill provides an early warning system. We simply cannot \nwait until we see that an American industry is devastated. We must be \nable to project ahead, understand the threats facing an industry, and \nthen consider quickly what type of action to take, if any.\n  My bill requires the Secretary of Commerce to monitor imports and \nreport its findings on a quarterly basis until 2005. This is absolutely \ncritical to take rapid action.\n  Finally, with the next round of the World Trade Organization talks \napproaching, the expiration of the Farm Bill, and uncertainties in \nglobal financial markets, anything can happen. U.S. industry, and our \nfarm communities, however, should not bear the brunt.\n  The Agricultural Import Surge Relief Act will begin to bring \nstability and predictability back to the system. I urge my colleagues \nto support this proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url":

BOOKOUT\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and pay tribute \nto Colonel Randall D. Bookout, Chief, Senate Liaison Division, Office \nof the Chief of Legislative Liaison for the U.S. Army, who will retire \non January 1, 2000. Colonel Bookout's career spans 27 years during \nwhich he has distinguished himself as a soldier, leader and friend of \nthe United States Senate.\n  An Ohio native, Colonel Bookout graduated from the United States \nMilitary Academy in 1972 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the \nInfantry Branch of the U.S. Army. During his career, he has commanded \nat the platoon through the battalion levels, where he ably trained and \nled America's soldiers at home and overseas. In Fort Wainwright, \nAlaska, he commanded the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, ``The \nManchus.'' He has also served in command and staff positions at Fort \nCarson, Colorado, the United States Military Academy at West Point, New \nYork, the Pentagon and overseas in Panama and Korea. Prior to assuming \nhis current duties, he served as the Aide de Camp to the Secretary of \nthe Army.\n  Since January 1996, Randy Bookout has served with distinction as the \nChief of the Army's Senate Liaison Office where he has superbly \nrepresented the Chief of Legislative Liaison, the Chief of Staff, Army \nand the Secretary of the Army, as well as promoting the interests of \nthe soldiers and civilians of the Army. His professionalism, mature \njudgment, sage advice and inter-personal skills have earned him the \nrespect and confidence of the Members of Congress and Congressional \nstaffers with whom he has worked on a multitude of issues. In over four \nyears on the Hill, Randy Bookout has been a true friend of the U.S. \nCongress. Serving as the Army's primary point of contact for all \nSenators, their staffs and Congressional Committees, he has assisted \nCongress in understanding Army policies, actions, operations and \nrequirements. As a result, he and his staff have been extremely \neffective in providing prompt, coordinated and factual replies to all \ninquiries and matters involving Army issues. In addition, he\n\n[[Page S12561]]\n\nhas provided invaluable assistance to Members and their staffs while \nplanning, coordinating and accompanying Senate delegations traveling \nworldwide to over sixty countries. His substantive knowledge of the key \nissues, keen legislative insight, and ability to effectively advise \nsenior members of the Army leadership directly contributed to the \nsuccessful representation of the Army's interests before Congress.\n  Throughout his career, Colonel Randy Bookout has demonstrated his \nprofound commitment to our Nation, his selfless service to the Army, a \ndeep concern for soldiers and their families, and a commitment to \nexcellence. Colonel Bookout is a consummate professional whose \nperformance, in over 27 years of service, has personified those traits \nof courage, competency and integrity that our Nation has come to expect \nfrom its professional Army officers.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Colonel \nBookout for his honorable service to the U.S. Army and the people of \nthe United States. We wish him and his family Godspeed and all the best \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12561-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CELEBRATING THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF KAHAL KADOSH BETH ELOHIM\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to \nrecognize today the congregation of Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim in \nCharleston, S.C. as it celebrates its 250th anniversary on October 23 \n1999.\n  Beth Elohim is the fourth oldest Jewish congregation in the United \nStates. The congregation still worships in a synagogue built in 1840-41 \nin the Greek Revival style, making it the oldest synagogue in \ncontinuous use in the United States. In 1980, the building was \ndesignated a National Historic Landmark.\n  Jewish settlers arrived in Charleston as early as 1695 and by 1749 \nwere numerous enough to organize the present congregation of Beth \nElohim, then known as Holy Congregational House of God. These settlers \nwere attracted by South Carolina's civil and religious liberty as well \nas the economic opportunities the colony offered. In 1792, construction \nof the synagogue began. The structure stood until being destroyed in \nthe Charleston fire of 1838. The visiting General Marquis de Lafayette \nobserved the original building to be ``spacious and elegant.''\n  Beth Elohim also holds the distinction of being the cradle of Reform \nJudaism in the United States. In 1824, a group of progressive members \nof the congregation petitioned for a shortened Hebrew ritual, English \ntranslation of prayers and a sermon in English. Their petition being \ndenied, they decided to organize The Reformed Society of Israelites. It \nwas a short-lived society, but when the members returned to the \ncongregation at Beth Elohim, their practices and principles influenced \nthe worship service there and today still form the basis of Reform \nJudaism. During the construction of the new temple in 1840, an organ \nwas installed, encased in mahogany to complement the building's \ninterior. Said to have 700 pipes and costing $2,500, the organ provided \nthe first instrumental music used in worship in any synagogue in \nAmerica.\n  Many members of K.K. Beth Elohim have been distinguished city, state \nand national leaders, including early congregant Moses Lindo, who \nbefore the Revolution helped to develop the cultivation of indigo. \nJoseph Levy, veteran of the Cherokee War of 1760-61, was probably the \nfirst Jewish military officer in America. Almost two dozen men of Beth \nElohim served in the American Revolution, most notably Francis Salvador \nwho, as a delegate to the South Carolina Provincial Congresses of 1775-\n1776, was one of the first Jews to serve in the American legislature. \nThe blind poet Penina Moise was a famous early superintendent of the \nJewish Sunday School at Beth Elohim.\n  Today, Beth Elohim is led by Rabbi Anthony David Holz and Rabbi \nEmeritus William A. Rosenthall. The congregation continues to function \nas a vital part of the Charleston community and deserves many \ncongratulations on reaching this milestone--250 years of rich \nhistory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12561-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BILL WOLFF\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nefforts of a group of farmers in eastern Montana who pulled together \nfollowing a tragic accident to help the Family of Bill Wolff harvest \ntheir crops.\n  Sadly, the Wolff family suffered a terrible loss on September 10, \nwhen a farming accident claimed Bill's life. In the midst of this \ntragedy, Bill's neighbor's gathered in an impressive effort to help the \nWolff family harvest their grain.\n  In all more than 20 trucks and 12 combines arrived in Glendive to \nassist in the harvest. Working simultaneously, the combines were able \nto cut 135 acres per hour and bring in the harvest for the Wolff \nfamily.\n  Jim Wolff, one of Bill's nephews said, ``After experiencing the great \nteamwork here today, it's going to be difficult to go home and finish \nmy own harvest by myself.'' In addition, many neighbors mirrored Jim's \nsentiment and expressed a sense of privilege that they were able to \njoin with the Wolff family during their time of need.\n  Montanans are truly a special breed of people--always quick to lend a \nhand to others. It says so much that these people took time away from \ntheir own extremely hectic harvest schedules to help the Wolffs, and I \ncommend them for it. Their selflessness serves as an example of us all.\n  I also extend my most sincere sympathies to the Wolf family. As \nevidenced by the outpouring of support from his neighbors. Bill was a \nman who was loved by a great many people and his loss will be shared by \nthem also.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12561-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INSTALLATION OF WILLIAM GORDON\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on Sunday William C. Gordon was \ninstalled as the 16th President of the University of New Mexico.\n  A psychologist by training, Dr. Gordon came to New Mexico by way of \nWake Forest University, and Rutgers, where he earned his Ph.D. He \ntaught at the State University of New York before moving to Albuquerque \nmore than twenty years ago. Serving as a Professor of Psychology, then \nas chairman of the department, he became Dean of the College of Arts \nand Sciences. From there he became the Provost and Vice President for \nAcademic Affairs and then assumed the job of interim president. It was \nduring that period, and after a national search had been conducted, \nthat he himself was named President in March of this year.\n  Distinguished and well respected, Dr. Gordon has worked diligently \nthroughout his administrative career to improve the university not only \nfor the students and faculty, but for the staff and the wider \ncommunity. He has sought to improve both the education people are \ngetting, and the way they are getting it. The University of New Mexico \nis our state's largest institution of higher learning. The potential \nthis represents is not lost on Dr. Gordon, and we look to him for \nleadership well into the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12561-4", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12561-S12562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR GORDON R.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nSergeant Major Gordon R. ``Randy'' Taft, United States Army, a native \nof Decatur, Alabama, who is retiring this month from active duty after \ntwenty-six years of distinguished service to the country. Sergeant \nMajor Taft, who currently serves as the Senior Enlisted Advisor to the \nDirector of the Defense Logistics Agency in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, has \ndevoted his professional life to supporting the personal, \nadministrative, and logistics needs of military men and women assigned \naround the world in defense of our freedom. His accomplishments are \nmany and his reputation for leading and developing young soldiers is \nlegendary. Randy Taft's selfless contributions to the National Defense \nwill be missed, so as he transitions to new opportunities, I want to \nsay thanks to him on behalf of a grateful Nation.\n  Sergeant Major Taft's numerous military awards and decorations \nreflect the tremendous impact he has had on the lives of America's \nfighting men and women. His decorations include the Legion of Merit, \nthe Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, and the \nHumanitarian Service\n\n[[Page S12562]]\n\nMedal. But the medals and certificates do not say it all.

Mr. President, these are difficult times for our \nnation's children as they watch their peers turn to violence, drugs, \ntruancy and gang membership. If one were to believe the evening news, \nthere appears to be little good news coming from our schools. But I \nrise before my colleagues today to share with them some good news. \nThunderbolt Elementary School in Savannah, Georgia, has been recognized \nby the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America as violence-free \nand the ``Best Example in America'' of what a safe and drug-free school \nshould be.\n  Thunderbolt Elementary is the only school out of the 10,600 which \nenrolled in the national ``Children's Set a Good Example'' Competition \nduring the past 12 years to win the national award three times in a \nrow. Additionally, Thunderbolt has also been chosen this year by the \njudges of the first ``Best of the Best'' competition, which will be \nheld just once every ten years, as the best of the best elementary \nschools in America.\n  The war against drug abuse, violent crime, illiteracy and intolerance \nis a multifaceted battle being fought in every sector of our community. \nIt is a war that ravages our streets and has kids killing other kids. \nToo many of our children have become casualties of this epidemic. We as \na society must apply proven, workable methods if we are to salvage our \nyouth and rid our cities of those social ills. Positive counter peer \npressure could be more effective than authoritarian efforts when it \ncomes to influencing youth away from drug abuse and gang involvement \nand I am so proud of Thunderbolt Elementary for showing this to be \ntrue.\n  The work that the students at Thunderbolt have done is inspiring and \nI hope that they will be an example to other students around the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12562-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RUSSELL W. PETERSON HONORED WITH FIRST-EVER ``LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT \n                AWARD'' BY CREATIVE GRANDPARENTING, INC.\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the lifetime \nachievements of a man with truly a lifetime of achievements.\n  Russell W. Peterson served as Governor of Delaware from 1968-1972, \nrestoring peace on the streets of Delaware's largest city in the wake \nof the tumultuous 1968 summer riots--as he overcame decades of \nresistance to implement a sweeping overhaul of State government. Russ \nPeterson is known to Delawareans as the father of the state's landmark \nCoastal Zone Act, just as he is renowned nationally as one of our \ncountry's leading environmentalists.\n  I will go into more detail of his many accomplishments, however, the \nreason I pay tribute to him today is for his recognition--not only as a \nstatesman, environmentalist and civil rights leader--but as a \ngrandfather! Delaware's Creative Grandparenting, Inc. has awarded \nRussell W. Peterson its first-ever ``Lifetime Achievement Award.'' \nPeterson, a grandfather of 17 and father of four, deserves every \naccolade bestowed upon him.\n  When Russ Peterson was elected Governor of Delaware in 1968, the \nNational Guard patrolled the streets of Wilmington. As he promised, the \nday Peterson was sworn in as Governor, the National Guard was pulled \nfrom the streets. As a 27-year-old New Castle County Councilman first \nelected that same year in 1968, I assure you Governor Peterson's \nleadership and steady stewardship made a lasting impression upon me. I \nam proud to call him a friend.\n  As Governor, he bucked resistance and reformed Delaware's arcane \nCommission form of Government into a Cabinet form of government. He \nconvinced the General Assembly to streamline 112 Commissions into ten \ndepartment leaders. It was nothing short of a revolution!\n  His greatest accomplishment came in June, 1972, when he single-\nhandedly pushed through the landmark Coastal Zone Act, which forever \nprohibits development along Delaware's precious coastal zone. Yes, he's \nthe man who proclaimed ``to hell with Shell,'' as he fought efforts by \noil refineries to further develop on the Delaware River. The Coastal \nZone Act shall forever stand as a monument to Russ Peterson in my \nState.\n  Governor Peterson also signed Delaware's Fair Housing Act into law \nand appointed the first female to the Delaware bench--Family Court \nJudge Roxana C. Arsht. And in July, 1972, he signed into law a major \nrevision of the Delaware Code, which is important for what was not \nincluded. The Whipping Post! From 1669-1952, more than 1,600 men were \nflogged at the whipping post. Delaware was the last State to eliminate \nthis barbaric punishment, thanks to Russ Peterson.\n  After leaving office in 1972, Russ served as an advisor to Presidents \nand held numerous prestigious environmental positions. He was named \nVice-Chair of Governor Nelson Rockfeller's National Commission on \nCritical Choices of America. Then, he chaired President Ford's Council \non Environmental Quality. In 1976, Peterson became President of New \nDirections, a world-wide citizens' lobby group. In 1978, he was tapped \nto be the director of the congressional Office of Technological \nAssessment. He secured his worldwide reputation as an environmentalist \nas the President of the National Audubon Society.\n  Mr. President, I consider myself very fortunate to call him a friend. \nI am honored that just last week, Governor Peterson took the time to \nwrite me a handwritten note to say he was ``proud that you are my \nSenator.'' That sort of praise from such an accomplished man is \nhumbling.\n  Russ Peterson, my friend, you have a lot of living yet to do and more \naccomplishments yet to come. Today, though, we honor your lifetime of \nachievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12562-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12562-S12563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL SAVE SCHOOLS FROM VIOLENCE DAY\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I have spoken several times this \nyear about the need for our Nation to address juvenile violence. Today, \nI would like to commend another group that has joined the call to end \nviolence. The American Medical Association Alliance has designated \ntoday as National SAVE Schools from Violence Day, and I would like to \npraise their efforts.\n  The AMA Alliance SAVE (Stop America's Violence Everywhere) campaign \nbegan in 1995 and comprises a grassroots effort of 700 local and state-\nlevel projects to curb violence. Through the campaign, the Alliance has \ncreated unique workbooks and activities for use as conflict resolution \ntools in classrooms across the country. One of their themes, Hands are \nnot for hitting, catches children's attention by challenging them to \ncome up with other uses for their hands. Rather than seeing their hands \nas weapons, children are reminded that their hands can be used for \nhugging, collecting bugs or coloring with crayons.\n  Another campaign theme, I Can Choose, teaches children that they can \nchoose their attitudes and behavior. Other projects including I Can Be \nSafe and Be a Winner have been distributed nationwide.\n  Using its Hands are not for hitting campaign and others like it, the \nAMA is working to call attention to school safety and the way children \ninteract. Nationally, the AMA hopes to reach 1 million children by the \nyear 2000 with activities that help them manage anger and build self-\nesteem. This type of private sector involvement represents a key \nbuilding block in our nation's commitment to providing a safe learning \nenvironment for our children.\n\n[[Page S12563]]\n\n  Many of my colleagues know that I introduced the Safe Schools Act of \n1999 to provide resources to public schools so they can remain safe and \nstrong cornerstones of our communities. As we move into the 21st \ncentury, we must adapt our approach to education to meet the changing \nneeds of students, teachers and parents.\n  Although I am one of the youngest members of the Senate, I grew up in \nHelena, Arkansas during what seemed to be a much simpler time. Our \nparents pulled together to make everyone's education experience a \nsuccess. Students came to school prepared to learn. Teachers had \ncontrol of their classroom. The threat of school violence was virtually \nnon-existent.\n  Now, more than twenty years later, things are different--very \ndifferent. Our children are subjected to unprecedented social stresses \nincluding divorce, drug and alcohol abuse, child abuse, poverty and an \nexplosion of technology that has good and bad uses.\n  These stresses exhibit themselves in the behavior of teenagers, as \nwell as in our young children. Increasingly, elementary school children \nexhibit symptoms of substance abuse, academic underachievement, \ndisruptive behavior, and even suicide.\n  Although school shootings will probably not occur in a majority of \nour schools, each time we witness a tragedy like Jonesboro or \nLittleton, it makes us wonder if the next incident will be in our own \nhome towns.\n  This is a very complex problem and there is no one single answer. It \nwill take more than metal detectors and surveillance cameras to prevent \nthe tragedies occurring in our schools. I believe the Safe Schools Act \nreflects the needs and wishes of students, parents, teachers and school \nadministrators.\n  Unfortunately, there are not nearly enough mental health \nprofessionals working in our nation's schools. The American School \nHealth Association recommends that the student-to-counselor ratio be \n250:1. In secondary schools, the current ratio is 513:1. In elementary \nschools, the student-to-teacher ratio exceeds 1000:1.\n  Students today bring more to school than backpacks and lunchboxes--\nmany of them bring severe emotional troubles. It is critical that \nschools be able to help our troubled students by teaching children new \nskills to cope with their aggression.\n  So, I commend the AMA Alliance for designating today as National SAVE \nSchools from Violence Day and encourage students, teachers, parents and \nthe community to work together to make our schools safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/13/senate-section/article/S12563-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT 106-14\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, it is my honor today to introduce a \nSenate resolution honoring a wonderful man and public servant, John E. \nCook. The National Park Service recently celebrated its 83rd birthday, \nand for more than half that time--43 years--John served the Service \nwith distinction, grit and integrity.\n  John E. Cook most recently served as Director of the Intermountain \nRegion of the National Park Service, which stretches from Canada to \nMexico and covers eight states, including Colorado, Utah, Arizona, \nMontana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. There he oversaw 87 \ndiverse park units, including national parks, national monuments, \nnational preserves, and national recreation areas. Since I have been a \nSenator from New Mexico, John and I have worked on various, and \nsometimes contentious, park issues. I have always appreciated our \nrelationship, and his frankness and competence in dealing with issues.\n  Anyone who knows John would agree he is a great guy. Before starting \nhis work for the National Park Service, he worked as a farm and ranch \nhand--and I've even heard a few good stories from his days as a rodeo \ncowboy. John began his Park Service career as a mule skinner at what is \nnow Saguaro National\n\n[[Page S12564]]\n\nPark, and he has worked as a fire fighter, laborer, ranger, \nsuperintendent, and regional director throughout the western United \nStates.\n  In addition to being a strong manager of people and parks, linking \ncultural and natural resource management, John has worked diligently to \npromote understanding of American Indians. Former Interior Secretary \nStewart Udall appointed John superintendent at Canyon de Chelly \nNational Monument in Arizona partially because he speaks Navajo. He has \nreceived awards for his work in parks around the Navajo Nation, and has \ntaught other park staff on American Indians' connection to lands that \nare now national parks.\n  The National Park Service owes John Cook a debt of gratitude, and the \nmany honors he has received in his service will not repay what he has \ndone for the parks of the west. I only hope that he will enjoy his \nextra free time to get in some hunting--a passion both he and I enjoy. \nI am pleased to offer this resolution, and I thank my colleagues for \njoining me in honoring this fine man.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, and any statements relating to this resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 202) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 202\n\n       Whereas John E. Cook has recently retired from the National \n     Park Service after 43 years of distinguished service to the \n     United States and the people of the western region of the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas John E. Cook most recently served 87 park units in \n     8 western States, stretching from the Canadian border to \n     Mexico, as Director of the Intermountain Region of the \n     National Park Service;\n       Whereas John E. Cook is in the third of 4 generations from \n     the Cook family who have served the National Park Service \n     with enthusiasm and dedication;\n       Whereas John E. Cook's father, John O. Cook, and his \n     grandfather, John E. Cook, served the National Park Service \n     in the southwestern region, and his daughter Kayci Cook, \n     currently serves as superintendent of Fort McHenry National \n     Monument and Historic Shrine in Baltimore;\n       Whereas John E. Cook began his National Park Service career \n     as a mule skinner at what is now Saguaro National Park;\n       Whereas John E. Cook, who is of Cherokee descent, speaks \n     Navajo, and has worked diligently to promote Native American \n     understanding;\n       Whereas John E.
