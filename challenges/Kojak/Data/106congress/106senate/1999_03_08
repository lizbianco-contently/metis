I wanted to take a few moments this morning to talk a \nlittle bit about birthdays and anniversaries. As we know, basically \nthey are happy remembrances of events we should celebrate. Eighty-six \nyears ago today, the Internal Revenue Service began to levy and collect \na personal income tax on the American people.\n  I believe this is nothing to celebrate. To borrow a phrase from \nRonald Reagan, you will excuse the taxpayers if they don't celebrate \nthe daily mugging that we call the Tax Code.\n  As we note the sad occasion, I rise to call upon Congress to take \nimmediate action to end the Federal Tax Code as we know it and replace \nit with a new system that is fairer, simpler, and friendlier to the \ntaxpayers. I also call upon Congress to take immediate action to reduce \nthe ever-increasing tax burden by providing meaningful tax relief for \nevery working American. Now, that, Mr. President, would be something to \ncelebrate.\n  This great Nation was born out of a tax revolt. The revolt didn't \ncome about because our Founding Fathers were selfish but because they \ndidn't want to be shackled by Government regulations, intrusive \nbureaucracies, abusive taxing powers, and the unjust policies of their \nhomeland. They didn't want to send their hard-earned money to an \nEnglish Parliament that wasted every penny of it without any respect \nfor those who earned it.\n  The Boston Tea Party was the result of a one-half of 1 percent tax \nthat was levied on the Colonies. Put that in terms of today's tax \nburden.\n  This tax revolt was about freedom; it was about liberty; it was about \na person being able to own more of the fruits of his labor rather than \nbeing strangled by the albatross of taxation.\n  Our Founding Fathers understood well that low taxes and freedom were \ndirectly related. To protect individual liberty from future abuses, \nthey crafted clause 4 of article I, section 9 of the U.S. Constitution, \nthat is, rejecting all direct income taxes that were not appropriated \nby each State by its population.\n  This clause, as originally adopted in the Constitution, reflected the \ngenius, the wisdom, and the experience of our Founding Fathers--\nprotecting individual liberty by limiting the Government's power to \ntax.\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\n  For more than 100 years following the founding of this Nation, the \nAmerican people enjoyed tax freedom and did not pay any income taxes. \nThe Supreme Court defended this freedom and held the income tax to be \nunconstitutional. Unfortunately, under the direct influence of the rise \nof socialism in Europe at that time, on February 3, 1913, the 16th \namendment to the Constitution was ratified, giving the Government \nunlimited power to tax. And then on March 8, 1913, the IRS began \ncollecting personal income tax. The ratification of the 16th amendment \nand the enactment of the first Tax Code fundamentally eroded our \nindividual liberty. Initially, less than 1 percent of all Americans \npaid any kind of income tax. Only 5 percent of Americans paid any \nincome tax as late as 1939 before the beginning of World War II.\n  Times, as we know, have changed dramatically. Today, the Federal tax \nburden is at a historic high. Federal taxes now consume nearly 21 \npercent of national income. A typical American family pays $9,000 a \nyear in Federal tax. A median-income family can expect to give up \nnearly 40 percent of all of its income in Federal, State and local \ntaxes. And that is more than it spends on food, clothing, \ntransportation and housing combined.\n  Mr. President, every year the tax system pushes more and more \nAmericans into higher and higher tax brackets, and that is to meet the \ndemands of ever-increasing Government spending. It is an old saying, \nbut it has never been more true, that ``Government is an endless \npursuit of new ways to tax.''\n  The tax system has created a monstrous bureaucracy--the intrusive, \nabusive Internal Revenue Service. More than $7 billion in taxpayers' \nmoney annually goes to support the operations of the Internal Revenue \nService. Those dollars have built a tax system that is extremely \ncomplicated and difficult for anyone to try to understand. The Tax Code \noriginally was only 14 pages when it was first enacted, but today it \nhas grown to more than 10,000 pages. And it costs hundreds of billions \nof dollars for taxpayers to comply with its dizzying requirements.\n  There is a growing national consensus that the current Tax Code is \nantifamily, it is antieconomic growth, it is unfair, it encourages \nabuse, waste and corruption, and it needs to be terminated.\n  I thank my colleague from Arkansas, who plans on introducing \nlegislation--he did introduce legislation last year--that would do just \nthat, that is, eliminate the Tax Code as we know it. I was proud to \njoin him as an original cosponsor, and I look forward to supporting his \nefforts once again this year.\n  The next question to answer is, How will we replace the Tax Code \nsince there is a need for Federal revenues to fund defense and foreign \npolicy needs as well as some Federal programs?\n  Mr. President, I have been exploring alternative tax systems for \nquite a while. After considerable study of the issue, I believe the \nnational sales tax plan that has been developed by Americans for Fair \nTaxation is the best replacement for the Tax Code.\n  Any new tax system must restore our fundamental principles of low \ntaxes and limited taxing power. It must fairly and efficiently \ndistribute the burden of funding our Government, promote economic \ngrowth, simplify compliance, and offer every American better economic \nopportunity.\n  The Fair Tax system, which I intend to introduce soon, meets these \nimportant criteria. It is a fairer, simpler, friendlier tax system. It \nwill increase economic growth, investment, capital formation, and the \ncreation of jobs and savings.\n  Under the Fair Tax system, working Americans keep 100 percent of \ntheir pay, pension, or Social Security check. They no longer need to \nfile a tax return with the IRS. Their family's finances are not \nrevealed to Government bureaucrats.\n  They will not be penalized for getting or staying married--or dying, \nfor that matter. Everyone pays the same tax rate without loopholes for \nspecial interest groups. There will not be any hidden taxes and \neveryone will easily understand the tax and how much tax they are \npaying. And finally--the good news--it will abolish the IRS.\n  Mr. President, does this sound too good to be true? It may sound that \nway, but believe me, it is real. Let me briefly highlight how my Fair \nTax legislation will achieve this.\n  First, the legislation will call for the repeal of the Constitutional \nAmendment that created the tax nightmare we find ourselves in today. As \nI noted earlier, the 16th Amendment is the root of all tax evil.\n  It abandons our Founding Fathers' core principle by giving the \nGovernment unlimited power to tax the private income of the American \npeople. Without repeal of this Amendment, any tax system will \neventually erode into the very system we have today.\n  Second, the legislation will repeal the income tax, the payroll tax, \nthe estate tax, the gift tax, the capital gains tax, the self-\nemployment tax, and the corporate tax.\n  Third, the legislation will impose a single rate on all new goods and \nservices at the point of final purchase for consumption, and it \nprovides a universal rebate in an amount equal to the sales tax paid on \nessential goods and services, to help lower-income individuals.\n  Every American will be better off under the Fair Tax system than they \nare under the system that today holds them captive. I believe it will \ncreate expanded economic opportunities for our Nation and for our \npeople.\n  I realize it will take some time to pass tax reform, so in the \nmeantime, I strongly support reducing the tax burdens of overtaxed \nAmericans.\n  The American people have good reason to ask for a tax cut.\n  Since 1993, Federal taxes have increased by 50 percent. They have \ngrown twice as much as Government spending and as a result, Americans \ntoday have the largest tax burden since World War II, and it is still \ngrowing.\n  What is most devastating is the ``middle-class tax squeeze.'' More \nand more middle-income workers are being thrown into higher tax \nbrackets. There is no excuse to continue taxing middle-income Americans \nat such a high rate in an era of budget surpluses.\n  More Americans are working harder and are earning more today. But a \nlarge share of the higher incomes of hard-working Americans are not \nbeing spent on their families' priorities, but are instead being \nsiphoned off by Washington.\n  This is not fair. People work hard and are then penalized for their \nwork. With punitive taxes, Washington makes the American dream of \nworking hard for a better life more difficult to achieve for many--and \nimpossible for some.\n  That is why Congress needs to take immediate action to provide \nmeaningful tax relief for all working Americans.\n  Our exceptionally strong economy will generate an enormous non-Social \nSecurity surplus over the next 10 years.\n  This surplus enables us to provide a broad-based tax cut for \novertaxed Americans--again, without new red ink, and without spending \nany of the Social Security surplus. The surplus will also allow \nCongress to retire some of the national debt every year.\n  If we do not return the surplus to the taxpayers, Washington will \nspend every penny of it to expand the Government.\n  In addition, broad-based tax relief is an insurance policy for the \nAmerican economy, helping to keep it strong and healthy.\n  Most economists, including Chairman Greenspan, agree that an across-\nthe-board tax cut is good for America. I will be addressing S. 3, my 10 \npercent across-the-board tax cut legislation, later this week in more \ndetail.\n  Today, I want to remind my colleagues about the anniversary of the \nincome tax and the hardship the Tax Code has placed on our people--\nagain, an anniversary I do not think worth celebrating.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to join me in a pledge that we will not let \nanother anniversary come and go before we dedicate ourselves to \nreplacing the Tax Code with a better system, and at the same time do \neverything we can to reduce the existing tax burden on the overtaxed \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Arkansas is on the floor. I \nwould like to yield to him, Senator Hutchinson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Minnesota. \nI don't know of a Senator who has been more consistent, more \npersistent, more\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\ndetermined, more resolute in trying to reduce the tax burden under \nwhich the American people labor, trying to simplify this very onerous \nTax Code under which we operate, than Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota. I \nam glad to associate myself with his comments today.\n  I suppose it is inappropriate to say, ``Happy anniversary,'' because \nthe anniversary we remember today is not one that is a source of \nhappiness. Mr. President, 86 years ago today--March 8, 86 years ago \ntoday--the Federal Government implemented the 16th amendment, ratified \nin 1913, and began at that point eating away at the income of the \nAmerican worker.\n  Perhaps that date, March 8, is a day that ought to ``live in \ninfamy.'' But, then, maybe we should not be too hard on those who \nenacted the income tax amendment. I believe they could never have \nenvisioned, they never could have imagined, what would have happened \nunder the guise of the income tax. In fact, I understand there was \nactually a proposal during the time that was being debated in Congress \nto cap what the income tax could ever reach--a ceiling--and it was \ndismissed because it was concluded that Congress would never raise the \nincome tax to such an exorbitant level.\n  During the 1930s, Federal income taxes never, never were more than \n1.4 percent of the Gross National Product--1.4 percent. In the 1990s \nthe income tax now represents, as a percentage of the GNP, about 9 \npercent. So it has just skyrocketed.\n  The amendment originally passed said this:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on \n     incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment \n     among the several states, and without regard to any census of \n     enumeration.\n\n  That is the way it began--just a little sliver, just a small portion \nfrom Americans' wallets, at the turn of the century. That has turned \ninto an enormous chunk of the pie, of the American family's reward for \na hard day's work.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, individual income \ntaxes constituted only 14.6 percent of the total revenue of the Federal \nGovernment in 1935. Less than 15 percent of all revenues generated for \nthe Federal Government came from the Federal income tax in 1935. Today, \nindividual income taxes constitute a whopping, staggering 45 percent of \nthe total Federal revenue, better than three times what it was in the \n1930s.\n  The rate has grown so rapidly, the Tax Code has become so onerous, \nthat Senator Grams and I are black-marking this day in American tax \nhistory. It is only a prelude to the dreaded date, April 15. It is only \nin May, on or about May 7, that hard-working Americans can breathe a \nsigh of relief, on what is called Tax Freedom Day. Only on that day, \nMay 7, can Americans begin to keep their hard-earned money, after \nhaving spent 4 months working to pay Uncle Sam's tax bill. It is for no \nsmall reason that Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 36, \nstated:\n\n       Many spectres have been raised out of this power of \n     internal taxation, to excite the apprehensions of the people.\n\n  That was written 210 years ago. Today, we know exactly what Alexander \nHamilton meant. The Federal Government has used the power of internal \ntaxation to create broad distrust in the American people and create a \nTax Code 7,500 pages in length containing over 800,000 words. We in the \nSenate have an opportunity to replace these dreadful anniversaries with \na new one--the elimination of the present Tax Code on December 31, \n2003. The Tax Code Termination Act, which I will, as Senator Grams \nalluded, introduce in the near future, would eliminate, terminate, \nsunset the existing Tax Code by December 31, 2003.\n\n  Congress, the President, and the American people would then replace \nthe current Tax Code with a leaner, simpler, fairer, and more honest \ntax system by no later than Independence Day, July 4, 2003, the \nbeginning of a new era of freedom in this country. Senator Grams will \nbe introducing a simpler, fairer tax system; others have proposed other \nalternatives. I will make my decision. I say this: The Tax Code \nTermination Act, the sunsetting of the Tax Code, is not relying upon \nwhich kind of solution, it does not determine which direction we should \ngo, but, I assert, we cannot do worse than the current inexplicable, \nincomprehensible Tax Code by which we are governed.\n  I applaud and commend Senator Grams for being bold enough, creative \nenough and, I might add, courageous enough to introduce a very broad, \ncomprehensive proposal to replace the current, clearly inequitable tax \nsystem. For too long the American people have suffered under the heavy \nchains of the oppressive regime we call our Tax Code. Each year, \nAmericans spend over 5.4 billion hours slaving away to comply with tax \nprovisions. That 5.4 billion hours is the equivalent amount of time it \ntakes to produce all the cars, all the trucks, and all the airplanes in \nthis country in 1 year. All of that energy, all of that productivity \ngoing to comply with the Tax Code.\n  A humble family of four will spend the equivalent of 2 weeks for Tax \nCode compliance. Ironically, every year $13.7 billion of the money that \ntaxpayers struggle to pay the Federal Government is expended in \nenforcing the code. They pay their taxes. They pay their tax bill, \n$13.7 billion of which goes to enforce that code. Yet the IRS, a \nbureaucracy of 110,000 people in over 650 offices around the country, \nprovides misinformation one out of every four times a taxpayer calls to \nseek assistance.\n  It is time that we act. We have made the Tax Code ever more complex. \nIn 1997, Senator Grams was very much involved in this. I am sure if \nSenator Sessions had been in the U.S. Senate at the time, he would have \nbeen involved in it. We made a serious attempt to ease the tax burden \non the American people. Senator Grams and I, on the House side, \nintroduced the $500-per-child tax credit. We said working families \ndeserved to have that; that the cost of rearing a child has increased \nand was never indexed for inflation. The per-child tax deduction \nnowhere near compensated for what it cost. We, in effect, said public \npolicy did not really value families, and we didn't really value \nchildren. We pushed for that, not only the $500-per child tax credit, \nbut this Senate and this Congress, for the first time in 16 years, \nreduced the tax burden on working Americans.\n  Even after that successful effort, the tax burden remains so high \nthat the average American family will spend more on taxes at the \nFederal, State, and local level than they will spend for food, for \nclothing, for housing, education and recreation all combined. That is \nhow much we are taking.\n  Even in 1997, when we sought to reduce the tax burden on the American \npeople, we had an undesired consequence. We were unwitting contributors \nto the complexity of the Tax Code, and we created even new \ncomplications, new deductions, new credits at that time when we were \ntrying to reduce taxes.\n  Mr. President, in the Senate we have a number of options before us in \n1999. We can ignore the plight of the American taxpayer, continue to \ncelebrate, so-called, these tax anniversaries. That is one option that \nwe have. No one has suggested we should not meet a full commitment to \nSocial Security. Sixty-two percent of the projected revenue surplus \nshould be set aside for Social Security. There is no debate about that. \nBoth parties agree about that.\n  We need to do much more. We need to take the opportunity with the \nremainder not to create new spending programs, but to lessen the burden \nupon the American people. We cannot ignore the plight of the American \ntaxpayer. We can continue with the status quo, or we can implement \nincremental reforms and try our best to make repairs to a house built \non shifting sand, as we have almost every year for the last 12 years.\n  Finally, we can lay a solid foundation for a new house by voting for \nreal reform. We can sunset the existing Tax Code, and we can pass a \nfairer and simpler and more understandable tax system, one that the \nAmerican people deserve.\n  I thank my colleague for his leadership. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for \njoining me this morning in talking about anniversary, as he mentioned, \nas not really a time to celebrate but to remember. As Senator \nHutchinson noted, it was he and I who, back in 1993 when\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\nwe were both in the House, worked to enact the $500-per-child tax \ncredit. We first introduced it in 1993, and finally got it signed into \nlaw in 1997. Today it makes up about 75 or 80 percent of all tax relief \nthis Congress has enacted in 4 years. It is just a small start, I \nthink, of what we really need to do as far as reform and additional tax \nrelief. I thank him for his help and all his support in getting it \npassed.\n\n  Again, I will just remind people why we are here talking about this. \nIt was in 1913, 86 years ago today, that the first income tax was \nlevied in this country, despite provisions laid out in the Constitution \nagainst that. It was passed in 1913. At that time it was only, as \nSenator Hutchinson said, a minor tax. Only about 1 percent of the \npeople in this country came under this income tax provision.\n  The first Tax Code was only 14 pages long. Today, as we know, it is \nwell over 10,000 pages, so complicated that even the most sophisticated \ntax lawyers cannot figure it out. As the Senator from Arkansas \nmentioned, if one calls the IRS for information or a question, they \nhave about a 50/50 chance of getting a correct answer. What we have is \na Tax Code, a tax system that is so complex, so abusive that it is no \nlonger efficient. To try and make even some minor reforms or \nadjustments to it, I always say, is like trying to put lipstick on a \npig. We cannot make it pretty. The thing we need to do is change it \ncompletely. We have talked about pulling it out by the roots and \nreplacing it. The Senator from Arkansas will be introducing the Tax \nCode Elimination Act which would sunset the current Tax Code as we know \nit and the IRS by January 1 of the year 2003. Some people may say that \nis a little irresponsible because we don't have a Tax Code system with \nwhich to replace it.\n  We have many ideas. I will be introducing a fair tax plan that would \nbe basically a national sales tax plan. It would eliminate all the \npayroll, the income tax, the estate tax, the corporate taxes, capital \ngains tax. It would basically eliminate all of those and replace them \nwith one simple tax at the point of sale, a consumption tax. One would \nnever have to file a tax return again. We wouldn't consume those \nbillions of dollars worth of hours it takes just to comply with the IRS \nregulations.\n  When people say we are irresponsible because we should have a Tax \nCode in place before we repeal the code, I always say that Congress \nloves to spend so much that it would not go 1 day without the ability \nto tax. If we can eliminate the Tax Code, Congress will work overtime \nto get a new Tax Code in place. I think it is something we need to \nstart doing and working on today.\n  Our income tax now has generated not the 1 percent of taxpayers, but \nover 21 percent of this Nation's income now goes to taxes. As I \nreferred to earlier, the Boston Tea Party was over one-half of 1 \npercent. Taxation without representation led to the tax revolt which \nbuilt this country. Yet today, we are taxed at these high rates.\n  I see my colleague from New Hampshire is here. I would like to \nrecognize him for any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. How much time is remaining in morning \nbusiness, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota has 1 minute remaining, after which the Senator from Ohio \nwill have 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave 5 minutes extending beyond the morning business time, no more than \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \nSenator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I \nthank my colleague, Mr. Voinovich, for not objecting.\n  I would like to compliment my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, \nfor his support on this issue. Mr. President, 1999 is the eighty-sixth \nanniversary of the Sixteenth Amendment and the collection of income \ntaxes by the Federal government. It is not an anniversary that we \nreally, in my view, ought to celebrate. As a matter of fact, I propose \nthat we mark the occasion by throwing out our existing tax code and \nstarting over from scratch.\n  The Tax Code Termination Act, which I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague, Senator Tim Hutchinson, and others to soon introduce, would \naccomplish just that goal. Our bill would sunset the Internal Revenue \nCode by December 31, 2003.\n  This year provides a good opportunity for the Senate to reexamine the \nincome tax and consider how the tax code has changed. As stated in the \nSalt Lake Tribune of Wednesday, January 27, 1999, the income tax is a \nrelatively new development:\n\n       France had an income tax in 1793 and Britain in 1799. With \n     a couple of short-lived exceptions, the United States \n     generally managed to get by without one until 1913. An income \n     tax was levied during the Civil War, but it was dropped after \n     a few years. Congress passed a 2 percent income tax on \n     individuals and business in 1894, but it was ruled \n     unconstitutional. The Constitution barred the federal \n     government from levying direct taxes except in proportion to \n     population. In 1913, the 16th Amendment to the Constitution \n     changed the rules, and an income tax was instituted.\n\n  Shortly after the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified in 1913, Congress \npassed the first income tax law. The Internal Revenue Service, then an \nobscure government agency, enforced the new law and collected the \nincome taxes.\n  Back then, the taxpayers got to keep most of their earnings. In 1913, \nthe income tax rate of 1 percent applied only to those making over \n$3,000 per year. Those making more than $20,000 paid a slightly higher \nsurtax. The highest rate of seven percent was imposed on all income \nabove $500,000. According to Peter Cleary of Americans for Tax Reform, \nin 1994 dollars, the one-percent income tax would apply on all income \nup to $250,000, while the seven percent rate would apply only to income \nabove $6 million.\n  Few people had to file returns in 1913. Only about 1 in 250 Americans \ndid.\n  Moreover, the original Form 1040 was brief and simple. As noted in \nyesterday's Washington Post Magazine, it consisted of just four pages, \nincluding one of instructions, and you would have finished calculating \nyour income by Line 7.\n  Since 1913, things have gotten more than a little out of hand. \nConsider these statistics:\n  Close to half of all Americans file a tax return today. Instead of \none form, there are many.\n  According to economist J.T. Young, the average family pays about 25% \nof its income in Federal, state and local taxes, and ``30 percent of \nevery additional dollar earned by a four-person median income household \nof $55,000 will go to pay taxes. Individuals and families earning \n$50,000 and above already pay 82 percent of total taxes and 91 percent \nof income taxes.''\n  The average middle-income taxpayer now has to work until at least May \nof each year just to meet all the federal, state and local taxes due.\n  The Tax Foundation has estimated that collectively, individuals \ndevote close to 2 billion hours to preparing tax returns each year.\n  It's no wonder that Americans dislike the current tax code. It is \nunnecessarily complex and overly burdensome.\n  Some of my constituents are especially upset about the fact that tax \nrevenues last year grew 9 percent, or twice as fast as the economy. \nConsider these comments from a man in Exeter, New Hampshire:\n\n       I have been reading and hearing about the tremendous budget \n     surpluses we can expect over the next ten years. . . . Where \n     is this money coming from and who authorized collecting it? \n     It seems to me that if the government has a surplus it's \n     because they're collecting more than they're spending. If \n     that's the case, why are they collecting more than they're \n     spending? I hope you realize that things like this are what \n     disenfranchise American citizens from their government.\n\n  How did we get to this point? Much of the blame lies with Congress. \nWe have changed the Federal tax code many times since 1913, turning it \ninto a tangled cobweb that few can understand. The changes have become \nmore complex and the tax rates have increased over the years.\n  What can we do about it? We can abolish the existing tax code and \npromptly adopt a new one that adheres to some basic rules:\n  First, we should have a tax code that is simple and fair.\n\n[[Page S2385]]\n\n  Second, our tax code should encourage savings and investment. The \ncurrent code distorts investment by creating incentives for Americans \nto use tax loopholes, rather than invest their money in more profitable \nways.\n  We should provide greater tax relief to the overburdened American \ntaxpayers. Tax cuts would provide American workers with more incentives \nto produce, because workers would be able to keep more of their \nearnings.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to urge my colleagues to support \nthe Tax Code Termination Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for talking about \nthe creative ways of taxing. This Congress has been so creative in \nfiguring out new ways to tax; I hope we can be creative in figuring out \nways to get rid of the tax.\n  Mr. President, I know we are out of time. I thank you very much. I \nyield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2385-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2385-S2388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WE OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I have devoted more than 30 years of my \nlife to public service. I have held elected office as mayor of the city \nof Cleveland, and I served as Governor of the State of Ohio. Now I am \nprivileged to serve the citizens of Ohio as one of their U.S. Senators. \nI am deeply honored by the confidence they have bestowed upon me.\n  They have placed their faith in my ability and my judgment to \nconsider and vote upon and bring to the forefront issues of national \nsignificance. It is for this reason that I have come to the Senate \nfloor to discuss what I consider to be the most serious financial and \neconomic threat facing our Nation today.\n  Through the tough choices made by Congress in passing the 1997 \nBalanced Budget Act, and through our continued strong economy, the days \nof escalating, crushing budget deficits appear to be coming to an end. \nIn Washington, politicians are saying we have turned the corner, and \nfor the first time in 30 years, we have a budget that shows a surplus.\n  If it is true, it would be brand new territory for many Americans. \nTens of millions were not even born yet when we had our last surplus. \nHowever, it is my contention that we do not yet have honest budget \nsurpluses, and unless we take bold steps, our actions will continue to \nleave our younger citizens and future generations liable for three \ndecades of massive deficits and a national debt that has made us the \ngreatest debtor nation in the world.\n  Prior to 1968, surpluses were not uncommon. But through President \nLyndon Johnson's expansion of the Vietnam war and the implementation of \nthe Great Society, we started to lose fiscal restraint.\n  A budget trick was implemented by the Johnson administration. It took \nthe off-budget Social Security trust funds, which were in true surplus, \nand commingled them with the regular budget which at that time was \nshowing a deficit. In this manner, Congress and subsequent Presidents \nwere able to mask annual budget deficits that contributed to a rising \nnational debt.\n  I would just like to point out, however, the years Social Security \nhas masked the true budget deficit that we have had and how it has \nimproved our budget situation.\n  If you go back to 1995, we reported that we had a budget deficit of \n$164 billion. The fact of the matter is we had a budget deficit of $226 \nbillion. And what we did was we reduced it by using the Social Security \nsurplus of $62 billion.\n  In 1996, we reported that we had a deficit of $107 billion. The fact \nis our budget deficit was $174 billion, and again we used Social \nSecurity to reduce that deficit.\n  Then, in 1997, we reported, oh, it is wonderful news, we had just a \nminus $22 billion deficit. The fact of the matter is we had a $103 \nbillion deficit, and we plastered it over with $81 billion of Social \nSecurity money.\n  Then, in 1998, we had the great celebration, the great surplus that \nwe talked about. The fact of the matter is that even in 1998, when we \nreported the first unified budget surplus, we still had a real deficit \nof $30 billion. Again, we used the $99 billion Social Security budget \nsurplus to hide the fact that we had a $30 billion deficit.\n  Again, this year, we are reporting we will have a $111 billion \nsurplus. The fact of the matter is, even this year, we will have a $16 \nbillion deficit; and again that has been covered over by the using of \nSocial Security.\n  And for the year 2000--the budget we are working on right now--we are \nreporting we will have a $133 billion surplus. The fact of the matter \nis, even this year, we are going to have a $5 billion deficit on \nbudget. We have covered that $5 billion up with $138 billion of surplus \nin the Social Security trust fund.\n  And next year we are celebrating the idea that maybe we are going to \nhave our first real honest to goodness on-budget surplus of $11 \nbillion. The fact of the matter is--and we will report a unified budget \nsurplus of $156 billion--but the truth is that we only have a real--\nreal--surplus of $11 billion.\n  Rather than attempting to enact policies that would bring us back to \nsurpluses, 30 years of financial gimmicks have ensued, so much that we \nran up a debt of $5.6 trillion in those intervening years from the time \nof Lyndon Johnson. Since the time my wife and I got married in 1962, \ninterest payments on the debt have gone from 6 cents on the dollar to \n14 cents on the dollar this past year. If we had had the same 6-percent \ninterest payment when we got married in 1962, Americans would have \nsaved $140 billion this year.\n  As the debt grew during the 1970s and 1980s, attempts were made to \nbring it under control. In 1985, Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings Act which required the unified budget to be split and the \nSocial Security trust funds kept separate. When Gramm-Rudman passed, I \nwas encouraged that finally we were going to get some truth in \nbudgeting.\n  At that time, I was mayor of Cleveland and I was serving as president \nof the National League of Cities. In 1985, the debt was $1.8 trillion. \nWe mayors felt the need to do our part to help reduce the debt. We did \nour share when we lost the CETA program, revenue sharing, one half of \nour community development block grant, and a complete loss of the Urban \nDevelopment Action Grant Program. When I left office after 10 years as \nmayor of the City of Cleveland, we had $79 million less a year from the \nFederal Government than we had when I came into office in 1979.\n  In order to make up that difference, first of all we did everything \nwe could to reduce costs. In many instances, cities across this country \nhad to increase their local income taxes or local taxes by over 50 \npercent to compensate for the loss of these Federal dollars. Much to \nour chagrin, our sacrifice did little to help reduce our annual \ndeficits or shrink our national debt. Indeed, the debt was $1.8 \ntrillion in 1985; today it is $5.6 trillion. If you go back to when I \nbecame mayor in 1979, the national debt was $780 billion; today, 20 \nyears later, it is $5.6 trillion. Listen to this: A 700-percent \nincrease in the country's national debt in a 20-year period.\n  We have a law that says Social Security trust funds are supposed to \nbe off budget, and we have the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 that \nremoves Social Security from deficit targets and other enforcement \ncalculations. But it was another law, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \nthat forced tough spending choices on Congress and on the \nadministration, making them live within their means for the first time \nin decades.\n  I congratulate the Members of Congress, those who supported the \nbalanced budget agreement of 1997. It is this law more than any other \nthat has given us the tools to help us now put our financial house in \norder. As a result, we are seeing a decrease in the on-budget deficit, \nwe are cutting down on spending, people are projecting surpluses, and \nthe Social Security trust funds are growing. There is a light at the \nend of the tunnel. But to get there, we must maintain our discipline \nand continue doing those things that will bring down our debt and honor \nour commitments to our citizens.\n  As this chart shows, if we stick to our guns, if we honor the caps in \nthe 1997 budget agreement, we might have an on-budget surplus starting \nin the year 2001 and a growing surplus thereafter. Here is what it \nlooks like: In 1999, if we stick to the balanced budget agreement, if \nwe don't invade the budget caps we have for the first time in 30\n\n[[Page S2386]]\n\nyears, we can begin the new century by having a true, real budget \nsurplus that will continue to grow.\n  But along comes the President with his fiscal year 2000 budget and \nprojections for 15 years into the future. In one fell swoop, he \nproposes a continuation of the ill-conceived policies that got us in \ntrouble in the first place. Under his budget, we still have unified \nbudget totals and the President has proposed to continue to use Social \nSecurity to pay for other government programs for at least the next 15 \nyears. We can't even show the 5 years beyond 2009 because there are no \nhard numbers from the administration so the Congressional Budget Office \ncan make projections. This is not truth in budgeting that the American \npeople expect or deserve, and I think it will lead to disastrous \nconsequences.\n  This chart shows what will happen if we follow the President's \nproposal to deal with the unified budget. In 1999, we will start \ndeveloping annual budget deficits that will take us down this crimson \npath to where we have been for the last 5 or 6 years.\n  Let me point out where we are going: The red line on the chart is the \ndeficit; this is the real deficit. Because we have had self-discipline, \nbecause we are honoring the budget agreement, we are seeing these red \ndeficit numbers get smaller. If the President's proposal goes into \neffect, we are going to go back to the old days. Instead of having this \nscenario at the beginning of the next decade, this scenario will be had \nunder the President's program.\n  Why is this important? First, the President says we have a budget \nsurplus in fiscal year 2000. This is simply not true. If you look at \nthe chart titled ``Real Budget Surplus,'' you will see again that \nfiscal year 2000 shows a real budget deficit of $5 billion. In fact, if \nyou look at the chart, we don't have a surplus this year--rather, a $16 \nbillion deficit.\n\n  What the President does is take the off-budget Social Security trust \nfunds and continue to use them to mask the deficit while saying he is \nsaving Social Security. It is a fraud. The President's surplus for this \nfiscal year, the next fiscal year, in fact, and for 14 fiscal years \nafter that, continues the gimmick of using the unified budget. It is \ndisingenuous. It continues to use billions of dollars of the Social \nSecurity trust fund to mask the true size of the budget and allows the \nPresident to put off making those tough budget decisions that we must \nmake. If we allow this to happen--the tough budget choices we have to \nmake today--we are in deep trouble.\n  We have a growing economy and we have the lowest unemployment we have \nseen at any time. If we can't as a nation make the tough decisions that \nwe need to make to turn things around and to have an on-budget surplus, \nif we can't do it now, we will never do it.\n  Second, the President not only busts the spending caps agreed upon in \nthe 1997 budget deal, he destroys them. These targeted caps are meant \nto keep our spending in check. But even before we debate a budget \nresolution for the coming fiscal year, we learn from Congressional \nBudget Office Director Dan Crippen that the President proposes to \nincrease, or ``blast,'' the caps by $30 billion--$30 billion. In fiscal \nyear 2000, we are supposed to face budget caps that will force us to \ncut $28 billion. It will take tough choices to meet these caps, but we \nmust show restraint if we are ever to bring our finances in order.\n  This is why I am pleased that the Republican leadership has given \ntheir assurance to maintain the caps so that we may demonstrate to the \nAmerican people that we are serious about the commitment. The \nRepublicans have also--this is really important, folks--committed to \nrestoring truth in budgeting by ensuring that 100 percent of Social \nSecurity trust funds are protected and not used for additional spending \nor tax cuts. In other words, the Social Security trust fund is off, it \nis off. We are locking it up. There will not be any tax reductions or \nnew spending with Social Security surpluses.\n  Third, the President is skirting a moral obligation that has been \nmade to our seniors and all future generations to fully preserve the \nsanctity of the Social Security system. Social Security is a sacred \ntrust between the Federal Government and every American.\n  That is why I firmly believe we need to get away from treating Social \nSecurity funds as part of the budget and wall it off from any \ntemptation to use it for purposes other than Social Security. As I say, \nwe need to ``put it in a lockbox.''\n  The President, on the other hand, wants to use the Social Security \ntrust funds to show that he has a budget surplus. As I said, there are \nbillions and billions of dollars meant for the Social Security trust \nfund that are supposed to be off budget. But he can't resist trying to \nmake those funds a part of the budget so he can mask the size of the \ndeficit and use any so-called surplus to pay for his agenda.\n  We have been playing games with Social Security for far too long. Do \nyou know what? It is time to stop.\n  Under the President's plan, only 62 percent of the unified surplus \nwould be devoted to Social Security. In fact, recently, the head of the \nSenate Budget Committee said only 58 percent of the unified surplus is \ngoing to be used to protect Social Security. This represents an actual \ndecrease from what we would allocate to Social Security if we were to \ntreat it as an off-budget item.\n  This is budgetary sleight of hand, and the President knows it. It is \nunconscionable for him to say that he is ``protecting and preserving'' \nSocial Security, when in reality he is taking money away from it and \nusing it to pay for other programs. No matter how well intentioned \nthose programs are, it is not the right thing to do.\n  Fourth, the President hinges his plan on budget surpluses that are \ncalculated far into the future.\n  As our Nation's premier economist, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan, testified before the Senate Budget Committee:\n\n       We cannot confidently project large surpluses in our \n     unified budget over the next 15 years, given the inherent \n     uncertainties of budget forecasting.\n\n  Greenspan goes on to say:\n\n       How can we ignore the fact that virtually all forecasts of \n     the budget balance have been wide of the mark in recent \n     years?\n\n  In a January 1999 report to Congress, the Congressional Budget Office \nwrote that an error on the projection of the budget surplus in 2009, \nand based on previous averages, could be ``equal to 13 percent of \nprojected outlays [and] would produce a swing of $300 billion.''\n  The Cincinnati Post, in an editorial on February 10, said: ``There's \none thing wrong with budget forecasts: they are inevitably wrong.''\n  Is it prudent to take that kind of risk with our children's future? I \ndon't think so. If we go along with these four points, we will have no \ncredibility with the American people. And to regain credibility, we \nmust put an end to the game playing and restore truth in budgeting.\n  When we--the Congress and the administration--are forced to make the \nhard choices that we were sent here to make, we often try to do what we \nbelieve our constituents want us to do. However, what they want, I \nthink, is quite simple; they want us to tell the truth. They want us to \nstop using smoke and mirrors to say that the Nation's financial house \nis in order. They want us to give them enough credit to know the \ndistinction between what we do and what we say. The American people \nwant us to make the tough choices.\n  Two weeks ago, I was faced with one of those tough choices. The \nSenate debated legislation that would expand the pay and retirement \nbenefits of our men and women in uniform. I want you to know that there \nis nobody who supports our Armed Forces more than I, and no one \nbelieves more than I that we should provide as many incentives as \npossible to retain these quality troops in our military.\n  However, we cannot continue to pass legislation without first dealing \nwith its consequences. That bill would have authorized an increase in \nour country's financial liabilities by approximately $55 billion over \nthe next 10 years. Because we had no idea how to pay for it or if it \nwould fall within the budget caps, I felt it necessary to vote ``no.'' \nIt was a tough choice, but I felt it was necessary.\n  When I became mayor of Cleveland, the city was in default. It was the \nfirst city in America to go into default since the depression. To get \nthe city out of its financial abyss, I had to make tough choices. As a \nresult of our actions, we were able to turn the city's default into a \nsurplus, and Cleveland\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\nnow enjoys an economic renaissance it has not seen in generations.\n  As Governor, I again had to make hard choices in each and every \nbudget in order to meet our constitutional obligation to balance our \nbudget. When I became Governor of Ohio in 1991, our State faced an over \n$1 billion budget deficit. In order to balance the budget, I had to \nmake four cuts over 2 years totaling $711 million. I was picketed by \ncollege students--5,000 of them outside the State House, who were told \nby the university people that I was cutting higher education and their \ntuition costs were going to go up. And I was picketed, at the same \ntime, by welfare recipients who marched on the capitol because we cut \nout general assistance for able-bodied people. But we had to get our \nfinancial house in order. Somebody had to make the tough decisions.\n\n  As a result, today Ohio is spending a record amount of money on \nprograms to help children. In addition, we have been able to cut State \nincome taxes for 3 straight years, including an almost 10-percent \nacross-the-board tax cut this year. In other words, when the taxpayers \nof Ohio, this year, file their 1998 returns, their income tax will be \nalmost 10 percent less than it would have been without our good \nmanagement.\n  Ohio has a general revenue rainy day fund of over $935 million and a \nMedicaid rainy day fund of $100 million, so in the future we can avoid \ndeep cuts in vital services or tax increases just in case there is a \ndownturn in the economy. Ohio is in better shape today because we were \nable to make the hard choices.\n  Every day, millions of Americans have to make hard spending choices, \ntoo. They have to pay their bills, pay their mortgages, put food on the \ntable, and buy clothes for their children. They have budgets and they \nknow they have to live within their means. Unlike the administration, \nwhen most people have extra money, they don't go out and start to spend \nit wildly. They tend to their finances, they save, they pay off their \ncredit cards and loans, and they invest in homes and businesses.\n  That brings us back to what we would do with whatever on-budget \nsurplus we achieve. What are we going to do with it if we get it? The \nfirst thing is, I will believe it when I see it. I am a ``doubting \nThomas'' about whether we really will see it. But if we do get an on-\nbudget surplus, what we need to do is be wise and leave it alone. Why \nthe rush to spend it? Why the rush to lower taxes? We don't even know \nif we have it. If we do get it, we should leave it alone and give it a \nchance to accumulate.\n  If we cannot guarantee--and we cannot--that we are going to have an \non-budget surplus, then we have no right to start committing dollars \nthat we don't have.\n  If and when we get an on-budget, or ``real,'' surplus, it is our \nmoral obligation to our children to pay them back by using any such \nsurplus to pay down our current debt. We have stuck these pages who are \nstanding in front of me with a big bill. We have an obligation to pay \nthat debt down so part of the income taxes they pay in the future \naren't to pay off the interest on debts they had nothing to do with \nduring their time of growing up.\n  I want you to know that this isn't just my opinion about paying down \nthe debt. It is the opinion of experts like Federal Reserve Chairman \nAlan Greenspan, CBO Director Dan Crippen, and GAO Comptroller David \nWalker. They agree that it is the best use of these funds--pay down the \nnational debt.\n  Not only is it a moral obligation, but this course of action makes \ngreat economic sense for four reasons. I think this is really important \nbecause a lot of people say: ``Reduce the taxes'' and ``This is really \ngoing to be the thing that is going to make a big difference.'' I say: \nReduce the deficit, bring it down, and here are the reasons why.\n  First of all, it will decrease the overall interest paid on the debt, \nand that is important because paying off the debt lowers the interest. \nWhen you lower the interest, what do you do? You lower the cost of \nGovernment, and that makes more money available for other purposes.\n  No. 2, Alan Greenspan will tell you that it helps allow the economy \nto expand.\n  No. 3, it lowers the interest rate for individual citizens, which is \na big deal. According to Alan Greenspan, it lets people afford to buy \nhomes or refinance their mortgages, and it puts real money into the \npockets of tens of millions of Americans.\n  Just think about it. As we got our house in order and interest rates \ncame down, think of the millions of Americans who have refinanced their \nhomes, and those who are able to buy automobiles today because interest \nrates are down. If we bring the national debt down and don't follow \nwhat the President wants to do, to use the unified surplus, we will \nkeep those interest rates down. That is real money in your pocket.\n  Last but not least, paying down the debt lowers the amount of taxes \nthe Government would need from the American people, according to the \nBusiness Roundtable.\n  Using only on-budget surplus funds for debt reduction prevents us \nfrom making false promises to the American people. One of the biggest \nassumptions associated with the treatment of surplus funds is an \nindefinite continuation of our current period of economic growth.\n  Blending that assumption with the use of a unified budget surplus is \na volatile mix since no one can predict how long this period of growth \nwill last. Optimistic surplus estimates could fluctuate wildly over the \nnext few years, with unknown consequences.\n  As most of my colleagues know, within ten years, the ``baby-boomers'' \nwill start to become eligible for Social Security and the sheer size of \ntheir numbers will present a challenge to maintain the viability of the \nSocial Security system. In order to honor the contract we entered into \nwith these individuals, it is our obligation to ensure that we have the \nnecessary funds.\n  A unified budget surplus raids the ``offbudget'' Social Security \nfunds and replaces them with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of \nIOU's for our children and grandchildren. This is not the legacy we \nshould leave.\n  We are bankrupting the futures of generations yet unborn because we \nhave a hard time saying no. Well, it is time to start owning-up to our \nobligations and meeting our responsibilities, because ladies and \ngentlemen, Social Security is a sacred trust.\n  Unfortunately, too many people have become cynical that we don't have \na commitment to Social Security. For example, citizens like my son, \nGeorge--people in their 20's, their 30's and even their 40's--don't \never expect to see a dime of Social Security in their lifetime.\n  What they know is that Uncle Sam has been taking money out of one \npocket via payroll taxes, and taking money out of the other pocket via \nincome taxes and the Government just puts it all together and uses it \nfor what it wants.\n  They've been told that their money is ``in there'' for them when they \nretire, but when Congress and the Administration play shell games with \nthe trust funds, no one believes it.\n  It is a sad commentary that there is such little faith in the \npromises made by our government. However, this cynicism is given \ncredence when we continue to use Social Security trust funds to hide \nour excesses.\n  I firmly believe that it is our moral obligation to honor the \ncommitments we have made to our citizens on Social Security, instill \ntruth-in-budgeting, clean up the financial messes we have made and \nprovide for all of the generations that follow, a nation that is better \nthan we received.\n  Behind my desk on my computer, I have a screen-saver picture of my 2-\nyear-old granddaughter, Mary Faith. She is the joy of our lives. She is \na wonderful little girl. We have lots of hope and promise for her. But \nshe has no idea the decisions we are making now are going to affect her \nfinancial future. And those decisions are being made by her \ngrandfather, other Members of the Senate and Congress and the \nadministration.\n  She has no idea that on the day she was born--Mary Faith was born on \nDecember 29, 1996--she immediately became responsible for a whopping \n$187,000 bill from the Federal Government on interest that she is going \nto have to pay over her lifetime. And that is on a debt her \ngrandfather's generation ran up for our own benefit.\n  I prefer the picture of Mary Faith on my screen saver, this picture \nright here, which says ``Sentenced to\n\n[[Page S2388]]\n\nRepay.'' That is the next generation of Americans--``Sentence to \nRepay'' the debt we didn't have the guts to pay for during our \nlifetime.\n  Any day this week Mary Faith is going to have a new brother or \nsister. And, Mr. President, we are actually expecting her brother or \nsister on Friday of this week, and I want to let you know that for sure \nI will not be here if we have any rollcall votes on Friday.\n  While nothing can surpass the joy our family will feel on this \nspecial day, I can't help but think that like my granddaughter, Mary \nFaith, he or she is going to receive a bill from this Government for \nthe interest on the debt that he or she had nothing to do with. And \nthat bill is going to be even larger than the one we gave to Mary Faith \n2 years ago.\n  We have been reaping all the benefits and putting the future of all \nour children and grandchildren in jeopardy through a ``we buy now, you \npay later'' philosophy. I cannot convey how wrong I think it is to \nsaddle them with such an excessive financial burden that we now, this \nCongress, have the ability to correct.\n  That is why I feel debt repayment is the wisest use of any on-budget \nsurplus. It is plain common sense, and it would be the greatest gift we \ncould ever give to our future generations.\n  Mr. President, each year, on the anniversary of President George \nWashington's birthday, a U.S. Senator is given the privilege of reading \nWashington's Farewell Address on the floor of this Senate. It is a \ntradition that dates back nearly 100 years. This year, I had the \ndistinct honor to read this wonderful document, the first Ohioan who \nhas had the privilege of reading that farewell address since Bob Taft \ngave it back in 1939, 60 years ago.\n  As I prepared for the speech and I read through his words, \nWashington's words, I was particularly taken by the relevance today of \none of President Washington's admonitions to a young United States of \nAmerica. Here is what he said 200 years ago.\n\n       [avoid] the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning \n     occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of \n     peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have \n     occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the \n     burden which we ourselves ought to bear.\n\n  Those were very, very wise words of President Washington, and they \nring true today as well as they rang true during his day. I believe it \nis our duty to heed them. We owe that to all our Nation's children and \nour grandchildren.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, last Friday, on behalf of Senator Bob \nKerrey and myself, I introduced legislation that will chart a new \nUnited States approach to the terrible problem of child exploitation in \noverseas labor markets.\n  This legislation, S. 553, the International Child Welfare Protection \nAct, will target new, additional trade benefits to countries that \ncomply with the provisions of the International Labor Organization's \nConvention No. 138 concerning the minimum age for admission to \nemployment, also known as the Minimum Age Convention.\n  The aim of the Minimum Age Convention is to abolish child labor \nthroughout the world by establishing a minimum age at which children \nmay be employed.\n  Our legislation will do two things:\n  It will give the President the authority to grant a country that \ncomplies with the Minimum Age Convention up to a 50-percent tariff rate \ncut on items produced in that country that would not otherwise be \neligible for preferential tariff rates.\n  It will also permit the President to waive current limitations on the \namounts of additional goods that countries complying with the Minimum \nAge Convention may export to the United States.\n  In the unlikely event the President finds that domestic industries \nare hurt because of these special, targeted trade benefits, the \nPresident also has the authority to suspend, limit, or withdraw the \nbenefits.\n  This legislation is important for three reasons.\n  First, it is a tragic fact that child labor is rampant in many places \nin the world, despite more laws aimed at stopping this inhumane \npractice. International Labor Organization statistics show that between \n100 and 200 million children worldwide are engaged in providing goods \nand services. Ninety-five percent of these children, according to the \nILO, work in developing countries. Why are children pressed into \nservice as low-paid or unpaid workers? Because, according to the ILO, \nchildren are ``generally less demanding, more obedient, and less likely \nto object to their treatment or conditions of work.'' It is very \nobvious that we must all do what we can to stop this unconscionable \npractice.\n  The second reason we need this legislation is because it is clear \nthat regulation and enforcement alone will not work. Incentives are \nneeded as well. The reason that it is so tough to enforce child labor \nstandards is that it is often very difficult to trace specific products \nto specific plants in specific countries. The Department of Labor's \nBureau of International Labor Affairs says that quantifying the extent \nof child labor in a particular country's export industry ``can seldom \nbe done with specificity.'' If you can't even trace the goods or \nservices with certainty, you can't expect enforcement alone to be the \nanswer. Hence the incentives that are in our legislation.\n  Finally, we need this legislation because even though the ILO Minimum \nAge Convention was adopted in 1973, only 21 developing country member \nstates out of 173 ILO member states have ratified the Convention to \nstop child labor. Out of the 21 developing country member states that \nhave ratified the Convention, none is from Asia, where over half of all \nworking children are to be found. If even one additional ILO member \nstate ratifies the Convention because of the trade incentives this \nlegislation offers, we will have achieved a great deal.\n  I am on the floor today stating again what is obvious but also to \nremind my colleagues, with the introduction of this bill by Senator \nKerrey of Nebraska and myself on Friday, you have an opportunity to \ncosponsor this bill, and I hope you will do so. I hope then that we \nhave results from legislation which we have already on the books to \nenforce regulation, but we also have results from these efforts that \nare presented in our legislation for a more market-oriented approach to \nhelping solve this bad economic situation of very young child labor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that S. 553 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 553\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, in a short while we will begin the debate \nagain on the Ed-Flex bill that has been on the floor for the last \nseveral weeks. It is a bipartisan bill. Democrats and Republicans alike \nare supporting this bill. It is a simple bill, essentially, that will \nallow some of our school districts to be more flexible with their \neducation dollars; for the liability for some of the waivers to be \ntransferred from the Department of Education directly to the Governors, \nso the Governors in our States can provide some of the waivers based on \nsome specific clauses that are in the bill. Essentially, it is a matter \nof paperwork being moved from the Nation's Capital to the Governors' \ndesks. It is a bill, again, that is supported broadly.\n  I have come to the floor numerous times over the last week to talk \nabout an amendment which I hope to offer today regarding class size \nreduction. A year ago, the President talked about the most important \ngoal in education, one of the most important goals we have--that of \nreducing class size in grades 1 through 3. Studies have shown us \nconsistently that reducing class size in those grades makes a \ntremendous difference in the learning of young children--in their math, \nreading, language scores, and in their ability to go on to college. It \nimproves discipline problems, as shown by numerous studies that I, \nagain, hope to be able to talk about once my amendment comes to the \nfloor.\n  We talked about this amendment all last year during the session. \nThen, in a bipartisan bill last October, in the budget process we \npassed the beginning phase of reducing class size and began a \ncommitment to this country that we would help our schools across this \ncountry begin to reduce class sizes in grades 1 through 3, where it \nmakes a difference. It was a bipartisan effort last year. It should be \na bipartisan effort this year.\n\n  This is a critical issue right now in this country, today, where \nschool boards across our country are looking for whether or not we just \nmade some kind of political offering last October, right before the \nelections, or whether we really meant it when we said we were going to \njoin with our schools across this country in this commitment to reduce \nclass size.\n  It is extremely timely that this Senate go on record right now with a \ncommitment to our school districts, to let them know that we are there \nfor them, that this wasn't just a fly-by-night political operation in \nOctober, it was a commitment from us at the Federal level to work hand \nin hand with schools across this country to begin to reduce class size. \nMy amendment will authorize this program for the next 6 years. It is \nextremely important, because our school boards right now are putting \ntheir budgets together. They are determining what kind of money they \nwill have.\n  They want to know, is this real or is this not, because they begin \nright now the process of hiring teachers to begin next fall. They do \nnot want to hire a teacher, find out we did not really mean it last \nOctober, and make that commitment. They want to know whether we stand \nthere ready, confirmed, and committed to this process. That is why it \nis so critical that we go on the record now with the class size \nauthorization bill.\n  I hope to offer that today. I am looking forward to working with my \nRepublican colleagues, again, in a bipartisan effort to let our school \nboards know we are with them in this critical process. We will \nobviously have other times to talk about this, certainly in the \nappropriations committees, as we did last year. I know we will have a \nbig discussion on it in the budget. It is extremely important that we \nmake this kind of commitment now.\n  I have heard my colleagues from the Republican side say that Ed-Flex \nneeds to go cleanly right now, because it is bipartisan and because it \nis timely. The same goes for class size reduction. It is timely, so \nschool boards can make those commitments, and it is bipartisan, if we \nall believed what we said and how we voted last October.\n  I really hope I can work with my Republican colleagues to, again, put \nthis amendment up this afternoon or whenever the majority leader \nagrees, have a time commitment to it. I am willing to negotiate that. \nIf it can be done quickly, that is fine by me. We need to have an up-\nor-down vote on this amendment, and we need to do it as quickly as \npossible.\n  I, too, want the Ed-Flex bill to pass. This is an amendment I think \nis critical and important and timely, and I hope to work with my \nRepublican colleagues to make sure it happens today. I am looking \nforward to our discussion, which will begin in about a half hour. I \nhope to offer my amendment and to work with all of our colleagues on \nthe floor to send a message that we do believe in this U.S. Senate that \nreducing class size in 1 through 3 is a commitment we can and should \nmake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2389-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2389-S2390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      KNOW-YOUR-CUSTOMER AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on Friday, an amendment was offered to the \nEd-Flex bill to block implementation of certain regulations which the \nbanking regulators had proposed for financial institutions to establish \nKnow-Your-Customer programs. That amendment is still pending before the \nSenate. On Friday, my colleague from the Banking Committee, Senator \nSarbanes, made a number of thoughtful comments about the pending \namendment. Today, I would like I to express some concerns about it as \nwell.\n  First, like Senator Sarbanes, I am struck by the irony of dealing \nwith an amendment that addresses banking issues wholly unrelated to \neducation, at the same time Democrats are being denied an opportunity \nto offer amendments on educational issues much more relevant to the Ed-\nFlex bill before us.\n  Be that as it may, this banking issue has been put before us. And \nlike all of\n\n[[Page S2390]]\n\nmy colleagues, I voted on Friday against tabling the pending amendment. \nI voted against tabling, because I think the amendment properly \ncriticizes the proposed regulations for failing to protect ordinary \nlaw-abiding citizens from possibly unreasonable and invasive scrutiny \nby their financial institutions.\n  At the same time, my vote against tabling was not a general \nendorsement of the amendment. To the contrary, like the proposed \nregulations it criticizes, the amendment is not drafted as carefully as \nit should be.\n  The first part of the amendment prohibits the banking agencies from \npublishing ``in final form'' the flawed regulations proposed in \nDecember. I support that prohibition. But the second part of the \namendment goes much farther. It also prohibits the banking agencies \nfrom proposing any regulation ``which is substantially similar to'' the \nproposals condemned in the first part.\n  The question is what ``substantially similar'' means.\n  If it means that the banking agencies should not propose know-your-\ncustomer regulations without including adequate privacy protections, \nthat is fine. But if means that the agencies may not propose any know-\nyour-customer regulations, no matter how finely tuned and protective of \nprivacy, then the amendment is a serious mistake. If it means that \nagencies are not only prohibited from issuing regulations but should \nalso start dismantling their existing know-your-customer practices, the \namendment is a disaster.\n  I say that because know-your-customer programs are today a key part \nof law enforcement efforts to stop money laundering. Virtually all \nmajor financial institutions operating in the United States today have \nwell developed know-your-customer programs, and U.S. bank examiners \nalready routinely test the adequacy and effectiveness of these \nprograms. For example, existing examination procedures testing bank \ncompliance with the most important anti-money laundering statute on the \nbooks, the Bank Secrecy Act, already spell out the elements of an \nadequate know-your-customer program and test that program as part of \nits ``core analysis.''\n  The purpose of these know-your-customer programs is to stop financial \ninstitutions from unwittingly helping criminals to launder illegal \nproceeds.\n  Ten or twenty years ago, if an individual walked into a U.S. bank \nwith a million dollars stuffed into a duffel bag and asked the bank to \nwire the money to an offshore account in a foreign country, most banks \nwould have done so with few or no questions asked. And the bank would \nhave collected a nice fee for arranging the wire transfer.\n  But that was before the United States embarked upon a world-wide, \nintensive effort to educate banks and foreign governments about the \nbenefits of battling crime by stopping money laundering. The goals are \nto make banks wary of moving funds for criminals, to seize illegal \nfunds in the banking system, and to put money launderers in jail and \nout of business.\n  Congress has played a key role in the advancement of this law \nenforcement strategy. For example, the subcommittee on which I am the \nranking minority member, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \nheld landmark hearings 15 years ago on how criminals were using \nfinancial institutions in the United States to launder their funds. The \nHouse and Senate Banking Committees have held numerous hearings over \nthe years outlining the problem and proposing legislation to detect and \nstop money laundering.\n  In the last Congress, the House Banking Committee held a series of \nhearings and the Congress passed H.R. 1756, the Money Laundering and \nFinancial Crimes Strategy Act. In this Congress, the leading crime bill \nproposed by the majority, S. 5, the Drug-Free Century Act, contains an \nentire title devoted to ``money laundering deterrence.'' Still another \nbill, H.R. 4005, the Money Laundering Deterrence Act of 1998, which \npassed the House by voice vote last year but was not brought before the \nSenate actually directed the banking agencies to propose know-your-\ncustomer regulations within 120 days.\n  That's because virtually all money-laundering experts will tell you \nthat know-your-customer programs are one of the most important tools \nfinancial institutions have to prevent money laundering. Two examples \nexplain why as well as illustrate how a sensible idea can be pushed too \nfar.\n  First, suppose a stranger walks into a bank with a million dollars in \nsmall bills and asks the bank to wire the cash to a foreign bank \naccount. Should the bank wire the money and then, after the customer is \ngone, report the transaction to law enforcement, or should the bank \nfirst determine who the customer is and, if not satisfied, decline to \ntransfer the money? To me, the answer is clear that the bank should \ndetermine who the customer is before moving any money.\n  Second example. Suppose a longtime customer of the bank with a modest \nsavings account deposits $3,000 into that savings account. Should the \nbank report that $3,000 deposit to law enforcement? To me, the answer \nis obviously no. That type of report would unreasonably invade the \ncustomer's privacy, as well as be a waste of time for law enforcement.\n  Surely, we can design regulations that distinguish between these two \nexamples. At a minimum, different rules should apply to customers \nholding assets or conducting transactions below a specified threshold. \nWe already do that with currency transaction reports, and the same \ncould and should be done with know-your-customer programs. Additional \nprivacy protections should be provided to prohibit banks from using \nknow-your-customer data for purposes other than law enforcement, such \nas to sell products to the customer or sell the customer's personal \ndata to third parties.\n  I do not support the current know-your-customer proposals, because \nthey do not include these and other privacy protections.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment before the Senate, in its zeal to \ncondemn the proposed regulations, goes too far. The first section, \nwhich prohibits the banking agencies from finalizing the regulations as \nproposed in December, is fine. But the second section, which also \nprohibits them from publishing ``substantially similar'' regulations, \nis ambiguous and troubling.\n  It is my hope that the supporters of the amendment do not intend to \nreverse the gains of the last twenty years and free banks of any \nobligation to know who their customers are. It is my hope that their \nintent is to protect ordinary law-abiding customers, but to keep the \nheat on money launderers by maintaining longstanding requirements that \nbanks ask appropriate questions. It is my hope that their intent to \nrequire the agencies to correct the flaws in the proposed regulations, \nbut not block all know-your-customer regulations no matter how narrowly \nor carefully drawn.\n  The pending amendment could easily be clarified. However, given the \ncurrent parliamentary situation, it is not clear that anyone will be \npermitted to offer the additional language. If no clarification is \nprovided, I want the record to show that my support for the amendment \nis based on the understanding that the amendment's ban on \n``substantially similar'' regulations is a ban on know-your-customer \nregulations that lack adequate privacy protections for ordinary, law \nabiding individuals. It is not a ban on all future know-your-customer \nregulations, no matter how carefully drafted.\n  Financial privacy is an important issue. It needs to be addressed. \nSenator Sarbanes is working on a comprehensive financial privacy bill \nthat I hope this body is given an opportunity to consider. It is \nunfortunate that we are being asked to address an important aspect of \nthe financial privacy debate in such a rushed and inappropriate \ncontext. Which brings me back to Senator Sarbanes' original question \nabout why we are adding banking amendments to an education bill instead \nof the education amendments America wants and needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2390-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2390-S2391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATIONS TO JOHN Q.

UDALL\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, yesterday this body paid tribute to one \nof the greatest men to serve in Congress in the twentieth century, \nMorris ``Mo'' Udall from Arizona. Yesterday, I was proud to sign the \nresolution honoring him, and I would like to pay tribute to him now.\n  Mo Udall was a giant. For thirty years, he straddled politics in \nArizona and America. He was a statesman as well as a legislator, and an \nintellectual as well as a politician. Although Mo believed passionately \nin many causes and was a Democrat through and through, his wit and \nwarmth helped him forge many productive, bipartisan relationships with \nhis colleagues across the aisle. Mo's intelligence, commitment, and \npersonal touch helped him create a legislative legacy that still shines \nbright today, almost forty years since he entered the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  As everyone who follows public affairs knows, Mo Udall hailed from a \nfamily with a rich tradition in politics and public service. His \nancestors were pioneers who helped transform the Arizona Territory into \na great state. Mo entered Congress after winning a special election in \n1961 to replace his brother, Stewart, whom President Kennedy had tapped \nto head the Department of the Interior.\n  Today, the Udall name continues to resonate in Congress. Mo's son, \nMark, and his nephew, Tom, both were elected to the House in 1998. I \nknow they will carry on the great tradition of public service and \nCongressional achievement set by their fathers.\n  Mo was such a modest and easy-going man that one sometimes overlooks \nthe enormity of his legislative record. After rising to the \nchairmanship of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, a \nposition he held until his retirement in 1991, Mo wrote much of the \nnation's most important environmental legislation. He pushed through \nimportant regulations concerning land, water, mineral, and timber use. \nMo also helped reform America's postal system and our campaign finance \nlaws, and he was instrumental in reforming the seniority system in \nCongress.\n  In addition to being a great legislator, Mo Udall was a great man. He \nbridged divisions and always sought to bring people together to work \nfor the good of the country.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I believe Mo's wit and self-deprecating \nmanner were largely responsible for his successes. Perhaps the best way \nto illustrate his humor is to relate a joke he loved to tell about one \nof his campaign visits to New Hampshire during his 1996 Presidential \nrace. At one stop, Mo approached a group of men to tell them he was \nrunning for President, only to be told, ``Yes, we were just laughing \nabout that.''\n  Mr. President, if ever a public servant deserved to be taken \nseriously, it was Mo Udall. It is a sign of his stature as a man that \ndespite his many accomplishments, he never took himself too seriously.\n  Today I am honored to pay my respects to my friend Mo Udall, whose \nlegacy of public service and bipartisan achievement will be remembered \nfor many lifetimes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2391-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO CHARLES PAONE OF REVERE, MASSACHUSETTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, next week, on March 17th, St. Patrick's \nDay, one of Revere, Massachusetts' finest sons, Charles Paone, will \ncelebrate his 90th birthday. Charlie, as he is known by his many \nfriends, has spent most of his life in his hometown of Revere. He \ngraduated from Immaculate Conception High School in 1927, and went on \nto Georgetown University, graduating in 1931. After college, Charlie \nreturned to Massachusetts and attended Boston College Law School, \nreceiving his law degree from that outstanding college in 1935.\n  Charlie was inducted into the Army in 1942, where he served with \ndistinction in the 209th Counter Intelligence Corps. He's been a member \nof the American Legion for more than 50 years, and he's been very \nactive in his post. He has also been a member of the Knights of \nColumbus for more than 60 years, and is a past Grand Knight. In 1981 he \nretired from the Revere Public School System after four decades of \noutstanding service.\n  Charlie is loved by his family and friends as a wonderful role model \nwho is always willing to go the extra mile for those in need, whether \nit's helping someone with their taxes or providing a ride to the local \nstore for groceries. And, of course, all of us in the Senate know \nCharlie's nephew Marty, who does an excellent job as our Secretary for \nthe Minority.\n  In many ways, our country is great today because of Americans like \nCharlie of the World War II generation. They served their country far \nabove and beyond the call of duty in the war, and they came back from \nthe war to rebuild the nation on the home front and make America the \ngreat country it is today. Tom Brokaw, in his current number one best-\nseller, calls them ``The Greatest Generation,'' and it's leaders like \nCharlie that he's writing about.\n  It's a privilege to join Charlie's family and friends in wishing him \na very happy 90th birthday and a very happy St. Patrick's Day, and to \ncommend him for all that he has done for his family, his friends, his \ncommunity, and our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2391-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2391-S2392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BENJAMIN H. HARDY, JR.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am honored to rise this morning to \npay tribute to a distinguished American and a great Georgia visionary. \n50 years ago, Benjamin H. Hardy, Jr., was one of the primary architects \nof a new foreign policy initiative that became known as President \nTruman's ``Point Four,'' a program of technical assistance to help the \npeople of developing nations. This bold and revolutionary program \nbecame an important tenant of American foreign policy, helping people \naround the world improve their lives.\n  Mr. Hardy was a distinguished student at the University of Georgia, \ngraduating with a BA in journalism in 1928. After graduation, he worked \nas a journalist and later as a public affairs officer for the \nDepartments of Defense and State. His service at the Department of \nState required him to draft the foreign policy portion of President \nTruman's 1949 inaugural address. The address cited four basic points of \nAmerican foreign policy: (1) Support for the United Nations; (2) \ncontinuation of the Marshall Plan; (3) military cooperation with \nWestern allies; and (4) a ``bold new program'' of technical assistance \nto people in developing nations. This last point was based on what Mr. \nHardy had seen of the economic needs in South America during World War \nII. According to some accounts, he included it in the draft of \nPresident Truman's speech at considerable risk to his own career.\n\n[[Page S2392]]\n\n  But it was the last concept, point four, which received widespread \nacclaim and that, in time, became a major component of American foreign \npolicy. In 1950, this ``Point Four'' policy was approved by Congress in \nthe form of a mandate to create the Technical Cooperation \nAdministration (TCA) within the State Department. It was this ``bold \nnew program'' drafted by Mr. Hardy that later developed into the Agency \nfor International Development and which, perhaps, was the seed for the \nestablishment of the Peace Corps. These were truly forward-looking \nconcepts.\n  During this period, Mr. Hardy served as the chief of public affairs \nfor the TCA and the chairman of its policy planning council. \nTragically, on December 23, 1951, Mr. Hardy, along with the Director of \nthe TCA, was killed in a plane crash on a flight from Cairo to Teheran. \nIt is a shame that Benjamin Hardy did not have the opportunity to see \nhis concept take root and grow as he would have had it.\n  Fifty years after Mr. Hardy drafted the Point Four speech, it is \nfitting that we in Congress pay tribute to the vision and courage of \nthis man, his contribution to American foreign policy, and his \ncommitment to improving the lives of people around the world. Ideas \nlike Benjamin Hardy's have helped demonstrate the generosity of the \nAmerican people around the world. And it is such ideas that have helped \nAmerica remain engaged as the world's leader, helping to build a better \nfuture for all people. Mr. President, it is my honor to recognize this \ndistinguished American from Georgia and to inform my colleagues of his \nproud heritage. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2392-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts \nthat I desire to make a statement for a while, if that is all right \nwith him.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we are again back with the Ed-Flex bill, \nwhich is a bill, as everybody knows, that would merely attempt to make \nit easier for States to be able to utilize regulations to their \nadvantage by being able to waive them for communities or school systems \nwithin their jurisdiction. This has been used successfully by 12 States \nnow--6 originally, and then another 6. It has demonstrated that there \nare problems in the present system which make it impossible to take \ncare of very, very minute differences in schools in order to get them \nto be able to have the flexibility for the utilization of the title I \nfunds.\n  We are also facing, apparently, a filibuster. Therefore, we will have \na cloture vote at 5 o'clock this afternoon. It is my hope that we can \nproceed perhaps on to another amendment, and then we will be able to \nmake some progress on this bill.\n  This is our fourth day on the Ed-Flex bill. This bill, which is \nsupported by the administration and all 50 Governors, has broad \nbipartisan support in both the Senate and in the House. I urged my \ncolleagues last week to limit their amendments to the bill before us. \nAs we have shown, we are perfectly willing to work with the limited \nissues raised by the Ed-Flex bill.\n  As my colleagues know, later this year we will be considering the \nstatute that governs the K-through-12 educational programs, the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, and that is where the debate on \nthese larger questions should take place. I say this not because I am a \nstickler for procedure, but because the whole point behind the \ncommittee system is so that complicated issues can be debated and \nexamined in detail. That is not possible on the floor of the Senate. \nThis doesn't happen in every instance, and I have been on both sides of \nthe question, but I cannot recall when we have been in a similar \nsituation where one side is trying to load up a small, noncontroversial \nproposal when the logical vehicle for the debate and consideration of \nthese larger questions is only a few months away.\n  We have never really considered these issues in committee. To be \nfair, Senator Murray offered her class size amendment to the Ed-Flex \nbill last year. But Republicans felt then, as we feel now, that this \nissue should be considered as part of the ESEA reauthorization. The \namendment was not adopted.\n  Reducing class size in our Nation's schools is a fine idea. Common \nsense tells us that a smaller class allows a teacher to spend more one-\non-one time with each student. According to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, common sense has been backed by data that also \nreinforces that small class size is correlated to higher student \nachievement.\n  There is something else that most of the data says. It says that the \nquality of the teacher leading that classroom makes a significant \ndifference. Contrary to statements made on the floor last week, the \nclass size proposal of my colleague from Washington does little or \nnothing toward improving teacher quality. Funds allocated for \nprofessional development are limited to 15 percent in the first 3 years \nit is authorized. Worse yet, the legislation prohibits funds from being \nused to enhance teacher quality in the last 2 authorized years. What \nkind of sense does that make?\n  Only after class size is reduced to an average number of 18 students \ndoes a school district have the flexibility to use those funds to \nimprove the quality of teaching in the classroom. Proponents point to \nstudies which show that smaller classes make a difference and improve \nacademic achievement. I argue that class size is less important than \nhaving a quality teacher. That, to me, is common sense.\n  As I mentioned, this common sense idea can also be backed with hard \ndata. Ronald Fergeson, in an article entitled ``New Evidence on How and \nWhy Money Matters,'' notes:\n\n       What the evidence here suggests more strongly is that \n     teacher quality matters and should be a major focus of \n     efforts to upgrade the quality of schooling. Skilled teachers \n     are the most critical of all schooling input.\n\n  Bill Sanders, a statistician at the University of Tennessee, stated \nin a 1997 article in ``The Tennessean'':\n\n       Teacher effectiveness is the single largest factor \n     affecting the academic growth of students. Poor teachers hold \n     students back,\n\n[[Page S2393]]\n\n     while strong teachers can push students ahead by nearly a \n     grade. When compared to class size, expenditures, and so \n     forth, they all fail in comparison. The residual effects of \n     teachers can linger at least three years, regardless of the \n     performance of subsequent teachers.\n\n  The report ``Doing What Matters Most; Investing in Quality Teaching'' \nstates that:\n\n       Studies discover again and again that teacher expertise is \n     one of the most important factors in determining student \n     achievement, followed by smaller, but generally positive \n     influences of smaller schools and small class size.\n\n  Eric A. Hanushek, a researcher from the University of Rochester, \nconcludes:\n\n       All things being equal, small classes are preferable to \n     larger ones because teachers can give students more \n     individual attention. However, all things are seldom equal, \n     and other factors, such as the quality of the teacher, have a \n     much more decisive impact on student achievement. Moreover, \n     the huge expense of class-size reduction may impede the \n     ability of schools to make other important investments in \n     quality.\n\n  In fact, in nearly all the studies that I looked at on the subject \nmentioned quality and class size together. While my colleagues say that \nthe class size reduction proposal has quality components, this program \nactually prohibits funds from being used for improving teaching in the \noutyears.\n  This legislation is seriously flawed. It puts quantity over quality. \nIn my opinion, it is not a well-thought-out proposal, and, not \nsurprisingly, it is becoming apparent that it will not work very well \nin rural America. We have not held one hearing on it. We have not heard \nfrom anyone at the local level as to whether this program will meet the \nreal needs that they have in their communities. And we have not heard \nwhere these tens of thousands of well-qualified teachers will come \nfrom.\n\n  Where is the emphasis on teacher quality in this proposal? My \ncolleagues keep telling me there is an emphasis on quality, but nowhere \nin this proposal do I see a real commitment to professional \ndevelopment.\n  This amendment would have us agree that a teacher's being \n``certified'' is synonymous with ``high quality.'' Does ``certified'' \nequal ``high quality''?\n  Not necessarily. Currently 91 percent of teachers are ``certified'' \nin their main field of teaching assignment. Are we all comfortable \nsaying that 91 percent of our nation's teachers are highly qualified? \nThere is a great deal of debate on that issue.\n  Furthermore, State certification requirements, in many instances, are \nlacking. Title II of the Higher Education Act we adopted last year \nrecognized that fact and actually encourages States to improve \ncertification standards. Sadly, by today's measure, certification is \nnot a ``Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.''\n  And as I mentioned before, the proposal actually prohibits the use of \nfunds for professional development for teachers in 2004 and 20005 \nunless the local educational agency has reduced its average class size \nto 18.\n  We have an opportunity to address these problems and consider this \nlegislation in a timely yet thoughtful manner during consideration of \nthe Elementary Secondary Education Act Reauthorization.\n   Let's not rush ahead. Let's take some time to consider what will \nreally make a positive difference for our nation's students.\n  The class size initiative is built on a foundation of sand. It came \nabout because President Clinton insisted that it be part of the omnibus \nappropriations bill last October. It was drafted in a back room by a \nfew people with virtually no input from anyone else.\n  This happens from time to time, and it doesn't really bother me. But \nI think it is a bit of a stretch to characterize this process as a \n``bipartisan agreement'' that the Senate is obliged to extend. As I've \nsaid, I don't think we should be getting into these issues on the ed \nflex bill.\n  But if the ed flex bill is going to spill over in to broader issues, \nI think we should perhaps revisit whether this attempt to hire one \nteacher in a hundred or more is the best use of federal funds.\n  At this point, I think the answer is ``no.'' Education policy must be \nbuilt on consensus, not focus groups. I have no doubt but that this \nclass size initiative is politically appealing, and the chair of the \nDemocratic Senatorial Committee has already made clear that he wants to \nuse it against those of us who might be running for reelection next \nyear.\n  But that is exactly my point. As soon as educational policy is driven \nby the electoral needs of one party or another, we have undermined it. \nIt will change every two years based on the outcome of the elections. \nAnd state and local governments, which already chafe at the \nrestrictions that accompany the 7 percent of funds derived from the \nfederal government, will become even more frustrated.\n  My Democratic colleagues argue that school districts need certainty \nin planning for the future. Yet the source of the uncertainty is their \nown failure to build consensus for this proposal. You can, and we all \ndo, force things through in the waning hours of a Congress. But you \ncannot expect that this process transforms a weak idea into a strong \none.\n  I do not want to paint too bleak a picture. We do have plenty of \nconsensus in education policy. In the last Congress we passed an \namazing number of major pieces of education legislation by unanimous or \nnearly unanimous votes. And none of this would have been possible \nwithout support from our Democratic colleagues.\n  I do not think there is any greater consensus than on the subject of \nthe federal role in helping schools educate the disabled.\n  The first hearing we held and the first bill we passed were on \nIndividuals with Disabilities Act. I don't think there is any more \nimportant federal role than to meet the basic commitment which we made \nnearly 25 years ago.\n  The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions held a \nhearing last month on education budget proposals that drove home this \npoint.\n  Representative Albert Perry from the Vermont State Legislature and \nAllen Gilbert, a school board member from Worcester, Vermont, told us \nunequivocally that the single most important thing we could do to help \nlocal school districts was to fulfill our pledge to fully fund IDEA.\n  Fulfilling an old promise is not as exciting as raising new \nexpectations with new programs. We won't get much press coverage for \nsimply doing the right thing.\n  But if we fulfill our obligation to fund IDEA, state and local \nagencies will be able to target their own resources toward their own \nvery real needs.\n  For some districts this may mean school construction or class-size \nreduction. In other districts the most pressing needs may include \nteacher training or music and art education.\n  If we decide to use this forum to discuss budget priorities, we \nshould all come together and agree that no new and untested elementary \nand secondary education programs should be funded until we fulfill our \nbasic commitment to programs--like IDEA--that are tried and proven.\n  The real issue today is not whether the legislation before us \naddresses all of the problems that plague our education system.\n  There are issues which are important to me--for example, in the areas \nof professional development--which I have not addressed on this bill \nbecause I believed that it was more appropriate that these issues \nshould be addressed in the context of the reauthorization of ESEA.\n  My own view is that we should have a longer school year, that \nchildren lose too much ground over the summer months. But is this area \nripe for federal involvement? I don't know.\n  The real issue we are considering today is simple. Are we going to \ngive state and local communities the flexibility they have requested to \nimprove the performance of their own students?\n  I want to emphasize this point. They have not requested this \nflexibility solely to make their lives simpler or as a way to avoid \ndelivering important services. The accountability requirements that are \ncontained within this bill and that have been implemented in current \nEd-Flex states like Texas and Vermont make it clear that this is not \ntheir goal.\n  And we would not expect this to be their goal. I have traveled across \nthe State of Vermont meeting with students, parents, and educators. I \ncan tell you that no one cares more about the\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\neducational achievement of students than do their own parents, teachers \nand community leaders.\n  Let us keep ourselves focused on this simple but important task. We \nmust fulfill the commitment we made more than 25 years ago and we must \nmove to quickly pass this important legislation.\n  In order to do so, I am offering an amendment proposing that all \nfunds made available in Fiscal Year 1999 for class-size reduction will \nbe used instead for part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA).\n  I believe it is important that we honor past commitments before \ntaking on new obligations--particularly those as expensive, untested, \nand fractious as the class-size reduction initiative. We have never \ncome close to providing local school districts with the level of IDEA \nassistance promised to them in 1975.\n  Yet, rather that meeting this long-standing commitment, we are \ninstead encouraging them to take on additional obligations in order to \nreduce class size. These are obligations for which States and \nlocalities will be solely responsible once Federal assistance for \nclass-size reduction efforts disappears.\n  It is not too late to correct this mistake. No funds are scheduled to \nbe distributed until July. Most school districts have not yet received \nguidance on the class-size reduction program, as the guidance was not \nissued until this past weekend.\n  Perhaps the situation will change now that guidance is available, but \nschool officials in Vermont have been telling me that they have been \nunable to get answers to even relatively simple questions about the \nprogram.\n  Supporting programs for students with disabilities is a far better \nuse of the $1.2 billion provided in fiscal year 1999 than is starting \nup an untested teacher hiring program which was written in about a day-\nand-a-half in the closing days of the 105th Congress as part of an \nappropriations bill.\n  In fact, several school districts may be faced with entirely \nunforeseen increases in their IDEA funding needs because of last week's \nSupreme Court decision. Freeing up these funds for IDEA, a program \nwhich is in place and the contours of which are well known, is a better \nuse of the appropriations scheduled to be distributed this coming July.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Washington. I believe she is \nready and desires to introduce her amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Washington \nif she would like to discuss her amendment, and I would be happy to \nyield to her 15 minutes for debate only and then take a look at things \nas they exist at that time and decide whether or not we should proceed \nwith the offering of her amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the regular order, Mr. President.\n  Regular order is that a Senator can yield for a question. We are now \nin debate time; we are not under a time agreement, and I make a point \nof order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement until 3 o'clock.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How do we yield time if there is no time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have the floor, and I am yielding for a certain \nnumber of minutes. I don't think there is anything wrong with that. I \nam asking unanimous consent. Object to it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the State of Vermont has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The quorum call continues.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 55 To Amendment No. 40\n\n   (Purpose: To require local educational agencies to use the funds \n       received under section 307 of the Department of Education \n     Appropriations Act, 1999, for activities under part B of the \n              Individuals with Disabilities Education Act)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 55 to amendment No. 40.\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . IDEA.\n\n       Section 307 of the Department of Education Appropriations \n     Act, 1999, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) by striking paragraph (2);\n       (B) in paragraph (1), by redesignating subparagraphs (A) \n     and (B) as paragraphs (1) and (2), respectively; and\n       (C) by striking ``(b)(1)'' and inserting ``(b)''; and\n       (2) by striking subsections (c) through (g) and inserting \n     the following:\n       ``(c) Each local educational agency that receives funds \n     under this section shall use such funds to carry out \n     activities under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) in accordance with the \n     requirements of such part.''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I offer this amendment in hopes that we \ncan, again, emphasize what the proper procedure is for this bill--to \ntry to see if we can get it through with the least possible delay. At \nthe same time, since there seems to be a desire to utilize the \namendment process, we can try to rectify what was an attempted \nprocedure on an appropriations bill at the end of the last session, to \nget to the question of funds for schools.\n  We believe very strongly, as we have emphasized over and over again, \nthat the best way to help the schools out, with the money that was \nappropriated at that time, is to have that money flow to the schools to \nassist in taking care of children with disabilities. There is no \nquestion in the mind of anybody outside of Washington that the best way \nto help local communities is to get them out from under the problems \nthat were put on them by the Federal Government when it promised to \nfund 40 percent of special education and only funded it at around 10 \npercent. That has put huge stress on the local communities, and this \nstress has just been made even worse by the recent Supreme Court \ndecision which has emphasized, that it is the school's responsibility \nto have health care available to a child in order for the child to get \nwhat is promised under the Constitution, an appropriate education which \nis free. And ``free'' is the key word here with respect to the recent \nSupreme Court decision.\n  Obviously, if a child cannot concentrate or be effective, as far as \nthe learning process goes, without some help from medication or a \nnurse, then, without that help, that free and appropriate education is \nnot being provided.\n  Just to emphasize again where we are, this is the time for us to be \nhelping the States out, to increase their flexibility and their ability \nto use title I funds in particular. It is not a time to try to place \nupon them new restrictions or to utilize the funds for less desirable \nprograms than those which are available now, and encumber them with \nonly being able to do it through the decrease in class size, as in the \namendment as passed out of the Congress last year.\n  So I am hopeful we can take the time now to analyze where we ought to \nbe going in education. I already discussed\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\nthat to a substantial extent previously, but would like to point out \nagain, as we go forward trying to improve the education of this Nation, \nthis can only be done by the Federal Government and the local \ncommunities and the States all working together to provide the kind of \neducational changes which will maximize the ability of our children to \nlearn. Certainly all the Governors in the country have agreed that the \nbest way to do that is to free the communities from the huge burden we \nplaced upon them back in 1975. Although we made a commitment to take \ncare of 40 percent of that, as has been explained on the floor, we are \nwell lacking that. We have been showing a chart to you for some time \nwhich dramatically emphasizes that huge shortfall.\n  I am hopeful as we go forward today, we will continue to try to find \na way to get this bill passed. It is unfortunate it is being objected \nto for reasons which really are not relevant. It is very important, as \nwe progress towards the end of this year, that we not keep stalling and \npreventing action that would result in benefiting communities, and stop \nencumbering ourselves with legislation which will accomplish what is \nnot the highest priority. Depending upon where you are, we would \naccomplish relatively low priorities. The need for flexibility is \nimmediate in order to help students and teachers, and in order to allow \nthe local communities to be free to provide the education which would \nbe much more beneficial than what could be achieved with the \nrestrictions they currently face.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                Motion to Recommit with Amendment No. 56\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nmove to recommit the bill to report back forthwith with the following \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for Mrs. \n     Murray, for herself and Mr. Kennedy, moves to recommit the \n     bill to report back forthwith with the following amendment \n     numbered 56.\n\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                            amendment No. 56\n\n                    (Purpose: To reduce class size)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. CLASS SIZE REDUCTION.\n\n       Title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 7301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n                     ``PART E--CLASS SIZE REDUCTION\n\n     ``SEC. 6601. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       ``This part may be cited as the `Class Size Reduction and \n     Teacher Quality Act of 1999'.\n\n     ``SEC. 6602. FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds as follows:\n       ``(1) Rigorous research has shown that students attending \n     small classes in the early grades make more rapid educational \n     progress than students in larger classes, and that these \n     achievement gains persist through at least the elementary \n     grades.\n       ``(2) The benefits of smaller classes are greatest for \n     lower achieving, minority, poor, and inner-city children. One \n     study found that urban fourth-graders in smaller-than-average \n     classes were \\3/4\\ of a school year ahead of their \n     counterparts in larger-than-average classes.\n       ``(3) Teachers in small classes can provide students with \n     more individualized attention, spend more time on instruction \n     and less on other tasks, cover more material effectively, and \n     are better able to work with parents to further their \n     children's education.\n       ``(4) Smaller classes allow teachers to identify and work \n     more effectively with students who have learning disabilities \n     and, potentially, can reduce those students' need for special \n     education services in the later grades.\n       ``(5) Students in smaller classes are able to become more \n     actively engaged in learning than their peers in large \n     classes.\n       ``(6) Efforts to improve educational achievement by \n     reducing class sizes in the early grades are likely to be \n     more successful if--\n       ``(A) well-prepared teachers are hired and appropriately \n     assigned to fill additional classroom positions; and\n       ``(B) teachers receive intensive, continuing training in \n     working effectively in smaller classroom settings.\n       ``(7) Several States have begun a serious effort to reduce \n     class sizes in the early elementary grades, but these actions \n     may be impeded by financial limitations or difficulties in \n     hiring well-prepared teachers.\n       ``(8) The Federal Government can assist in this effort by \n     providing funding for class-size reductions in grades 1 \n     through 3, and by helping to ensure that the new teachers \n     brought into the classroom are well prepared.\n\n     ``SEC. 6603.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue to call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the hour of 3 o'clock having arrived, there \nwill now be 2 hours of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. As I understand it, no amendments can be offered on the \nmotion to debate relative to the cloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No amendments are in order. The order \nprohibits amendments at this time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, let me give Members a little bit of \ninformation on where we are. We are now on debate for cloture. We are \ntrying to get this bill--which is very small in the sense of the number \nof words--but would be very helpful to the Governors with respect to \ntrying to utilize their title I funds in a better way. The States would \nbe able to assist the maximum number of children in need of help. The \n50 Governors support it as it will help them have more flexibility. It \ndoes no damage to anyone and would be helpful to many. According to the \nlatest estimates for the Department of Education, this school year \nthere are 6.1 million schoolchildren.\n  We are also looking at an alternative--if you continue to refuse to \nlet the bill go out in order to help the Governors to help the \nchildren, we have offered, and will continue to offer, second-degree \namendments. These amendments will not run into the problem of being \nunder the Elementary and Secondary Education Act jurisdiction of the \ncommittee, where we are now holding hearings, as the other amendments \nhave. These amendments will say that the highest priority now and the \nbest thing to do now, would be to take the funds appropriated last year \nor authorized last year and to have those instead utilized to reduce \nthe burden on our local schools caused by the failure of the Federal \nGovernment to live up to their promise to provide 40 percent of the \nfunding for children with disabilities. We believe that is, by far, the \nbetter option and would not in any way impair our ability to continue \nto move forward on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  However, and it is unfortunate, the minority believes they would \nrather try to have the President's program. There are many parts of the \nPresident's program that I don't have a problem with. To put these \nproposals up at this time, however, without going through the normal \nprocess of debate, analysis, and hearings that normally go on in the \ncommittee process, is irresponsible. We must be able to determine \nwhether the programs work, how best to put them in, what kind of law \nchange would be needed--all those things are normally handled during \nthe committee process. We have already had several hearings and we will \nhave many more hearings on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nI am anxious to move forward now and continue with those hearings, and \nat the same time give the Governors maximum flexibility in their \nability to be able to utilize funds presently appropriated, especially \nunder title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Twelve States have demonstrated how you can utilize this to enhance \nthe education of your children. Texas and Vermont have had a special \nsuccess in utilizing these flexibilities, but there are now 38 other \nStates that would like to have the same benefits. Why we would want to \nstall and delay that time, I am not sure, but that is the situation we \nare in right now.\n  We, therefore, are going to have 2 hours of debate from now until 5 \no'clock on the motion to invoke cloture so that we can proceed to this \nvery important but relatively simple bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am sure that many Members of the \nSenate, and certainly Americans who have been watching the Senate for \nthe past few days, must have a question on their minds about what is \ngoing on in the U.S. Senate. For many of us who have been here for some \nperiod of time, it is becoming painfully clear what is going on. Our \ngood friends on the other side look up to the Parliamentarian and ask, \n``There is no opportunity for them to offer an amendment at all, is \nthere?'' and after they get their assurance, then they permit this side \nto speak. If you agree with them, you get a chance to speak, and they \ndon't object to calling off the quorum; but if you don't agree with \nthem, then you don't get a chance to speak.\n\n  This is the new U.S. Senate. I guess this must be part of the \nattitude we all heard about after the impeachment--that we were going \nto try and work things out in a way of comity and understanding, and we \nare going to have give-and-take on both sides. We were denied an \nopportunity to debate this issue or offer amendments last Friday when \nwe wanted to, and we were denied\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\nthe opportunity to offer amendments here today. There are evidently \nobjections to the consideration of the Murray amendment, even though \nthe majority and the chairman of the committee were quite prepared to \ntag amendments on to this Ed-Flex legislation, which is of so much \nimportance to local districts. I supported this legislation, but it \ndoesn't really compare in importance to the Murray amendment which will \nresult in the reductions of class size.\n  We saw the acceptance of a far-reaching banking amendment, and I \ndoubt very much whether there are five Members in the U.S. Senate that \nwould be able to explain it. And then the majority talks to us about \nnot trying to clutter up this legislation with amendments, like the \nMurray amendment to reduce class size, whose only purpose is to \ncontinue the commitment made last year which the Republicans signed on \nfor and took credit, to make sure this commitment was going to continue \nfor the next 6 years, but we have been denied the opportunity to bring \nit to the floor. But we have accepted a banking amendment of enormous \nsignificance and importance and there isn't a complaint over here, not \na complaint over here.\n  So now we have a prohibition on offering amendments from 3 o'clock to \n5 o'clock. It is neatly timed to divide the time up so that we can talk \nabout this. I dare say when the majority leader comes over here, we \nwill have the same kind of situation tomorrow, the same situation since \nhe has filed the cloture motion. We will have the explanation, ``Look, \nwe have been on education for a number of days now and it is time we \nresolve it.''\n  Madam President, maybe that explanation satisfies some Americans. But \nit defies logic, Madam President, if we are prepared to try to debate \nand discuss these matters, why we don't let the Senate make a judgment \non it.\n  I listened to my friend talk about the amendment. Last year, the \namendment that was accepted on teachers was drafted in a back room. As \nI remember, the good Senator from Vermont was in that back room at that \ntime. I didn't hear him complaining at that time about being in the \nback room. When the chairman of the House committee, Congressman \nGoodling, went out there to announce this, he was quite prepared to \ntake very considerable credit for what had been done in terms of \nexpanding the classrooms. He went out and stated at that time:\n\n       This is a real victory for the Republican Congress, but \n     more importantly, it is a huge win for local educators and \n     parents who are fed up with Washington mandates, redtape and \n     regulation.\n\n  That is what the chairman of the House committee said on this.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Were you in the back room?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was there part of the time, but not when he had his \npress conference. I was in the room, yes, I was, and glad to be there, \nbecause we were fighting then for smaller classrooms.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I think if you check your memory, I was not there.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator wasn't there, I apologize to the Senator. \nIt was, as I see now, Senator Gorton, Chairman Goodling, Congressman \nClay, and myself.\n  So I apologize to the Senator. Would the Senator have complained in \nthe back room last year if he had been there?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If I had been there, there would not have been anything \nto complain about.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will let the record stand and let the people figure \nit out.\n  The point is, Madam President, what we have tried to do with this Ed-\nFlex legislation, which some Democratic Governors and Republican \nGovernors desire, is to create greater flexibility, while at the same \ntime insisting that we are going to have some accountability--those \nissues have not been completely resolved--and to ensure that Federal \nfunding that was going to be available was going to be targeted to the \nneediest students. We all want to make sure that we are going to be \nable to judge the Ed-Flex by how the students' achievement and \naccomplishment actually are enhanced over a period of time.\n  There is another amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island, who \nwants to ensure that parental involvement in these decisions will be \nconsidered. That has not been accepted. We certainly hope that will be \nincluded, because every single study that has been made with regard to \nthe importance of early education shows the importance and significance \nof parental involvement.\n  So we still have to resolve those issues. As our majority leader \npointed out when he addressed the Governors two weeks ago, we would get \na chance to debate the issue of education. This is what our Majority \nLeader Lott, who spoke to the National Governors' Association, said:\n\n       Now, when we bring up the education issues on the floor \n     next week, there will be some amendments and some \n     disagreements. But at the leadership meeting we had yesterday \n     afternoon, I said, ``That's great. Let's go to the Senate \n     floor, let's take days, let's take a week, let's take 2 weeks \n     if it's necessary, let's talk about education.''\n\n  What happened, Madam President? What happened to that kind of \ncommitment that was made to the Governors? What happened to the \nopportunity to be able to address the issue of class size and to be \nable to vote on it? What happened in the last two weeks which has \ndenied the Senator from Washington the opportunity to offer her \namendment last Friday and denied the opportunity to offer it today? I \ndaresay she will be denied the opportunity to offer it tomorrow. What \nhappened here, Madam President?\n\n  What is more important to the families of this country than the \nissues of education? What is more important than having a good debate \non issues such as classroom size? What is more important than \nconsidering other issues that our colleagues wanted to bring up for \nSenate consideration, such as the afterschool programs to try to assist \nchildren that too often are finding themselves in trouble or spending \ntoo much time watching the television in the afternoon? What is wrong \nwith an amendment to expand that program? Let's hear the arguments and \nhave a vote here. Let's have a short time limit. The Senator from \nWashington had indicated that she would be willing to enter into a time \nagreement. We don't need to have a cloture vote tomorrow. We could vote \non the Senator's amendment late this afternoon, if that is the desire. \nI bet the membership would stay here during the evening, if that was \nthe desire and others wanted to speak on it because of its importance \nto people in communities all across this country--parents, children and \nschoolteachers. We can do that.\n  We can reach a time agreement, as our minority leader said, on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate, for five or six amendments with time \nlimitations. We could wind this whole debate up by tomorrow. But, no. \nAre we sure we can't have any amendments this afternoon? Yes, the \nSenate can be assured that it is not possible for any Member of the \nU.S. Senate this afternoon to offer an amendment. Fine. Then you can go \nahead and speak.\n  That is known as a gag rule, Madam President. We had that kind of \nproblem at the end of the last session. We had the gag rule on minimum \nwage. We had the gag rule on the Patients' Bill of Rights. And now we \nstart off this Congress and we have a gag rule on education. If the \nmajority agrees with you, you can bring up your amendment. But if you \nhave an amendment like Senator Bingaman and Senator Reid on school \ndropouts, where we had a very substantial number of Republicans who \nsupported that, absolutely not. Absolutely not.\n  The amount of time spent in quorum calls last week when they brought \nup this simple amendment that had been debated and discussed and \naccepted and dropped in conference last year is beyond belief. We had a \nsmall number of amendments that could have been worked out. All of us \nunderstand that there is a program and a schedule, and Senator Daschle \nspoke for all of us on our side to try to reduce any number of \namendments, and to try to get a time limitation and to move on. But \nthat continues to be denied.\n  ``Not as long as school class size is one of the amendments,'' they \nsay. Isn't that wonderful? No agreement as long as school class size is \nan issue. What is this terrible issue about school\n\n[[Page S2398]]\n\nclass size that they won't even permit Republicans or Democrats to vote \non?\n  I see my colleague, the author of this amendment. I am glad to yield \nto the Senator from Washington and withhold the remainder of the time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair, directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to \na close the debate on the Kennedy-Daschle motion to recommit S. 280:\n         Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman, Ernest F. Hollings, Max \n           Cleland, Tom Harkin, Daniel K. Akaka, Daniel K. Inouye, \n           John Breaux, Carl Levin, Patrick Leahy, Byron L. \n           Dorgan, Tom Daschle, Edward M. Kennedy, Patty Murray, \n           Harry Reid, and Paul Wellstone.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you. Madam President, let me just commend the \nSenator from Massachusetts for his tremendous work on the education \nissue and for his repeated help with those of us who would like to \noffer amendments that would make a difference for young children in \nthis country--in their education and in our responsibilities to live up \nto promises we made to our voters to deal with the issues of education, \nwhether it is reducing class size; training our teachers; dropout \nprevention, as Senator Bingaman has brought to us; afterschool care, as \nSenator Boxer has talked about; and numerous other issues that will \naffect children's education.\n  I listened to the chairman this morning as he talked about my \namendment, which has yet to be offered, on class size. I agree with him \nthat the best thing we can do for our kids in our classes is to have a \nquality teacher. That is exactly what this amendment that we would like \nto offer does.\n  Reducing class size allows 15 percent of the funds to go to \nrecruiting, hiring, and training certified, regular, and special \neducation teachers, and teachers of special needs children, including \nteachers certified with State and local governments.\n  I am reading from my amendment, Madam President. This amendment makes \nsure that the teachers who are put into our classrooms are well \nqualified. In fact, I worked with Senator Jeffords, chairman of the \ncommittee, last year, along with our ranking member, in order to deal \nwith the issue of quality teachers. We passed an agreement last year \nthat began to make sure that our young people out in the colleges today \nwho are learning to be teachers are given skills in technology, a very \nimportant issue, making sure that every new teacher who is certified \nfrom here on out has training in technology. We intend to work with the \nchairman of the committee when we reauthorize the ESEA, to make sure \nthat our teachers who are out there are already getting the training \nand help they need so they can be the best teachers possible.\n  But it isn't good enough to just have a teacher in the classroom. We \nneed to make sure that those teachers have enough time with individual \nstudents to help them with their reading skills, to help them with \ntheir math skills, to help them with their introduction to science, to \nhelp them with their writing skills. There is nothing more frustrating \nto a first-grade teacher who is trying to help the young student in her \nclassroom learn to read, and one young student can't get the time and \nindividual attention he or she needs so that they can break through the \nbarrier and learn to read. And there is nothing worse than for a \nteacher to go home at night and be completely frustrated because they \nhad 30, 35 kids in their classroom and they weren't able to help one \nchild. There is nothing more difficult for a teacher than to recognize \nthat they left the child behind that day or that night or that year \nbecause they didn't have the individual attention they needed.\n  We go out to our communities--all of us--and we talk to business \nleaders in our communities. Every one of them tells us that they want \nto hire kids from their local schools to go into their businesses. They \nlook directly at us, and they say, ``We want to know when those kids \ngraduate from high school that they know how to read, write, that they \nhave the basics in science and math.'' What we have found from all of \nthe studies we have seen is that when class sizes are reduced in the \nfirst through third grades, those students go on through high school \nand they graduate with competency in those requirements. It does make a \ndifference.\n  Madam President, last year I introduced legislation on reducing class \nsize. It was turned down on a partisan vote in the beginning of the \nyear. But we did have a bipartisan agreement. We changed the language \nof my original bill to add training for teachers, because that is what \nmy Republican colleagues wanted. We added language that included local \nalternative routes. That was directly in relation to the Republicans \nasking us to put this in the amendment. We worked the wording back and \nforth and, last October, agreed with Congressman Goodling, Senator \nGorton, Senator Kennedy, and others who were in the negotiations, who \nwere representing all of us in those negotiations, to come up with a \nbipartisan agreement. And it was passed in a bipartisan fashion.\n  It is now not only extremely timely but necessarily timely that we go \nback to those districts and tell them that this wasn't just a \ncommitment from October; we are firmly committed to making sure that \nyoung children in our schools get the class size reduction that they \nneed to have the ability to learn the skills they need so that we can \nmake a real commitment to education.\n  Don't just look at me for this. I am a former teacher. I am a former \nschool board member. I am a parent of two students who went through our \npublic schools. I have been out there as a PTA member. I have been a \nState legislator dealing with education. And I have been on the \ncommittee here that deals with education. I have seen education from \nevery angle--from being a teacher, a parent, a school board member, a \nlegislator--and I can tell you that all of those groups, every one of \nthem, know that when you reduce class size you make a difference in a \nchild's learning.\n  We all agreed on that last October. We all agreed on that language. \nWe said yes, this is a commitment that we need to make as a Federal \nGovernment. We looked at the bill and did everything we could, and \nbrought our Republican colleagues into the discussions, so that there \nwere no new reports, there was no additional paperwork, that the money \nwent directly to our school districts so they could hire qualified \nteachers. We worked this through in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Today school boards are out there and they are calling my office--I \nam sure they are calling every office here--saying, ``We are putting \nour budget together for next year. We are beginning the hiring process \nto hire our teachers. Is this a commitment that is just a hollow \npromise, or are you going to follow through?'' Our amendment, a 6-year \nauthorization, says we are going to follow through, that we didn't just \ndo it last October, that we meant it as a commitment, that we as a \nCongress know that class size reduction is absolutely critical.\n\n  Madam President, the President has made this a top priority. The Vice \nPresident issued a statement in support of it today. The administration \nis going to be there with us. We will get class size reduction. We all \nknow that. We know we are debating an amendment now. But the school \nboards don't know that. They need a commitment now so they can put \ntheir budgets together and hire those teachers.\n  I was a school board member. I can tell you, we didn't deal with \npromises when I was a school board member. When you are putting the \nbudgets together to hire these teachers, everybody loves you. But you \ndon't want to be the school board member a year from now or 6 months \nfrom now who tells those teachers, ``We are going to fire you, let you \ngo.'' They do not care if it was the Federal Government or not. They \nwill come to your school board meeting saying, ``How can you fire our \nteachers?'' School board members can say, ``Well, the Federal \nGovernment didn't follow through on their\n\n[[Page S2399]]\n\npromise.'' But that doesn't make a difference when you are a school \nboard member and you have to go to the grocery store the next day with \nall the parents who are going to be affected by a decision we made.\n  Madam President, we made a good, solid commitment. We worked a year, \nalong with our Republican colleagues, to add their language to our \nproposal. That is what was agreed on last October. That is what we have \nin front of us today, if we are allowed to offer it. And that is a \ncommitment that we ought to make to parents, to students, and to school \nboards who are doing their budgets, and to our Government, which is \nalso counting on us to make sure that we have our commitments in order \nto our young children across this country.\n  Madam President, I have worked long and hard with my Republican \ncolleagues on this issue. It is an extremely timely and necessary \nissue. We agree that the Ed-Flex bill is one that we can all agree on. \nBut why not do what is really important in this country on this bill? \nWhy should we be precluded from offering these amendments? If our \nRepublican colleagues now don't agree with those on class size, fine; \nvote no. But let's let our school board members know. They have a right \nto know. We have an obligation to tell them. That is why we feel so \nstrongly about offering this amendment.\n  Again, I offer to my Republican colleagues, we would like to work \nwith you on this. We believe this is a commitment that was made last \nyear that we should stand up to. The administration stands with us. \nLet's put the words in writing, and then we can go on to other issues.\n  I heard the chairman of the committee say, ``Well, let's wait until \nthe ESEA is reauthorized.'' I have been here in the Senate for 6 and a \nhalf years. I know that reauthorizing a bill, bringing it here to the \nfloor, and having it move forward is no guarantee. I know it could be a \nyear from now. It may not happen. I have seen reauthorizations not \nagreed to. I want to make sure that our class size allocations don't \nget lost because we can't get a bill through the floor 6 months from \nnow or 8 months from now. Again, our school boards are hiring teachers. \nThey need to know now. They cannot wait.\n  I have studies, which I will go through when we get our amendment to \nthe floor, which show that reducing class size makes a difference. I \nhave many, many letters, and I have had phone calls from parents. I \nhave heard from students. I have teachers who would like to have their \nwords be put on the floor of the Senate in support of this proposal. I \nam hearing from them. I am sure many of our colleagues are as well.\n  This is an important and timely issue. I sincerely hope that our \nRepublican colleagues will allow us to vote on it. I heard the chairman \nof the committee, the manager on the floor, talk about the fact that \nperhaps it would be agreed on now. I again urge you to allow us to vote \non it. Let's have the debate.\n  I heard the chairman talk about the fact that he would second-degree \nmy amendment with legislation to take all of the class size money that \nwas allocated last year and give it to IDEA funding for special \neducation children.\n  Madam President, I agree with the chairman of the committee, funding \nfor IDEA is absolutely essential. I offered this amendment on the floor \nduring the budget process last year to fund IDEA. I believe in that \ncommitment. But let's not rob those schools of money that we promised \nthem last October for this year to reduce class sizes in first through \nthird grade and give it to IDEA. We can't pit student against student. \nWhat an empty promise, to anybody who depends on the future of \neducation, if we come back 6 months later, after a bipartisan agreement \nhas been reached, and say, ``Well, gee, sorry. Politics have changed. \nWe are taking the money that we promised you and giving it to another \ngroup.''\n  Madam President, kids in the first through third grade in school \ndistricts, whether they are in Shoreline, or Seattle, or Wanaque, \nKentucky, Florida, or any other community, know that reducing class \nsize makes a difference. Ask any parent how many times, when their \nchild comes home on the first day of school--every parent--the first \nquestion is, ``How many kids are in your classroom?'' Every parent \nknows that if the class size is small enough--we are asking for 18 in \nfirst through third grade--their child is going to get a good \neducation. If the answer is 32, as it was for a friend of mine just a \nfew days ago in enrolling her child in kindergarten, you know your \nchild is not going to get the help they need and deserve in this \ncountry today to get a good education.\n  Madam President, I will retain the remainder of our time. I am happy \nto hear what our Republican colleagues say.\n  But I again offer to them that I am more than willing to have a time \nagreement on my amendment and an up-or-down vote. I am more than \nwilling to do it in an expeditious fashion. I am positive we could \nfinish the bill in the next 24 hours. With a time agreement on my \namendment and the other amendments that I am sure our leader, along \nwith yours, can work out on the floor, we can finish this bill by \ntomorrow and have the whole bill done in a week. But it will allow us \nto let people in this country know that this is a commitment we have an \nobligation to keep.\n  Madam President, I retain the remainder of my time, and I look \nforward to the debate, and I again plead with our colleagues to allow \nus to offer these amendments.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. ``A commitment we have an obligation to keep.'' That is \nwhat we are hearing from the other side. ``A commitment we have an \nobligation to keep.'' Tell the special ed child that. Tell the special \ned child, whose funds you are raiding. You are raiding those funds to \nstart these new initiatives. That is where the funds are coming from. \nEvery time the President goes to the podium to propose a new program, \nwhere does that money come from in education? It comes from the \nchildren. It comes from the special ed child.\n  Why? Because this administration year in and year out has refused to \nfund special education. In fact, ironically, if you take all of the \nPresident's new initiatives, which have been thrown at us on poll \nnumber after poll number--every time he takes a poll, he puts out a new \ninitiative. If you take all of his new initiatives on education, they, \nironically, happen to add up to almost exactly the amount of money it \nwould take for the Federal Government to fulfill its obligation to the \nspecial needs children of this country, an obligation which was made--a \ncommitment, the term used by the other side, a commitment which was not \nmade last fall in order to entertain the concerns of the teachers \nunions in this country; it was a commitment that was made in 1975--\n1975--when we passed 94-142, a law which said that the Federal \nGovernment would pay 40 percent--40 percent--of the cost of the special \nneeds child.\n  What happened? The Federal Government reneged on that obligation, to \nthe point where it was down to only 6 percent that was being paid by \nthe time the Republicans took over this Congress.\n  We have been able to reverse that trend as a Republican Congress. We \nhave increased that funding by almost 100 percent in the last 3\\1/2\\ \nyears. We have gone from 6 percent up to 11 percent but without any \nhelp from this White House. Not once did they send up a budget that has \nsaid, let's look at the needs of the special ed child. Not once did \nthey send up a budget that said, we have a 40-percent obligation here; \nwe are only fulfilling 6 percent of it, so let's start to fill up the \nrest of the obligation.\n  No, every time they send up a budget, it is take the money that \nshould have gone to special education, put it into some brand new \nprogram which moves responsibility back here to Washington so we can \nhave more control here in Washington purchased with the money that is \nsupposed to be going to the special needs child.\n  We have another example of it right here on this floor today that is \ngoing to be proposed by the Senator from Washington. Let's add 100,000 \nteachers. How much does that cost? Billions. Does it say anything about \ntaking care\n\n[[Page S2400]]\n\nof the special needs child, the 40-percent obligation? No, nothing. \nNothing.\n  Let me point out that if we took the money that was going to the \n100,000 teacher program proposed by the President and sent it back to \nthe communities to spend on their special needs children, that would \nfree up the local dollars so that the local principal, the local \nteacher, the local school board could make the decision as to whether \nthey needed a new teacher, a new classroom, a new afterschool program, \na new computer, a new science program, a new math program, a new \nlanguage program.\n  But, no, no, the President and his Members on the other side of the \naisle are not going to let that sort of freedom fall into the hands of \nthe local education folks. They are not going to let parents suddenly \nhave some power or teachers have some power or principals have some \npower.\n  No, don't let that happen. We have to set up a new program and take \nall the money going to special ed, which would have freed up local \ndollars, and tell the school districts how to spend it. Tell them that \nwe, here in Washington, know better. My goodness, we all know that the \nfolks down here on, I think it is 600 Independence Avenue, the \nEducation Department, know a heck of a lot more about the kids in the \nEpping Elementary School than the principal of the Epping Elementary \nSchool.\n  We all know that. That is sort of one of those prima facie facts here \nin Washington, that the bureaucrat in that building, in that back room \nthere on the 15th floor of some office building knows a heck of a lot \nmore about how to educate a child in Epping, NH, or in Concord, NH, or \nin Nashua, NH, than the teacher who sees that child every day and the \nprincipal who works with that teacher every day or the parent who \nhappens to be involved with this child more than every day, obviously, \n24 hours a day.\n\n  No, it is the great theory of self-worth which says that Senators \nhere in Washington and bureaucrats here in Washington, especially the \nPresident here in Washington, know more about how to educate the child \nthan the child's parents, the child's teachers, the child's principal, \nor the child's school board. So they take the money that should have \ngone to special ed and they put it into these new programs.\n  Let me reiterate what the practical effect of that is, because this \nis the insidiousness of the proposal that is being made from the other \nside. You see, if the Federal Government actually funded what it said \nit was going to fund in special needs, actually paid for the cost of \nthe special education child to the full 40 percent as required, that \nwould free up the local resources, because today what happens is the \nFederal Government is only paying 11 percent of the cost. It would have \nbeen 6 percent of the cost if this administration had been allowed to \nhave its way for the last 3 years. But we changed that. We raised it to \n11 percent.\n  So the next amount of the cost, the difference between 11 percent and \n40 percent, has to be found somewhere else; that Federal share that is \nnot being paid by the Federal Government has to be found somewhere \nelse.\n  Where is it found? It is found in the local taxpayers' pockets and \nthe State. And so the local school district has a special needs child, \nor maybe a series of special needs children who are costing them a \nconsiderable amount of money, and we should fund that; we should take \ncare of them. And they know that and so they pay for that child's \nproper education. But when they make the decision to pay for that \nchild's proper education, instead of getting 40 cents back on the \ndollar from the Federal Government for every dollar they spend, they \nonly get 11 cents back, and so they have to find the difference \nsomewhere else.\n  Where do they find it? Well, maybe they do not hire another teacher \nthat they want for history or art. Or maybe they do not put in a \ncomputer room. Or maybe they do not start an afterschool program. Or \nmaybe they do not build a new building or add on to their building. \nThey have to make a decision such as that at the local level. It is a \ndaily decision that is made in this country. All across this country \nthat decision is being made, because the Federal Government refuses to \npay its fair share of special education costs to which it has \ncommitted.\n  No, instead we have this arrogance of power that says we are going to \ntake the money from special ed; we are going to create a new program; \nwe are going to give it to you but you have to spend it exactly as we \ntell you. You have to spend it to hire teachers. You have to spend it \nfor an afterschool program. Or you have to spend it to hire \nconsultants, which is the way it usually works out.\n  The local school district, instead of having flexibility to make its \nown decisions with money that it should be getting from the Federal \nGovernment, suddenly finds itself hit twice. First, it does not get the \nmoney the Federal Government was supposed to send it. And then it is \ntold that if it wants to get the money the Federal Government was \nsupposed to send it, it has to create a brand new program that they may \nnot even want. It is an arrogance of power.\n  The other side has said, we don't want to pit student against \nstudent. We don't want to pit student against student. Tell us about \nthe special needs child and their parents going to a school board \nmeeting in my State.\n  We have town meetings. School budgets are voted in the open in a town \nmeeting. Anybody can go. Anybody can vote who is a member of that town. \nLet me tell you, student is pitted against student; parent against \nparent. It is awful. Why does it happen? It happens because we have \nfailed to pay the obligations of the Federal share of special ed. It is \nabsolutely inexcusable that we put special ed kids and their parents \nthrough the nightmare of having other kids and their parents saying to \nthem, ``You are taking our money.'' But that is what happens every day \nacross this country because the Federal Government refuses to pay its \nfair share.\n  So, what does the other side propose? Let's pit more students against \nstudents. Let us not increase special ed funding; let's create a brand \nnew program so the special ed kid is once again left out there without \nthe protection of the dollars that were supposed to come from the \nFederal Government, and once again is thrown into the meat grinder, \nunfairly and inappropriately being accused by other students and \nparents in the school district that funds going to that child should be \ngoing to the general education activities.\n  So this student-against-student argument is--well, it is like arguing \nthat black is white, to say that this new teacher program is somehow \ngoing to relieve the student-against-student issue. It is just the \nopposite, just the opposite. It is going to create an excessive problem \nfor the special needs child.\n  Do they need teachers? I don't know. I don't know whether the town of \nEpping or Concord needs new teachers. I do know this: The people in the \ntown of Epping and the city of Concord know whether they need teachers. \nI am not going to tell them whether they do or they do not. What I am \ngoing to try to do is give them the money and the flexibility to make \nthe decisions themselves, rather than have it directed here from \nWashington. But that seems to be an anathema to the President and to \nthe people who are carrying his water in this Congress; the concept \nthat the local community should make these decisions, the concept that \nthe local teacher or the local principal, or even, God forbid, the \nparent might know more about what the child needs than we know here in \nWashington. That is the attitude.\n  That is the attitude that leads to this arrogance which takes the \nmoney from the special needs child and moves it over for new programs \nwhich happen to poll well, and therefore create some sort of political \nstatement that allows you to create an election event, because that is \nwhat this is all about. If this administration wanted to help the \nchildren of this country get a better education, the absolute first \nthing it would have done would have been to fund special education at \nthe full 40 percent, or made a commitment to try to get there. The fact \nthat they did not, the fact that they have not, the fact that the only \npeople who have been committed to this have been on our side of the \naisle, reflects the insincerity of their effort in the area of \neducation. It reflects that they are interested in politics, while we \nare interested in actually producing quality education.\n  This bill, by the way, is another example of that. It stuns me that \nthis bill\n\n[[Page S2401]]\n\nwould be held hostage for these really blatant political weapons, \nespecially ones which make so little sense. That is what is happening \nhere. This bill is being held hostage so somebody can take a poll and \ndo a focus group and decide we need a new program. I imagine we will \nget another one after this teacher one, where the Federal Government \ncan tell the local communities how to run their educational system.\n\n  It is inappropriate, to say the least, because everybody supports \nthis Ed-Flex bill. It is supported by the Governors. It was supported \nby the President. It was even supported by Members on the other side of \nthe aisle. Why? Because it is a good idea. It gives flexibility to \nlocal school districts. It allows local school districts to make \ndecisions as to how Federal dollars are spent without the Federal \nstrings. In fact, I think 12 States are already functioning under this \nand doing extraordinarily well, and all this bill does is expand it to \nthe rest of the States. It is ironic that 12 States should have this \nbenefit, but the rest of the States should not have this benefit.\n  This second-degree that has been offered, which I think is absolutely \non target, takes the money which was stuck in the bill last year for \nthis teachers initiative and moves it over to the special ed accounts, \nwhich is where it should be--should have been in the first place. We \nmade a mistake last year. This is an attempt to correct it. This \nmistake has been confirmed beyond any question by the recent Cedar \nRapids decision of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said just last \nweek that not only do the local school districts now have to pay for \nthe special needs child's educational activities, they are going to \nhave to pay for the medical activities within the school system that \nare required in order to educate that child.\n  I can tell you, those medical costs are going to be extraordinary. \nThis is an exponential increase on the local school districts in order \nto pay those medical costs. Those medical costs used to come out of \nMedicaid in most instances. Sometimes they came out of other accounts, \nbut a lot of these kids were Medicaid qualified, so if they were really \nhigh they might have come out of there. But they didn't come out of the \nlocal school budget. Now they are going to come out of the local school \nbudget.\n  Many of the New Hampshire school districts, for example, have small \nnumbers of people in them. If you have a child who needs an extreme \namount of medical help in order to be mainstreamed--and they should be \nmainstreamed; this is critical, it works, it is a good idea--but they \nhave to have full-time nursing care, or they have to have very high \ncaliber medical assistance, devices like ventilators or a variety of \nother things, oxygen, it gets extraordinarily expensive. And every one \nof those dollars, according to the Supreme Court, is now going to come \nout of the school budget.\n  Where is it going to come from? It is not going to come from the \nFederal Government, because we are not going to pay our 40 percent. No, \nit is going to come from maybe the math/science department. Maybe the \ndecision to buy new computers will be put off. Maybe the decision of \nhiring a new teacher will be put off. Maybe the decision to add a wing \nonto the building will be put off. Maybe the football team will be \ndropped. Who knows? But somebody is going to have to lose, because \nthere is now a Constitutional requirement that the health needs of that \nchild, when that child is being educated, must be paid for by the \nschool department.\n  The Federal Government is not going to come through with its 40 \npercent of that cost. Instead, the administration is going to take the \nmoney which should have gone for that cost and move it into some new \nprogram which is going to be directed out of Washington where the local \nschool district will be told from Washington how and when they can hire \na teacher, and what sort of qualifications that teacher can have. It \nis, in light of that decision in Cedar Rapids, absolutely inexcusable \nthat we would be initiating new programs without funding the special \nneeds program first--absolutely inexcusable. It is going to put \nextraordinary pressure on every school district across this country \nunless we face up to that reality.\n  So, the $1.2 billion that last year we put into this teachers program \nshould be taken out of that and moved over to special needs and the \nspecial needs child's program, in light of the Cedar Rapids decision. \nTo not do that is to really be derelict in our duty as a Federal \nGovernment. We have already walked away from that duty by not funding \nthe full 40 percent. But to fail to do it in light of the decision on \nCedar Rapids is really to add insult to injury--to rub salt in the \nwound.\n  So I congratulate the chairman of the committee for offering this \namendment. I think it is right on. I look forward to this debate, \nbecause this is the issue we should join. Are we going to support the \nspecial needs children in this country with dollars, not rhetoric? Or \nare we going to start new programs, directed by Washington, decided by \nWashington, under the control of Washington, which take the money from \nspecial needs which would have freed up local flexibility and put them \ninto categorical decisions out of Washington?\n\n  That is the debate here. That is the substance of the education issue \nand the difference between the two parties on education. It is not an \nissue of dollars. It is an issue of how local communities get to manage \nthose dollars and where those dollars get spent. There isn't a \ncommunity in New Hampshire which, if given the option, would take the \nspecial ed dollars before they would take a new categorical program \nfrom Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators from your side have 34 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, let me, first of all, very briefly explain what this \nmeans to Minnesota. I think we on the floor have already gone over what \nthis proposal is. It is $12 billion over 7 years, $7.3 billion over 5 \nyears. It is an initiative to enable our school districts to reduce \nclass sizes, grades 1 through 3, to an average of 18 students. It is an \nadditional 100,000 teachers. Estimates are that we are going to need to \nhire 2 million really good teachers over the next 10 years in our \ncountry. This is our way, at the Federal Government level, of providing \nsome resources to States and school districts that are sorely needed.\n  Under this proposal, Minnesota would receive $19 million in fiscal \nyear 2000 to support 519 teachers. Minneapolis would receive \n$2,355,271; St. Paul, $1,761,943; and Anoka-Hennepin, $489,090. This \nmoney is sorely needed, and it would be put to great use.\n  I am pleased to announce that this comes as a complement to what the \nVentura administration is planning on doing, which is to provide $150 \nmillion in the next 2 years to reduce class sizes in kindergarten \nthrough third grade, with the goal of having no more than 17 students \nper classroom.\n  Let me say to my colleague from New Hampshire that in Minnesota, at \nleast, I do not think you are going to get any argument whatsoever that \nthe Federal Government ought to do a better job of providing money for \nspecial ed children. There is no question about it, the IDEA program is \na great idea. We want children with special needs to be in our schools. \nWe want them to get the best education possible.\n  What troubles me is two things. No. 1, what troubles me is this sort \nof playing off one group of children against another group of children. \nI will say right now that in the State of Minnesota, we have also made \nit a goal to try to reduce class size because we know--I try to be in \nthe schools about every 2 weeks--that there are a couple of things for \nsure that work. One of them is to make sure that we have the parents \ninvolved, and one of them is to make sure that children come to \nkindergarten ready to learn. We are not there as a Nation.\n  One of them is smaller class size. At the elementary school level, it \nmakes a huge difference. It makes a huge difference, I say to my \ncolleague from Washington, at the middle school level, at the junior \nhigh school level, and at the high school level. So why are we\n\n[[Page S2402]]\n\ntalking about these proposals as if it is one versus the other?\n  I say to my colleagues that what disappoints me the most is that the \nevidence is crystal clear. Let me just lay this out as I talk about \nthis. Project STAR studied 7,000 students in 80 schools in Tennessee. \nStudents in small classes perform better than students in large classes \nin each grade from kindergarten through eighth grade. In Wisconsin, the \nStudent Achievement Guarantee in Education Program is helping to reduce \nclass size in grades K through 12 in low-income communities; again, \nshowing significant improvement in reading, math, and language tests. \nIn Flint, MI, efforts over the last 3 years to reduce class size in \ngrades K through 3 have produced a 44-percent increase in reading \nscores and an 18-percent increase in math scores.\n  The research shows that it makes a huge difference. When we talk to \nthe teachers, they tell us it makes a huge difference. When I am in \nschools and I ask students, ``What do you think represents real \neducation reform?'' the first thing they talk about is reducing class \nsize. They say, ``Smaller classes.'' I ask them, ``Why would smaller \nclasses make a big difference?''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, why would smaller classes make a \ndifference? Students go on and they say, ``Well, because with smaller \nclasses, we might get more of a chance to interact with our teachers. \nIf we need special help, we get the help from our teachers. The \nteachers get to know us better as individuals. We establish more \nrapport with our teachers.''\n  I say to my colleagues, there is not an educator in the country who \ndoesn't believe that we ought to try to reduce our class size. I say it \nwould be better to have classes no larger than 15 students at the \nelementary school level.\n  Senator Murray and Senator Kennedy bring an amendment to the floor. \nWhat we are saying--I think all of my colleagues know my views about \nthe Ed-Flex bill; I won't go over my views again--today is, if we are \ngoing to be talking about education and we are going to pass a piece of \nlegislation, then we bring to the floor a good-faith, positive effort, \nwhich will make a huge difference.\n  Again, in Minnesota, hardly any student I have ever talked to said, \n``Please, Senator, we want you to support Ed-Flex.'' They do not even \nknow what it means. Then if I were to tell them about the debate about \ntitle I, personally I think most of the students would say, ``We are \nall for flexibility by way of giving the school districts the \ndiscretion to do more on community outreach, if that is what they want \nto do, or more on teacher assistance, if that is what they want to do, \nor more on special instruction, if that is what they want to do, but \ncertainly, Senator, we want to keep the basic standards in place.'' I \nthink most students would agree with that. Most students do not know \nthis debate. What the students and the teachers and the parents and the \npeople in the community who care fiercely about education tell all of \nus is, ``Here is something you can do.''\n  In Minnesota, I do not always agree with the Ventura administration \non issues. They did a good job in their budget. They made it a priority \nto reduce class size. I think that what Minnesota would say is, \n``Listen, some additional resources that enable us to do this job, we \nare all for it.''\n  For some reason, I guess my colleagues do not want to let us have an \nup-or-down vote on this amendment, I say to Senator Murray; is that \ncorrect? I want to try to stay at as high a level as possible, but I \nguess I say to the majority leader that I am surprised he is surprised \nthat Democrats on an education bill would come to the floor with an \namendment that Senator Murray has now presented to reduce class size. \nIt is amazing to me.\n  Now we are not going to have an up-or-down vote? My colleague, the \nSenator from Vermont, who is an education Senator, knows that this is \nan important initiative and knows that we have an education bill out on \nthe floor, that we are going to have this debate, and we are going to \nhave this amendment. Apparently, we are going to have no vote.\n  I do not like saying this, but I will: From my point of view, if this \npiece of legislation goes nowhere, the Ed-Flex bill, that is fine. I do \nnot think it is a step forward; I think it is a great leap backwards. I \nam saddened by the fact that, for some reason--and this reminds me too \nmuch of the last Congress--it looks to me like the majority leader and \nthe Republican majority have made the strategic decision that we will \nnot be allowed to have amendments on the floor, debate, and up-or-down \nvotes so all Senators are held accountable about education. You cannot \ndance at two weddings at the same time. You cannot say you are for \neducation, education, education, you are for children, children, \nchildren, and then say, when Senator Murray and Senator Kennedy and \nsome of the rest of us come out here on the floor of the Senate with an \namendment to reduce class size, that you won't even let us vote on it. \nThis isn't going to work.\n  This isn't going to work, because one of the best things we can do is \nto provide some additional resources so that our school districts can \nreduce class size and, at least at the elementary school level, our \nteachers can do better by our students, our parents can do better by \nour students.\n  I come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to speak on behalf of this \namendment. I come to the floor of the U.S. Senate with a mixed mind. On \nthe one hand, to use ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' I am not disappointed \nthat the majority leader is blocking Senators from offering amendments, \nbecause I think it is going to mean this bill is going to go nowhere, \nand I think that will be better for the country. On the other hand, I \nam really saddened by it and outraged by it because I think this \namendment to reduce class size is real. This is real stuff. This makes \na little bit of a difference. I would rather we do even more on this.\n\n  So with all due respect, I think it is a shame. I think my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle are making a huge mistake in trying to \nblock a debate, in trying to block a vote, in trying to block an effort \nto reduce class size. And if it is blocked on this bill, I assume this \namendment will come up over and over and over again, and all of us will \nbe out here talking about it on other pieces of legislation. And we \nwill be talking about pre-K, and we will be talking about rebuilding \ncrumbling schools, and we will be talking about support services for \nkids at a very early age, and we will be talking about a whole lot of \nother things that lead to an improvement in the quality of education \nfor our children.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues, you are not going to gag us on \nthis. You are not going to silence us on this. We are going to have \ndebates about education on the floor of the U.S. Senate. This is just \nthe beginning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I just want to remark very briefly. All we have done--\nand I do not understand why my good friend from Minnesota cannot agree \nwith it--is to give the Senate a choice. Do you want to send it for \nspecial ed, where it is desperately needed, or do you want to see \nwhether the States would prefer to have it to put more teachers in \nplace? It is as simple as that. We are not getting an opportunity to \nvote on our amendment either.\n  Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. For 9 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, thank you.\n  It must be really confusing to people following this debate over the \nlast several days, especially after people have been away for the \nweekend coming back now. In about an hour, we will have a vote called a \ncloture vote on a topic that means a great deal to the American people. \nI had a chance to review some of this in some town meetings over the \nlast 2 days. I have come back even more convinced we have a real \nobligation to pass this simple, direct bill that will be translated \ninto\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\nimproving education opportunities for people all across America.\n  This bill--a simple bill--is a bill I brought to the floor last week \ncalled the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. The cloture vote, in \n55 minutes, is an attempt on our part to say, let's bring this bill in \nas clean a fashion as possible, addressing flexibility, addressing \naccountability, at no expense --at no cost; this bill does not cost a \nsingle cent--and let's vote on that bill. Let's not clutter it with all \nsorts of different amendments from either side of the aisle.\n  I think it is very sad that we are having to file cloture on this \nbill to bring it to a vote, because it is a worthy bill. It is a bill \nthat has the support of every Governor in the United States of America. \nIt is a bill that is bipartisan. My principal cosponsor is the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden.\n\n  It is ostensibly supported by the President of the United States. He \nfirst called for this bill, in fact, about 13 months ago, and has been \nin support of the bill since that time. Just last week he spoke out in \nsupport of the bill and said let's pass Ed-Flex. I think it is sadder \nstill--yes, we are voting on cloture--but sadder still that now we are \nplaying politics, playing politics with the future of our children, \nwith our children's education. And that is what it is.\n  It became really clear to me as I was at home and I was in Mountain \nCity, which is at the far east end of Tennessee, and went across \nTennessee and ended up in Memphis yesterday talking about education. \nThey said: ``If there's one thing we want you to do, U.S. Senate, \nCongress, the Washington Federal Government, it is to stop playing \npolitics and pass useful legislation that you know will work.'' And we \nhave in this Ed-Flex bill. We have 5 years of experience with a program \nthat has been demonstrated to work. Numerous examples have been cited \nagain and again. Stop playing politics.\n  Let me just very briefly bring people up to date in terms of the \nhistory of this legislation. Senator Wyden and I worked together on a \ntask force on the Budget Committee which complemented much of the work \nwe did last year on the Labor Committee and identified a particular \nprogram that, as we held our hearings, very clearly worked. We heard \nthe examples from Texas and from Vermont and from Massachusetts--all of \nwhom came forward and said this is a program that allows us to focus \nthe resources, with the intent out of Washington, DC, but to do it in \nsuch a way as we do it with respect to our needs in our local \ncommunities, in our local schools, in our local school districts--with \nthe same goals, with the same money, with the same intent of the \nFederal Government, but without the Washington red tape, without the \nexcessive bureaucratic regulations. And that is what Ed-Flex is about.\n  I did not bring this bill to the floor to be cluttered with another \n25 different spending programs, however well intended they are. No. \nThere is a more appropriate place to be dealing with that, and that is \non the reauthorization which is currently underway in the Health and \nEducation Committee, that reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  Ed-Flex is a valuable program. It is a bipartisan program. It has \nbeen demonstrated to work. We introduced Ed-Flex just last July. I \nworked very closely with the Department of Education: How can we make \nabsolutely sure that we have strong accountability provisions built \ninto this piece of legislation? It only makes sense, if you are giving \nlocal communities more flexibility, to innovate, to be creative, and to \nanswer those challenges that are out there in educating our children--\nby taking into account those local needs specific to whatever school \nmight be considering a particular issue.\n  The Department of Education came, and we worked closely together. I \nworked with Secretary Riley, and last year he endorsed this very bill. \nThe Labor Committee approved this bill 17-1--not 9-9 or 10-8, but 17 in \nfavor of Ed-Flex and 1 against. We ran out of time last year.\n  We reintroduced Ed-Flex this year. The Health and Education Committee \nagain reported this bill out of committee, and now we are on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate debating this simple, straightforward bill on \neducation flexibility with accountability. Yet clearly we are getting \noff in other directions. We have had a list of amendments come in. One \nprogram cost $12 billion, we want to add; another cost $80 million. I \nplead with both sides of the aisle, let's step back and pass the bill \nwe brought to the floor.\n  Let me also say--and again it is an important point--it is important \nfor my colleagues who are not on the Health and Education Committee to \nunderstand, and for Americans and Tennesseans to understand, that the \nvehicle, the appropriate vehicle to which we should be considering, \nwhether it is construction or whether it is getting dollars all the way \nto the classroom or whether it is 100,000 new teachers or better \nteacher preparation in terms of quality, the appropriate place is not \non the Ed-Flex bill, which does not cost anything, which allows for \nthis innovation, but through the authorization process currently \nunderway. We are having hearings right now, and will over the next \nseveral weeks and months, on the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, where we look at all of these programs, kindergarten through 12.\n  Some, as I said, would rather play politics with this bill. I really \ncall upon my colleagues to put the politics aside and pass this bill.\n  Ed-Flex does not cost a dime. The bill on the floor does not cost a \nsingle dime, yet an amendment just came to the floor which costs $12 \nbillion over 6 years--$12 billion. The appropriate place to debate that \nis where you are looking at other resources we need to put into \neducation and have that debate.\n  Chairman Jeffords offered an alternative to those expensive plans, \nand that is we should not be out there funding all these new programs \nwhich have come along as amendments until we fulfill a promise we made \nin 1974.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire just outlined that we should not be \ndebating funding new programs until we fully fund our special needs \nchildren, special education, where we made a promise in the past. \nIndeed, the Senate voted 100 to 0 to support that approach, although it \nseems now we have people backing away from that commitment.\n  Madam President, the floor debate has not focused on the real merits \nof the Ed-Flex bill. In fact, I bet if we can get cloture today, when \nthis bill comes to the floor the vote will be probably 99-1 in favor of \nthe Ed-Flex bill. I plead that people vote in favor of cloture so we \ncan vote on the Ed-Flex bill without introducing myriad amendments.\n  We have moved beyond talking about Ed-Flex to the political posturing \nand the doublespeak. America is not going to tolerate it, I don't \nbelieve, based on my experiences around Tennessee this week. Every \nMember on the other side of the aisle voted to fund the needs of \nspecial education students before spending on new programs, yet today \nwe have seen another amendment discussed which is yet another new \nspending program.\n  We cannot be occupied by political rhetoric. What is at risk is the \nEd-Flex bill. This bill could be brought down if we overload it with \nall of these new programs. That would be a travesty because we could \nhave this bill passed here and in the House and on the President's bill \nin 6 weeks, and 38 States that don't have Ed-Flex now would have that \nprogram available for them if we passed it here in the next several \nweeks. Ed-Flex streamlines our education process, it cuts through \nredtape, it allows States greater flexibility.\n  Let me briefly refer to this chart, and please don't try to dissect \nthe chart. Let me use it as an example of what I am up against. This is \nthe General Accounting Office, and as everybody in the Chamber knows, \nthe General Accounting Office will come in and look at a field and make \nadvice. At one of their presentations, this chart was presented. It \nbasically says here are some target groups that are very important to \neducation. One is teachers, the other is at-risk and delinquent youth, \nand the other is young children. I asked that group a simple question: \nWhat programs do we have today--out of Washington, DC, or what \nDepartments--looking at at-risk and delinquent youth? I don't \nunderstand because I have heard that there were hundreds--200 and 260; \n500 and 560. I asked a simple question: What is Washington doing for \nteachers, for example?\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\n  This is the chart they came back with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield an additional 60 seconds to the Senator.\n  Mr. FRIST. The point I end with, what we are hearing today is to have \na new program put on the outside to address a population that we know \nis important.\n  Look at the complexity of this on this chart, which my staff jokingly \ncalls the spiderweb chart. Look at the 15 different programs for \nteachers. What the other side wants to do is put another program out \nthere.\n  Our argument is to pass a simple program--that allows innovation; it \nhas bipartisan support--instead of introducing a new program. The \nappropriate debate here is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  I plead with my colleagues to pull back on all of these amendments, \npass Ed-Flex, vote in favor of cloture today so we can address a bill \nthat has bipartisan support, that is supported by all 50 Governors, \nsupported by the President of the United States, the Department of \nEducation, and, I bet, 99 U.S. Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I want to express my appreciation to Senator Frist for his excellent \nleadership on this bill. Senator Jeffords, who has managed it, brought \nit out of the committee last year 17-1. It has broad bipartisan \nsupport, and was crafted by Democrats and Republicans. Yet, we get here \nnow and we get into this kind of political brouhaha, this kind of spat \nthat does nothing for education. It is not healthy for America and \nconfuses people about what is important.\n  As Senator Frist noted, we are talking about a bill, Ed-Flex, that \nwill give our school systems some flexibility as we gave the State \nwelfare systems flexibility. We know how well they did when we gave \nthem that flexibility. It would give the school that same kind of \nflexibility and not cost one dime. It would not cost any money.\n  Blithely now, we have a Senator walking in here to propose a $12-\nbillion amendment--just like that--100,000 teachers. Somebody ran a \nfocus group, I suppose, did a poll somewhere and the people said, ``We \nlike teachers; we like smaller class sizes.''\n  We have hired Ph.Ds and experienced teachers to lead our school \nsystems. Principals all across America are concerned about the schools \nin your community and in my community. I don't know why we should have \nsome mandate here; we haven't even had hearings on this. We will spend \n$12 billion on teachers--maybe we ought to consider whether we should \nspend it on something else.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Governors' Association. \nThere is not a Governor in America today who didn't get elected who \npromised to improve education in his State. They are committed to the \nimprovement of education in their States. They love their children in \ntheir States as much or more than Senators love the children in each of \nthe 50 States. They want good school systems. They support this bill. \nThey are calling on us to pass this bill and get out of this political \nfolderol we are going through. Our new Governor in Alabama, a Democrat, \nDon Siegelman, supports this bill. Dr. Ed Richardson, the Alabama State \nsuperintendent of education, supports the legislation.\n  I will share some information with this body. One of my staff people \nvisited a Montgomery title I school in a poor neighborhood, sat down \nwith the principal, and asked him what he would like for his school \nsystem if he could name it right now. The principal, Mr. Thomas \nToleston, from Southlawn Elementary School, when asked what he would do \nif he could be free from redtape and Federal regulations, said:\n\n       I would ensure that Southlawn implement a comprehensive \n     summer school program.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I don't have the time to give you.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will give you 1 additional minute, Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Thomas Toleston listed a number of items, including \ntaking kids to educational programs like NASA, afterschool programs, he \nmentioned bringing in extended-day programs and for paying faculty for \nextended-day programs.\n  I just say this: The people we elected in our communities care about \nour children. We ought to allow them to do their job with the least \npossible headache from Washington. It is arrogant of us to think we \nknow better how to spend the money to educate the children than the \npeople who elected us.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to just take a few moments at \nthis time, because we have others who would like to speak, to say that \nI am somewhat perplexed at some of the arguments that have been made \nhere this afternoon about the importance of local control and the role \nof the States in terms of education, because just last fall, in \nOctober, we gave assurance to the States that there would be help and \nassistance toward making the classrooms smaller. We gave them those \nassurances. Communities all across the country were depending on them.\n  Now we have an amendment on the floor that effectively wipes out that \ncommitment. So not only do local school districts not know how to plan \nfor the future, but they don't even know now--even with the assurance \nthey have gotten from HEW--about what funds would come into local \ncommunities and whether they would have the resources to be able to \nplan for the fall. If that makes a great deal of sense, it makes a \ngreat deal of sense to others, not to me.\n  Now, Madam President, I will include in the Record what we have done \nover the past several years on increasing funding in education. We have \nseen that, since 1995, we have made a bipartisan commitment to increase \nIDEA funding by $2 billion. That has been very worthwhile. Many of our \nRepublican friends initiated that. I am glad to support it. It made \nsense and it continues to make sense. We also had a bipartisan \ncommitment to help the neediest children in America by increasing Title \nI funding by one billion dollars. We have initiated bipartisan \ncommitments for the funding of afterschool programs and education \ntechnology by about $700 million. Since 1995, we have expanded \nopportunities for qualified students to go to college. And last year, \nwe made a 1-year downpayment on a bipartisan commitment to reducing \nclass size across the country over 7 years.\n  We reject the idea of pitting children against children. I listened \nto the eloquence of my friend from New Hampshire, talking about how we \nwanted one group of children to benefit at the expense of other \nchildren. Let me just mention that I am strongly committed toward \nenhancing the resources available to the IDEA, just as I am for \nsupporting the Murray amendment. Improving teacher quality, having \nwell-trained teachers, can identify children with special needs early \nand better address their needs. They can also better teach all \nchildren. If you are talking about special needs children, improving \nthe teacher quality and getting well-trained teachers helps us to meet \nthat responsibility.\n  Reducing class size, as the Murray amendment provides for, would help \nall children--all children--including children with disabilities. They \nwould get more individual attention, which they need. Modernizing the \nschool buildings--school construction--would offer support and help for \nall children, including those with disabilities and give them access to \nsafe and modern schools. Children with disabilities would benefit from \nhaving buildings with appropriate access to school facilities and \nbuildings equipped to handle modern technologies. Expanding the \nafterschool programs would help all children, including those with \ndisabilities, stay off the street and out of trouble and help them get \nextra academic help. The Reading Excellence Act will help all children \nread well early. It will help teachers address reading difficulties \nearly and possibly eliminate the need for costly special\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\neducation later. All of these initiatives would help all children, \nincluding children with disabilities, get better educations.\n  We are committed to all of these factors, to try to help children all \nacross the country. So we welcome the opportunity to work with the \nSenator from New Hampshire, or any others, to see expanded resources \nfor IDEA. It is essential and important. But we don't want to penalize \nsome children to benefit others. Let's make a commitment that we move \nall the children along together.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote for \ncloture on this bill. This is an important piece of legislation in \nwhich there is bipartisan support. I just plead with my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle--who are being obstructionists and are \nholding up a piece of legislation that the National Governors' \nAssociation supports, Republicans and Democrats support, educators \nacross this country support, and which makes good sense--let's vote for \ncloture and move on to the debate so that we can give the American \npeople what they deserve in better education.\n  In voting for cloture, we will be voting to cut educational \nbureaucracy and ensure greater resources going to the children. In the \nState of Arizona--\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question on my time?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the objection of the Senator to agreeing to a \ntime limitation on the five amendments and to move toward final passage \non tomorrow?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The five amendments that have been proposed add \nbillions and billions of dollars in costs when the first obligation, \nthe commitment the Senator speaks of, has already been made to the \neducators in IDEA, in providing the full funding for special education \nacross this country.\n  Reclaiming my time, to vote for this cloture is to vote to cut \neducational bureaucracy. In Arizona, 165 employees--nearly half of the \nwhole workforce of their Department of Education-- oversee only Federal \nprograms accounting for only 6 percent of the funding. I say that is \nwhere we can take a step in the right direction in the passage of this \nbill.\n  We should not be funding new programs. This amendment that Senator \nKennedy refers to is a $12.635 billion amendment. That is the kind of \namendment that will destroy the possibility of passing this bill into \nlaw and ensuring better education for our children. We don't need new \nspending programs until we have made the commitment that we made to the \nNation's Governors in providing a full 40 percent of funding for \nspecial education. If there is a complaint from local schools, it is \nnot that we are not starting enough new programs, it is that we are not \nfunding the programs that we already mandated to them.\n  I look forward to debating the amendment for 100,000 new teachers--\n$12 billion. Let me just refer to my home State of Arkansas where, \nbetween 1955 and 1997, class size dropped from 27.4 students per \nclassroom to 17 students per classroom. We are doing the job on cutting \nthe size of classrooms, but we have not seen a comparable improvement \nin academic performance. Why do we assume that this is the only great \nneed that schools have and we are going to decide it in Washington, DC? \nWhile public school enrollment in Arkansas has decreased by 1.3 percent \nin the last 26 years, the number of teachers has grown by over 12,000--\nfrom 17,000 to 29,000.\n  We don't need to give them the .3 teachers per classroom that they \nwill get under this amendment. We need to give them greater flexibility \nso they can do a better job. I ask my colleagues: After 7 years, if we \ndo this, after we fund this, if we fund these 100,000 teachers for 7 \nyears, what then? How will the schools fund those teachers then? I \nsuggest to you that it will be the COPS Program all over again.\n  I had a call this week from the director of the State police in \nArkansas who said, ``We hired 90 State police officers under the COPS \nProgram, and now the money is ending. What do we do? How do we pay for \nthem? You have to keep the money coming.''\n  After 7 years, what we will have done is either pull the rug out from \nunder local educators, where they have to come up with additional local \nfunding--schools that are already strapped--or they are going to look \nto Washington, as they have before, and we will have created another \nnew entitlement in permanently funding teachers from Washington, DC.\n  That is not what we need to do to improve education in this country. \nThat is not what we need to do for the children of this country. What \nwe do need to do is to pass this bill, eliminate some of the hoops we \ncurrently make the States jump through, allow them greater flexibility \nin doing reforms, and improve education creatively at the local level \nwhere the decisions can best be made.\n  Let's reject the ``one-size-fits-all'' solution from Washington. \nLet's approve this cloture motion and move on to provide educational \nflexibility for the schools of this country.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, as a newcomer to the Senate, I have \nbeen perplexed by the great debate over Ed-Flex. I would like to say \nthat Ed-Flex is not the beginning and the end in terms of education. \nWhen we first talked about Ed-Flex early on in this session, the \nthought was that we would move it out early before we got into the \ngreat debate over the reauthorization of elementary and secondary \neducation and to understanding that there are a lot of things we needed \nto discuss --more teachers, school construction; on our side of the \naisle, block granting all the money into the classroom, and many other \nthings. It was a bipartisan effort.\n  As chairman of the National Governors' Association a year ago, I was \nat the White House. I said to the President, ``We would like to see Ed-\nFlex for all the States.'' By the way, we don't need it in Ohio. We \nwere one of the first States to get Ed-Flex. I thought it would be \nwonderful if the other States had the same opportunities we had in \nOhio. The President said, ``I am for Ed-Flex.'' Tom Carper, now the \nchairman of the National Governors' Association, Governor Carper, was \nat the White House. Again, the President said, ``I am for Ed-Flex.''\n  This bill is just aimed at giving the other 38 States in the United \nStates of America the opportunity to use these waivers the way we have \nin Ohio. We believe they have helped us do a better job with the money \nthat has been made available under various Federal programs. We can \nshow, for example, where we have been able to get waivers under title \nI, and how it has improved the performance of our children in our title \nI schools. We have been able to show that by getting waivers to the \nEisenhower professional grants that the money has been used better than \nit was before.\n  One of the things we all ought to be concerned about here in the \nSenate is you can't get an Ed-Flex waiver without putting a kind of \nGoals 2000 plan together, getting a State to waive their regulations \nand some of their statutes, and allowing a school district to look at \nall of these programs and come up with a plan that is going to do a \nbetter job of taking care of their boys and girls in their respective \nschool districts.\n  I was saying to one of the Senators yesterday that in terms of Ed-\nFlex I wish every school district that was title I would ask for a \nwaiver, because at least you would then be able to go back a year later \nand find out whether or not that title I money is really making a \ndifference in the lives of those children.\n  I just think the issue of--a lot of these great things have been \ntalked about, Senator Kennedy and others have--but I think the thought \nwas that we need to spend the time discussing those things as we move \nthrough the reauthorization of elementary and secondary education. \nThere were a lot of people on my side of the aisle who didn't want to \ngo along with Ed-Flex because they thought it would spoil their bills \nthat block grant money into the classroom.\n\n  So I just think that all of us who really care about the kids ought \nto get\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\non with Ed-Flex and talk about these other programs as we move through \nthis session as we had originally anticipated.\n  As I say, the President agrees. All the Governors agree. It is an \nopportunity for the Federal Government to become a better partner to \nStates and local governments to do a better job in providing help for \nour children. I just think this concept of ``one size fits all'' coming \nout of Washington doesn't work. We don't have a national school board. \nI must tell you that in Ohio what came out of Columbus, ``one size fits \nall,'' did not work. ``One size fits all'' doesn't work in individual \nschool districts because of the fact that those districts are \ndifferent.\n  This legislation gives all of the States an opportunity to take \nadvantage of Federal money and meld it with money they are spending on \nthe local and State level and make a real difference in the lives of \nour boys and girls in this country and achieves measurable improvement \nin the classroom. That is what people want--accountability.\n  I urge my colleagues to end the debate. Let's get on with it. Some of \nthese other issues that are so very, very important which are near and \ndear to their hearts--I am not going to get into the argument about \nwhether class size or the Federal Government should hire more teachers, \nand so forth; I will not get into that. I have feelings about that. But \nI think we need to do that later on and not on this piece of \nlegislation.\n  One other thing that I think needs to be pointed out, Ed-Flex does \nnot cost one dime--not one dime.\n  What we should think about is that I think it will allow us to use--I \ndon't think--I know it will be able to use the money we are getting \nfrom the Federal Government in a more effective way of helping our \nchildren in the classroom.\n  Some of the other things that have been talked about here are the \namendments to this legislation are going to cost money. The question \nis, Where is the money going to come from? That ought to be taken into \nconsideration when we are looking at the whole smorgasbord of \neducational priorities and look at the dollars that are available, and \nthen conclude that is it better to, say, fund IDEA rather than putting \nthe money into new teachers or into new classroom construction?\n  As Senator Kennedy notes, I am very interested in zero to 3. We would \nbe better off taking money from new classrooms and for hiring new \nteachers and focusing it on zero to 3 where we know that a lot more \nneeds to be done, and where we know that if we invest early on in the \nchild's life we are going to get a better return.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for cloture. Let's get Ed-Flex done. \nLet's get on with the debate over how we are going to spend the money \navailable to make the biggest difference in the lives of our children \nin this country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from \nMassachusetts yielding me some time to speak.\n  I strongly support the Ed-Flex legislation. In fact, New Mexico has \nseen the benefit of being one of the Ed-Flex States for the last 3-plus \nyears. So we have seen there is some value in that. We certainly favor \nexpanding that authority to other States as well. But I don't \nunderstand why we are in the condition or situation we are in here on \nthe Senate floor today. I am not opposed to Ed-Flex. I am just in favor \nof going ahead and doing a few other things at the same time.\n  I proposed an amendment which incorporates the provisions of the \nDropout Prevention Act, which passed this Senate by 74 votes in the \nlast Congress. All we are saying is that is a bill which had 30 \nRepublican Senators supporting it. It had, I believe, virtually all \nDemocratic Senators, or nearly all Democratic Senators, supporting it. \nThat is something we can agree upon. Let's go ahead with that. That is \na priority.\n  We do not need to say, ``Look, it has to be Ed-Flex alone, or it can \nbe nothing.'' That is the part of this debate that I don't really \nunderstand. The notion is sort of being left out there that somehow or \nother we are trying to stall a resolution of this issue or stall the \nfinal vote on Ed-Flex.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. I would be happy to have a \nvote on this Dropout Prevention Act amendment which I proposed last \nweek after 15 minutes of debate on our side and 15 minutes of debate on \nthe other side.\n  So there is no effort by me or my cosponsors to slow down the \nconsideration of this Ed-Flex bill. I believe that the other Senators \nwho are interested in having amendments brought to the floor for \nconsideration would also be glad to have short time limits so that \nthose amendments could be considered and voted upon by the Senate.\n  Clearly, if the Senate believes that some of these proposals are too \nexpensive, then we can vote against them. If the Senate believes that \nsome of these proposals are not yet refined enough and need to be \npostponed until the Elementary and Secondary Education Act comes to the \nfloor, that is fine; you can vote against the amendment at this time \nand explain that is the reason. But I do not understand why we can't at \nleast have votes on the other important education proposals that people \nfeel strongly about going ahead with.\n  My own State, as I said, has this Ed-Flex provision in law already. \nWe have had it for over 3 years now. During that time, 1 of the school \ndistricts--we have 89 school districts in New Mexico--1 of our 89 \nschool districts applied for a waiver 1 time during those 3 years. As \nyou can see, we have not used the Ed-Flex authority to great advantage \nin our State, and I think that may be partly our fault.\n  But Ed-Flex is not a cure-all. I support expanding the authority to \nall States. I support putting it in permanent law. But I do not think \nwe should be out here on the Senate floor leaving the impression that, \nonce we pass this, all the problems of education are going to be \nresolved and the States are going to have this tremendous capability to \nresolve everything and the problems will go away.\n  During the 3 years we have had Ed-Flex authority in New Mexico, we \nhave had 1 application by 1 of the 89 school districts for 1 waiver, \nand at the same time--and that waiver was granted --we have had 20,000 \nof our New Mexico students drop out of school before they graduate.\n  So I come to this from the point of view that it is at least as \nimportant with my State that we go ahead and consider the problem of \nstudents dropping out of school in the early part of this Congress. \nSome say we can deal with that later. Well, if later means a year and a \nhalf or 18 months from now, at the end of the 106th Congress, if that \nis as soon as we can do it, fine. But if it is important for the Senate \nto move ahead at this point on Ed-Flex, it is also important that the \nSenate move ahead at this point on this dropout prevention initiative.\n  A preliminary analysis of last week's fourth grade reading scores \nshowed where the problem begins--or early indications of the problem. \nBetween 1992 and 1998, the gap in reading skills between Hispanic \nstudents and non-Hispanic students in nine of our States widened, and \nonly in four States did that gap decrease. So we are going in the wrong \ndirection as far as heading off this dropout problem. I do not think \nEd-Flex is going to solve that. I favor giving that authority to the \nStates. I favor using it more effectively in my own State of New \nMexico.\n  I certainly intend to vote for this bill, but I also think it is \nappropriate that Senators be allowed to offer amendments and get votes \non them. As I say, if people want to vote against the amendments, that \nis fine. But I don't see why we cannot have a vote on an amendment \nunless that amendment somehow passes some kind of litmus test.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I do urge my colleagues to oppose \ncloture at this time so we can offer our amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island from the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise today to join my colleagues to urge that we not only debate \nthis Ed-Flex bill but we also consider thoughtfully, carefully, and \ncompletely many of the amendments that are being put forward by my \ncolleagues.\n  Senator Bingaman has talked with great eloquence and knowledge about \ndropout prevention. He has worked for many years to make sure there is \na response to that growing problem here in the United States. That is \ncertainly a legitimate issue to bring to this debate on education \nflexibility. And there are other amendments that should and must be \nconsidered.\n  Many--in fact, all--who have spoken about education flexibility have \nstressed the need for accountability. The Governors have stressed it. \nSeveral Governors appeared before our Education and Labor Committee to \ntalk about not only the need for Ed-Flex but also to insist that they \nneed real accountability to accompany this legislation.\n  Real accountability means something more than just words. I, for \nexample, have an amendment that would provide for parental involvement \nin accountability in this process, for notification of parents of the \nproposed State plan, the pulling together of comments by parents, \nteachers, and others, and the incorporation of these comments in the \napplication that goes forward to the Secretary of Education. If we \ncan't give parents a voice in education flexibility, then we are not \nonly missing a great opportunity but missing a significant and primary \nresponsibility, and yet that is pending without a vote.\n  So there is much work left to be done, and I hope we will defeat the \nmotion for cloture so that we can get on with this work, so that we can \nfairly consider these amendments, we can vote them up or down, but we \ncan consider them. I hope that is the case.\n  Interestingly enough--and I know this is something that all of my \ncolleagues do--I spent this morning in a school in Rhode Island. I went \nto the Norwood Avenue Elementary School in Cranston, RI, and I read to \nfirst graders, which is a very challenging assignment. And after that, \nI am even more in favor of smaller class sizes that Senator Murray \nproposes.\n  Then I went to the Warwick Neck School in Warwick, RI, and read to \nfirst graders. Then I concluded the morning by going to the Mandela \nWoods School in Providence, RI. This is a new school which just opened, \nand it has the most diverse population you would want to see in an \nAmerica school--African Americans, Asian Americans, Latin Americans. It \nis a tapestry of urban education in the United States. While I was \nthere, it struck me again and again the importance of the issues we are \ntalking about --not just educational flexibility but all of the issues, \nhow smaller class sizes contribute to better performance. And this is \nthe case in the Warwick Neck school, because that is a small school in \nand of itself with small class sizes. The principal was very, very \nproud of the fact it had done very well in statewide mathematics \ntesting as a result of their efforts.\n  So the issue of small class size is there, but also--and I know we \nhave talked about special education--we are beginning to understand now \nthat special education is in many respects a function of early \nchildhood intervention, not just educationally but also in terms of \nhealth care. There is a problem in Rhode Island, a terrible problem in \nRhode Island, and other places, of lead paint exposure, and that \nproblem leads directly to educational complications.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair for reminding me, and I again urge that \nwe continue this debate, because it is an appropriate, indeed, \nimportant, debate, and I hope it continues past this cloture vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6 minutes remaining on the Senator's \nside.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. And how much on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, if I could take just a few minutes, the \nvote is going to occur here on cloture in a few short minutes. I have \nto say, I have listened to the debate over the past week, and we are \ncoming to the last several minutes. We are going to be voting at 5 \no'clock whether or not to have cloture on the Ed-Flex bill that is \nbefore us. If cloture is invoked, essentially what will happen is, all \nof the education amendments we have been talking about--class size \nreduction, dropout prevention, parent accountability that Senator Reed \nof Rhode Island just talked about, afterschool care--we will be \nprecluded from offering these amendments.\n  I have been out here for the last week ready to offer my amendment on \nreducing class size, willing to work with my Republican colleagues on a \ntime agreement, willing to do what we needed to do in terms of any \nlanguage that they would like to be amended or changed, but knowing \nthat school boards across this country are waiting for us to make a \ndecision on whether or not we are actually going to authorize reducing \nclass size and make a firm commitment to putting 100,000 new, well-\ntrained teachers in classrooms.\n  Madam President, I have to say that I am baffled as we come into the \nlast several minutes before we vote on cloture. We worked very hard \nlast year, last fall, as we put the budget agreement together, to put \ntogether a bipartisan agreement on class size, and we got that. \nRepublicans and Democrats alike said yes, we are going to make a \ncommitment to reduce class size in the first through third grade. We \nagree with what the studies show. We agree with what parents are asking \nus to do. We understand that it makes a difference in the learning of a \nchild in the first, second, and third grade if they are in a class size \nthat is reduced. We understand that their grades will be better as they \nget into high school. We understand that discipline problems will be \nreduced. We understand they will have a better and higher likelihood of \ngoing on to college. We understand that as the Federal Government we \nneed to reach out and be a part of the solution and give a commitment \nof dollars to those school districts to hire teachers. It was a \nbipartisan agreement. I am baffled today by my Republican colleagues \nwho now no longer are supporting this.\n\n  Last fall I watched the campaign and elections, and, as did many in \nmy State, I am sure, I watched the ads from the Republicans saying they \nsupport reduced class size. Madam President, this is our opportunity to \nvote to authorize this program and really say we are committed to doing \nthis. It will make a difference. It is absolutely essential. It is \nimportant that we be a part of this.\n  Over the last 6\\1/2\\ years that I have been here, I have listened to \na number of my colleagues come to the floor to speak as ``a \nbusinessperson who has run a major million-dollar business.'' I have \nlistened to my colleagues, who come here as former Governors or former \nattorneys general or former State legislators, talk about their \nexperience in their fields. Madam President, I stand before you today \nas a former teacher. I can tell you that it makes a difference whether \nyou have 18 students in your class or you have 24 or you have 30. It \nmakes a difference whether or not you have the ability to take that one \nyoung boy or girl and help that child really get his or her alphabet \ndown so that child can read later, or if you ignore that child and say, \n``Gosh, I really would like to help, but I have 30 kids here and there \nare winners and losers.''\n  Those young children you cannot help because your class size is too \nlarge still grow up. They go on to high school. They probably don't go \non to college. They become failures at an early grade.\n  We have a responsibility. We actually have an ability right now to \nsend a message to those little boys and girls, to young students, to \nteachers, that we are going to give them the attention they need in \nfirst, second and third grade. Our amendment authorizes a 6-year \ninvestment in helping school districts hire 100,000 well-trained \nteachers. If we follow through on this commitment I guarantee, as a \nformer teacher, as a parent, as a school board member, that 12 years \nfrom now we will have\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\nyoung boys and girls, young students, graduating from high school who \nwill be competent in reading, writing and math, because they were in a \nclass with a size we helped reduce today.\n  If we do not make that commitment, there will be kids who may not \ngraduate from high school, may have discipline problems, will not go on \nto college. They will become a burden to all of us. They will not be \nable to get a job in the high-tech industries that are saying, we need \nhighly skilled students who graduate. They will not be able to compete \nand go on to college. They will become economically disadvantaged, and \nthe Senate will be here, 12 years from now, wondering how we, as a \nnation, are going to be able to afford to continue to help kids who we \ndidn't help 12 years ago.\n  Madam President, we have an opportunity to vote on this amendment and \non the amendments of several of my colleagues who have made very good, \nstrong arguments about what we can do to make education better in this \ncountry; reducing class size, training teachers, school construction, \nafterschool programs--real issues that will help young students. We \nwill have the opportunity to do that if the majority leader will only \nallow us to offer our amendments.\n  We should not be precluded on the floor of the U.S. Senate from \noffering our amendments. If our colleagues want to vote no, they can \nvote no. If they want to vote with us, they can vote with us. But no \none should come to this floor and be told that you cannot present your \namendment.\n  I am ready to go. I am ready to have a time agreement. I ask my \ncolleagues to support us in opposing cloture, and I will be back again \nand again until I can make a difference with class size reduction. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I could briefly comment on the process we \njust went through and where we are with regard to this bill, Ed-Flex, \nthe education flexibility bill, that is the underlying bill. It has \nbroad bipartisan support. The President is for it. He had suggested we \nshould pass it last year. We did not get it done, but he went before \nthe National Governors' Association and called again for this \nlegislation and says that he supports it. The National Governors' \nAssociation--all 50 of the Governors--supported a resolution in support \nof this bill, education flexibility.\n  Twelve States have this flexibility now. My State is not one of \nthose. It has been working quite well, I understand, in Massachusetts \nand in Maryland and other States where they now have this option in \nthose 12 States. The rest of us want it.\n  I just came from Chester, PA, earlier today, and Pennsylvania does \nnot have this education flexibility. They would like to have it. They \ndesperately would like to have it. The Governor of that State said: \nPlease, give me this option. Let's waive some of this paperwork and the \nregulatory requirements. Let's have this option so we can give schools \nthe flexibility, at the local level, to make these decisions to where \nthe funds can best be used but results based. We need to see the proof \nthat it actually is working. And all of that is included in this \nlegislation.\n  But in spite of that broad bipartisan support that we wanted to \ncontinue to show with this legislation, we now see there is a raft of \namendments developing that would undermine or stop or add to, explode \nthis legislation. I have asked the Members on this side of the aisle to \ntry to withhold a whole number of amendments.\n  We started off the first week--last week or the week before last--\nwith a very broad bill in support of our military men and women. The \nSoldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights passed \noverwhelmingly. I believe that if we can get to a direct vote on Ed-\nFlex to waive this bureaucratic redtape that the vote would probably be \n98-2 or 100-0. But now we see, with all these amendments being offered, \nand with us having no option but to add amendments of our own, with \nsupport for the special education commitment being fulfilled that we \nhave not done, that this legislation now is being bogged down.\n  We see that the first bill of the year that has broad bipartisan \nsupport is now approaching gridlock. Let's don't do that. Free the Ed-\nFlex bill. Let's let this bill go. There will be other opportunities \nfor Democrats and Republicans to offer their ideas on education on \nother bills this year. We have the reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act coming up. There will be plenty of \nopportunities to offer that. I would like for us to have another day or \n2 to discuss the underlying bill and then vote. Let's get it done. I \nthink it is good that we are having an education debate even on those \nissues that we might not have agreement, but let's find a way to move \nthis legislation through.\n  I have encouraged the Members, the Senators that are involved with \nthis, to come up with some recommendations of how maybe we could have a \nlimited number of amendments and then go on to final passage. But \nagain, I call on Senators to free this important legislation. Let's \ngive these other States this opportunity. Let's see if we can't get \nmore decisions made at the local level and give them the option to \ndecide whether this money should go for teachers or to repair roofs or \ntechnology for computers--whatever it may be. But in one school, \nperhaps, they need a greater emphasis on excellence in reading; in \nanother school maybe they don't have a single computer in the \nclassrooms.\n  Let's give them the option, the flexibility to use these Federal \nfunds without Federal Government mandates that you must use it here, \nyou must use it there. I think the American people would support that. \nI know the Governors do. We say we do. Let's find a way to get this \nlegislation passed.\n  I urge the leaders and the managers of the legislation to see if they \ncan come up with some ways to get this bill completed in the next 2 \ndays. But for now we will have a cloture vote on Tuesday. We will have \nat least one cloture vote, I guess maybe two, on Wednesday. And maybe \nin the interim we can find a way to get an agreement to provide for \nfinal passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the statement of \nthe majority leader on the issue that is before us, the Ed-Flex \nlegislation. If you look back over the history, it was officially \ninitiated by an amendment by the Senator from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, \nand myself. It was initially provided that six States were going to \nhave the power of waiver, and then when we considered the Goals 2000 we \nadded six more States.\n  So many of us on this side are very familiar with the legislation, \nare very familiar with the record that has been made, and are in \nsupport of the kind of accountability that the majority leader has \nstated. We are eager to see this legislation move towards completion. \nBut we want to point out too, as the majority leader knows, that the \nunderlying legislation may very well be the major opportunity for \ndebate on education this year. Because the Elementary/Secondary \nEducation Act does not expire until next year, it may very well not be \nup at that time.\n  We will have a chance to express a sense of the Senate on the budget \nitems. We will look forward to debating appropriations. That is \ngenerally the last piece of legislation that comes here in October. But \nthis may very well be the only serious debate on education for the \nwhole year. That is why, given the fact that there is not an extensive \nor busy calendar, given the importance of the issue--education--to \nfamilies all over the country, and given the timeliness of the \nparticular issue--the Murray amendment in terms of giving assurances to \nlocal communities all across the country--it is imperative that we have \nan opportunity for the Senate to address this issue in a brief way. \nSenator Murray has indicated her willingness to enter into a reasonable \ntime limit to move toward a disposition of that legislation and that \nparticular amendment.\n  I just finally remind our colleagues that our leader, Senator \nDaschle, had indicated that he would urge short time limits on as few \nas five or six amendments. I would think that Senator Daschle might \neven be able to get\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\na reduction to maybe even four amendments, even though there are many \nMembers here who have plans and believe they are important. We could \ndispose of all of this in the period of a day, if not a day and a half.\n  It seems to me that it is not unreasonable to say that on this issue \nwhich is of central importance and significance to families all across \nthis country--the issue over partnership, the Federal Government \nworking with the States and local communities--that we address the \nissue of class size, and we also address the very important issue of \nthe funding of the IDEA.\n  I think we can find very, very broad support for making sure that \nlocal communities are going to have the funding for IDEA, but I also \nthink if put to a vote we would have a strong majority of Republicans \nand Democrats in favor of giving the communities across this country \nsome help and assistance in terms of class size. That is something that \nevery parent understands. It is something every teacher understands and \nevery student understands.\n  No one makes that case better than the former school board member and \nformer teacher herself, Senator Murray. I welcome the chance to hear \nher on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the State of Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his statement. He has \nbeen a strong supporter of education. He understands that on this issue \nof class size reduction, parents, families, community members, police, \nmayors, school board members have all stood behind us and said this \nwill make a difference for young children's learning.\n  I remain baffled by the majority leader not allowing us to simply \noffer the amendment with an up-or-down vote. We are more than willing \nto have a time agreement, a short time agreement, and move this bill \nalong.\n  We all know that Ed-Flex has been asked for by 50 Governors. Well, \nreducing class size has been asked for by thousands of parents. It has \nbeen bipartisan--maybe it is not anymore; it certainly was last fall--a \nbipartisan initiative to reduce class size. I still believe that is \ntrue. It is timely, again, as school boards are looking at those \nbudgets. If we can come to an agreement that will allow us to have an \nup-or-down vote, I am happy to offer my amendment. I will stay tonight; \nI can be here tomorrow morning.\n  Let me conclude by saying it is frustrating to be told no and no and \nno time and time again when we want to offer an amendment. I am \nbeginning to feel like one of those kids in one of those large classes \nwho has been told by the teacher time and again, ``You have to wait.'' \nWhen that happens, you get frustrated, you start to think of other \nthings to do. You can become a discipline problem. I don't want to be, \nbut I will tell my colleagues that we want to offer this amendment, we \nwant an up-or-down vote, and as long as we are told we can't move ahead \nwith it, we will think of other things to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, let me comment on the remarks of \nthe Senator from Washington.\n  First of all, this bill is a very simple bill to help the Governors \nhave flexibility--the States to have flexibility to maximize the \nutilization of title I funds, in particular. I don't think anybody \ndisagrees with it.\n  What I have set out as a policy for me, working with the leader, is \nthat this bill ought not to be encumbered by matters which are under \nthe jurisdiction of the committee which should be considered separately \nand after due hearing and after all of the elements of the legislation \nare considered. The amendment of the Senator from Washington really \nshortcuts that.\n  Now, I agree that is an existing piece of legislation which needs \nsome improvement. However, it does not fall out from the jurisdiction \nof the committee. On the other hand, with an appropriate amendment, I \nwill endorse it. So I don't understand the concern of my partners on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  We have an offer which will be before the Senate, and this side can \nendorse her amendment with the modification that is in that amendment. \nWhat that modification does is say, all right, let's reach a compromise \nhere. The compromise would be, very simply, let the local governments \ndecide whether they want to use the money which was appropriated but \nnot quite available; they should have the local option. If they want to \nspend it on more teachers, additional teachers, they should have that \noption. If they want to spend it on IDEA, which I think most of the \ncommunities would do, they would have that option.\n  I don't see why you can say that we are placing ourselves in a \nposition of preventing the amendment from going forward. I don't want \nto do that.\n  Let's also take a look at the problems of this committee. This \ncommittee has huge jurisdiction. The Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct spends about $15 billion, and amendments that have been addressing \nthis bill would bypass the committee's ability to review all of these \nprograms, which we should do. We haven't done so for 5 years, and the \neducation of this country is suffering badly from not being able to \nmaximize the opportunities for our young people.\n  We have already had several hearings. We will have more hearings on \nit, and in the orderly process we ought to take those amendments up and \nvote on them at that time, but not now when we are just starting the \nlegislative session.\n  We will have an opportunity for the Senate to vote on an excellent \namendment to the amendment of the Senator from Washington and give this \nbody an opportunity to express itself. It will be, apparently, \nfilibustered. I don't understand why or how anybody could filibuster an \noption for the local communities to decide whether they want to use it \nfor new teachers or for special education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2410-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2410-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2410-S2411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-2077.

A bill to designate the Federal building located at 33 East \n8th Street in Austin, Texas, as the ``J.J. `Jake' Pickle Federal \nBuilding''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 J.J. ``Jake'' Pickle Federal Building\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison in introducing a bill to name the Austin, Texas federal \nbuilding in honor of a great Texan: Congressman J.J. ``Jake'' Pickle. \nCongressman Pickle became an institution in Washington, D.C. throughout \nhis 30-year tenure in Congress, and his dedication and service to the \npeople of Austin and Central Texas continue today. I had the pleasure \nto serve with him in the House of Representatives, and I hold him in \nhigh esteem for the man he is and the spirit in which he served. Jake \nPickle walked with giants like Lyndon Johnson and Sam Rayburn, and he \nis a giant in his own right. I believe that naming the federal building \nin Austin in Jake's honor is a fitting tribute to his service on behalf \nof our great state and in recognition of his significant and ever-\nlasting contributions to our country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Lautenberg (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Schumer, and Mr. Reed)):\n  S. 560. A bill to reform the manner in which firearms are \nmanufactured and distributed by providing an incentive to State and \nlocal governments to bring claims for the rising costs of gun violence \nin their communities; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              THE GUN INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Gun Industry \nAccountability Act of 1999 along with my colleagues, Senators Durbin, \nSchumer, and Reed of Rhode Island. This legislation is aimed at one \npurpose: to force the gun industry to market and manufacture their \nproducts in a safer and more responsible manner.\n  Mr. President, on Thursday, March 4th I was joined at the \nannouncement of this bill by Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta and Mayor \nAlex Penelas of Miami-Dade County. They represent two of the now five \njurisdictions that have filed claims against the gun industry on behalf \nof the taxpayers of their communities. They seek reimbursement for the \nmassive costs of gun violence within their borders and ultimately, \nmajor changes in the way the gun industry sells its lethal products.\n  Mr. President, the gun industry has long placed profits above the \nsafety of society. The industry ignores numerous, patented safety \ndevices for guns--even things as simple as an indicator of whether a \ngun is loaded. The distributors of firearms also intentionally flood \ncertain markets with guns, knowing that the excess weapons will make \ntheir way into a nearby illegal market.\n  The lawsuits by these courageous mayors will likely prove to be the \nmost effective mechanism to get the Industry to alter their deadly \npractices. The reason is simple: it will bring the gun merchants into \nline by striking where they are most sensitive--the bottom line.\n  To aid this effort, the Gun Industry Accountability Act will \nstrengthen the hand of the cities in court against the formidable \nfirepower of the gun industry and its team of high-priced lawyers. It \nwill help these mayors in their quest to get the industry to lay down \nits weapons, come to the table and finally agree to behave as \nresponsible corporate citizens.\n  Mr. President, under current law, these cities filing claims against \nthe gun industry are only able to recover the costs that their city or \ncounty has paid out due to gun violence. The Gun Industry \nAccountability Act will strengthen the mayors' hands by allowing them \nto recover both the city's costs for gun victims in their area as well \nas the Federal costs associated with these same victims. If a city \neventually recovers Federal costs, either through a court judgment or \nsettlement, then the city will be permitted to keep two thirds of the \nrecovery and return the remaining one third to the Federal Government.\n  By increasing the likely reward for bringing a lawsuit against \nfirearms manufacturers, this legislation will serve as an incentive for \nmore cities, counties and States to join the fight to hold the gun \nindustry accountable. When our legislation passes, it will force the \nindustry to stare down the double barrel of local and federal liability \nin these suits.\n  Mr. President, the potential federal liability is substantial. The \nNational Center for Injury Prevention and Control tells us that 80 \npercent of the economic costs of treating firearms injuries are paid \nfor by taxpayers.\n  Federal taxpayers pick up the tab for disability payments through \nSSI, Veterans Administration, Unemployment, Medicare and other costs of \ntreating victims of gun violence.\n  Mr. President, despite these enormous costs, the gun industry and its \nfriends in the National Rifle Association will go to any length to \navoid accountability. The NRA and its corporate members are seeking \nstate and federal legislation to take away the rights of mayors to \nsafeguard their citizens against unsafe products and irresponsible \nmarketing practices.\n  Unfortunately, the NRA's drive against the legal rights of local \ncommunities has already succeeded in at least one state. In Georgia, \nthe state legislature has already passed a bill at the NRA's request to \nretroactively block the City of Atlanta's suit. Mayor Campbell has \nalready asked the court system to throw out the legislature's \nunconstitutional action.\n  The NRA's extremism has reached new heights in Florida. In that state \nlegislature, a bill has been introduced that would not only block \nMiami-Dade's lawsuit, but also declare Mayor Penelas a felon! In the \nNRA's world, a public official should be imprisoned for acting to \nprotect the safety of his or her constituents.\n  Mr. President, here in Congress there is already talk of Federal \nlegislation to block cities, counties and States from asserting their \nrights in court. If such a bill is introduced it will prove that the \nera of Big Government is certainly not over.\n  Mr. President, I pledge that I will do all I can to make sure that \nbill will never pass the Senate. Senators Durbin, Schumer, Reed and I \nwill work tirelessly against such an unconscionable proposal.\n  Congress should be helping these local communities make their streets \nsafer--not block them from accomplishing that goal.\n  To that end, I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the Gun \nIndustry Accountability Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Gun Industry Accountability \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Across the Nation, local communities are bringing \n     rightful legal claims against the gun industry to seek \n     changes in the manner in which the industry conducts business \n     in the civilian market in those communities.\n       (2) Since firearms are the only widely available consumer \n     product designed to kill, firearm manufactures, distributors, \n     and retailers have a special responsibility to take into \n     account the health and safety of the public in marketing \n     firearms.\n       (3) The gun industry has failed in this responsibility by \n     engaging in practices that have contributed directly to the \n     terrible burden of firearm-related violence on society.\n       (4) The gun industry has generally refused to include \n     numerous safety devices with\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\n     their products, including devices to prevent the unauthorized \n     use of a firearm, indicators that a firearm is loaded, and \n     child safety locks, and the absence of such safety devices \n     has rendered these products unreasonably dangerous.\n       (5) The gun industry has also engaged in distribution \n     practices in which the industry oversupplies certain legal \n     markets with firearms with the knowledge that the excess \n     firearms will be distributed into nearby illegal markets.\n       (6) According to the National Center for Injury Prevention \n     and Control--\n       (A) at least 80 percent of the economic costs of treating \n     firearms injuries are paid for by taxpayer dollars; and\n       (B) in 1990, firearm injuries resulted in costs of more \n     than $24,000,000,000 in hospital and other medical care for \n     long-term disability and premature death.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for a comprehensive, coordinated effort to \ncombat methamphetamine abuse, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n       comprehensive methamphetamine abuse reduction act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nMethamphetamine reduction legislation the Senator from the State of New \nMexico and I are introducing today.\n  Methamphetamine is fast becoming a leading illegal drug in our \nNation. From quiet suburbs, to city streets, to the corn rows of Iowa, \nmeth destroys thousands of lives and families every year.\n  This highly addictive drug is reaching epidemic proportions as it \nsweeps from the west coast, ravages the Midwest, and begins to touch \nthe East. To illustrate the violence it elicits in people, \nmethamphetamine is cited as a contributing factor in 80 percent of \ndomestic violence cases in Iowa and a leading factor in a majority of \nviolent crimes committed in the State.\n  In 1996, I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the \nMethamphetamine Control Act, which has done some good. However, in \ntalking to local enforcement and concerned citizens across Iowa and the \nMidwest, its obvious that the methamphetamine problem has exploded \nbeyond anything we envisioned in 1996.\n  The number of meth arrests, court cases, and confiscation on labs \ncontinues to escalate. In the Midwest alone, the number of clandestine \nmeth labs confiscated and destroyed for 1998 is five times the number \nconfiscated and destroyed in 1997. The cost of cleanup for each lab \nranges from $5,000 to $90,000 and creates a toxic trap to law \nenforcement officers and children who find them.\n  Mr. President, the Midwest is not alone in this battle. The impact of \nthis epidemic has reached the West and Southwest, including the state \nof New Mexico. In Albuquerque alone, law enforcement has seized four \ntimes as much meth last year as they did in the previous year, and they \nhave identified and shut down twice as many meth\n\n[[Page S2414]]\n\nlabs as they had in the previous year. New Mexico has also seen an \nincrease in meth trafficking on the New Mexico-Mexico border, as have \nthe States of Arizona and California.\n  The problem has spread to the rural communities and my colleague, \nSenator Bingaman, is concerned that the cheap cost of meth will \nthreaten America's youth with yet another life-threatening drug.\n  That's why today, Senator Bingaman and I are introducing the \nComprehensive Methamphetamine Abuse Reduction Act of 1999. Senators \nMurray and Johnson are cosponsoring this measure. A similar bill is \nbeing introduced in the House by Congressman Boswell.\n  This legislation takes a comprehensive, common sense approach in \nbattling this growing epidemic. It calls for an increase in resources \nto law enforcement working through the High Intensity Drug Trafficking \nArea (HIDTA) program and establishes swift and certain penalties for \nthose producing and peddling meth. It also reauthorizes and expands \ndrug courts to help nonviolent drug abusers rid themselves of an \naddiction that leads them to other crimes.\n  Our legislation expands school and community-based prevention efforts \nat the local level--targeting those areas that need it the most. That \nincludes funding to allow students to develop their own anti-meth \neducation programs to teach their school peers about the destructive \neffects of this drug.\n  This proposal calls on the National Institute on Drug Abuse to find \nexactly what makes methamphetamine so very addictive--especially to our \nyoung people--and the best methods for beating the addiction.\n  Finally, the bill calls for a joint strategic plan and national \nconference involving local, State and Federal law enforcement, \neducation, health and elected officials to discuss solutions to stop \nthe spread and use of this deadly drug.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we have a window of opportunity as a \nnation to take a stand right now to defeat this scourge. Every day, \nmeth infiltrates our city streets and rural towns, leading more and \nmore people down a path of personal destruction. Families are being \ndevastated and communities are fighting an uphill battle against this \npowerful drug. The time is now to make a stand to protect our \ncommunities and schools by passing this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal a waiver that permitted the issuance of a \ncertificate of documentation with endorsement for employment in the \ncoastwise trade of the vessel Columbus, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              JONES ACT WAIVER FOR THE VESSEL ``COLUMBUS''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I introduce today legislation to repeal the \nJones Act waiver contained in last year's Coast Guard Authorization \nbill for the vessel Columbus.\n  Mr. President, I had serious objections to a provision in last year's \nCoast Guard Authorization bill that was inserted in the House bill in a \nmanagers' amendment with no hearings or vote in the Senate. This \nprovision granted a waiver of existing law for a single vessel \noperating on the Great Lakes and elsewhere against the wishes of both \nMichigan Senators and other Senators and in circumvention of a Customs \nService ruling regarding the type of dredge work this vessel is allowed \nto perform.\n  This waiver is a discriminatory provision which gives special \ntreatment and a competitive advantage to one vessel at the expense of \nits competitors and it should be repealed.\n  Mr. President, the granting of this waiver is detrimental to other \ndredgers on the Great Lakes and elsewhere who are abiding by U.S. law \nand U.S. Customs Service interpretations of the Jones Act. The hopper \ndredge vessel Columbus, the vessel seeking the waiver, was challenged \nby a competitor for violating the Jones Act because it was performing \ndredging work that was not allowed under that Act. That challenge was \nupheld by the U.S. Customs Service. However, instead of abiding by or \nappealing the Customs Service ruling, a legislative waiver was sought \nto circumvent that ruling. The waiver was granted by the House, but not \nthe Senate because the Senate passed Coast Guard authorization bill did \nnot contain this discriminatory provision.\n  The only reason this waiver was included in the final Coast Guard \nauthorization bill was due to the circumstances under which that bill \nwas considered. Under normal circumstances, I believe the Senate would \nhave removed this controversial provision from the final bill.\n  At the time of the Senate vote on the Coast Guard Authorization \nConference Report, I engaged in a colloquy with my colleagues Senators \nSnowe and McCain. In that colloquy, they agreed to work with me to \nrepeal this waiver as early as possible in 1999. The legislation I am \nintroducing today with my colleague from Michigan, Senator Abraham, \nwill do exactly that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 563\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF WAIVER.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 403 of the Coast Guard \n     Authorization Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-383) is amended by \n     striking subsection (e).\n       (b) Action by the Secretary of Transportation.--If, before \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Transportation issued a certificate of documentation with \n     endorsement for employment in the coastwise trade for the \n     vessel COLUMBUS (United States official number 590658) under \n     section 403(e) of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1997 \n     (Public Law 105-383)--\n       (1) that certificate shall be null and void; and\n       (2) the Secretary shall issue a revised certificate of \n     documentation for that vessel that is consistent with the \n     limitations on the operation of that vessel that applied to \n     that vessel on the day before the date of enactment of the \n     Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-383).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. DeWine. Mr. \n        Torricelli, and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 565. A bill to provide for the treatment of the actions of certain \nforeign narcotics traffickers as an unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe United States for purposes of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\ntreatment of the actions of certain foreign narcotics traffickers as an \n         unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, in introducing a bill that targets one \nof America's most dangerous and real national security threats--the \ninternational drug cartels. I am also pleased that Senator DeWine, \nSenator Lott, and Senator Torricelli have agreed to cosponsor this \nimportant legislation. These drug cartels, through their involvement in \nillegal drug trafficking, money laundering, arms trafficking and the \nviolence related to these activities, pose a threat to the political \nand economic stability of countries in this hemisphere. More \nimportantly they threaten the citizens of this country by preying on \nour children.\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\n  That is why it is so important that we introduce this bill today--to \ncombat the drug cartels and move one step forward in the war on drugs. \nThis bill codifies and expand a 1995 Executive Order created under the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which targeted \nColombia drug traffickers. The bill will expand the existing Executive \nOrder to include other foreign drug traffickers considered a threat to \nour national security. The bill freezes the assets of identified drug \ntraffickers, their associates, and their related businesses. It also \nprohibits these individuals and organizations from conducting any \nfinancial or commercial dealings with the United States.\n  Our goal is to isolate the leaders of the drug cartels and prevent \nthem from doing business with the United States. By stopping the drug \nkingpins's ability to benefit from the U.S. market and from practices \nthat enable them to sell drugs to our nation's children, we are taking \nan important step to eliminate the scourge of illegal drugs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 566. A bill to amend the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to exempt \nagricultural commodities, livestock, and value-added products from \nunilateral economic sanctions, to prepare for future bilateral and \nmultilateral trade negotiations affecting United States agriculture, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                   the agricultural trade freedom act\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \nopen foreign markets, eliminate unfair trade barriers and secure for \nfarmers the ability to export their products abroad. By enacting the \n1996 FAIR Act, commonly known as Freedom to Farm, we gave farmers to \nfreedom to make planting decisions for themselves, free from government \ncontrols. However, Freedom to Farm is a compact. Freedom to Farm means \nfreedom to export, and in exchange for phasing out subsidies, Congress \ncommitted to secure free, fair and open markets for our farmer's \nexports. This legislation will improve opportunities to export at a \ntime when such opportunities are more important than ever for U.S. \nagriculture.\n  No sector of the economy is more reliant on international trade than \nagriculture. Approximately three out of ten acres of domestic \nagriculture production are sold in markets outside of the U.S. and \nagricultural exports make a positive impact on our international \nbalance of payments. Despite this success, a great deal of untapped \nexport potential still exists. Farmers are reliant on the ability to \nexport and this legislation will enhance that ability. Barriers need to \nbe removed--barriers we impose on ourselves and barriers imposed by \nothers.\n  This legislation addresses several items but none is more important \nthan sanctions. This legislation exempts commercial agricultural \nexports from unilateral economic sanctions. We impose export barriers \non ourselves when we unilaterally sanction foreign countries. Such \nsanctions do not preclude the targeted country from looking elsewhere \nfor agricultural commodities. U.S. competitors quickly fill the void \nleft when the U.S. denies itself market access. Sales are lost and our \nstatus as a reliable business partner suffers. We often do more harm to \nourselves than we do to the target country. Unilateral sanctions have \ncost billions of dollars in U.S. income and have cost thousands of U.S. \njobs. We must end the practice of closing foreign markets for our own \nexports at a time when such exports are more vital than ever for \nagriculture in this country.\n  Apart from sanctions, a number of barriers are imposed on U.S. farm \nexports by other countries. The World Trade Organization will hold an \nimportant round of agricultural negotiations later this year in \nSeattle. These negotiations offer an important opportunity to address \ntariff and non-tariff barriers to U.S. agricultural exports. We must \ntake advantage of this opportunity to open foreign markets and \neliminate unfair export barriers. This legislation provides important \nguidelines for these and other negotiations.\n  Mr. President, U.S. agriculture is the best in the world. This \nlegislation will allow our farmers to take better advantage of their \nposition by opening up foreign markets and eliminating barriers to \nagricultural exports. This is the most important thing we as Congress \ncan do for our farmers. I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 566\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SALE OR BARTER OF FOOD ASSISTANCE.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the amendments to section \n     203 of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act \n     of 1954 (7 U.S.C. 1723) made by section 208 of the Federal \n     Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law \n     104-127; 110 Stat. 954) were intended to allow the sale or \n     barter of United States agricultural commodities in \n     connection with United States food assistance only within the \n     recipient country or countries adjacent to the recipient \n     country, unless--\n       (1) the sale or barter within the recipient country or \n     adjacent countries is not practicable; and\n       (2) the sale or barter within countries other than the \n     recipient country or adjacent countries will not disrupt \n     commercial markets for the agricultural commodity involved.\n\n     SEC. 6.

note) is amended by \n     striking ``such democracies'' and inserting ``the markets''.\n       (c) Trade Compensation and Assistance Programs.--Section \n     417(a) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. \n     5677(a)) is amended by inserting ``of an agricultural \n     commodity'' after ``causes exports''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     take

Res. 59\n\n       Whereas 44,000,000 people living in the United States read \n     at a level lower than is required to fully function in \n     society and to earn a living wage;\n       Whereas approximately 22 percent of adults in the United \n     States cannot read, leaving valuable resources untapped, and \n     depriving those adults of the opportunity to make a \n     meaningful contribution to society;\n       Whereas people who have the lowest literacy skills are \n     closely connected to social problems such as poverty, crime, \n     welfare, and unemployment.\n       Whereas 43 percent of all adults functioning at the lowest \n     literacy levels live in poverty;\n       Whereas prisons hold the highest concentration of \n     illiterate adults, with 7 of 10 prisoners functioning at the \n     lowest literacy levels;\n       Whereas the likelihood of receiving welfare assistance \n     increases as the level of literacy decreases;\n       Whereas 3 of 4 food stamp recipients function at the lowest \n     literacy levels;\n       Whereas millions of Americans are unable to hold a job or \n     fully function in the workplace because they cannot read well \n     enough to perform routine uncomplicated tasks;\n       Whereas almost 38 percent of African Americans and \n     approximately 56 percent of Hispanics are illiterate, \n     compared to only 14 percent of the Caucasian population, with \n     such a disparity resulting in increased social and economic \n     discrimination against those minorities;\n       Whereas 35 percent of older Americans operate at the lowest \n     literacy levels, making it difficult to read basic medical \n     instructions, thus prolonging illnesses and risking the \n     occurrence of emergency medical conditions;\n       Whereas the cycle of illiteracy continues because children \n     of illiterate parents are often illiterate themselves because \n     of the lack of support they receive from their home \n     environment;\n       Whereas Federal, State, municipal, and private literacy \n     programs have been able to reach fewer than 10 percent of the \n     total illiterate population;\n       Whereas it is vital to call attention to the problem of \n     illiteracy, to understand the severity of the illiteracy \n     problem and the detrimental effects of illiteracy on our \n     society, and to reach those who are illiterate and unaware of \n     the free services and help available to them; and\n       Whereas it is necessary to recognize and thank the \n     thousands of volunteers and organizations, like Focus on \n     Literacy, Inc., that work to promote literacy and provide \n     support to the millions of illiterate persons needing \n     assistance: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates both July 2, 1999, and July 2, 2000, as \n     ``National Literacy Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Literacy Day'' with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ndesignating July 2, 1999, and July 2, 2000, as National Literacy Day.\n  Mr. President, the United States has one of the most sophisticated \neducation systems in the world. We have more students enrolling in \nschool than ever before, and more people attending college than ever \nbefore. But there is a significant part of the population that has been \nleft behind--the ever growing population of people who can't read.\n  Mr. President, approximately 44 million adult Americans are \nfunctionally illiterate. That means somewhere between 21 to 23% percent \nof the adult population read below the fifth grade level and are unable \nto perform basic functions you and I do every day. People reading at \nthat level usually cannot locate an intersection on a street map or \nfill out a social security application form. Older people who can't \nread may\n\n[[Page S2421]]\n\nnot be able to understand the instructions on a vial of prescription \ndrugs, causing a potentially life-threatening situation.\n  Mr. President, it is not surprising that the inability to perform \nbasic functions results in the inability of the illiterate population \nto fully participate in society. In fact, nearly half, or 43 percent, \nof the illiterate population lives in poverty. Other social problems \nassociated with poverty are prevalent in the illiterate community, like \nthe proclivity to commit crime, the need of welfare assistance, and the \ninability to get a job.\n  A majority of the prison population in this country is illiterate. A \nmajority of people who receive food stamps is illiterate. People who \nare illiterate work less than half the amount of time in a an average \nyear than a fully literate person, and they earn approximately a third \nof the income. That is, Mr. President, if they hold jobs at all.\n  Mr. President, the Federal government, as well as state and local \nmunicipalities, have shown a steadfast dedication to eradicating \nilliteracy through financial assistance. In 1998 alone, the major adult \neducation and literacy programs were funded at $360 million. And \nmillions more are spent on the state and local level, spent either by \nmunicipal government or donated by private sources.\n  Mr. President, my resolution designating July 2 as National Literacy \nDay is a nice complement to all the resources we spend on adult \neducation and the effort to boost literacy rates. The more we do to \nidentify illiteracy as a problem and the more we publicize what \nresources are available to citizens who want to learn how to read, the \ncloser we are to winning the war against illiteracy.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2421-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2421-S2424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       FEINSTEIN AMENDMENT NO. 52\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by her \nto the bill (S. 280) to provide for education flexibility partnerships; \nas follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                     TITLE __--STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT\n\n     SEC. __01.

SENSE OF SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Research shows that the lack of consistent access to \n     highly competent teachers adversely impacts student \n     achievement.\n       (2) Teachers are the most basic educational resource that \n     communities provide their students. All students deserve \n     access to well prepared, high quality teachers.\n       (3) The Nation's schools will need to hire 2,200,000 \n     teachers during the 10-year period following 1999. One-half \n     to two-thirds of the teachers will be first-time teachers.\n       (4) High poverty urban and rural school districts face the \n     greatest challenges in recruiting, supporting, and retraining \n     teachers. The school districts will need over 700,000 \n     teachers during the 10-year period following 1999.\n       (5) Thirty percent of newly hired teachers enter the \n     teaching profession without having fully met State licensing \n     standards.\n       (6) There are nationwide shortages of qualified \n     mathematics, science, special education, foreign language, \n     and bilingual teachers.\n       (7) While minority students make up more than 30 percent of \n     our Nation's student population, only 13 percent of our \n     Nation's teachers are minorities.\n       (8) Up to 40 percent of our Nation's students come from \n     rural schools. But less than 22 percent of Federal funding \n     goes to rural schools.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     significant additional resources should be provided to \n     increase the recruitment of high quality teachers in rural \n     areas as well as high poverty urban areas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 DORGAN (AND BINGAMAN) AMENDMENT NO. 54\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Bingaman) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by him to the bill, S. 280, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n               TITLE __--STANDARDIZED SCHOOL REPORT CARDS\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Standardized School Report \n     Card Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the report ``Quality Counts 99'', by \n     Education Week, 36 States require the publishing of annual \n     report cards on individual schools, but the content of the \n     report cards varies widely.\n       (2) The content of most of the report cards described in \n     paragraph (1) does not provide parents with the information \n     the parents need to measure how their school or State is \n     doing compared with other schools and States.\n       (3) Ninety percent of taxpayers believe that published \n     information about individual schools would motivate educators \n     to work harder to improve the schools' performance.\n       (4) More than 60 percent of parents and 70 percent of \n     taxpayers have not seen an individual report card for their \n     area school.\n       (5) Dissemination of understandable information about \n     schools can be an important tool for parents and taxpayers to \n     measure\n\n[[Page S2422]]\n\n     the quality of the schools and to hold the schools \n     accountable for improving performance.\n\n     SEC. __03.

Mr. President, with the end of the Cold War, the \nthreat of a nuclear holocaust between the United States and Russia has \nlargely receded. There remains a real risk, however, that former Soviet \nweapons of mass destruction or the technology needed to build them will \nfind their way to rogue states, terrorist groups, or even criminal \norganizations. If such weapons should ever be used, their impact will \nbe catastrophic. It will hardly matter that ``only'' one or two cities \nhave been so hideously slaughtered.\n  The war against these so-called ``loose nukes'' is as important as \nany war we have fought. It is a war fought with assistance to states of \nthe former Soviet Union, rather than with armed force. Its battles are \nthe battles against unemployment and lax security. Its fronts are an \narray of firms and institutes and so-called ``nuclear cities,'' as well \nas the international frontiers where smugglers try to move sensitive \nmaterials to states like Iran, Iraq or Libya.\n  This is a war that we dare not lose. The Carnegie Endowment for \nInternational Peace reports that in December, the chief of Russia's \nFederal Security Service in the Chelyabinsk region said that employees \nat one sensitive plant had tried to steal 40 pounds of weapons-usable \nnuclear material. A month earlier, 3,000 workers at Chelyabinsk-70, a \n``nuclear city'' similar to our nuclear weapons design laboratories, \nhad held a protest over unpaid wages. In 1996, the head of that city \ncommitted suicide in despair over his inability to pay his personnel.\n\n\n                The Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative\n\n  The Clinton Administration recently announced an Expanded Threat \nReduction Initiative that will enlarge existing Nunn-Lugar programs by \n60 percent for the next five years. The Carnegie Endowment notes \ncorrectly that ``this new funding commitment still does not match the \nthreat.'' But the Administration's request for extra funding in the \nFiscal Year 2000 budget is desperately needed and merits wholehearted \nsupport.\n  One especially important aspect of the President's package is a major \neffort to find alternative employment for Russia's biological weapons \nexperts. The microbiologists and other scientists who built the Soviet \nUnion's massive biological warfare establishment are highly expert. \nThey are quite capable of doing research and development that would \nimprove public health in Russia and around the world. But they would be \nequally capable of assisting rogue states to wreak massive destruction, \nif we and other countries did not enable them to survive in non-\nmilitary pursuits.\n  The United States is taking steps, in other programs, to better \nprepare for the awful possibility of a terrorist attack with chemical \nor biological weapons. The Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative will \nhelp give us the time we so desperately need, in which to improve our \ncapability to combat those threats.\n\n\n          The Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention Program\n\n  Two weeks ago, the General Accounting Office issued a report on \nanother of our non-proliferation assistance efforts, the Energy \nDepartment's Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention--or IPP--program, \nthat was critical of program management. Newspapers quoted a statement \nby my friend from North Carolina, Senator Helms, who chairs the Foreign \nRelations Committee and commissioned the GAO study. He said that Energy \nDepartment failure to implement reforms recommended by the GAO would \n``jeopardize continued support'' for the program and also ``cast \ndoubt'' on the wisdom of the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative.\n  Those stories made it sound as though threat reduction efforts were \nin danger. In my view, however, what we are actually witnessing are the \nnormal growing pains of a basically successful program. I believe that \nthe IPP program and other Nunn-Lugar efforts both deserve and will \nobtain the Senate's continued support.\n  The IPP program is only five years old. Its objective is to foster \nnon-military employment for weapons scientists in the former Soviet \nUnion by assisting them to develop marketable ideas that can then be \nproduced in joint commercial ventures with Western companies. The GAO \nreport notes that over 400 projects have been funded by IPP--over 200 \nprojects in its first year alone--at about 170 institutes and \norganizations.\n\n  Thousands of Russian scientists have found at least part-time \nemployment through IPP projects, and the result has been to lessen the \ntemptation to sell their goods and expertise to rogue states. The GAO \nreport discusses those results as follows:\n\n       Officials from three institutes told us that the IPP \n     program had prevented their laboratory or institute from \n     shutting down and reduced the likelihood that scientists \n     would be forced to seek other employment. A representative \n     from Sarov [the new name for Arzamas-16, Russia's equivalent \n     of Los Alamos] told us that without the IPP program, the \n     situation at the institute would be a disaster.\n       Some institute officials told us that the benefits of the \n     IPP program went beyond financial support. . . .[and \n     included] how to do business with the United States.\n\n  The GAO noted that the Energy Department's National Laboratories\n\n[[Page S2425]]\n\n``have made great strides in helping to `open up' NIS [former Soviet] \ninstitutes,'' stated that ``the program has been successful in \nemploying weapons scientists through research and development \nprograms,'' and concluded that the overall effort is ``in our national \nsecurity interests.''\n  Why, then, was the GAO critical of the IPP program? First, it found \nadministrative lapses in the Department of Energy, such as not knowing \nhow many scientists were engaged in particular projects, spending too \nmuch money in the United States and too little in the former Soviet \nUnion, and allowing Russia to charge taxes on the assistance we \nprovided. Secondly, it found many projects that had little or no chance \nof ever becoming commercially viable. Given that the IPP program is \nsupposed to find Western investors for the projects it funds, the GAO's \npoint was that the program was not achieving its long-term goals.\n  The GAO is right. But what they found was actually the tail end of \nthe success story. They found a program that, in five short years, \nsuccessfully reached into 170 former Soviet institutes and helped \nemploy thousands of scientists. The IPP program made those crucial \ncontacts and brought a message of hope that resonated throughout the \ncommunity of Russian experts in weapons of mass destruction. It told \nthem that we understood their need to survive economically and also \ntheir need to retain self-respect as skilled professionals.\n  After five years, it is time to tighten the administration of the IPP \nprogram. The good news is that the Energy Department is already working \nto do that. Indeed, of the GAO's 11 recommendations, the Energy \nDepartment accepted 10 completely and the 11th in part.\n  That 11th recommendation was to move more slowly in expanding the \n``Nuclear Cities Initiative'' that will help Russia to downsize its \nnuclear complex without throwing weapons scientists out on the street. \nThe Energy Department agrees on the need to move carefully, but \nreserves the right to take advantage of opportunities to expand the \nprogram beyond the three ``nuclear cities'' where it will begin.\n  When Chairman Helms warns that the GAO recommendations must be \nimplemented, he is sending a stern message to which the Energy \nDepartment should pay attention. But as I read the GAO report and the \nEnergy Department's response, that Department is indeed paying \nattention. I have every hope, therefore, that even conservatives like \nmy friend from North Carolina will conclude that the IPP program and \nthe Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative deserve our support.\n  On February 26, the New York Times published a very perceptive \neditorial regarding U.S.-Russian nuclear relationships. The last \nparagraph of that editorial spoke directly to the last GAO \nrecommendation:\n\n       The G.A.O. report calls for closing down the nuclear-cities \n     program until the problems in the institutes program have \n     been resolved. That would be a mistake. The nuclear-cities \n     agreement is more carefully drawn than its predecessor and \n     already provides for exemption from Russian taxation. \n     Tightened project review procedures are in place to make sure \n     that Washington is not inadvertently subsidizing new Russian \n     weapons development. These programs, along with Washington's \n     contributions to Russia's plutonium and uranium conversion \n     and security programs, should go forward as part of a \n     coordinated drive to substantially eliminate Russia s cold-\n     war nuclear infrastructure before the Clinton Administration \n     leaves office.\n\n  The New York Times is right. Wars are not cheap. We cannot win the \nwar against ``loose nukes,'' ``loose chemicals'' and ``loose \npathogens,'' unless we give our government the means to fight. Given \nthe terrible stakes in this war, we must move forward.\n  I ask that the New York Times editorial of February 26 and the Energy \nDepartment's response to the GAO report be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 26, 1999]\n\n                      Unfinished Cold-War Business\n\n       History will judge the Clinton Administration's foreign \n     policy record partly by its success in helping Russia reduce \n     the nuclear remnants of the cold war. Nothing would do more \n     to protect American security in the decades ahead than \n     insuring that Russia's immense stockpile of nuclear weapons \n     and materials is diminished and adequately controlled. The \n     modest amount of money needed to achieve these goals now \n     could save Washington many billions of dollars in the future \n     to deal with the Russian nuclear threat if it is not reduced.\n       Moscow still has 6,000 nuclear warheads poised for long-\n     distance delivery. Weapons-grade plutonium from dismantled \n     warheads is stored in poorly secured buildings, vulnerable to \n     theft. Russia also has tens of thousands of underpaid weapons \n     scientists and workers in 170 scientific institutes and 10 \n     closed cities that house the Russian nuclear weapons complex. \n     If President Clinton hopes to leave an enduring mark in \n     international affairs, he will work on these problems in the \n     remaining 23 months of his term. Specifically, he should look \n     for innovative ways to further reduce nuclear weapons and \n     speed the conversion of Russia's nuclear establishment to \n     civilian activities.\n       The last nuclear arms reduction treaty, negotiated more \n     than six years ago, has yet to be ratified by Russia's \n     Parliament. That treaty alone would cut nuclear weapons \n     totals nearly in half. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov \n     recognizes the treaty's value for Russia, both in foreign \n     policy and budget savings terms. Mr. Clinton should work \n     closely with President Boris Yeltsin and Mr. Primakov to \n     achieve ratification.\n       But hopes for deep nuclear cuts need not depend on Russia's \n     Communist-dominated Parliament. In coordination with Russia's \n     leaders, Mr. Clinton should initiate steps that go beyond the \n     treaty, including parallel nuclear reductions and taking more \n     weapons off hair-trigger alert. Such methods proved effective \n     when tried by Presidents George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev a \n     decade ago.\n       Shrinking Russia's nuclear infrastructure also requires \n     expanding the cooperative programs developed under \n     legislation originally sponsored by Senators Sam Nunn and \n     Richard Lugar. These efforts have already supported the \n     dismantling of 5,000 Russian warheads. Additional work is \n     needed now to safely convert as much of the plutonium and \n     enriched uranium from these bombs into less dangerous forms \n     and to store what remains under much more secure conditions. \n     The Administration rightly seeks large spending increases in \n     these programs in next year's budget. It is essential that \n     Congress approve these requests.\n       Washington should also press ahead with its efforts to re-\n     employ Russian weapons scientists in civilian work. Two \n     American programs managed by the Energy Department are \n     designed to achieve that goal. One, begun in 1994, is aimed \n     at Russia's scientific institutes. A newer program deals with \n     the closed nuclear cities. The scientific institutes program \n     has succeeded in re-employing thousands of Russian scientists \n     at home and keeping them out of the reach of terrorists or \n     countries eager to make nuclear, biological or chemical \n     weapons. But a report prepared for Congress this week by the \n     General Accounting Office called attention to some problems, \n     including taxation by Russia of some of the aid money and \n     allegations that some assistance went to institutes and \n     scientists still engaged in weapons work. However cash-\n     starved the Russian Government is, taxation of American aid \n     money is unacceptable. Nor should American subsidies support \n     Russian weapons development.\n       The G.A.O. report calls for slowing down the nuclear-cities \n     program until the problems in the institutes program have \n     been resolved. That would be a mistake. The nuclear-cities \n     agreement is more carefully drawn than its predecessor and \n     already provides for exemption from Russian taxation. \n     Tightened project review procedures are in place to make sure \n     that Washington is not inadvertently subsidizing new Russian \n     weapons development. These programs, along with Washington's \n     contributions to Russia's plutonium and uranium conversion \n     and security programs, should go forward as part of a \n     coordinated drive to substantially eliminate Russia's cold-\n     war nuclear infrastructure before the Clinton Administration \n     leaves office.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Department of Energy,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 1999.\n     Mr. Victor S. Rezendes,\n     Director, Energy, Resources and Science Issues, U.S. General \n         Accounting Office, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Rezendes: The Department of Energy appreciates the \n     opportunity to review the draft General Accounting Office \n     report, GAO/RCED-99-54, ``Nuclear Proliferation: Concerns \n     With DOE's Efforts to Reduce the Risks Posted by Russia's \n     Unemployed Weapons Scientists.'' The report, as written, \n     provides valuable insight into our Initiatives for \n     Proliferation Prevention Program and will assist the \n     Department to better manage this valuable program. Technical \n     comments to this report have been provided separately. Our \n     comments on the report's recommendations are attached.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Leonard Spector, Director,\n                      Office of Arms Control and Nonproliferation.\n\n       Attachment.\n\n      Comments on Draft General Accounting Office Report--Nuclear \nNonproliferation: Concerns With DOE's Efforts To Reduce the Risks Posed \n       by Russia's Unemployed Weapons Scientists, February, 1999\n\n\n                            general comments\n\n       The Department of Energy appreciates the effort that the \n     General Accounting Office put into this report. We agree with \n     the vast\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\n     majority of its recommendations, and the IPP Program will be \n     significantly strengthened as the result of this independent, \n     in-depth evaluation. There are, however, a number of issues \n     that we believe need further clarification.\n       First, the report expresses concern that certain IPP \n     projects may have supported the development of dual-use \n     technology that could inadvertently strengthen Russian \n     military capabilities. We note that the specific projects \n     identified in the report date from an earlier period of the \n     program and, at worst, might have provided only incidental \n     military benefits to Russia--and not to its weapon of mass \n     destruction or missile programs. We are firmly committed to \n     ensuring that IPP projects do not support dual-use \n     technologies and are directed exclusively to peaceful \n     objectives. This is an explicit project requirement as noted \n     in guidance. Over the past eighteen months, the new \n     management of the IPP Program has intensified project reviews \n     to reinforce implementation of this standard.\n       We have been particularly sensitive to the dual-use \n     potential of projects in the NIS chemical and biological \n     institutes. The Department recognized from the onset of the \n     program that the dividing line between commercial and weapons \n     technologies was subtle in this area of technology. As a \n     result, DOE instituted a special review process, which \n     included the U.S. interagency, the U.S. chemical and \n     biological community, and the DOE National Laboratories. \n     Although the GAO report states that some reviewers may have \n     provided only cursory analysis of particular projects, we \n     believe that every IPP project with a chemical and biological \n     institute received extensive scrutiny from numerous \n     participants in the review process and that this process \n     deliberately erred on the side of disapproval when questions \n     on potential dual-use applications were raised. Nonetheless, \n     we recognize that improvements are needed to make the review \n     process more consistent and, as noted below, we accept the \n     GAO's recommendation on this issue.\n       The GAO report also raised the concern that some Russian \n     weapon scientists are being paid by the IPP Program even \n     though they remain employed at their respective weapons-\n     related institutes. The implicit criticism of the program is \n     that this practice is subsidizing Russian weapon-of-mass \n     destruction activities. We believe this implication is \n     misplaced. The fundamental goal of the IPP Program is to keep \n     weapons specialists working in their home countries--in the \n     face of grim domestic employment prospects--rather than \n     selling their services to foreign states or organizations of \n     proliferation concern. At virtually all Russian weapons \n     institutes, salaries are going unpaid for months, even for \n     those who are nominally ``employed'' there. These scientists, \n     and those who have been dismissed, are the proper targets of \n     the IPP Program, because these are the individuals who are \n     most likely to be tempted to sell their services abroad. IPP \n     policy clearly states that the Program does not pay \n     scientists to perform weapons work, and we match the scale of \n     payments to those of deliverables required by our contracts, \n     so that we are not inadvertently subsidizing other work at \n     the host institute. Moreover, time spent on IPP activities is \n     time scientists cannot spend working on Russian military \n     programs.\n       Finally, GAO notes that only two of the IPP projects have \n     progressed to Thrust III. Commercialization of science and \n     engineering requires time, and the IPP program has only \n     recently shifted its emphasis to commercialization. In the \n     United States, commercialization efforts normally take five \n     to seven years. In just the past year, the IPP Program has \n     placed increased emphasis on projects cost-shared with U.S. \n     industry (Thrust II) and on moving such projects towards \n     commercial viability (Thrust III). This progression is \n     important, we believe, to create viable long-term employment \n     opportunities for Russian scientists who are leaving weapons \n     work. We recognize, however, that IPP cannot by itself create \n     commercial entities; it can only set measures and procedures \n     in place to maximize the likelihood of their creation by U.S. \n     industry. If Russian economic conditions stabilize, we \n     believe the coming eighteen months will see the fruits of \n     these and earlier efforts.\n       Fortunately, as the GAO notes, even if IPP \n     commercialization success remains limited, the fundamental \n     objective of the IPP Program--keeping former Soviet weapon-\n     of-mass-destruction scientists at home--is succeeding.\n\n\n                    responses to GAO Recommendations\n\n                 A. Recommendations on the IPP Program\n\n     Recommendation 1\n       Re-examine the role and the costs of the national \n     laboratories with a view towards maximizing the amount of \n     program funds going to the NIS institutes.\n     DOE management position\n       Concur.\n       The Department will continue its examination of laboratory \n     roles to utilize their expertise more efficiently. In coming \n     months, we expect to increase significantly the proportion of \n     project dollars going to the NIS and to correspondingly \n     reduce the proportion of funds spent at the national \n     laboratories. An increased emphasis on Thrust II and Thrust \n     III projects will help to promote this shift in funding. The \n     Department notes that the enabling legislation for IPP calls \n     for a ``. . . program of cooperation between scientific and \n     engineering institutes in the New Independent States of the \n     former Soviet Union and national laboratories and other \n     qualified academic institutions in the United States designed \n     to stabilize the technology base in the cooperating states as \n     each strives to convert defense industries to civilian \n     applications . . .''\n     Recommendation 2\n       Obtain information on how program money is being spent by \n     the NIS recipients of program funds.\n     Management position\n       Concur.\n       The IPP Program office will issue guidance to participating \n     laboratories to ensure more complete tracking of the \n     expenditure of funds by the NIS recipients. The program will \n     establish quarterly reporting on funds spent in the NIS.\n     Recommendation 3\n       Seek assurances from the Russian government, either through \n     a government-to-government agreement or through other means, \n     that program funds are exempt from Russian taxes.\n     Management position\n       Concur.\n       The Department of Energy agrees with this recommendation \n     and will work with the Department of State to facilitate a \n     government-to-government agreement. In the meantime, the \n     Department will continue its efforts within the U.S. \n     interagency structure to resolve this issue. This effort has \n     led to discussions by the Vice President with his Russian \n     counterparts on taxation issues and to the renewal of the \n     Panskov-Pickering agreement as the basis for seeking case-by-\n     case tax exemptions for IPP funds expended in Russia.\n     Recommendation 4\n       Require that program officials, to the extent possible, \n     obtain accurate data on the number and backgrounds of \n     scientists participating in program projects, and eliminate \n     funding for institutes that did not formerly work on weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n     Management position\n       Concur.\n       The IPP Program has issued, and will reemphasize, program \n     guidance instructing principal investigators to obtain \n     accurate data regarding the number and backgrounds of \n     scientists participating in program projects. Scientists with \n     weapons knowledge now employed at nonweapons institutes will \n     continue to be eligible to participate in the IPP Program, as \n     they represent a continuing potential proliferation concern.\n     Recommendation 5\n       Clarify program guidance as to whether scientists currently \n     employed in weapons of mass destruction programs are eligible \n     for program funding.\n     Management position\n       Concur.\n       The basic goal of the program is to retain former Soviet \n     WMD scientists in their home countries; the key question is \n     the expertise they possess and might offer to others, not \n     whether they are currently on the roster of an NIS WMD \n     institute. Through its increasing emphasis on \n     commercialization, IPP will continue to develop long-term \n     opportunities for scientists to leave WMD institutes. \n     Explicit program guidance regarding scientists currently \n     employed in weapons of mass destruction programs will be \n     issued within 90 days.\n     Recommendation 6\n       Require that project reviewers consider all military \n     applications of projects to ensure that useful defense \n     related information is not unintentionally transferred.\n     Management position\n       Concur.\n       The IPP Program has always been sensitive to the question \n     of transfer of weapons-sensitive technology to the NIS. Based \n     on the GAO's report, however, we recognize that our review \n     process was not as complete as it should be. Accordingly, the \n     program has revised its procedures to request a direct review \n     of projects by the Department of Defense instead of \n     forwarding projects through the Department of State.\n     Recommendation 7\n       Strengthen and formalize DOE's process for reviewing \n     proposed chemical and biological projects by:\n       (1) providing complete project information to all reviewing \n     U.S. Government agencies and organizations.\n     Management Position\n       Concur.\n       Based on the GAO's report, the program has revised its \n     procedures to ensure that all appropriate government agencies \n     and organizations have complete project information.\n       (2) developing criteria to help frame the evaluation \n     process.\n     Management Position\n       Concur.\n       This recommendation was completed during the course of the \n     GAO's audit.\n       (3) providing feedback to all of the reviewing agencies \n     about the final disposition of the projects.\n     Management Position\n       Concur.\n       The Department will provide feedback to all reviewers \n     regarding the status of final approval of IPP projects.\n     Recommendation 8\n       Re-evaluate the large number of Thrust 1 projects, \n     particularly those that have been\n\n[[Page S2427]]\n\n     funded for several years, and eliminate those that do not \n     have commercial potential.\n     Management Position\n       Concur.\n       The Department has implemented a reevaluation of Thrust 1 \n     projects based on GAO's review.\n     Recommendation 9\n       Develop criteria and time frames for determining when \n     Thrust 1 projects should be terminated if they do not meet \n     the criteria of graduation to the program's next phase.\n     Management Position\n       Concur.\n       Based on GAO's review, this recommendation will be \n     accomplished within 120 days.\n\n            B. Recommendations on Nuclear Cities Initiative\n\n       Because DOE plans to implement the Nuclear Cities \n     Initiative in a relatively short amount of time (5 to 7 \n     years) at a potential cost of up to $600 million during \n     uncertain economic times in Russia, we believe it is critical \n     that program implementation be based on solid thinking and \n     planning which considers the problems experienced under the \n     IPP Program. Therefore, we recommend that DOE:\n     Recommendation 10\n       Develop a strategic plan for the Initiative before large \n     scale funding begins and include in the plan-program goals, \n     costs, time frames, performance measures, and expected \n     outcomes, such as the number of jobs created for each city.\n     Management Position\n       Concur.\n       The Department is preparing a strategic plan that will be \n     published within 90 days.\n     Recommendation 11\n       Not expand the Initiative beyond the three nuclear cities \n     until DOE has demonstrated that its efforts are achieving \n     program objectives, that is, that jobs are being created in \n     the civilian sector for displaced weapons scientists, \n     engineers, and technicians.\n     Management Position\n       Concur, with qualification.\n       Some existing IPP projects in other closed cities may \n     naturally transition to work under the Nuclear Cities \n     Initiative. Similarly, the Department does not want to \n     preclude the possibility of accomplishing significant \n     reductions in nuclear weapons related activities in another \n     closed nuclear city should the opportunity arise to assist in \n     the shutdown of facilities there. It is also the intent of \n     the Department to structure the second year of the Nuclear \n     Cities Initiative based upon lessons learned the first year. \n     The Department has a process for reviewing program objectives \n     to determine lessons learned and next steps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2427-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2427-S2428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             POST OFFICE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill \nthat my colleague Senator Baucus and I are re-introducing titled the, \n``Post Office Community Partnership Act of 1999.''\n  Aside from a few technical changes, the bill is similar to the one we \nintroduced in the 105th Congress that was supported by so many of our \ncolleagues in a 76-21 vote last July. Unfortunately our postal language \nwas dropped from the underlying bill during conference with the House. \nHowever, I am hopeful that this year our bill will become law. I should \nadd that this year we have coordinated our efforts with Representative \nBlumenauer of Oregon and an identical companion bill is being put \nforward in both the Senate and the House.\n  Mr. President, I live in a small town in Vermont. I understand the \nimportance downtowns and village centers play in the identity and \nlongevity of communities. Downtowns are the social and economic hearts \nof small communities. They are where neighbors catch up on the news, \nshop, worship, and celebrate national holidays.\n  Our bill will enable the residents of small villages and large towns \nto have a say when the Postal Service decides that their local post \noffice will be closed, relocated, or consolidated. Local post offices \nare important tenants in any vibrant downtown. A recent article in USA \nToday cited a 1993 study that found that 80 percent of people who \nshopped downtown planned their visit around a visit to the post office.\n  There is much talk in the news today about revitalizing our downtowns \nand encouraging smart growth. I say to my colleagues, if you want to \nencourage smart growth, let's start by doing what we can to keep \nfederal facilities such as post offices in downtowns.\n  Some of my colleagues may ask why this legislation is necessary. A \nstory from my home state of Vermont will answer that question.\n  A few years ago the general store on the green in Perkinsville, \nVermont went bankrupt and the adjacent post office wanted to leave the \nsmall village center for a new building outside of town. By the time \nthe community was aware of the relocation, plans were so far along--the \nnew building had actually been constructed based on the promise of the \npost office as the anchor tenant--that there was no time to fully \ninvestigate in-town alternatives. One elderly resident wrote that in \ncontrast to families now being able to walk to the post office, ``we \ncertainly won't be walking along the busy Route 106 two miles or more \nto get our mail.'' The State Historic Preservation Officer commented \nthat as people meet neighbors at the post office, the threads of \ncommunity are woven and reinforced. ``It may be intangible, but its \nreal, and such interaction is critically important to the preservation \nof the spirit and physical fabric of small village centers like \nPerkinsville.''\n  In other Vermont towns such as Springfield, Arlington, and St. \nAlbans, the threat of our legislation has encouraged the Postal Service \nto work more closely with these communities as plans are developed to \nexpand their local post offices. Our bill would codify the process that \ncommunities should go through and would avoid a one-size fits all \napproach to community needs.\n  Mr. President, post office closings and relocations are occurring all \nacross the country and especially in small and rural communities. My \ncolleagues will quickly discover similar examples in their own states \nwhere the removal of the post office has harmed the economic vitality \nof the downtown area, deprived citizens without cars of access, and \ncontributed to sprawl.\n  The basic premise for this legislation is to give the individuals in \na community a voice in the process of a proposed relocation, closing, \nconsolidation, or construction of a post office. This bill does not \ngive the citizenry the ultimate veto power over a relocation, closing, \nconsolidation, or construction. Instead, the bill sets up a process \nthat makes sure community voices and concerns are heard and taken into \naccount by the Postal Service.\n  Additionally, this bill will require the Postal Service to abide by \nlocal zoning laws and the historic preservation rules regarding federal \nbuildings. Because it is a federal entity, the Postal Service has the \nability to override local zoning requirements. In some cases this has \nled to disruption of traffic patterns, a rejection of local safety \nstandards, and concerns about environmental damage from problems such \nas storm water management.\n  Mr. President, post offices in Vermont and across the nation are \ncenters of social and business interaction. In communities where post \noffices are located on village greens or in downtowns, they become \nintegral to these communities' identities. I believe that this \nlegislation will strengthen the federal-local ties of the Postal \nService, help preserve our downtowns, and combat the problem of sprawl. \nI urge my colleagues to join Senator Baucus and I in support of this \nimportant legislation. I ask to have the text of the bill printed in \nthe Record.\n  The text of the bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 556\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join others \naround the world in marking International Women's Day. This day \ncelebrates the contributions and accomplishments of women worldwide, \nand also reminds us that, unfortunately, many women are still treated \nas second-class citizens. Gender-based discrimination and harassment, \ndomestic violence, and sexual assault are far too common in too many \nplaces. The glass ceiling, while perhaps a bit cracked, still blocks \nthe progress of many women who work outside the home. Lack of \naffordable quality child care forces many women to make a painful \ndecision between their children and their careers.\n  The wage gap between men and women around the world is still vast. \nAccording to 1997 statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \nAmerican women working outside the home in non-agricultural jobs earn \nabout seventy-five percent of what their male counterparts earn; that \nis, seventy-five cents on the dollar. International Labour Organization \nstatistics from 1996 state that women in Japan make sixty-two percent \nof what their male counterparts earn; the figure in Kenya is eighty-\nfive percent. Australian women fare better, earning virtually the same \nwages as men.\n  In many places, women and girls are not considered valued members of \nsociety. Rather, their basic human rights are curtailed, sometimes to \nthe point of denial of adequate medical care and basic educational \nopportunities. The illegal trafficking of women and girls for purposes \nsuch as slavery and prostitution is rampant in some areas of the world. \nIn some places, it is common for women to be burned with acid by their \nhusbands if their dowries are not large enough.\n  The deplorable practice of so-called ``honor killing''--men murdering \nfemale relatives accused of things ranging from infidelity to objection \nto an arranged marriage--is again receiving international attention. \nWhat is even more deplorable is that the men committing these murders \ntake pride in their crimes, which they justify as cultural tradition, \nand are routinely given light prison sentences. Some women endure \nvoluntary imprisonment to escape male relatives who intend to murder \nthem.\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\n  Despite the challenges they face--or maybe in spite of them--women in \nthe United States and around the world contribute to their families and \ntheir countries in countless ways.\n  In the United States, March is Women's History Month. It is a time to \ncelebrate the contributions of women such as Carrie Chapman Catt, a \nnative of Ripon, Wisconsin, who served as the last president of the \nNational American Women Suffrage Association, and was the founder and \nfirst president of the National League of Women Voters. Her influence \non the direction and success of the suffrage movement is legendary, and \nher legacy in grassroots organizing is equally significant. She led a \ntireless lobbying campaign in Congress, sent letters and telegrams, and \neventually met directly with the President--using all the tools of \ndirect action with which political organizers are now so familiar \ntoday.\n  Catt's crusade for suffrage saw a homefront victory on June 10, 1919, \nwhen Wisconsin became the first state to deliver ratification of the \nconstitutional amendment granting women the right to vote before it was \nadopted as the Nineteenth Amendment in August of 1920.\n  The legacy of Carrie Chapman Catt is alive and well today--in \nWisconsin and across the globe--as women take a more and more active \nrole in the political process. I am proud to serve alongside \nCongresswoman Tammy Baldwin, the first woman elected to Congress from \nWisconsin. The 106th Congress includes a record 67 women--nine in the \nSenate and 58 in the House of Representatives.\n  As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the \nSenate Committee on Foreign Relations, I have monitored how the women \nof Africa participate in the political process and make vital \ncontributions to the economies of their countries. During the recent \nassembly and presidential elections in Nigeria, women served as poll \nworkers and were candidates for the assembly. I regret that voter \nturnout among women was noticeably low, but was pleased to see some \nprogress being made.\n  One way in which the Senate can honor women worldwide is to fulfill \nour long-overdue constitutional obligation to offer our advice and \nconsent to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) at the earliest possible \ndate. This year marks the 20th anniversary of CEDAW, which was adopted \nby the United Nations General Assembly on December 18, 1979. CEDAW was \nsigned by the United States on July 17, 1980, and was transmitted to \nthe Senate for its advice and consent by President Carter on November \n12, 1980. Almost two decades later, the treaty is still pending before \nthe Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. As of December 1998, 163 \ncountries have ratified CEDAW. Only three signatories have yet to \nratify the convention: Afghanistan, San Tome and Principe, and the \nUnited States. It is high time for us to ratify this important \ndocument.\n  In closing, Mr. President, as the father of two daughters, I am \nhopeful that the world we leave to our children and grandchilren will \nbe deviod of domestic violence and other forms of gender-based \ndiscrimination, harrassment, and violence. As we prepare to enter the \n21st century, we must redouble our efforts to protect and promote the \nrights of women and girls at home and abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2429-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2429-S2430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HUMAN RIGHTS IN CUBA AND COMMEMORATING THE BROTHERS TO THE RESCUE\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support \nfor Senate Resolution 57 condemning the Cuban government's human rights \nrecord and calling on the President to make all efforts necessary to \npass a resolution condemning Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission \nmeeting in Geneva, Switzerland.\n  Many people have written and spoken about the latest crackdown in \nCuba as if they were discovering for the first time the nature of Fidel \nCastro's brutal regime. Fidel Castro is a tyrant. He rules with \nabsolute authority and uses fear and greed to maintain his power. For \nforty years he has demonstrated to us his nature. He has not changed. \nWe must continue our pressure on him--voice our opposition to him. And \nwe must continue our support for the struggling Cuban people. The \nchoice should not be difficult to make: we must stand with those \nsuffering under one of the few totalitarian Marxists remaining in power \nin the world, and we must stand up to condemn the actions of the brutal \nregime.\n  One clear reminder of who we are dealing with is the murder in the \nFlorida straits of four Americans in 1996. They were flying a \nhumanitarian mission when the Cuban Air Force shot their unarmed \naircraft out of the sky. For three years, Mr. President, we have all \nknown about this murder, and for three years, I have been struggling to \nunderstand why this administration refuses to take appropriate action.\n  The Boston Globe published a very powerful essay by columnist Jeff \nJacoby to mark this anniversary. I'd like to read from it. Jeff \ncaptures the starkness of the mismatched foreign policy in place, \ncomparing the act, which Fidel Castro committed with this \nadministration's unprincipled response. His piece is titled ``Murder \nOver the High Seas.''\n\n       They were trying to save lives. Three years ago this week, \n     they paid with their own.\n       When Armando Alejandre, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and \n     Pablo Morales took to the skies that day in their little \n     blue-and-white Cessna 337s, their plan was to search the \n     Florida Straits for stranded boat people, refugees fleeing \n     Cuba in makeshift rafts or flimsy inner tubes. There was \n     little enough the fliers could do for any rafters they came \n     upon--toss down food and bottled water, radio their location \n     to the Coast Guard--but that little could make the difference \n     between life and death.\n       Of the four, Carlos was the most experienced. He had flown \n     more than 500 such missions for Brothers to the Rescue, and \n     had saved scores of boat people from drowning or dying of \n     thirst. Armando, by contrast, was going up for only the \n     second time. What all four had in common was a love of \n     American liberty--and a profound concern for any Cubans so \n     desperate to escape Fidel Castro's Caribbean hellspot that \n     they would risk their lives to get away.\n       On Feb. 24, 1996, Carlos, Armando, Mario, and Pablo took \n     off from an airfield in Opa-Locka, Fla. They intended to fly \n     just below the 24th parallel, well north of Cuba's \n     territorial waters. Both planes contacted Havana air-traffic \n     controllers as they approached the 24th parallel, identifying \n     themselves and giving their position. Whereupon the Cuban Air \n     Force, without warning and without reason, scrambled two MiG \n     fighters and blew the rescue planes out of the sky.\n       The Cessnas and their passengers were disintegrated by the \n     Cuban MiGs. Only a large oil slick marked the spot where they \n     went down. No bodies were ever recovered.\n       Three of the men--Carlos, Mario, and Armando--were US \n     citizens. Pablo, a former refugee who had himself been saved \n     by Brothers to the Rescue in 1992, was a permanent US \n     resident. What happens when four American civilians are \n     butchered in cold blood, over international waters, by the \n     air force of a Third World dictatorship? What terrible \n     retribution does the United States exact for a quadruple \n     murder so barbaric and unprovoked?\n       The astonishing answer is: Nothing happens. There is no \n     retribution. Indeed, the Clinton administration takes the \n     position not only that Castro must not be punished for the \n     four lives he destroyed, but that the victims' families must \n     not be permitted to recover anything for their loss.\n       In the wake of the shootdown, under intense political \n     pressure, President Clinton agreed to sign the Helms-Burton \n     Act. Title III of the statute allows American citizens whose \n     property was confiscated by the Cuban government--Castro \n     nationalized billions of dollars' worth of American assets in \n     the 1960s--to file suit against any foreign company using \n     that property. Title IV bars any officer of a foreign \n     company trafficking in stolen American property from \n     receiving a visa to enter the United States.\n       Properly enforced, Helms-Burton would weaken Castro's grip \n     on power by reducing the flow of foreign capital into his \n     treasury. But Helms-Burton is not properly enforced. Title \n     III has never taken effect because Clinton keeps suspending \n     it (as the law permits him to do if he finds that a \n     suspension ``will expedite a transition to democracy in \n     Cuba''). Title IV has never taken effect because the State \n     Department refuses to carry it out.\n       The hobbling of Helms-Burton is a stinging insult to the \n     memory of the four murdered men. But the Clinton \n     administration has delivered a cut unkinder still.\n       In 1996, the families of Armando, Carlos, and Mario sued \n     the Cuban government for damages caused by the wrongful \n     deaths of their loved ones, a legal remedy specifically \n     authorized by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty \n     Act. In December 1997, Senior US District Judge James \n     Lawrence King awarded the plaintiffs $187.7 million in \n     damages. ``Cuba's extrajudicial killings . . . were inhumane \n     acts against innocent civilians,'' he wrote in his final \n     judgment. ``The fact that the killings were premeditated and \n     intentional, outside Cuban territory, wholly\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\n     disproportionate, and executed without warning . . . makes \n     this act unique in its brazen flouting of international \n     norms.''\n       But when the families attempted to collect their judgment \n     out of frozen Cuban assets, the Clinton administration \n     blocked them. The president famous for feeling people's pain \n     is less concerned with the pain of grief-stricken Americans, \n     it would appear, than with the pain Castro might feel if the \n     judgment were paid.\n       The administration's position is staggering. Castro is an \n     open and declared enemy of the United States and has been for \n     40 years. In sending combat aircraft to slaughter four \n     unarmed Americans engaged in humanitarian rescue work, he \n     committed an act of war. The response of the United States \n     should have been to remove Castro from power and put him in \n     the dock for crimes against humanity. (for the murder of just \n     ``one'' American in 1989, the United States invaded Panama \n     and seized Manuel Noriega.)\n       Clinton's appeasement of Castro is a cruel betrayal. The \n     families of the dead Brothers of the Rescue deserve better \n     from their government. And the tormented people of Cuba, \n     bleeding under Castro's whip, deserve better from their free \n     and powerful neighbor to the north.\n\n  Mr. President, it is clear to me that the United States has failed to \nstand up for the protection of the individual when damaged by \ninternational terrorism. I spoke last week about this administration's \nfailure to adequately address terrorism in the Middle East. The pattern \nremains consistent--appease the enemies of freedom, the advocates of \nterror, in the hopes that they will not strike again. This approach \nsimply fails. I don't know how to say it any more directly that that. \nThis approach fails.\n  The Congress passed a law last year supporting the awarding of \ndamages from the frozen assets of terrorist states being held by the \nTreasury Department to American victims. This law can help the families \nof the Brothers to the Rescue pilots. The President, however, waived \nthis relief asserting our national security interests would be better \nserved by protecting Castro's money. How can this be? Nobody has \nprovided to me an adequate explanation of what interest would cause us \nprotect terrorism and shun American victims.\n  Mr. President, this resolution calls on the United States to stand up \nfor freedom, justice, and human dignity. It states that the President \nof the United States should lead on this issue by having the United \nStates introduce and make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution in \nGeneva condemning the human rights record of the Cuban government. Mr. \nPresident, if there is one time and one place where we are obliged to \ncondemn human rights practices, it is at the UN Commission meeting in \nGeneva each year. That is what this resolution calls for, and I calls \nfor its immediate passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2430-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOE DIMAGGIO\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. ``Joe, Joe DiMaggio, we want you on our side!'' \nWell, he is on the other side now, but stays with us in our memories.\n  Mine are, well, special to me. It would be in 1938 or 1939 in \nManhattan. The Depression lingered. Life was, well, life. But there was \neven so somebody who made a great difference and that was Lou Gehrig of \nthe New York Yankees. I admired him as no other man. Read of him each \nday, or so it seemed, in the Daily News. And yet I had never seen him \nplay. One summer day my mother somehow found the needful sixty cents. \nFifty cents for a ticket at the Stadium, a nickel for the subway up and \nback. Off I went in high expectation. But Gehrig, disease I must assume \nwas now in progress, got no hit. A young rookie I had scarce noticed \nhit a home run. Joe DiMaggio. It began to drizzle, but they kept the \ngame going just long enough so there would be no raincheck. I went home \nlifeless and lay on my bed desolate.\n  Clearly I was in pain, if that is the word. The next day my mother \nsomehow came up with yet another sixty cents. Up I went. And the exact \nsame sequence occurred.\n  I went home. But not lifeless. To the contrary, animated.\n  For I hated Joe DiMaggio. For life.\n  I knew this to be a sin, but it did not matter. Gehrig retired, then \ndied. My animus only grew more animated.\n  Thirty years and some went by. I was now the United States Permanent \nRepresentative to the United Nations. One evening I was having dinner \nat an Italian restaurant in midtown. As our company was about finished, \nwho walked in but DiMaggio himself, accompanied by a friend. They took \na table against the wall opposite. I watched. He looked over, smiled \nand gave a sort of wave. Emboldened, as we were leaving, I went over to \nshake hands. He rose wonderfully to the occasion.\n  I went out on 54th Street as I recall. And of a sudden was struck as \nif by some Old Testament lightening. ``My God,'' I thought, ``he has \nforgiven me!'' He must have known about me all those years, but he \nreturned hate with love. My soul had been in danger and he had rescued \nme.\n  Still years later, just a little while ago the Yankees won another \npennant. Mayor Guiliani arranged a parade from the Battery to City \nHall. Joe was in the lead car; I was to follow. As we waited to get \nstarted, I went up to him, introduced myself and told of having watched \nhim at the Stadium these many years ago. ``But I have to tell you,'' I \nadded, ``Lou Gehrig was my hero.''\n  ``He was my hero, too,'' said Joe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2430-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING BERNICE SHIVLEY, FIRST BOOK COORDINATOR, PEND OREILLE \n                           COUNTY, WASHINGTON\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Bernice \nShivley in my home state of Washington for her efforts to promote \nliteracy in her community. As I have traveled around Washington state, \nI hear again and again about the great strides ``First Book'' has made \nin improving children's literacy and in particular, I hear remarkable \npraise for Bernice Shivley, the First Book Coordinator in Pend Oreille \nCounty.\n  First Book is a national non-profit organization with a single \nmission: To give disadvantaged children the opportunity to read and own \ntheir first new book. At the national level, First Book has developed a \nsustained network of strategic partnerships with groups and companies \nlike the American Library Association and Barnes & Noble, Inc. The key \nto First Book's success, however, is the inspiration and commitment of \nlocal communities.\n  In each locality, First Book establishes an advisory board comprised \nof volunteer leaders including librarians, teachers, retailers, and \npublic officials. These boards work with existing local literacy \nprograms to increase the availability of tutors, book grants, and to \npromote special events--all in the name of improved literacy. Most \nimportantly, perhaps, First Book reaches out to the children who are \nmost difficult to reach: the children in soap kitchens and in homeless \nshelters, in church basements and in youth centers.\n  In Pend Oreille County, which is in the northeast corner of \nWashington state, Bernice Shivley has made the success of First Book \nher passion. The regional coordinator for First Book tells me that \n``Bernice is a model for what First Book is all about.'' She has \ngraciously volunteered her time and has spent countless hours creating \nan advisory board, securing donations from area business, and \nidentifying local literacy programs to support. For these reasons, I am \nawarding Bernice the second of my weekly ``Innovation in Education \nAwards.''\n  It is the actions of people like Bernice around the country that \nshould remind us here in Washington, DC that those closest to our \nchildren are best equipped to make important decisions regarding their \neducation. I commend Bernice for her outstanding work on behalf of the \nchildren and citizens of Pend Oreille County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2430-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2430-S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize March \n8th as the annual celebration of International Women's Day in the State \nof New Jersey.\n  International Women's Day began in 1911, when over one million people \nfrom around the world gathered to honor women in the workplace and \nenhance women's rights universally. The many citizens from Austria, \nDenmark, Germany, Sweden and the United States attended rallies in \ntheir home countries and called for women to have the right to vote, \nthe right to hold public office, for vocational training and to end \ndiscrimination against women in the workplace.\n\n[[Page S2431]]\n\n  Mr. President, women's rights have come a long way since then. But we \nstill have farther to go.\n  Mr. President, the purpose now of International Women's Day is to \npromote many causes important to women and girls, such as education, \nleadership development and ongoing human rights struggles. Supporters \nof this day would like to see economic justice for women, freedom from \nglass ceilings, violent workplace environments and sexual harassment, \nand the elimination of child labor in sweatshops.\n  In addition, Mr. President, a concurrent celebration of International \nWomen's Day has blossomed in New Jersey. New Jersey, in fact, is the \nonly state where International Women's Day is celebrated state-wide in \nclassrooms and community centers everywhere.\n  In 1992, New Jersey's celebration was founded in Metuchen with the \nhelp of organizations like Women Helping Women, Citizens for Quality \nEducation and the Metuchen Public Schools. Since then, the New Jersey \nstate legislature, the White House and the United Nations have all \nrecognized this celebration as important in the evolution of women's \nrights. The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) of the U.S.A., \none of the oldest and largest women's organizations in the world, has \nalso become a vital sponsor of International Women's Day.\n  Mr. President, this year's celebration is entitled, ``Women Working \nfor Health: Body, Mind, Spirit,'' focusing on women in the workplace. \nIn classrooms across New Jersey, women from all walks of life, \nincluding veterinarians, pilots, judges, community leaders, and medical \nresearchers, have been invited to discuss their personal and \nprofessional experiences with students at levels ranging from \nkindergarten to adult education programs. These priceless exchanges \nwill provide young girls and women with mentors, role models and \nfriends.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to join in the celebration of International \nWomen's Day in New Jersey, and all that it does to foster the promotion \nof equal rights for women. I hope my colleagues will do the \nsame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2431-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CLIMATE CHANGE BILL AWARDING CREDIT FOR EARLY ACTION\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, climate change poses potential \nreal threats to Vermont, the Nation, and the World. While we cannot yet \npredict the exact timing, magnitude, or nature of these threats, we \nmust not let our uncertainty lead to inaction.\n  Preventing climate change is a daunting challenge. It will not be \nsolved by a single bill or a single action. As we do not know the \nextent of the threat, we also do not know the extent of the solution. \nBut we cannot let our lack of knowledge lead to lack of action. We must \nstart today. Our first steps will be hesitant and imperfect, but they \nwill be a beginning.\n  Today I am joining Senator Chafee, Senator Mack, Senator Lieberman, \nand a host of others in cosponsoring the Credit for Early Action Act in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Credit for Early Action gives incentives to American businesses to \nvoluntarily reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. Properly \nconstructed, Credit for Early Action will increase energy efficiency, \npromote renewable energy, provide cleaner air, and help reduce the \nthreat of possible global climatic disruptions. It will help industry \nplan for the future and save money on energy. It rewards companies for \ndoing the right thing--conserving energy and promoting renewable \nenergy. Without Credit for Early Action, industries which do the right \nthing run the risk of being penalized for having done so. We introduce \nthis bill as a signal to industry, you will not be penalized for \nincreasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable energy, you \nwill be rewarded.\n  In writing this bill, Senators Chafee, Mack, and Lieberman have done \nan excellent job with a difficult subject. I am cosponsoring the Credit \nfor Early Action legislation as an endorsement for taking a first step \nin the right direction. I will be working with my colleagues throughout \nthis Congress to strengthen this legislation to ensure that it strongly \naddresses the challenges that lie ahead. The bill must be changed to \nguarantee that our emissions will decrease to acceptable levels, and \nguarantee that credits will be given out equitably. These modifications \ncan be summarized in a single sentence: credits awarded must be \nproportional to benefits gained. This goal can be achieved through two \nadditions: a rate-based performance standard and a cap on total \nemissions credits.\n  The rate-based performance standard is the most important item. A \nrate-based standard gives credits to those companies which are the most \nefficient in their class--not those that are the biggest and dirtiest \nto begin with. Companies are rewarded for producing the most product \nfor the least amount of emissions. Small and growing companies would \nhave the same opportunities to earn credits as large companies. This \nsystem would create a just and equitable means of awarding emissions \ncredits to companies which voluntarily increase their energy efficiency \nand renewable energy use.\n  The second item is an adjustable annual cap on total emissions \ncredits. An adjustable annual cap allows Congress to weigh the number \nof credits given out against the actual reduction in total emissions. \nSince the ultimate goal is to reduce U.S. emissions, this provision \nwould allow a means to ensure that we do not give all of our credits \naway without ensuring that our emissions levels are actually \ndecreasing.\n  With these two additions, Credit for Early Action will bring great \nrewards to our country, our economy, and our environment. It will save \nmoney, give industry the certainty to plan for the future, and promote \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy, all while reducing our risk \nfrom climate change. This legislation sends the right message: \ncompanies will be rewarded for doing the right thing--increasing energy \nefficiency and renewable energy use.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2431-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2431-S2432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RICHARD G. ANDREWS\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a man who \nhas been a pillar of loyalty, integrity and continuity in Delaware's \nU.S. Attorney's office for the past 15 years.\n  We all know men and women who are the pillars of federal government \noffices--people who keep the wheels of government turning as changes \noccur around them. Richard G. Andrews is that pillar who keeps \nDelaware's U.S. Attorney's Office standing tall and strong. I respect \nhis legal talents, professionalism, work ethic and people skills. And I \nrecognize this dedicated public servant today, not because he's \nretiring--fortunately he's still working as hard as ever--but simply \nbecause he deserves the recognition.\n  As an Assistant U.S. Attorney since 1983, and Chief of the Criminal \nDivision for the past five years, Rich has earned a reputation as a \ntough, fair prosecutor in the nearly 40 felony jury cases he has tried. \nHe was involved with the most far-reaching FBI undercover sting \noperation in Delaware history that sent several top State and County \nofficials to prison for bribery convictions. He also sent the Vice \nPresident of the Pagan Motorcycle Club to jail for 25 years for running \na drug distribution ring. And he prosecuted the men convicted of \nbilking the federal government and taxpayers out of nearly half-a-\nmillion dollars in a student loan scam.\n  Rich Andrews started his legal career learning from the best--he was \nlaw clerk to the late U.S. Court of Appeals Judge for the Third \nCircuit, Chief Judge Collins J. Seitz.\n  It's no wonder that distinguished experience marked the beginning of \nmany more honors to come. In 1996, FBI Director Louis Freeh issued a \ncommendation to him for the convictions of three top officials of \nMadison & Co. in $1 million securities fraud case. In 1993, he was \ncommended for prosecuting ocean dumpers off the Delaware coast.\n  Rich continues to pass on his craft to young attorneys, teaching \nCriminal Trial Advocacy courses. And he goes the extra mile for \nvictims, serving as Chairman of Delaware's Criminal Justice Council's \nVictims' Subcommittee.\n  Delaware and our country's U.S. Department of Justice are better for \nthe continued service of Rich Andrews. He is an honest, down-to-earth, \ntough prosecutor and dedicated public servant. It is my pleasure to \nrecognize this second-in-command as he continues to serve as the Chief \nCriminal prosecutor\n\n[[Page S2432]]\n\nfor Delaware's U.S. Attorney's Office. It's a simple thank you for a \njob well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2432-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2432-S2434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ANTITRUST MERGER REVIEW ACT\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \n``Antitrust Merger Review Act'' (S. 467), a bill that I introduced with \nSenator Kohl, the ranking minority member of the Antitrust, Business \nRights and Competition Subcommittee.\n  S. 467 is, plain and simple, a bill that imposes time limits on the \nFCC review of telecom mergers. This bill will not limit the scope of \nthe FCC review, or attempt to dictate to the FCC how to evaluate these \nmergers; instead, it will simply impose a deadline for FCC action.\n  As I have stated before, telecommunications mergers have a major \nimpact on competition, and they require careful scrutiny from the FCC. \nHowever, careful scrutiny does not mean endless scrutiny. These mergers \nmust be evaluated in a timely fashion, so that the merging parties and \ntheir competitors can move forward. The longer these deals remain under \nreview the longer the market remains in limbo, and the longer it will \nbe before we see vigorous competition.\n  Accordingly, Senator Kohl and I have introduced S. 467, and plan to \nwork with our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and with Senator \nMcCain and Senator Hollings and the rest of the Commerce Committee, to \nmove this bill forward and help increase the pace of competition in the \ntelecommunications industry.\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \n``Antitrust Merger Review Act'' (S. 467), a bill that I introduced with \nSenator DeWine, my colleague on the Antitrust Subcommittee. This \nmeasure sets a deadline on the Federal Communications Commission when \nit reviews mergers. In other words, our bill says to the FCC: approve a \nmerger, reject it, or apply conditions. But don't sit on it.\n  All too often, telecommunication companies, their customers, and \ntheir employees are left to mercy of a time-consuming merger review \nprocess--a process in which the two lead agencies, the Department of \nJustice and the FCC, act in sequence rather than in tandem. Like the \nDOJ and the Federal Trade Commission, who have deadlines under the \nHart-Scott-Rodino laws, there is no compelling reason to let the FCC \n``hang back'' and wait until the end.\n  Our bill is simple, effective and straightforward, and sets \nreasonable time limits for the FCC to follow. When a license transfer \napplication is filed, the FCC will have 30 days to decide whether or \nnot a ``second request'' for further information is needed from the \nmerging companies. If this second request phase is needed, the FCC will \nthen have six months after receiving the additional material--so-called \n``substantial compliance''--to make a determination. For those familiar \nwith antitrust laws, these time limits are nothing new or shocking. If \nanything, they make common sense by creating a framework for a timely \ndecision. And this measure is entirely consistent with the thrust of \nthe 1996 Telecom Act, which strengthened the hand of the antitrust laws \nin addressing telecom mergers. See, e.g., Public Law 104-104 \nSec. 601(b).\n  But Mr. President, let me also tell you what this bill is not. First, \nwhile our measure sets time limits on the FCC's merger review process, \nit does not change the FCC's substantive role in approving or rejecting \nthese deals. Others have suggested doing this, but many of us believe \nthat the FCC through application of its ``public interest test'' can \nobtain market-opening concessions from merging companies that the DOJ, \nunder antitrust laws, simply cannot. Second, though some in Congress \nmay want to revisit other aspects of the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust \nlaws, this bill is not a vehicle for substantive changes--they are best \nleft for other measures at another time.\n  This is not a perfect piece of legislation to be sure, but it is a \nstep in the right direction. Still, it is a work in progress, so we \nplan to work together with our colleagues, Senator Hollings and Senator \nMcCain, and to get input from all the affected parties. After that, we \nwill ask for our colleagues' support for this bipartisan proposal, \nwhich will help companies get on with their businesses, and employees \nand consumers get on with their lives.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The text of the bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 467\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

We desire to move the process along. It is hard for \nme to understand how anyone could disagree with giving the local \nschools that option. The President had this bill put in and it had no \nhearings. It was put in in the final moments of the last session. I am \nsure that if we had an opportunity, we might have been able to get this \namendment on. This will move the process along.\n  I point again to the chart behind me, which indicates that what we \nare trying to do is to relieve the incredible pressure that is placed \non our local governments by having to fund special education themselves \nin the States--primarily all of it. We promised to fund 40 percent of \nit back in 1975 and 1976. We are now at around 11 percent. If we were \nto fully fund it, it would do more to allow the local communities and \nthe States to be able to meet the educational needs of their people \nthan any other act of this Congress. That is what we are pushing for. I \nthink it is a reasonable thing to do. It would have no impact, of \ncourse, on the Elementary and Secondary Education reauthorization, \nexcept to give a tremendous opportunity for local governments to be \nfreed up to work, and we could design programs to go along with those \noptions.\n  With that, I hope tomorrow we will be able to move matters along with \nthis amendment, which I think everybody ought to find desirable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/08/senate-section/article/S2435-5", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2435-S2437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NIGERIAN ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, just over a week ago we witnessed a \nseminal event in Nigeria, the West African country that could hold the \nkey to stability and prosperity in the region. Millions of Nigerians \nparticipated in an election to select the first civilian president in \nalmost two decades. Since gaining its independence in 1960, Nigeria has \nsurvived a number of military coups and has been under the military \nrule of one regime or another for most of that time. Last weekend's \nelection was only the second democratic presidential election in \nNigeria the last 39 years. According to the official results, former \nGen. Olusegun Obasanjo won a majority of votes throughout the country, \nand will be inaugurated as a civilian president on May 29.\n  Yet, Mr. President, what could have, and should have, been a proud \nmoment in Nigeria's history was marred by significant irregularities, \nfraud and low voter turnout.\n  Coincidentally, election weekend was also marked by two important \nannouncements by President Clinton: his determinations pursuant to the \ndrug certification law and the publication of the annual State \nDepartment Human Rights Report. Under the drug law, Nigeria was \nidentified among those countries that failed to meet the test for \ncooperation on anti-narcotics efforts but were granted waivers \nexempting them from the economic penalties imposed by the law. The \nadministration explained this decision with respect to Nigeria by \nexpressing hope that it would be able to work more effectively after \nthe ``nation's transition to democracy.'' At the same time, the human \nrights report noted significant progress in Nigeria's human rights \nrecord, although it still acknowledged that significant problems \nremain.\n  Now, as Nigeria plots its course through the next stage of its \nmultiphase transition to civilian rule, Nigerians, and we in the \ninternational community, must figure out how to react to these \nconcurrent, though sometimes contradictory, developments.\n  Let me elaborate. The February 27 presidential elections marked the \nlast of a series of four types of elections--local council, \ngubernatorial, legislative and presidential, respectively--that have \ntaken place over the past three months according to the transition \nprogram established by General Abdusalami Abubakar. Despite some \ndisturbing irregularities, these elections, and the campaign period \npreceding them, were conducted in a calm and orderly fashion, and--with \nthe exception of a few localized incidents--without violence or \nphysical intimidation. This process has been marked throughout by a \nclear demonstration of Gen. Abubakar's commitment to the transition \nprogram, including the handover of power to elected civilian \nauthorities on May 29, and the genuine efforts of the Independent \nNational Electoral Commission charged with the responsibility for \nconducting the elections themselves.\n\n  Although the turnout was much lower than expected, particularly for \nthe presidential election, millions of Nigerians opted to participate \nin the process, either through voting or civic work. According to \nreports from domestic and international observers, the conduct of the \npresidential election in many places was smooth, orderly and \nimplemented according to the established procedures. Particularly \nnoteworthy was that the head-of-state himself, General Abubakar, was \ndenied the\n\n[[Page S2436]]\n\nopportunity to vote because he arrived at his polling site too late to \nfollow the required accreditation process. This adherence to proper \nprocedures is indeed encouraging.\n  Doubly encouraging is the clear and strong wish of the overwhelming \nmajority of Nigerians for a swift and orderly transition to democratic \ncivilian rule.\n  Mr. President, I commend and congratulate the Nigerian people who \ncontributed to these positive developments in the electoral process.\n  But Mr. President, these commendations and congratulations are \ndampened by reports of massive irregularities in this election, which \ncan be more properly called deliberate fraud. I find these reports \ndeeply discouraging.\n  At polling stations in several areas, particularly in what is known \nas the South-South zone, the turnout observed by domestic and \ninternational monitors was significantly lower than the vote totals \nreported at a statewide level. This suggests that there were a \nconsiderable number of ballots included in the final count that were \nnot submitted by legitimate registered voters. Domestic and \ninternational monitors also noted that the reported collated results \nfrom a particular local government area exceeded the combined total \nvotes from the polling stations in that area. Additionally, at some \nlocations, voters were denied the opportunity to vote because ballots \nwere delivered suspiciously late or in insufficient numbers. Finally, \ncertain procedures established by the electoral commission were not \nconsistently applied. According to the report issued by the Carter \nCenter/National Democratic Institute Observer Delegation, these \nincluded the failure to use indelible ink at many polling stations, the \nfailure to ensure ballot secrecy, late poll openings, and a failure to \nadhere to an accreditation process that was distinct from the actual \nvoting process.\n  Reports of these malpractices are indeed disturbing. Although it \nremains unclear whether the fraudulent activities had an impact on the \nultimate outcome of this election, such irregularities risk bringing \nthe legitimacy of the process into question and must be condemned.\n  Indeed, former President Jimmy Carter, who led a 66-person \nobservation delegation and spent considerable time in the country, was \nso disturbed by these irregularities that he sent a terse, two-sentence \nletter to the chairman of the electoral commission. The letter said--\nquote--``There was a wide disparity between the number of voters \nobserved at the polling stations and the final results that have been \nreported from several states. Regrettably, therefore, it is not \npossible for us to make an accurate judgment about the outcome of the \npresidential election.'' Since 1989, President Carter has led \ndelegations to observe electoral processes in 15 countries and has \nrarely had such harsh words to say regarding the outcome. This \nassessment truly gives me pause.\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to the views expressed by international \nobservers, I would also like to emphasize the importance of the views \nof the main domestic observer group, The Transition Monitoring Group, \nor TMG. The TMG is an umbrella organization formed of more than 60 \nhuman rights and civil society groups from throughout Nigeria. \nTogether, these organizations fielded some 10,700 monitors to observe \nvoting and counting at a large number of the country's 115,000 polling \nstations in all of the country's 36 states. In its interim report, the \nTMG noted that the kinds of malpractices observed in the elections \n``have the potential to erode the confidence of the electorate in the \nwhole transition.'' Therefore, the report recommends, and I quote:\n\n       It is important for the incoming civilian government to \n     appreciate and understand that the emphasis in the current \n     process has been on transition to civilian rule, rather than \n     the establishment of full-blown democracy to Nigeria. Any \n     triumphalist insistence on a ``winner-take-all'' stance on \n     the basis of a supposed democratic mandate must be avoided. \n     The incoming civilian government must therefore begin to make \n     determined and sustained efforts to cultivate democratic \n     norms and values amongst its members, as well as in the \n     society at large.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a key observation. The large number of reports \nof deliberate fraud, combined with the low voter turnout, appear to \nweaken the mandate for Gen. Obasanjo. His strong mandate, however, is \nfor the development of civilian democratic rule. The General certainly \nhas the capacity to embrace that mandate and implement true civilian \nrule according to the wishes of his people. Whether he chooses to go \nthis route or not remains to be seen. I strongly urge him to take the \nneeded steps to allow real democracy to take root in Nigeria. He should \nact decisively to develop effective democratic institutions, establish \nappropriate decentralization of decisionmaking throughout the three \nlevels of government, integrate the military into democratic society, \nand create the mechanisms of transparency and accountability that will \nallow the people to gain confidence that they are truly governing \nthemselves.\n  Key to these measures, of course, will be the adoption of a broadly \naccepted constitution. Amazingly, the ongoing transition process has \nbeen conducted without the benefit of a constitutional framework. The \ncurrent military government has said it will introduce a constitution \nin the near future. I hope it will be promulgated as an interim \nframework, and not imposed as a final document. Then I hope the \npresident-elect will institute a democratic procedure to debate and \ndevelop a new constitution that can have popular support.\n  Mr. President, as I said at the beginning, Nigerians and we in the \ninternational community, must decide how to react to these \ndevelopments. My own assessment is mixed. Therefore, I have a few words \nto say about the two executive branch announcements that were issued \njust prior to the election, the drug certification decision and the \nhuman rights report.\n  Although there was little concrete progress on important anti-\nnarcotics efforts between the United States and Nigeria, the President \ndecided to grant Nigeria a vital national interests certification in \norder to support the transition underway in Nigeria. That decision \npaves the way for the administration to provide needed economic and \nsecurity assistance to the new civilian government in Nigeria once it \nis inaugurated. In this particular case, I wish the decision to waive \nthe sanctions under this law could have waited until inauguration day \nactually arrives. The United States has until now had a strong \nsanctions regime against Nigeria, which has provided significant \nleverage for us in that country. Slowly, we were beginning to open up \nthat relationship, with the loosening of visa restrictions last fall. \nNow, however, by appearing to bless the efforts of the current Nigerian \nregime on narcotics enforcement, we have removed an important source of \nleverage. Despite good communication between Nigeria's National Drug \nLaw Enforcement Agency and our own Drug Enforcement Agency, the fact is \nlittle progress has been made in key areas. Nigerian efforts have been \nunsatisfactory on extradition of offenders wanted in the United States, \nimplementation of Nigeria's own national drug strategy and related \nlaws, stemming corruption among law enforcement personnel, and \ntargeting Nigeria-based worldwide narcotics and money laundering \norganizations.\n\n  Mr. President, the loss of our leverage on these important issues \nmakes me nervous. Yet I am inclined to be ``cautiously supportive'' or \nat least ``cautiously open-minded'' about this decision as long as the \nadministration's plans for working with the government are moderated \nand deliberately paced. A cautious approach is essential so that in the \nevent of a severe downspiral, the United States will not be overly \nexposed. I look forward to extensive consultation with the executive \nbranch on such plans.\n  Mr. President, I must also note some of the observations in this \nyear's State Department report on human rights in Nigeria. I am pleased \nthat the report indicates substantial improvement in Nigeria's human \nrights record in the latter part of 1998 as compared to its previously \nextremely poor record. Nonetheless, despite progress in the reduction \nof government use of lethal force and torture, the ending of harsh \nsuppression of a free press, and the restoration of citizens' rights to \nchoose their government, the report acknowledges that serious human \nrights problems persist.\n  In particular, Nigerian security forces continue to commit\n\n[[Page S2437]]\n\nextrajudicial killings, although generally not of a political \ncharacter. During frequent fuel shortages, the police and military \ndeployed to maintain order at filling stations repeatedly killed \ncustomers and operators, according to press reports. During the month \nof November alone, members of the combined police and military \nanticrime task force known as ``Operation Sweep'' reportedly committed \nat least 16 extrajudicial killings. Although some improvements were \nmade, harsh prison conditions and denial of proper medical treatment \ncontributed to the death of inmates. While Gen. Abubakar apparently \nbegan a serious effort to release political detainees, the lack of \nauthoritative information regarding the exact number of remaining \ndetainees served to confirm the fact that Abacha-era security forces \nwere able to put persons in detention with very little concern about \ndue process or accountability.\n  In addition, several of the important military decrees, which grant \nthe security forces sweeping powers of arrest and detention, remain on \nthe books.\n  Given the longstanding pattern of human rights abuses and some \nuncertainty about how widely accepted the new civilian president will \nbe, the report acknowledges that there is significant potential for a \ncontinued unacceptable human rights environment in Nigeria.\n  Mr. President, I have long been concerned about the human rights \nsituation in Nigeria. I have introduced several pieces of legislation \ndesigned to encourage democratization and respect for the rule of law \nin that country. I desperately want to support an active and proactive \nU.S. policy toward the country. For now, most signals seem to indicate \nthat the transition will continue to be smooth and peaceful. However, I \nam concerned that in truly wishing the best for the Nigerian people and \nin looking for ways to support the transition, the United States will \nin effect hold Nigeria's rulers to a lower standard of good governance \nthan it traditionally has demanded. I know that the administration is \nanxious to work with the new government, and if all goes well, I would \nencourage that.\n  The conduct of the elections last weekend did not inspire much \nconfidence in the process, and this is a great disappointment. However, \nit does not mean we should throw in the towel in the fight to foster a \ndemocratic Nigeria. No. In fact the opposite is true. We must continue \nto be vigilant and encourage Nigeria and its new leadership to follow \nthe right path. This means the United States should continue to help \nNigeria develop democratic institutions and to strengthen political and \ncivic organizations at all levels of government. We should help the \nmilitary remove itself from political life and become integrated into \ndemocratic society. But we should do this carefully and thoughtfully. \nAnd that is the best way we can help Nigeria help itself.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of a March 1 New \nYork Times editorial on this subject be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 1, 1999]\n\n                    Nigeria's Presidential Election\n\n       Olusegun Obasanjo, a former general, will be the next \n     president of Nigeria, according to preliminary election \n     results. His selection reflects the complexities of power in \n     Nigeria today. When the country's current leader, Gen. \n     Abdulsalami Abubakar, took over last June, he promised a \n     transition to civilian rule after 15 years of disaster under \n     general after general. Mr. Abubakar has kept his promise. But \n     the transition is incomplete. Military officers, who largely \n     bankrolled Mr. Obasanjo's candidacy, will continue to loom \n     over his government. Mr. Obasanjo will have to break with \n     them to have any success in improving life in Africa's most \n     populous nation.\n       General Abubakar took power after the death of Gen. Sani \n     Abacha, one of the most corrupt and certainly the most \n     despotic of Nigeria's recent military rulers. Their thievery \n     and mismanagement turned Nigeria, one of the world's richest \n     nations during the oil boom of the 1970's, into one of the \n     world's poorest. General Abacha snuffed out political life in \n     this once-vibrant country, jailing many of his rivals, \n     including General Obasanjo.\n       In his nine months in power, General Abubakar reversed much \n     of the political crackdown. Most political prisoners are now \n     free. Newspapers publish openly. This election was the first \n     in many years in which the Government did not dictate the \n     number of parties, although General Obasanjo's opponent has \n     complained about fraud in Saturday's voting.\n       But General Abubakar's early promises to bring corrupt or \n     brutal officers to justice have melted away. Some political \n     opponents arrested on trumped up charges are still in jail. \n     General Abacha's decrees muzzling the press are still on the \n     books, and lately some journalists who write sensitive \n     stories have been harassed and their publications \n     confiscated. Police have killed protesters, with the worst \n     repression in the Delta, Nigeria's poorest region despite \n     being the source of its oil wealth.\n       Many Nigerians hope that Mr. Obasanjo's government will end \n     the military's political role, but this is unlikely. Mr. \n     Obasanjo, who was president from 1976 to 1979, is the only \n     military ruler to leave office voluntarily. Yet he is still \n     close to the armed forces. Military men finance his party, \n     and one of its biggest supporters is Ibrahim Babangida, among \n     Nigeria's less savory former military rulers. That money \n     allowed Mr. Obasanjo to build a political machine that won a \n     majority in both houses of parliament in elections earlier in \n     February.\n       Desperately needed economic reforms and anti-corruption \n     measures will anger officers, the main beneficiaries of the \n     present morass. Reversing the poverty and environmental \n     destruction of the Delta is another urgent task that may be \n     hindered by Mr. Obasanjo's links to the armed forces, which \n     are hated there. Those ties may also prevent him from calming \n     ethnic tensions. He is a Yoruba from Nigeria's southwest, but \n     many Yoruba distrust him, viewing him as closer to the \n     northern army officials who have traditionally run Nigeria. \n     To have any success in tackling these daunting problems, Mr. \n     Obasanjo must make his government not the last stage in a \n     military transition, but the first stage of full civilian \n     rule.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.
