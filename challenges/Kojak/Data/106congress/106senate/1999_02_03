Mr. President, on Monday morning just past, President \nClinton submitted his annual budget to the Congress, but unlike prior \nsubmissions, this budget is much more than a plan for a single fiscal \nyear; this is a long-term blueprint for the 21st century. It prepares \nfor the impending retirement of the baby boomers. It ensures that \nyounger Americans will enjoy the security of Social Security and \nMedicare. And it provides a $500 billion tax cut to promote savings by \nordinary Americans.\n  Now, importantly, it achieves these goals while increasing national \nsavings and dramatically reducing our public debt.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton budget is a historic one. It begins a new \nera in budget policymaking and promises to shape our Nation's future \nfor years, for even decades, to come.\n  The Federal Government at long last has put its fiscal house in \norder. Last year was the first year since 1969 that we ran a budget \nsurplus--a unified budget surplus, I point out. This year that surplus \nwill be even larger. And many analysts see budget surpluses continuing \nfor years to come.\n  Our Government is the smallest that it has been, on a relative basis, \nin a quarter century, and we have improved our fiscal condition for 7 \nyears in a row--the best record in U.S. history.\n  Much of the credit for this success goes to President Clinton and the \ncongressional Democrats, but I hasten to point out that much of the \nimpetus that brought us to the point that we are came because we did \nthis in a bipartisan fashion. And I speak as the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee. The President lent the considerable force of his \noffice and his persuasion and worked with both Republicans and \nDemocrats to get to this fairly enviable position to produce a balanced \nbudget agreement. So there is plenty of credit to go around for an \naccomplishment that is well in place. I hope we can resume our work in \nsimilarly bipartisan and cooperative ways because there is so much left \nto be done.\n  In my view, President Clinton's budget submission provides an \nexcellent roadmap for that work. The heart of the President's plan is \nits allocation of roughly 90 percent of projected budget surpluses to \nthree key areas: Saving Social Security, strengthening Medicare, and \ncutting taxes to promote savings for ordinary Americans.\n  Social Security now is projected to be insolvent by 2032. The \nPresident's plan would preserve the program until\n\n[[Page S1116]]\n\n2055. The plan also would extend Medicare solvency from the year 2008 \nto 2020.\n  In addition, the budget includes a $500 billion tax cut to promote \nsavings among ordinary Americans in new ``USA accounts.'' That is way \nmore than a tax cut; it is a way to help all Americans invest in the \nprivate sector and share in the benefits of economic growth.\n  These priorities--saving Social Security, strengthening Medicare, and \ncutting taxes for retirement--are all designed to increase savings, and \nthat is essential. After all, while we have a unified surplus today, \nour public debt--that debt owed outside our Government--is still $3.7 \ntrillion. That is the debt owed to the public. We will also face huge \nunfunded liabilities when the baby boomers begin to retire.\n  We need to prepare for that future, and that is why it is important \nthat we pay off our debts, reduce interest costs, and increase private \ninvestment. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified \nthat that is the best way to promote long-term economic growth. And it \nis the only way to ensure that when the baby boomers retire we will be \nable to meet our obligations.\n  Beyond devoting most of the budget surpluses for savings, President \nClinton's budget also includes some important investments in our \nfuture. All are fully offset as required by budget rules and therefore \nprotect the budget caps.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the budget makes a strong commitment to \nquality education. It would help modernize our schools, hire more \nteachers, reduce class size, and improve educational \nstandards. Together these initiatives would help ensure that Americans \nare equipped to compete in the global economy. Everyone is aware that \nthis century, the 20th century, has been defined as the American \ncentury because of the progress that we made. After winning two World \nWars and having engaged in other conflicts that ultimately produced \npeace, American leadership was at the helm of global economic growth.\n\n  The budget also calls for a variety of other targeted tax cuts such \nas new credits to help families support long-term care and child care. \nIt increases our commitment to our men and women in the military. It \nwas made clear in newspapers across the country in the last few days \nthat we are having significant problems recruiting and retaining those \npeople that we would like to have serve us in the military. So it \nreflects the President's commitment to strengthen that; possibly to \nencourage young people to spend some time in the military and to \nencourage those who have experience and longevity to continue to do the \njob that they are capable of and not be attracted simply by a momentary \nbetter opportunity in the private sector.\n  The budget also reflects the President's commitment to strengthening \nour communities by hiring more police officers, cleaning up our \nenvironment, and fighting sprawl. We cannot go into every detail of the \nbudget here today, but overall I think this is an excellent proposal. \nIt is bold, it is innovative, and it has the right priorities for our \nfuture.\n  Unfortunately, I have been disappointed that the response to the \nPresident's budget, like other things that happen in Congress, has so \nfar been too partisan. Some Republicans have accused the President of \nreturning to an era of big government. This claim is so preposterous it \nis difficult to take it seriously when we look at the amounts of moneys \nbeing spent on government and see that, relative to the GDP, it is at \nthe lowest point that it has been since 1974. This budget, after all, \nwould reserve almost 90 percent of the surpluses for debt reduction. It \nwould be hard to get more fiscally responsible.\n  I respect the views of my Republican colleagues who have honest \ndisagreements with the President. I hope we can work together on this \nbudget issue. However, I do want to express my strong opposition to one \nelement of the Republican's budget plan, and that is their proposal for \ncuts across the board in tax rates.\n  I want to emphasize that I strongly support tax relief for ordinary \nAmericans. In particular, I support the $500-plus billion in tax cuts \nfor savings that are included in the President's budget for ordinary \nAmericans. Unfortunately, the Republican position is to spend much of \nthe budget surplus for tax rate cuts that go disproportionately to \nAmericans with the highest incomes.\n  According to one analysis, the Republican proposal would provide more \nthan $20,000 for those in the top 1 percent of earners who have incomes \nof more than $800,000. Just look at the chart. It looks like a fairly \nridiculous comparison, but the top 1 percent of those earning \n$833,000--those folks are in the top 1 percent; that is not the entire \n1 percent--they would get a tax cut of $20,697, but the person who \nworks hard and is included in the 60 percent of our American wage \nearners whose incomes are below $38,000 would get a $99 tax cut. Mr. \nPresident, $20,000 for the high-income wealthy people, $99 for the \naverage American; it is not fair and I hope that it will be \nreconsidered by our friends on the Republican side.\n  Even worse, these tax breaks for the highest income Americans would \ncome at the direct expense of Medicare. Medicare has become such an \nimportant program in our society, such a commitment, that it is valued \nby Americans across the board. We see its effects on the better health \nand the longevity that our citizens enjoy and the quality of life they \nexperience in those longer lives in their later years. So it would be \nwrong to sacrifice some addition to the solvency of Medicare for a tax \nbreak across the board that gives someone earning over $800,000 in a \nsingle year a $20,000-plus tax break.\n  President Clinton's budget reflects the values and priorities of most \nAmericans, and I hope that many of its proposals will enjoy bipartisan \nsupport. The American public loves it when we work in a bipartisan \nfashion, and I noted that when we got to the balanced budget agreement \nfor fiscal year 1997. We had all kinds of comments--it is a pleasure \nnot to see any bickering, not to see any sharp diatribes, not to see \nany acerbic discussions; it is a pleasure to see Senators working \ntogether on behalf of all Americans.\n  So this focus for this budget is on the future: saving Social \nSecurity, strengthening Medicare, providing tax cuts and promoting \nsavings for ordinary Americans. Together these policies will help \nensure a vibrant economy and a secure future for all Americans. So I \nhope my colleagues will support the President's approach. I look \nforward to doing what I can to work with them to address the serious \nfiscal issues facing our Nation and to prepare us for the 21st century, \nwhich I think can become the second American century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1115-6", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1116-S1117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE NEED FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE IN MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, senior citizens deserve coverage of \nprescription drugs under Medicare, and it is time for Congress to see \nthat they get it.\n  Medicare is a compact between workers and their government that says, \n``Work hard, pay into the system when you are young, and we will \nguarantee health security in your retirement.'' But that commitment is \nbeing broken every day, because Medicare does not cover prescription \ndrugs.\n  Prescription drug bills eat up a disproportionate share of the income \nof the typical elderly household. Senior citizens spend three times \nmore of their income on health care than persons under 65, and they \naccount for one-third of all prescription drug expenditures. Yet they \nmake-up only 12 percent of the population.\n  The greatest gap in Medicare--and the greatest anachronism--is its \nfailure to cover prescription drugs.\n  Because of this gap and other gaps in Medicare coverage, and the \ngrowing cost of the Part B premium, Medicare now pays only 50% of the \nout-of-pocket medical costs of the elderly. On average, senior citizens \nnow spend almost as much of their income on health care as they did \nbefore Medicare was enacted.\n  Prescription drugs are the single largest out-of-pocket cost to the \nelderly for health services. The average senior citizen fills an \naverage of eighteen prescriptions a year, and takes four to six \nprescriptions daily. Many elderly Americans face monthly drug bills of \n$100 or more.\n\n[[Page S1117]]\n\n  When Medicare was enacted in 1965, coverage of prescription drugs in \nprivate insurance policies was rare--and Medicare followed that \nstandard practice. Today, 99 percent of employment-based health \ninsurance policies provide prescription drug coverage--99 percent. But \nMedicare is caught in a 34-year-old time warp--and senior citizens are \nsuffering as a result.\n  Too many elderly Americans today face a cruel choice between food on \nthe table and the medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their \nillnesses. Too many senior citizens often take only half the pills \ntheir doctor prescribes, or don't even fill needed prescriptions--\nbecause they can't afford the high cost of the drugs. Too often, they \nare paying twice as much as they should for their prescription drugs, \nbecause they are forced to pay full price when those with private \ninsurance policies get the advantage of negotiated discounts. As a \nresult, many senior citizens end up in the hospital--at excessive cost \nto Medicare--because they aren't obtaining the drugs they need or are \nnot taking them correctly. As we enter the new century, pharmaceutical \nproducts are increasingly the source of miracle cures for many dread \ndiseases--and senior citizens will be left even farther behind if we \nfail to act.\n  The 21st century may well be the century of life sciences. With the \nsupport of the American people, Congress is on the way to the goal of \ndoubling the budget of the National Institutes of Health over the next \nfive years. This investment is seed money for the additional basic \nresearch that will enable scientists to develop new therapies to \nimprove and extend the lives of senior citizens and all citizens.\n  In 1998 alone, private industry spent more than $21 billion for \nresearch on new medicines and to bring them to the public. These \nmiracle drugs save lives--and they save dollars too, by preventing \nunnecessary hospitalization and expensive surgery. All patients deserve \naffordable access to these medications. Yet, Medicare, which is the \nnation's largest insurer, does not cover outpatient prescription drugs, \nand senior citizens and persons with disabilities pay a heavy daily \nprice for this glaring omission.\n  America's senior citizens and disabled citizens deserve to benefit \nfrom new discoveries in the same way that other families do. Yet, \nwithout negotiating power, they receive the brunt of cost-shifting--\nwith often devastating results. In the words of a recent report by \nStandard & Poor's, ``Drugmakers have historically raised prices to \nprivate customers to compensate for the discounts they grant to managed \ncare consumers.'' The so-called ``private'' customers referred to in \nthis report are largely our nation's mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, \ngrandmothers, and grandfathers.\n  Up to 19 million Medicare beneficiaries are forced to fend for \nthemselves when it comes to purchasing these life-saving and life-\nimproving therapies. They have no prescription drug coverage from any \nsource. Other Medicare beneficiaries have some coverage, but too often \nit is inadequate, unreliable and unaffordable.\n  About 6 percent of senior citizens have limited coverage through a \nMedicare HMO. While the majority of Medicare HMO plans offer \nprescription drug coverage, the benefits vary widely. Some plans cap \nthe benefit at just $300 a year or less. Imagine that, $300 a year or \nless. In addition, the current trend is for HMOs to cut back on drug \ncoverage or, in extreme cases, leave the Medicare market altogether. We \nhave tried to remedy this problem in Massachusetts, but clearly it is a \nnational problem, and it requires a national solution.\n  An additional 12 percent of Medicare beneficiaries purchase an \nindependent medigap policy with prescription drug coverage and coverage \nof other gaps in Medicare. Only three of the ten standard medigap \nbenefit packages even include insurance for prescription drugs. These \nplans are difficult to obtain, because even the most generous companies \nrefuse to cover all people who walk in the door.\n  They fear that only those who urgently need the coverage will sign \nup, so the plans contain escape clauses that exclude applicants with \npre-existing conditions. Even if they decide to issue a policy, often \nthere are no limits on what these private companies can charge. As a \nresult, medigap plans with drug coverage are often out of reach for \nsenior citizens. For those fortunate enough to obtain the coverage, the \nbenefits are limited and the costs are high.\n  Another 10 percent are Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for \ncoverage under Medicaid. This coverage is an important part of the \nsafety net for our poorest elderly and disabled citizens, but it offers \nno help to the vast majority of senior citizens.\n  Finally, a third of all Medicare beneficiaries have reasonably \ncomprehensive coverage through a retiree health plan. These plans, \nwhich are offered through their former employers, supplement Medicare, \nand the prescription drug benefits are often generous. But \nincreasingly, retiree health benefits are on the chopping block as \ncompanies cut costs by reducing health spending.\n  Despite Medicare's lack of coverage for prescription drugs, their \nmisuse results in preventable illnesses that cost Medicare as much as \n$16 billion annually, while imposing vast misery on senior citizens. It \nis in our best interest, and in the best interest of Medicare, to \nreform it in ways that encourage proper use and minimize these abuses.\n  Savings can be achieved when physicians and pharmacists are better \neducated on the needs of senior citizens and the potential problems \nthey face in obtaining and using their medications.\n  Savings can also be achieved when senior citizens are assisted in \nlearning how to follow the instructions that are dispensed with their \nmedications. Too often, patients shortchange themselves. They take half \ndoses or try to stretch out their prescription to make it last longer. \nThis is wrong, and it doesn't have to happen. If elderly patients know \nthat the drugs they need will be affordable, compliance will improve, \nand so will their quality of life.\n  President Clinton has correctly identified prescription drug coverage \nas one of the very highest priorities for Medicare reform. I hope we \ncan reach a broad bipartisan consensus in the coming weeks that any \nMedicare reform worth the name will include coverage of prescription \ndrugs. The health and financial security of millions of senior citizens \ndepend on it, and we owe it to them to act as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to a piece that was written by our distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, our colleague, Senator Byrd, that appeared in \ntoday's Washington Post entitled ``Don't Tinker With Impeachment.''\n  The reason I want to do that is there are discussions occurring now, \naccording to some of my colleagues and accounts in the newspaper and on \ntelevision, about trying to create a mechanism to require a vote in the \nSenate during the impeachment trial on the findings of fact prior to a \nvote on the articles of impeachment themselves.\n  I was just looking at the Constitution in our Senate manual, and, of \ncourse, article III in the Constitution establishes the basis for \nimpeachment, and it is simple, direct and provides nothing of the sort \nthat would lead Senators to believe that they can bifurcate the vote in \nthe Senate in an impeachment trial first to findings of fact and have a \nmajority vote on findings of fact and then to move toward a vote on the \ntwo articles of impeachment that are currently in front of the Senate.\n  But I think the article written by our colleague, Senator Byrd, \nprovides the best description of the difficulty with these findings of \nfact. Let me read just a few comments, and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave the article printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the article, in part, by Senator Byrd \nsays:\n\n\n[[Page S1118]]\n\n\n       The notion of trumping the articles of impeachment with \n     even a ``broad'' findings of fact flies in the face of what \n     the Framers of the Constitution intended. They deliberately \n     set the bar high when it came to the vote on articles of \n     impeachment, first by requiring a supermajority of two-thirds \n     of the Senate to convict, and second, by fusing the penalty--\n     [that is] removal from office [being the penalty]--into the \n     question of guilt.\n       In voting on articles of impeachment [he goes on to say] \n     senators must answer not one but two questions: Is the \n     president guilty or not guilty of committing high crimes and \n     misdemeanors, and, if he is guilty, do his actions warrant \n     removal from office?\n\n  Continuing to quote from Senator Byrd's article:\n\n       This was not a casual coupling on the part of the Framers. \n     Their intent was to force senators to set aside their own \n     passions and prejudices and focus instead on the best \n     interests of the nation. To lift this burden from the \n     shoulders of senators by offering them a way to convict the \n     president without having to accept responsibility for \n     removing him from office would, in effect, bastardize the \n     impeachment process.\n       Moreover [he says] the aftershocks would be felt long after \n     this impeachment has faded into history. No longer would \n     senators be confined to the articles of impeachment \n     formulated by the House of Representatives. No longer would \n     senators need a two-thirds majority vote to pronounce a \n     president guilty. From this time forward, they could cite \n     the precedent set by the Senate in the 106th Congress as \n     giving them carte blanche to write, and approve by a \n     simple majority, ersatz articles of impeachment cloaked as \n     ``findings of fact.''\n\n  Senator Byrd, as always, finds the bull's-eye in this debate. This is \nnot some ordinary debate; this is a debate about constitutional \nrequirements and responsibilities and what the provisions of the \nConstitution mean with respect to impeachment.\n  The impeachment article provisions of the Constitution require, when \nimpeachment articles are voted by the U.S. House of Representatives and \nsent to the Senate, that a trial must commence, and the vote on the \narticles of impeachment would be conducted by the Senate; and two-\nthirds of the Senate would have to vote guilty on those articles of \nimpeachment in order to remove a President from office.\n  But it doesn't bifurcate the vote, doesn't call for extra procedures, \ndoesn't call for findings of fact, doesn't allow some Senators to say, \n``Yes, that's what the Constitution says but we're going to create a \nnew, or pretend there's a new, provision in the Constitution without \nhaving the difficulty of debating Madison and Mason and Hamilton and \nFranklin over our proposal. We'll just pretend it's in the \nConstitution. And we'll have separate votes on findings of fact. And in \nfact, doing that, we can have our own little vote and create our own \nlittle result with only 51 Members of the Senate voting in favor of our \nresolution.''\n  That is a terrible idea and, in my judgment, stands this \nConstitution, and the article of impeachment provisions in this \nConstitution, on its head. But Senator Byrd says it much better than I \ndo. I will, as I indicated, include his article at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  This Constitution, written in a room in Philadelphia over 200 years \nago, is quite a remarkable document. It established the separation of \npowers. It established the framework for a new kind of Government that \nhas worked remarkably well. If those who watch these proceedings and \nbecome interested in the Constitution would go to that room in \nPhiladelphia, they would see that that room still exists. It is called \nthe Assembly Room in Constitution Hall.\n  That room, which is smaller than the Senate Chamber, has a chair in \nthe front of the room where George Washington sat as he presided over \nthat Chamber. The same chair sits there today. And you will see where \nMason sat, Madison, Franklin, and others who wrote this Constitution. \nThey wrote it on a hot Philadelphia summer with the curtains drawn to \nkeep the heat out of that room, and they created this remarkable \ndocument that is printed here in the Senate Manual. And that is the \ndocument by which we in the Senate are now conducting an impeachment \ntrial.\n  I come to the floor today only to say that I think there is great \ndanger in believing there are things written in this Constitution that \ndon't exist in the Constitution. There is danger, in my judgment, in \nsuggesting ways or mechanisms by which some can vote and create \nmajority votes on some extraordinary findings of fact that are not \nprovided for in this Constitution.\n  In this impeachment trial, there is one of two results, and that is a \nvote on the two articles of impeachment that have been sent to the U.S. \nSenate by the House of Representatives. That vote will be a vote cast \nby each and every Member of this Senate, and the vote will be either a \nvote to convict or a vote to acquit--guilty or not guilty on the two \narticles of impeachment. And my hope is that when the Senate reconvenes \nin the impeachment trial, all Senators will have read this rather \nremarkable article by the preeminent constitutional scholar in this \nChamber and the historian of this U.S. Senate, the esteemed Senator \nByrd.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Washington Post, February 3, 1999]\n\n                     Don't Tinker With Impeachment\n\n                          (By Robert C. Byrd)\n\n       While the lawyers are busy deposing witnesses in the Senate \n     impeachment trial of the president, a number of senators are \n     continuing to work quietly behind the scenes to chart a \n     course that will end the trial with a minimum of political \n     carnage. One route currently being investigated is a so-\n     called ``findings of fact,'' an extravagant novelty by which \n     a simple majority of the Senate could condemn the president's \n     behavior within the framework of the impeachment process \n     without being forced to remove him from office.\n       This convict-but-don't-evict strategy appeals to some \n     senators who have no appetite for prolonging a trial whose \n     outcome is all but certain. At the same time, they are \n     squeamish about the likelihood of an all-but-inevitable \n     acquittal without having some vehicle to first register their \n     condemnation of the president's actions. No doubt their \n     motives are sincere, and I applaud their ingenuity, but this \n     findings-of-fact proposal is not the answer. While the Senate \n     sits in the impeachment trial, it is not in legislative \n     session. The insertion of such a legislative mutant into the \n     impeachment proceedings would subject the process to some \n     very experimental genetic engineering.\n       The notion of trumping the articles of impeachment with \n     even a ``broad'' findings of fact flies in the face of what \n     the Framers of the Constitution intended. They deliberately \n     set the bar high when it came to the vote on articles of \n     impeachment, first by requiring a supermajority of two-thirds \n     of the Senate to convict, and second, by fusing the penalty--\n     removal from office--into the question of guilt.\n       In voting on articles of impeachment, senators must answer \n     not one but two questions: Is the president guilty or not \n     guilty of committing high crimes and misdemeanors, and, if he \n     is guilty, do his actions warrant removal from office?\n       This was not a casual coupling on the part of the Framers. \n     Their intent was to force senators to set aside their own \n     passions and prejudices and focus instead on the best \n     interests of the nation. To lift this burden from the \n     shoulders of senators by offering them a way to convict the \n     president without having to accept responsibility for \n     removing him from office would, in effect, bastardize the \n     impeachment process.\n       Moreover, the aftershocks would be felt long after this \n     impeachment has faded into history. No longer would senators \n     be confined to the articles of impeachment formulated by the \n     House of Representatives. No longer would senators need a two \n     thirds majority vote to pronounce a president guilty. From \n     this time forward, they could cite the precedent set by the \n     Senate in the 106th Congress as giving them carte blanche to \n     write, and approve by a simple majority, ersatz articles of \n     impeachment cloaked as ``findings of fact.''\n       And why stop at findings of fact? If the Senate can ignore \n     the intent of the Framers to combine a guilty verdict with \n     removal from office in an impeachment trial, maybe senators \n     can find a way around the constitutional prohibition against \n     bills of attainder, or legislative punishments.\n       The Senate impeachment trial takes place in a quasi-\n     judicial setting, and findings of fact would move the Senate \n     headlong into an area reserved for the judicial system, where \n     the Senate, under the separation of powers principle, dares \n     not go.\n       Findings of fact would become part of a quasi-judicial \n     record that could not subsequently be amended or overturned. \n     Could such a record of findings of fact be later used by an \n     independent counsel before a federal grand jury in an effort \n     to secure an indictment? If this or any president were to be \n     indicted, could such findings be introduced as evidence in a \n     subsequent trial in an effort to sway a jury and bring about \n     a conviction? Who knows what monsters this rogue gene might \n     spawn in future days?\n       The impeachment process, as messy and uncomfortable as it \n     may be, is working as designed. This is neither the time nor \n     the place for constitutional improvisation. No matter how \n     sincere the motivation, our nation and our Constitution will \n     not be well served by this sort of seat-of-the-pants \n     tinkering.\n       A post-trial censure resolution that does not cross the \n     line into legislative punishment is something else. It can \n     and should be considered by the Senate after the court of\n\n[[Page S1119]]\n\n     impeachment has adjourned sine die. Censure is not \n     meaningless, it will not subvert the Constitution, and it \n     will be indelibly seared into the ineffaceable record of \n     history for all future generations to see and to ponder. For \n     those who fear that it can be expunged from the record, be \n     assured that it can never be erased from the history books. \n     Like the mark that was set upon Cain, it will follow even \n     beyond the grave.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, first of all, I want to raise with my \ncolleagues two issues that revolve around energy security. The first \nissue is the state of the domestic oil industry and the second issue is \nthe Oil-for-Food Program for Iraq. I think that this marks the first \ndeparture from the debate on the impeachment, and I hope the Presiding \nOfficer will find it refreshing.\n  Last week, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which I chair, \nheld a hearing to review the state of the domestic petroleum industry, \nand to assess the threat to our economic security from our growing \ndependence on foreign oil. The domestic oil industry in the United \nStates is in serious trouble. Companies are laying off workers in \ndroves. In my State of Alaska, British Petroleum, just announced the \nlayoff of some 600 workers, and another one of our major oil companies \nlost somewhere in the area of just under $800 million in the last \nquarter of 1998.\n  Exploration and drilling budgets are way down. Drilling contractors \nhave been cut to the bone. Marginal and stripper wells are being shut \nin. These are production capabilities, Mr. President, that, once lost, \nwill unlikely be regained. These, to a large degree, represent an \nongoing operating petroleum reserve--one might conclude a strategic \npetroleum reserve--because while they are small, they are substantial \nin their numbers and contribute to domestic production.\n  Now, to quote a recent report by the John S. Herold Company, 1998 was \na ``catastrophe'' for the U.S. oil industry, ``nothing short of \nmurderous for investors'' in that industry. We are seeing mergers and \nconsolidations, significant implications for the Nation's energy \nsecurity, and certainly U.S. jobs--30 merged companies alone last year.\n  This situation in the oil industry is interesting, as we look at the \ncommodities in this country. As the Presiding Officer is well aware, \nthe agricultural industry--production, livestock, hogs, beef--the \nfarmers can hardly raise them anymore. Many aspects of the agricultural \nindustry are under water. This is true of the timber industry. It is \ntrue of the steel industry. It is true of the mining industry, and \ncertainly true of the oil and gas industry.\n  So as we reflect on the prosperity of this country, it is interesting \nto note the job losses in the commodities industries of this country--\nand one has to wonder when it is going to catch up with itself. Of \ncourse, we enjoy low gasoline prices when we fill our car or boat, low \nheating oil prices when we warm our home, and low inflation due in \nlarge measure to low oil prices. Let's recognize where it is.\n  But a decimated U.S. oil industry creates a risk to consumers, to the \neconomy, to our national energy security. And we only have to look back \nat history. Some say we learn from history, and some say not much. \nWell, we recall the 1973 Arab oil embargo when we were only 36 percent \ndependent on foreign imported oil. That had a devastating impact on \nconsumers and the economy. We saw oil shortages, and long lines at the \ngas stations. Many people have forgotten that timeframe--soaring \nprices, double-digit inflation, and an economy put into recession. What \nwas the prime rate at that time? Well, the prime rate was 20.5 percent \nin 1980. Inflation was in the area of 11 percent--double-digit.\n  If it happened today, we could be hit even harder. And we are getting \nset up for it because we are in worse shape today than we were in 1973. \nSince 1973, our foreign dependence has grown by leaps and bounds. U.S. \ncrude oil production dropped by one-third. U.S. oil imports--oil \nimports--soared by two-thirds.\n  Today, U.S. foreign oil dependence is 56 percent, compared to 36 \npercent back in 1973. Our excessive foreign oil dependence puts our \nnational energy security interests at stake and hence our national \nsecurity at stake. We can't forget that the United States went to war \nin 1991 when Iraq invaded Kuwait and threatened the world oil supplies. \nPart of that was our supply.\n  In 1995, President Clinton issued a Presidential finding that imports \nof oil threatened our national security, and a short time ago the U.S. \nbombed Iraq because Saddam continues to threaten the stability in the \nPersian Gulf. Well, it is fair to say, Mr. President, if we do nothing, \nwhat will happen: We know things are going to get worse.\n  The Department of Energy projects in the year 2010 U.S. foreign \ndependence will hit about 68 percent. That means we will be depending \non foreign sources for 68 percent of our oil supply.\n  I don't think we should put our trust in foreign oil-producing \nnations that have their interests in mind, not ours. I plan to work \nclosely with the small and independent producers to develop a solution \nto this crisis. Already I have cosponsored Senate bill 325, a bill \nintroduced by my colleague from Texas, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, \nthat would amend the Tax Code to add marginal producers. I will work as \na member of the Finance Committee to consider this and see it is \nadopted.\n  I also intend, with Senators from producing States, to consider a \nnon-tax means to assist domestic production through regulatory and land \naccess issues.\n  Second, I want to talk about oil-for-food and our relations with \nIraq. This deals with our energy security; that is, our U.S. policy \ntowards Iraq, specifically, the U.N. Oil-for-Food Program. Six weeks \nhave passed since President Clinton ordered America's Armed Forces to \nstrike military and security targets in Iraq. What has Saddam's regime \ndone since then? They have shot at U.S. fighter planes on almost a \ndaily basis. They have challenged Kuwait's right to exist. They have \ndemanded compensation for U.N. crimes against Iraq--isn't that ironic. \nThey have demanded an end to sanctions and no-fly zones. They have \nreiterated that no weapons inspectors will be allowed to return. That \nis a pretty bold statement.\n  Now, what policy initiative has the Clinton administration launched \nto deal with Saddam's defiance? U.S. officials offered to eliminate the \nceiling on the Oil-for-Food Program, a de facto ending of the sanctions \non oil exports. My views on the absurdity to this proposal were \nincluded in a recent Washington Post op-ed, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 25, 1999]\n\n                      Our Toothless Policy on Iraq\n\n                        (By Frank H. Murkowski)\n\n       On the eve of Operation Desert Fox, President Clinton \n     announced to the nation that ``we are delivering a powerful \n     message to Saddam.'' That message now appears to be that as \n     long as Saddam Hussein refuses to cooperate with inspections, \n     refuses to comply with U.N. resolutions and refuses to stop \n     illegally smuggling out oil, he will be rewarded by the de \n     facto ending of economic sanctions.\n       At least, that was the message sent by the U.S. Ambassador \n     to the United Nations Peter Burleigh on Jan. 14 when he \n     offered a plan to eliminate the ceiling on how much oil Iraq \n     can sell abroad. This proposal was in reaction to a proposal \n     (made by France and supported by Russia and China) to end the \n     Iraq oil embargo.\n       Do not be fooled. The distinctions between the U.S. plan \n     and the French plan are meaningless. This is the end of the \n     U.N. sanctions regime. Security Council Resolution 687, \n     passed in 1991 at the end of the Gulf War, requires that \n     international economic sanctions, including an embargo on the \n     sale of oil from Iraq, remain in place until Iraq discloses \n     and destroys its weapons of mass destruction programs and \n     capabilities and undertakes unconditionally never to resume \n     such activities. This, we know, has not happened.\n       But the teeth in Resolution 687 have effectively been \n     pulled, one by one, with the introduction and then continued \n     expansion of\n\n[[Page S1120]]\n\n     the so-called oil-for-food exception to the sanctions. \n     Although the humanitarian goals of the oil-for-food program \n     are worthy, Saddam Hussein already has subverted the program \n     to his own benefit by using increased oil capacity to smuggle \n     oil for hard cash and by freeing up resources he might have \n     been forced to use for food and medicine for his own people.\n       The increase in illegal sales of petroleum products \n     coincided with implementation of the oil-for-food program in \n     1995. Part of this illegally sold oil is moving by truck \n     across the Turkish-Iraqi border. A more significant amount is \n     moving by sea through the Persian Gulf. Exports of contraband \n     Iraqi oil through the gulf have jumped some 50-fold in the \n     past two years, to nearly half a billion dollars. Further, \n     Iraq has been steadily increasing illegal exports of oil to \n     Jordan and Turkey.\n       Oil is Saddam Hussein's lifeline; it fuels his ability to \n     finance his factories of death and rebuild his weapons of \n     mass destruction. Revenue from oil exports historically has \n     represented nearly all of Iraq's foreign exchange earnings. \n     In the year preceding Operation Desert Storm, Iraq's export \n     earnings totaled $10.4 billion, with 95 percent attributed to \n     petroleum. Iraq's imports during that same year, 1990, \n     totaled only $6.6 billion.\n       The United States proposes to lift the ceiling on the only \n     export that matters. In addition, it is prepared to relax the \n     scrutiny applied to contracts for spare parts and other \n     equipment needed to get Iraqi industry working better.\n       France, China and Russia, of course, did not support Desert \n     Fox, and have wanted to lift the Iraq embargo for some time. \n     They are willing to put economic gain before international \n     security, because these appeasers of Iraq stand to earn \n     billions in a post-sanctions world. In fact, earlier this \n     month, the U.N. released more than $81 million under the \n     expanded oil-for-food program to enable Iraq to buy \n     electrical generating equipment, nearly all of which ($74.9 \n     million) will come from China. Will these new turbines merely \n     guarantee an uninterrupted power supply for Saddam Hussien's \n     poison gas facilities?\n       Why is the Clinton administration prepared to take this \n     course? Because our Iraq policy is bankrupt. We have relied \n     on Koki Annan and the Iraq appeasers to sign meaningless \n     deals with Saddam Hussein regarding inspections that were \n     useless from the moment they were signed. When we called back \n     our aircraft at the last moment in October, despite the \n     unanimous support of the Security Council for the attack, our \n     Iraq policy suffered a near-fatal collapse. It finally did \n     collapse when we decided to strike at a time when the \n     president's credibility was at its lowest and the approach of \n     Ramadan guaranteed Saddam Hussien easily could outlast our \n     attack. Indeed the absurdity of our policy is reflected in \n     the fact that in December our bombers targeted an oil \n     refinery in Basra and at the end of the attack we pledged \n     support to rebuild Iraq's oil-export capacity.\n       The inept policies that have brought us to this point must \n     be reversed. As a first step, the administration ought to \n     turn back from its path toward lifting, rather than \n     tightening, the sanctions on Saddam Hussein. Second, when the \n     U.N. reconsiders reauthorizing the oil-for-food program in \n     May, the United States should use its veto to end this \n     program, which has allowed Saddam Hussein to rebuild his \n     political and military support.\n       We can bring Saddam Hussein to his knees by eliminating his \n     ability to market any of his oil, thereby cutting off his \n     cash flow. Not only should the United States strengthen oil \n     interdiction and inspection operations, the administration \n     should consider adopting a policy similar to the air blockade \n     we enforce in the ``no-fly'' zone. A strictly enforced ``no-\n     oil-export'' policy is what is called for.\n       Only then will Saddam Hussein realize that cooperation with \n     U.N. inspectors is the only way to rebuild his economy. The \n     policy predicated on so-called humanitarian grounds--oil for \n     food--not only has failed but has ensured the survival of \n     Saddam Hussein.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I don't have time to go into that in \ndepth, but let me remind my colleagues of a few things. One, the United \nNations Security Council Resolution 687 passed in 1991 at the end of \nthe Persian Gulf War requires that international economic sanctions, \nincluding an embargo on the sale of oil from Iraq, remain in place \nuntil Iraq discloses and destroys its weapons of mass destruction \nprograms and capabilities and undertakes unconditionally never to \nresume such activities.\n  But the teeth in Resolution 687 have effectively been pulled out one-\nby-one with the introduction and then continued expansion of the so-\ncalled oil-for-food exception to the sanctions: In 1995, UNSCR 986 \nallowed Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil every 6 months. Iraq \nproduced 1.2 million barrels per day in 1997. In 1997, UNSCR 1153 \ndoubled the offer to $5.2 billion in oil every 6 months. Iraq is now \nproducing 2.5 million barrels of oil. In 1999, United States, France, \nand Saudi Arabia will offer varying plans on removing the limit on how \nmuch oil Iraq can sell and for what purpose.\n  This means that Iraq's oil production of 2.5 million barrels per day \nequals--their production now equals--the prewar production levels in \nthe year preceding Desert Storm. Iraq's export earnings total $10.4 \nbillion, with 95 percent attributed to oil, which is Iraq's only \nsignificant identifiable cash flow. Iraq's imports that same year were \nonly $6.6 billion.\n  The President's National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, takes issue \nwith my characterization of the U.S. proposal. In a Washington Post \neditorial, he said that under the Oil-for-Food Program:\n\n       We prevent Saddam from spending his nation's most valuable \n     treasure on what he cares about most--rebuilding his military \n     arsenal--and force him to spend it on what he cares about \n     least--the people of Iraq. From Saddam's point of view, that \n     makes the program part of the sanctions regime.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that editorial in the Washington Post be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                Oil for Food: The Opposite of Sanctions\n\n                         (By Samuel R. Berger)\n\n       The Post's Jan. 17 editorial ``Rewarding Saddam Hussein'' \n     endorsed the administration's policy of containing Iraq and \n     our continued readiness to back that policy with force. \n     Unfortunately, it also misconstrued important elements of our \n     approach to sanctions to Iraq. The confusion was compounded \n     by a Jan. 25 op-ed by Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska). Both \n     took issue with what the editorial referred to--\n     incompletely--as an administration statement offering ``to \n     eliminate the ceiling on how much oil Iraq is permitted to \n     sell.'' The second half of that statement--which the \n     editorial omitted--read: ``to finance the purchase of food \n     and medicine for the Iraqi people.''\n       Under the U.S. proposal, Iraq could pump as much oil as is \n     needed to meet humanitarian needs. All the revenue would go \n     directly to a U.N. escrow account, as it does now. From that \n     account, checks could be written--directly to the \n     contractor--to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian \n     supplies, as well as parts for equipment that we know is \n     being used to pump oil for this program. These supplies then \n     would be distributed under U.N. supervision. Saddam would \n     never see a dime.\n       The Post and Sen. Murkowski also asserted that our proposal \n     to increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Iraq is no \n     different from proposals to lift sanctions. In fact, it is in \n     direct opposition to them.\n       If sanctions were lifted, the international community no \n     longer could determine how Iraq's oil revenues are spent. The \n     oil-for-food program would have to be disbanded, not \n     expanded. Billions of dollars now reserved for the basic \n     needs of the Iraqi people would become available to Saddam to \n     use as he pleased. The amount of food and medicine flowing \n     into Iraq most likely would decline.\n       In contrast, under the current program, we prevent Saddam \n     from spending his nation's most valuable treasure on what he \n     cares about most--rebuilding his military arsenal--and force \n     him to spend it on what he cares about least--the people of \n     Iraq. From Saddam's point of view, that makes the program \n     part of the sanctions regime.\n       Indeed, Saddam already has rejected our initiative to \n     expand it. He knows that every drop of oil sold to feed the \n     Iraqi people is a drop of oil that will never be sold to feed \n     his war machine. Oil for food means no oil for tanks.\n       Saddam's intent is clear: He is cynically trying to exploit \n     the suffering of his people--for which he is responsible--to \n     gain sympathy for his cause and to create a rift in the \n     international coalition arrayed against him. In this way, he \n     hopes to build support for ending sanctions so that he can \n     resume his effort to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\n       But he is failing. In recent weeks, opinion has hardened \n     against Saddam in Arab countries. On Sunday, the Arab League \n     called on Iraq to stop provoking its neighbors and to comply \n     with U.N. resolutions. Newspapers in Egypt and Saudi Arabia \n     have called for Saddam's ouster. But there remains strong \n     public sympathy for the Iraqi people.\n       The effect of our policy is to make clear that the source \n     of hunger and sickness in Iraq is not sanctions but Saddam. \n     After the Gulf War ended, the United States made certain that \n     food and medicine would never be subject to sanctions. Saddam \n     always has been free to import them. When he refused to do \n     so, the United States took the lead in proposing that Iraq be \n     allowed to sell controlled quantities of its oil in order to \n     purchase humanitarian supplies. Remarkably, until 1996, \n     Saddam refused to do even that.\n       Currently, the United Nations allows Iraq to spend up to \n     $5.2 billion in oil revenue every six months for humanitarian \n     purposes. Saddam is so indifferent to the suffering of his \n     people that he still refuses to make full use of this \n     allowance. But the food supply in Iraq has grown, and soon \n     will provide the average Iraqi with about 2,200 calories per \n     day, which is at the top of the United Nations' recommended \n     range.\n\n[[Page S1121]]\n\n       To leave no doubt about who is responsible for the \n     suffering of Iraq's people, we are willing to lift the $5.2 \n     billion ceiling to allow Iraq--under strict supervision--to \n     use as much oil revenue as is necessary to meet humanitarian \n     needs. In the meantime, we will continue to enforce sanctions \n     against Iraq and remain prepared to take action against any \n     oil facilities being used to circumvent them.\n       Critics of this effort imply we should starve Iraq into \n     submission. They forget that starving Iraq is Saddam's \n     strategy. The oil-for-food program helps us to thwart it.\n       The program does not reward Saddam; it further restrains \n     him, while relieving the suffering of ordinary Iraqis. It has \n     helped to deepen Saddam's isolation, and it will remain a \n     logical part of our strategy against him and the threat he \n     poses.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In conclusion, I don't care much about Saddam's point \nof view, but from the point of view of this Senator from Alaska, what \nthis program does is allow Saddam to use his increased oil capacity to \nsmuggle oil for hard cash and free up resources he can use to finance \nhis weapons of mass destruction. Saddam's cash flow is oil. The \nsmuggling is documented. The displacement issue is harder to track, but \nSaddam's war machine is still working and his troops are still fit.\n  Let me take issue with the definition of ``humanitarian supplies.'' \nThe most recent U.N.-approved plan would allow Saddam to spend this \noil-for-food money, and I think it is interesting to reflect where is \nhe spending his money. Let's look at it, because I think it counters \nSandy Berger's remarks that this is going for ``humanitarian'' \npurposes: $300 million for petroleum equipment; $409 million for \nelectricity networks; $126 million for telecommunication systems; $120 \nmillion to buy trucks, repair the railway system, and build food \nwarehouses; $180 million for agriculture equipment, including \npesticides.\n  What is the humanitarian goal in guaranteeing an uninterrupted power \nsupply for Saddam's poison gas facilities? What is the humanitarian \ngoal in making sure his elite guards can communicate with each other?\n  And finally, with a new emphasis on building an effective Iraq \nopposition, I wonder how an opposition can take root when Saddam is \nable, through the Oil-for-Food Program, to take care of his citizens' \nbasic needs?\n  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, and I \nwill be holding a joint hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee and \nthe Energy Committee next week to ask the administration these \nquestions. I have asked Sandy Berger to come up and defend his \narguments, along with Secretary Richardson and Under Secretary \nPickering.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an excellent \nanalysis of the various proposals for changing the sanctions by Patrick \nClawson from the Washington Institute.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [The Washington Institute, January 19, 1999]\n\n       Assessing Proposals for Changing U.N. Restrictions on Iraq\n\n                 (By Patrick Clawson, with Nawaf Obaid)\n\n       In the last two weeks, France, the United States, and Saudi \n     Arabia have all proposed changes in UN restrictions on Iraq. \n     While all would have the effect of cutting Saddam some slack, \n     intriguingly, the Saudi plan is about as good as the \n     American.\n       The French Proposal. The French proposal is soft both on \n     inspections and on sanctions. In the words of Foreign \n     Minister Hubert Vedrine, the French proposal aims at \n     ``preventing any new [emphasis added] development of weapons \n     of mass destruction [WMD].'' Vedrine proposes no action be \n     taken about what he describes as ``remaining [WMD] stocks \n     that may have escaped control or destruction''--stocks that \n     include some long-range missiles and biological weapons \n     materials. The French-proposed inspection system would be \n     built on the model of the International Atomic Energy Agency \n     (IAEA), rather than UNSCOM. Since the Gulf War, the IAEA has \n     continued its practice of looking primarily at fissile \n     material rather than at the full scope of activities needed \n     to make a nuclear weapon. Intelligence reports suggest Iraq \n     has produced weapon components from which functioning nuclear \n     weapons could be assembled soon after Iraq acquired fissile \n     material. The French proposal may be the most intrusive \n     regime that Saddam would accept. Yet, France is asking the \n     wrong question; the issue is not what Saddam will accept, but \n     what will accomplish the goal of eliminating the threat of \n     Iraqi WMD. From this perspective, France's plan comes up \n     short.\n       France has also proposed that Saddam be permitted to use \n     oil export receipts as he wishes, subject only to the \n     restriction that he not import arms or dual-use technologies. \n     The practical effect of this proposal would be to allow \n     Saddam to reduce food and medicine imports to fund his \n     priorities. The French proposal would also eliminate the \n     current system under which all earnings from approved Iraqi \n     oil exports go into an escrow account abroad, and each \n     payment out of the account requires documentation showing for \n     what the funds are being used. The French would instead trust \n     Iraq to keep honest accounts and report accurately to the UN, \n     without diverting any money into clandestine accounts.\n       The U.S. Proposal. The U.S. government's January 14 \n     proposal to the Security Council focuses not on the \n     inspection system but instead on what can be done to \n     alleviate humanitarian suffering while sustaining sanctions. \n     The first element in the U.S. proposal would be to allow \n     Saddam to export as much oil as he wants. Such a step may be \n     a good way to win a propaganda victory without having any \n     practical effect, because the UN-imposed limit is so far \n     above what Iraq can produce. In the six months to November \n     1998, Iraq exported $3.04 billion through the oil-for-food \n     program, or less than 60 percent of the UN limit of $5.26 \n     billion. The practical constraint was not the UN limit, but \n     Iraq's production capacity.\n       The only way Iraq can produce more is if it can import \n     equipment needed to repair and modernize its oil industry. In \n     1998, the UN approved imports of $134 million worth of oil-\n     field equipment. A team from the Dutch firm Saybolt, hired by \n     the UN, visited Iraq in December 1998 to identify what more \n     is needed. The issue is whether to expedite approval of the \n     $300 million program that team recommended. A sticking point \n     has been Iraqi oil exports outside the oil-for-food program, \n     namely, shipments to Jordan (80,000 barrels a day of crude \n     and 16,000 barrels a day of oil products) and the smuggling \n     of oil products to Turkey and via Iranian waters (the amounts \n     vary from month to month, with the total averaging perhaps \n     50,000 barrels a day). The United States could adopt a tough \n     approach--for instance, insisting that Iraq not be allowed to \n     import oil equipment while illegal exports continue--but that \n     would run counter to the U.S. desire to expand Iraqi \n     humanitarian imports.\n       The second element in the U.S. proposal is to expedite \n     humanitarian deliveries and, for this purpose, allow Iraq to \n     borrow in order to import more. Yet, the basic problem with \n     the oil-for-food program is neither a lack of money nor an \n     excess of red tape; instead, the problem is that Saddam does \n     not care about the welfare of Iraqis. To generate more \n     pressure to end the sanctions. Saddam continues to hinder \n     international relief. For instance, the plan Iraq \n     submitted to the UN for the latest six-month relief \n     program would have provided insufficient protein; this \n     caused the UN to delay its approval for two weeks (from \n     November 29 until December 11) until Iraq agreed to an \n     extra $150 million for food. Clear proof that Saddam, not \n     UN restrictions, is responsible for Iraqi suffering can be \n     found in the detailed UN reports about the improving \n     living conditions in the Kurdish areas outside Saddam's \n     control, where the UN administers the oil-for-food program \n     directly rather than through the Iraqi government.\n       The fact is that Iraq has ample funds for food and \n     medicine. Under current procedures, Iraq will have the \n     resources to import at least $1.8 billion over the next six \n     months, even if prices for its oil stay at $9 per barrel and \n     even after the deductions for the Compensation Fund and UN \n     expenses. But even after the UN modification, Iraq's plan \n     calls for only $1.6 billion for humanitarian goods: $1.446 \n     billion for food, medicine, and water and sanitation \n     equipment, and $165 million for nutrition programs, education \n     needs and, in the Kurdish north, demining and resettling \n     refugees. Any extra money will go for activities that not all \n     would call humanitarian. The UN-approved plan authorizes \n     $1.135 billion for other purposes; $300 million for petroleum \n     equipment; $409 million for the electricity network; $126 \n     million for the telecommunications system; $120 million to \n     buy trucks, repair the railway system, and build food \n     warehouses; and $180 million for agricultural equipment, \n     including pesticides. The telecommunications system repairs \n     are presented as a way to coordinate food and medicine \n     deliveries, but they also allow Saddam to stay in touch with \n     his secret police and military commanders. To date, the \n     United States has used its veto in the Sanctions Committee to \n     block shipments of such dual-use items, even though such \n     items are authorized by the plan approved by the Secretary \n     General. Yet, as the January 14 U.S. proposal focuses on how \n     to increase imports, the United States may consider allowing \n     more questionable items.\n       The U.S. proposal also suggests letting Iraq raise money by \n     borrowing from the fund to compensate those whose property \n     was destroyed when Iraq occupied Kuwait. Eight years after \n     these people suffered a loss, none has received more than \n     $10,000. The Compensation Commission has approved two more \n     rounds of payments, mostly to recipients who will get only \n     $2,500 per claim, as soon as it has the funds available.\n       The Saudi Proposal. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah \n     has presented a plan that overlaps the U.S. strategy in key \n     areas, calling for retaining sanctions but abolishing\n\n[[Page S1122]]\n\n     the limit on how much oil Iraq can sell and making other \n     changes to speed humanitarian deliveries. It is also said to \n     call for revamping UNSCOM, with few details on what that \n     means (evidently not much change is proposed). Saudi Arabia \n     has lobbied for the plan vigorously at three meetings of the \n     Gulf Cooperation Council and two other inter-Arab sessions. \n     It is unusual for Saudi Arabia to be so bold at asserting \n     leadership in the region, and even more unusual for Saudi \n     Arabia to pursue the plan so tenaciously in the face of \n     opposition from those in the region who want to distance \n     themselves from the U.S.--British air strikes. Under the \n     direction of the foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faysal, the \n     Saudis have successfully brought on board Egypt, which was \n     initially skeptical.\n       The Saudi initiative underscores the convergence of U.S. \n     and Saudi interests on Iraq. Although Riyadh was widely \n     criticized in the United States for its reluctance to \n     participate in the December air campaign. Saudi policy is in \n     fact closely aligned with Washington's. For instance, the \n     political commentator of the official Saudi news agency \n     wrote. ``The Iraqi people deserve and need a revolution'' \n     against ``the tyrant of Baghdad,'' whereas in Egypt, another \n     Arab country whose ruler Saddam attacked, the government \n     confined itself to saying ``the Iraqi leadership is primarily \n     responsible for the Iraqi people's hardships.'' The \n     reassertion of leadership in the region by Saudi Arabia, if \n     sustained, would on many issues correspond well with U.S. \n     interests.\n       Although it is unlikely that the Saudis will be able to \n     convince enough Arab states to support their plan for the \n     January 24 meeting of Arab League foreign ministers to \n     endorse it openly, the United States should lend weight to \n     the Saudi diplomatic effort. The Saudi effort focuses Arab \n     attention on the issue most important for U.S. interests--how \n     to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi people--rather than on \n     the question raised by the French proposal, namely, how to \n     water down inspections so as to win Saddam's assent.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will ask the administration to take a different tact \nto tighten, rather than loosen, the Oil-for-Food Program, to veto U.N. \nplans that allow Saddam to use this money to finance nonhumanitarian \npurchases, and to strengthen oil interdiction and inspection \noperations, including adopting something like the ``no-fly'' zone with \na ``no-oil'' vessel zone. Only by taking these measures can the U.N. \nfinally cripple Saddam's regime and increase energy security for all \nAmericas.\n  If we cut off Saddam's oil supply, we will bring him to his knees. \nThat is the only way it will happen.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to comment on the \nDepartment of the Interior s Mineral Management Service proposed oil \nvaluation rule.\n  Earlier this week, speaking with regard to the Administration's FY \n2000 budget, Secretary Babbitt said, ``We have met, and talked, and \ntalked, and talked,'' about the proposed rule. But I submit that the \nonly talking done by MMS has been at industry and at Congress, not with \nthem. Mr. President, the proposed rule by MMS was unfair last year and \nit remains unfair.\n  Babbitt has declared that talks are ``over'' and that MMS is \ndetermined to issue its rule in June, when the Congressional moratorium \nexpires.\n  This is simply unconscionable. The domestic oil industry is on its \nknees right now. But, again, this action by Interior is symptomatic of \nAdministration attacks on the domestic energy industry.\n  The federal government should work to save marginal producers, not \nput them out of business. Yet that is just what Interior is doing by \nissuing an unfair royalty rule at a time when producers can least \nafford it.\n  I would ask Secretary Babbitt the following question: How many \nroyalties can a bankrupt industry pay? I would also ask him if this \nrule is truly about raising revenue, or is it another Administration \nscheme to drive petroleum producers out of business. After all, 100 \npercent of zero is zero.\n  For the record, Mr. President, I will be speaking to MMS and looking \ninto this flawed royalty rule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1119-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE PRESIDENT'S FY 2000 BUDGET\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come here today to talk about our \nNation's first investment in the next century: the budget for the year \n2000. I want to say how great it is that we are turning our attention \nto the issues that are important to America's families.\n  When I first came to Washington, DC, the deficit was $290 billion. We \nhad to make some very tough budget decisions to get the Nation's books \nback in balance. Now our economy is growing and it is strong. This \nyear, the Office of Management and Budget projects a surplus to be $79 \nbillion. That is the biggest surplus in American history. It hasn't \nbeen easy to get to this point and we still have a lot of work to do.\n  Now we have to use this opportunity to make critical investments in \nour Nation's senior citizens and in our children. We have an obligation \nto ensure the dignity of the previous generation and to prepare the \nnext generation for a successful future. The budget we have before the \nSenate will help us do that.\n  This budget keeps our commitment to save Social Security first. It \nwill set aside more than 60 percent of the surplus to extend the \nsolvency of the Social Security trust fund until 2055. And it takes \nimportant steps to protect older women who depend on Social Security, \nbut must continue to work to supplement their incomes. This budget will \nincrease their survivor's benefits after the deaths of their husbands \nand eliminate the earnings limitation.\n  This budget will strengthen Medicare and provide more stability. It \nalso gives assistance to the elderly and disabled who need long-term \ncare in their families by providing a $1,000 tax credit.\n  We have to also make education a top priority. This budget provides \ndesperately needed funds to fix our Nation's worn out schools and our \novercrowded classrooms. It provides tax credits to help States and \nlocal school districts build and renovate public schools, and it \ncontinues our commitment to hiring 100,000 new and well-trained \nteachers. In addition, it provides flexibility at the local level for \nschools to ensure all children receive a quality education, and it \ncalls for tough new accountability measures to hold schools and \nteachers to high standards.\n\n  This budget is by no means perfect. The funding for educating \nchildren with special needs is inadequate, and I will work to address \nthis inequity. The Federal Government has made a commitment to meet 40 \npercent of the cost of educating disabled children, but we have yet to \ncome close. As we work to improve our schools and raise our academic \nstandards, we must not leave disabled children behind.\n  I know that as we go through the budget process we will have our \ndisagreements, but I am looking forward to an open discussion of the \nissues and working together to accomplish a bipartisan agreement that \nserves the American people well.\n  This budget provides a real framework for action. I applaud the \nPresident's pledge to save Social Security and prepare for the \nchallenges of a new century. Now we must move forward. The clock is \nticking. It is time for us to work on the issues and the priorities of \nAmerica's families.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning).

Mr. President, the President has now given us his \nbudget--quite a remarkable document.\n  I remember when the President came to speak to the joint session and \nsaid, ``The era of big government is over.'' There was broad applause--\nnot only in the Chamber but around the country. Now we are confronted--\nit is not nearly as spot oriented or media driven--but it is sort of \nthe statement: ``The era of big government is over'' is over. He has \ntaken that pronouncement and absolutely quashed it in this new budget--\ndriven it in the ground never to be seen again. It was a 77-minute \nspeech,\n\n[[Page S1123]]\n\nand it outlined 77 new Government spending proposals that amounted to \napproximately $5 billion in new Government spending per minute. I am \nglad the speech wasn't longer.\n  In the President's budget, according to the New York Times, he \nproposed 81 separate tax increases totaling $82 billion over the next 5 \nyears. The effect of that would be to nearly nullify the limited tax \nreduction that the last Congress finally fashioned with this \nadministration for which there was an enormous celebration on the White \nHouse lawn. This would virtually eliminate it.\n  The administration will describe these as ``user fees.'' That is not \nnew. Both parties have used that. But when you look down at what that \nmeans, it is quite interesting, Mr. President:\n  $1.1 billion in airline fees. That means all traveling America is \ngoing to get a tax increase, if you ever get on an airplane.\n  Or $504 million in food inspection fees. Who is going to pay that? \nAnybody who goes into the grocery store and buys a quarter-pound of \nground beef, processed chicken, or milk; in other words, everybody.\n  Then we have $200 million in new health care fees on providers and \nplans and doctors--no, not on providers, health plans, and doctors. \nThat goes to patients. Patients will pay that.\n  So if you are buying food in the grocery store, if you are part of \ntraveling America, if you have to go see your doctor, to a hospital, \nyou are going to be the recipient of this $1.1 billion in new taxes.\n  Now, he said there is tax relief in his budget. Well, the only way an \nAmerican taxpayer would see one cent of President Clinton's so-called \ntax relief is if they agree to buy a solar panel or buy an electric car \nor engage in some other sanctioned Government behavior--this in the \nface of $800 billion of non-Social Security surpluses that have been \ngenerated by our economy. The direct beneficiary of balanced budgets \nand financial discipline and disciplined spending has produced a \nvigorous economy which has produced massive surpluses for the first \ntime in modern history, but this administration could not resist spend, \nspend, spend and could not find it in any frame to suggest, well, maybe \nsome of this should be returned to the working people of America.\n  Mr. President, I see that we have been joined by Senator Grams of \nMinnesota to speak on the subject, and I am going to yield up to 10 \nminutes to Senator Grams of Minnesota to continue our presentation on \nthis budget.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the Senator from Georgia \nputting this effort together. I think it gets the information out about \nwhat this budget really does and does not entail.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to make a few observations about the \nPresident's millennium budget.\n  After a brief review, my conclusion is this:\n  First, in his quest to continue to offer something for everyone, the \nPresident's budget offers a lot of smoke and mirrors and a lot of \naccounting gimmicks.\n  Secondly, this budget is chock full of new spending, earmarks, and \ndozens of new ways for Washington to spend the tax dollars earned by \nworking Americans. It is a blueprint for an even bigger federal \ngovernment.\n  Thirdly, while I agree that the 62 percent of the projected surplus \nthat belongs to Social Security should be reserved for Social Security, \nI do not agree with what the President seeks to do with the 38 percent \nof the surplus that represents tax overpayments.\n  He chooses to spend the vast majority of it and leaves only pennies \non the dollar for very minor, tightly targeted tax relief plan that he \nwas offered in the budget.\n  His plan is basically only token tax cuts that sound big, but the \nbottom line is it provides little or no tax relief.\n  Fourth, he proposes new taxes and user fees and takes tobacco \nsettlement money from the states. Can you believe it--in times of \nsurplus, he actually proposes to raise taxes even higher, and his \nbudget spends the Social Security surplus he claims to wall off.\n  Finally, the President's budget does not save Social Security from \nbankruptcy.\n  Let me be a little more specific.\n  You don't have to look further than the way in which the President's \nbudget deals with spending caps to determine if this is an honest \nbudget.\n  As you know, President Clinton has repeatedly broken the statutory \nspending caps in the past to spend more for new and expanded government \nprograms. Last year alone, the President and the Congress spent over \n$22 billion of the surplus for alleged ``emergency spending'' in the \nOmnibus spending legislation.\n  Nearly $9.3 billion in regular appropriations was shifted into future \nbudgets. In my judgment, both of these efforts broke the caps, and that \nis why I opposed the Omnibus bill.\n  Also, I wish that Congress and the President could be as creative in \ncutting spending and cutting taxes as the President is in finding ways \nto spend more money for more programs.\n  According to the CBO, last year's budget--when alleged emergency \nspending is included--exceeded the spending caps by $45 billion. Even \nwithout counting the emergency spending, we still exceeded the spending \ncaps by $29 billion.\n  Last year's irresponsible spending has made the spending caps even \ntighter for this year. In order to stay within the caps as required by \nlaw, we must cut spending by $28 billion. This would require an \napproximately 5-percent across-the-board reduction of this year's \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Instead of cutting spending to comply with the law, President Clinton \nactually proposes significant spending increases to expand many of the \nexisting programs and create many more new programs. These spending \nincreases total over $130 billion. Yet the President claims his budget \ndoes not break the spending caps.\n  How can President Clinton have it both ways? How can he have his cake \nand eat it, too? It is simple. He does it by budget gimmicks.\n  The President imposes new user fees and raises existing ones by $21 \nbillion, and then counts these taxes as ``negative spending'' rather \nthan as revenues.\n  He also devotes presumed receipts from the state settlements with the \ntobacco companies and a 55 cents-per-pack federal tax on cigarettes to \na variety of programs to avoid the spending caps.\n  However, it is far from certain these taxes will be accepted by \nCongress, so what we have is new spending without reasonable offsets.\n  The President also reclassifies the increased discretionary spending \nfor expanded military retirement benefits, again, as mandatory \nspending. In addition, President Clinton speeds up the FCC's collection \nof spectrum auction payments.\n  Like last year, the President has again shifted some program \nfunding--such as the Northeast multispecies fishery--into so-called \n``emergency spending'' to further bust the budget. And he has severely \nunder-funded some major programs such as Medicare, knowing Congress \nwill restore the funds.\n  These decisions by the President are troubling. The more I review \nthis budget, the more questions I have about how the President can \npropose so much new spending and claim that he will not break the \nbudget.\n  President Clinton proposes to funnel 62 percent of the projected \nbudget surplus which represents the Social Security surplus to the \nSocial Security Trust Funds, 15 percent to Medicare, 12 percent to the \nso-called Universal Saving Accounts, and another 11 percent to increase \nother government spending.\n  The OMB estimates that we would have a $12 billion on-budget \ndeficit--that is without. Social Security excess Surpluses--in FY 2000. \nThis means we don't have any on-budget surplus to spend this year. All \nof the $117 billion unified budget surplus is, in fact, Social Security \nsurplus.\n  I don't know how I can say this more clearly. Despite the President's \npromise to save Social Security first, he is proposing to spend all of \nthe Social Security surplus.\n  Moreover, not only has the President manipulated the numbers, but he \nhas also included enormous increases in existing programs and created \nmany new programs, including entitlement programs.\n  Without counting government user fees, the actual size of the \ngovernment has reached $2 trillion, not $1.8 trillion, as the President \nclaimed in his budget.\n\n[[Page S1124]]\n\n I am sure there is much more hidden spending and hidden taxes in this \n2,600 page budget.\n  With all of these spending and tax increases, President Clinton fails \nto provide any meaningful tax relief for working Americans. His \ntargeted tax cuts reward only a few, with too few dollars. And again, \nin times of surplus, the President is proposing to raise taxes.\n  Now, I would like to just show a little cartoon that I brought with \nme that I think kind of explains this. As the cartoon suggests, \nPresident Clinton doesn't want to give any of the non-Social Security \nsurplus to hard-working, overtaxed Americans because he believes he can \nspend it better on his own priorities. As the cartoon says: It seems we \nhave grossly overcharged you, so let me explain how we intend to spend \nthe money.\n  When you go to a restaurant and overpay the bill, you expect to get \nthe change back. Here the taxpayers have overpaid, and I think they can \nrightfully expect that they should get the change back and the surplus \nshould go to the taxpayers and not to the bureaucracies in Washington.\n  In fact, satisfying the President's spending appetite would squeeze \nan additional $80 billion from working Americans as tax increases. So, \nin times of surpluses, tax increases.\n  Mr. President, Americans today are taxed at the highest level in \nhistory, with nearly 40 percent of a typical family budget going to pay \ntaxes on the Federal, State, and local level.\n  They tax it when you earn it. Tax it again when you save it. Tax it \nagain when you spend it. Tax it again when you invest it. And tax it \nyet again when you die.\n  No wonder Americans feel overtaxed!\n  But under the President's budget, the Government will collect more \ntaxes from working Americans in the next five years. Total taxes will \nreach over $10 trillion. Federal tax revenues will grow faster than \nspending, consuming 20.7 percent of GDP, a historic high since World \nWar II.\n  This is wrong. More spending and more Government is not the answer. \nThe answer lies in tax cuts that return power to the taxpayers and \nleave a little more of their own money in their pocket at the end of \nthe day.\n  That is why I, along with Senator Roth, introduced S. 3, the Tax Cuts \nfor All Americans Act, the one bill that will do the most to help \nAmerica's working families. Our plan will cut the personal tax rate for \neach American by ten percent across the board.\n  The broad-based tax cut is simple and fair. It is pro-family and pro-\ngrowth. If President Clinton wanted to make a strong statement for \nworking Americans, he should have made this broad-based tax cut the \ncenterpiece of his budget.\n  My last point is that despite his claim to have made Social Security \nsolvent, and despite the fact that he will pour general funds into \nSocial Security, Mr. Clinton's budget does not and will not save it. \nThis budget does nothing to address its long-term unfunded liabilities.\n  In what Chairman Greenspan has called a very ``dangerous'' approach, \nit has the Government invest any surpluses in the stock market for \nSocial Security.\n  In my home state of Minnesota, taxpayers are already expressing their \nfrustration with the notion that, in the case of retirement security, \nWashington knows best.\n  Let me quote one thing here. Patrick Garofalo of Apple Valley wrote \nthe following letter in yesterday's St. Paul Pioneer Press:\n       I am a big boy. I no longer live with my parents. The \n     government trusts me to own a gun.\n       It trusts me to choose my state and congressional elected \n     officials. It trusts me to make decisions about the welfare \n     of both of my children. If it trusts me to make these \n     important decisions, why does not it trust me to decide how I \n     want to save for my retirement?\n       Please don't tax me to death while you ``help'' me. Let me \n     keep my money. I will decide where and with whom to invest my \n     nest egg.\n\n  I could not have said it better myself.\n  Mr. President, the Administration's budget will not meet the \nchallenges of a new millennium but rather lead us down the path of \nfiscal disaster. Congress can and will do better.\n  We will produce a budget that preserves and protects the Social \nSecurity surplus; we will give the non-Social Security surplus back to \ntaxpayers as major tax relief and debt reduction; we will have a \nblueprint that leads this nation into the 21st century.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Georgia yielding me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, and I now yield up to 5 minutes of our time to the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia. I have \njust a few brief thoughts on this budget that has been submitted to us. \nThe President's budget says we are going to have about a $4 trillion \nsurplus over the next 15 years. He has said, and we agree, that we \nshould fix Social Security first. We are going to do that. He believes \nthat we ought to set 62 percent of the surplus aside for fixing Social \nSecurity. Again, we agree, because that is about what Social Security \nreceipts are provided.\n  But when we got his budget message and when we heard his State of the \nUnion, we didn't see a fix to Social Security. We saw new gimmicks, \nfinancial gimmicks, borrowing more money. And under this plan that he \nhas presented, while we are supposedly running these surpluses that \nwill amount to $4 trillion, we are going to have to raise the debt \nceiling within a couple of years because he is issuing more bonds. We \nare going to borrow our way into solvency for Social Security. Nobody \nhas explained yet how that is going to work. But it is clear that he \nhas not proposed any responsible reform of the Social Security system \nto make sure it is there. We in Congress are going to have to develop a \nplan. I believe we will. It is going to take some of the surplus, 62 \npercent. I think that we must do that because we owe that not only to \nthose who are retired now and those who are about to retire, but to the \nbaby boomers and others coming along who want to see retirement \nsecurity.\n  So we have 38 percent. What do we do with the remaining 38 percent of \nthe surplus? I have spent a lot of time. I traveled around the State of \nMissouri many, many days listening to and talking with people, telling \nthem: We finally got that budget deficit monster slain. What should we \ndo with the surplus we are going to start running? And they had two \nvery strong ideas. They said, No. 1, pay off the debt. We started to \npay off the debt. If it hadn't been for the President's having invested \nsome $20-plus billion in spending last year, we would have paid off $20 \nbillion more.\n  Frankly, around this place there is nothing quite so tempting as an \nunspent surplus. If you don't return it to the taxpayers, it is going \nto get spent. We already have a historically high tax rate as part of \nour gross domestic product, the highest it has been since the end of \nWorld War II. And we are continuing to take more and more money. We \nneed to have tax relief. That is the other thing that the people of \nMissouri say: We want tax relief; lower, simpler, flatter taxes.\n  Small businesses spend 5 percent of what they take in just figuring \nout how much they are going to have to pay in taxes. That is before \nthey pay taxes. It is too complicated. It is too high. It discourages \neconomic activity. Those who made fun of the capital gains tax relief \nand objected to it now have to admit that reducing capital gains \nbrought more economic activity and brought a tremendous increase in \ncapital gains revenue. If we give families and small businesses the \nopportunity to keep some of their money, do you know what? They can \nspend it better than we can in Washington, and that is what I propose \nwe do.\n  But the President is not content with a $4 trillion surplus. He wants \nto increase Federal Government revenues by raising taxes. And on top of \nthat, he is going to spend it all, he is going to spend more of it, he \nis going to spend $100 billion in new spending. He busts the cap. He \neven raids the tobacco settlements from the States because he has so \nmany good ideas on how to spend it.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not believe the people of America want those good \nideas. It is unbelievable, $4 trillion in\n\n[[Page S1125]]\n\nsurplus yet every dollar of it spent, then more taxes are added. This \nis a classic example of the Federal ``Father Knows Best,'' requiring \nthe States, localities, and most of all the families, the working men \nand women in America, to play ``Mother May I?''\n  Let's take a look at education, something I think is a top priority, \nand the President says it is a top priority, too. It is about that \npoint where we diverge 180 degrees. The President wants to be your \nlocal school superintendent. Do you know, we have over 763 Federal \neducation programs. The system is not working now. We have too much \nFederal bureaucracy, too much Federal red tape. Yesterday the President \ntold the school board members who were in town from school boards all \nacross the country, he said, ``Listen to what they are saying in the \nschools.'' I have. Do you know what they are saying? Do you know what \neducators and the administrators and school board members are saying? \n``We have too much Federal regulation and dictates. We spend too much \ntime on misplaced Federal priorities.''\n  That is why I want, and I think my colleagues want, to return dollars \ndirectly to the classroom. Do not run it through the bureaucracy in \nWashington, DC. Don't even run it through the State bureaucracies. It \nis the school districts that have to make the decisions. They are the \nones that know the kids' names. They are the ones that know the \nstrengths of the kids. They are the ones that know the challenges they \nface. Let them make the decisions and take the Federal handcuffs off of \nlocal educators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for 1 more minute?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 1 more minute to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. One final item I need to get in. Last year, we worked very \nhard for a Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century, or TEA 21. I \nled the fight with Chairman John Chafee and Chairman John Warner to \nmake sure we put the trust back in trust fund; that is, we told the \nAmerican people that we would send back, for highways, the money in the \ntrust fund as it increased. In this budget he proposes more boutique \nprograms. He wants to go back on the promise we made last year. We have \ngreat highway needs and there is absolutely no reason to get more \nFederal programs when it is the States who need to build the highways. \nWe need to start over again on transportation and education and make \nsome sense out of this budget.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Missouri. I now yield up to 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  I wish to join my colleagues in expressing our deep concern at this \nadministration's misleading and potentially damaging budget.\n  Now that we have finally gotten our fiscal house in order, turning \nhuge deficits into significant surpluses, I am troubled, as a lot of \nour colleagues are, that the administration is seeking to turn the \nclock back to the bad old days of tax and spend that got us in \nfinancial trouble in the first place.\n  I think the Senator from Missouri very effectively outlined some of \nthe inadequacies of this budget.\n  This budget includes $1.7 trillion in new Government spending, with \nthe potential of trillions more, despite the President's agreement to \nset budget caps. And despite the President's frequent calls to save \nSocial Security first, it does nothing to save this crucial program.\n  Finally, this budget includes no significant tax cut for the hard-\nworking American families who brought us out of the age of deficits and \ninto the present age of surplus. With the $4.5 trillion in anticipated \nsurpluses, this administration could not find--in its budget, or in its \nheart--the wherewithal to give anything back to the American people, \nand that, Mr. President, is simply shameful.\n  I know my colleagues and I will be speaking a great deal in the \ncoming weeks about the need for tax cuts, and I know the Presiding \nOfficer will be one of those speaking often about this topic. But \ntoday, I want to focus on one particular aspect of the President's \nbudget that would do great damage to our system of Government and to \nour States, my State of Michigan in particular.\n  Last November, 46 States and the tobacco companies reached a \nsettlement in their long-running litigation. The Federal Government \nneither initiated nor helped the States financially in these suits. Yet \nnow, the Clinton administration wants to divert $18.9 billion of the \nsettlement to its own uses.\n  The Federal Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, wants to \nseize this money under legislation allowing it to recoup Medicaid \noverpayments. But no Medicaid moneys were allocated under the tobacco \nsettlement. This seizure is a raw exercise of Federal power, dangerous \nto our liberties and our form of Government.\n  In addition, the administration's actions promise costly litigation \nand first hits those least able to fend for themselves: State Medicaid \npatients whose funding would be seized by HCFA.\n  Of course, the administration claims that it will use the State's \nmoneys to benefit everybody. Once again, this administration believes \nit is better able to spend money than are those actually entitled to \nit; in this case, the States.\n  A number of States already have acted in reliance on the tobacco \nsettlement, putting forward proposals that will greatly benefit their \nconstituents. For example, in my State of Michigan, Governor John \nEngler has proposed to endow a merit award trust fund with Michigan's \nshare of the settlement, at least a portion of that settlement.\n  Under this program, every Michigan high school graduate who masters \nreading, writing, math, and science will receive a Michigan merit \naward, a $2,500 scholarship that can be used for further study at a \nMichigan school of that student's choice. Another $500 would be \navailable for seventh and eighth grade students who pass their State \ntests, bringing the total available for higher education in Michigan to \n$3,000 for students who work hard and learn the basic skills needed to \nmove on to higher education.\n  We need programs like Michigan's to help kids do well in school and \nget ahead in life. The Federal Government should be learning from these \nkinds of programs. It should not be taking money out of the pockets of \nMichigan's young people to put into the pockets of Washington \nbureaucrats.\n  We must protect the rights and the people of our States by seeing to \nit the tobacco settlement money stays where it belongs and where it \nwill do the most good--in the States.\n  That, Mr. President, is, in my judgment, one of the many inadequacies \nin the President's budget. I certainly intend to work very hard here in \nthe months ahead to make sure these tobacco settlement dollars go to \nthe States where the priorities can be set that make the most sense to \nthe people of the States. They are the ones who fought this litigation \nand won it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan, and \nI now yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \ntime, and I appreciate his organizing this discussion of the \nPresident's budget, because it has some very serious problems, even \nthough we are in superb fiscal times now and it appears the President \nhas put forward a budget which will create for us into the future some \nfiscal problems of an enormous extent. Many of these relate to his so-\ncalled ``resolution'' of the Social Security issue. Let's talk a few \nnumbers to begin with.\n  What the President has proposed in Social Security does virtually \nnothing to address the underlying problem of Social Security. The \nunderlying problem of Social Security, of course, is we have the post-\nwar baby boom generation that begins retiring in the year 2008, and \nthat generation is so large in\n\n[[Page S1126]]\n\nphysical numbers that it overwhelms the capacity of the younger \ngenerations to support it. Has the President addressed that? No.\n  What the President has done is put forward a major accounting gimmick \nwhich is, basically, a proposal that has no substantive effect on the \nunderlying problem, but gives them the capacity, through bookkeeping, \nto claim that they have addressed the problem.\n  The President has proposed that we take the present surplus, which is \nprojected in the Social Security fund, of about $2.3 trillion and keep \nthat in the Social Security fund. And then the President has proposed a \nbrand new commitment from the general fund to the Social Security fund, \na new bookkeeping entry which amounts to new debt of another $2.8 \ntrillion. The practical effect of that, of course, is that nothing \nhappens. But the political effect of it is that the President can claim \nthat by making this bookkeeping entry, he is extending the life of the \ntrust fund for another 8 years or so.\n  Let me try to explain it through this pie chart, because it is a \ncomplicated little shell game. It is not a little shell game, it is the \nbiggest shell game ever played in the history of this country, \nactually.\n  This is the spending which is projected relative to the surplus over \nthe next 15 years. There is $2.3 trillion for Social Security in the \nPresident's proposal: $700 billion for Medicare, $500 billion for new \nUSA accounts, and $500 billion of new spending items. Notice there is \nno tax cut in here for Americans. He decided to skip that for the next \n15 years, but that is another issue other Members will talk to. \nEssentially, that is how he spends the $4.4 trillion surplus, which is \nprojected for the next 15 years.\n  However, in his accounting process, he also spends another $2.8 \ntrillion, which is these new notes that he credits to Social Security. \nWhy does he do that? He does it essentially because he wants to claim \nhe has expanded the size of the Social Security trust fund so he can \nextend this life expectancy out. But this doesn't exist. This is a \nbookkeeping event. What it does do is it creates a huge new debt which \nwill have to be paid by later generations to the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  The practical effect of that debt is that he will be increasing the \ntax obligations necessary to support the Social Security trust fund as \nwe move into the later years by huge numbers.\n  Beginning in the year 2025, it will take an extra $360 billion in \norder to maintain the trust fund, and this will have to come from the \ngeneral fund, which means it will have to come through tax increases. \nThis is in order to meet the obligations created by this new $2.8 \ntrillion bookkeeping entry.\n  In the year 2035, that number jumps to $786 billion. That is just 1 \nyear, coming out of the general fund into the Social Security trust \nfund. The implications of this are staggering. It moves up to a figure \nof $2.07 trillion--that is a 1-year number--in the year 2055. The \nimplication is staggering, because it does two things.\n  First, it creates this huge pressure on the general fund which \ninevitably leads to a huge tax increase. Secondly, it creates a whole \nnew dynamic for the Social Security system. The Social Security system \nhas never gone into the general fund in order to support the Social \nSecurity system. That is not the concept of the Social Security system. \nThe Social Security system has always been a trust fund. This creates \nthe Social Security fund as a fund that has a drain basically on the \ngeneral fund.\n\n  This all comes down to basically, in my opinion, sham accounting. And \nyou don't have to take my word for it. Ironically, in a spurt of \nhonesty and truth in accounting, the President's submission to the \nCongress of its budget had this language at page 336. I think it is \nworth reading.\n\n       (The Social Security Trust Fund) balances are available to \n     finance future benefit payments and other trust fund \n     expenditures--but only in a bookkeeping sense. . ..\n\n  So somebody at least down at OMB had the integrity to acknowledge \nwhat they were actually doing. They were creating a bookkeeping event \nfor the purposes of claiming an extension of the Social Security trust \nfund.\n\n       They do not consist of real economic assets that can be \n     drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are \n     claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be \n     financed by raising taxes--\n\n  Which is the item I pointed out here, the trillion dollars in the \nyear 2045, for example--\n\n     borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other \n     expenditures. The existence of large trust fund balances, \n     therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the \n     Government's ability to pay benefits.\n\n  If I had written a critique of what the President proposed, I could \nnot have done a better job. Somebody on his staff had the integrity to \ntruly write the critique, and by mistake, I suspect, they slipped it \ninto the President's budget submission. I am sure they are upset now \nthat it is in there. But it is an accurate statement of what they have \ndone. This is a bookkeeping entry, the practical effect of which will \ncreate huge outyear chaos.\n  Why is that? Common sense tells you why it is. You can't address the \nproblem of the Social Security issue with mirrors. You can't say that a \nproblem that is created by having a huge generation retire is going to \nbe solved by having a bookkeeping event occur in the budgeting \nprocesses of the Federal Government. But that is what this President \nwould like us to believe.\n  In fact, if you look at the President's proposal on Social Security, \nas he put it forward, it has absolutely no substantive impact on the \nunderlying problem. He first uses this double-counting event, which \ndoes nothing--in fact, it potentially aggravates the problem \ndramatically in the outyears --and, secondly, suggests we should take \nthe trust fund and invest some portion of it, 15 percent of it, under \nFederal management in the marketplace, which will create, potentially, \nhavoc, basically a nationalization of our stock market, potentially \nhavoc in our stock portfolios throughout the country, as Chairman \nGreenspan has correctly pointed out. And then he proposes two specific \nthings to do, both of which cost more money. He proposes we raise the \nearning limits, which is a good idea; and he proposes we address the \nproblem of elderly women who are at the low-income levels, which is a \ngood idea. But neither of those help the Social Security solvency \nissue. They actually aggravate the Social Security solvency issue.\n  So his proposal on Social Security is the largest shell game ever put \nforward in the history of the world and does absolutely nothing to \nsubstantively improve the problems which we have with Social Security \nas we go into the next 20 to 30 years. And those problems are huge.\n  A number of us on our side of the aisle--and I notice Senator \nDomenici is here--have put forward proposals which are substantive, \nwhich are legitimate, which address the fact that this is a \ndemographic-driven event and which must be addressed. But we can't move \nforward with our proposals if the President is going to be so \nirresponsible with his proposal. The fact is his proposal is used \nprimarily for the purposes of pushing another political agenda. Trying \nto lower the ability of this Congress to address tax cuts is the \nprimary political agenda behind this proposal, in my opinion. It does \nnothing as a constructive voice on the issue of Social Security and \nSocial Security reform; and thus it is a great disappointment. And I \nthink the White House is going to go back to its drawing board and come \nback with another idea, another proposal, if it expects the legacy of \nthis President to be a correction of the most significant fiscal policy \nwhich faces this country, which is the Social Security crisis in which \nwe are headed.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for his courtesy.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New \nHampshire, not only for his presentation today but for all of his work \non this great question before the country embraced in Social Security.\n  I now yield up to 7 minutes to our distinguished colleague, the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, thank you. And let me thank Senator \nCoverdell for chairing the special order today to talk about a very \nimportant debate which this country is now just beginning to engage in; \nand that is, the debate over the Federal budget for the\n\n[[Page S1127]]\n\nnext fiscal year and for the near future of the next 10 years.\n  The reason I say it is an important debate--and I associate myself \nwith the remarks of the Senator from New Hampshire--if not the most \nimportant debate we will become involved in in this decade is that it \nis long term. What we do in this budget sets a trend line, clearly \nestablishes a standard of performance for how Government operates and \nhow taxpayers are treated in our country.\n  So for the next few moments I am going to dwell on that, because I \ncan't deal with the specifics of this budget yet, not in the detail \nthat the Senator from New Mexico, who is the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, is going to in a few moments. He is the expert. He teaches \nme what is in this budget. And I listen very closely.\n  But let me tell you, there are some fundamentals that I hope the \npublic will come to recognize as this debate goes on, that within the \nbudget surplus there are two surpluses. About 62 percent of that \nsurplus is generated by Social Security tax, Social Security tax \nrevenue. And that 62 percent the President of the United States and the \nCongress of the United States agree ought to be dedicated to reforming \nand strengthening the Social Security system. So if you will, that is \nsurplus I.\n  There is a second surplus, and that is a surplus that is generated by \nother taxes, including the taxpayers' income tax. And that represents \nabout 38 percent of the Federal budget. It is on that percentage that \nthis Republican Senate at this moment is proposing, amongst other \nthings, a significant tax cut for the taxpayers of the country.\n  I am very proud to stand on the floor, along with a lot of my \ncolleagues, and say that a decade and a half ago we began an argument \nto force our Government to balance its budget. We were told at that \ntime, in the early 1980s, that wasn't going to happen, just wasn't \ngoing to happen in my lifetime. In fact, I had an elder statesman in \nthe House--I was serving in the House --after I delivered this House \nspeech on balancing the budget on the floor, tap me on the shoulder, \nand he said, ``Kid, you ain't gonna live long enough to see a federally \nbalanced budget.'' And then he went on to say, ``Why would you want to \ndo it? Look what you can do with Government spending to expand the \neconomy, to create all these neat things.'' And I looked at him and \nsmiled and said, ``To reassure your reelection.''\n  Well, that was less than 20 years ago. In fact, that was about 14 \nyears ago when that statement was made. And today the budget is \nbalanced. Today we are now arguing over how to spend the potential \ntrillions of dollars of surplus that will be generated by that budget.\n  When I was arguing the balanced budget idea in the early 1980s, along \nwith a lot of my colleagues, there were some fundamental reasons why we \nwere doing it: No. 1, to control Government. Because we saw an all-\nincreasingly expanding, powerful Federal Government as a damper on the \nrights and freedoms of the citizens of our country. More Government, \nless freedom; more programs, less control, less opportunity on the part \nof the average citizen. So that was one of the reasons. The other \nreason was to turn this economy on.\n  In all fairness, Mr. President, I don't think any of us ever knew how \nmuch you could turn the economy of this country on if you did just two \nthings: If you balanced the Federal budget, that is called fiscal \npolicy, and if you kept monetary policy in line with it; and if you \nrewarded the workers by allowing them to keep more of their own money \ncalled taxes.\n  We have been able to do all of those things in combination. And what \nhappened? We turned this economy on. We fueled it in a way that was \nreally beyond our imagination.\n  In fact, a lot of us are looking at this strong economy today and \nsaying, how can it last? Why is it so strong even in light of all the \nthings that are going on around us in a world economy that is dragging \nit down to some extent.\n  The reason it is strong is because the Federal budget is balanced, \nbecause monetary policy is in line with the Federal Reserve. Now the \nnext step is to keep it strong and even stronger and to take overtaxed \nAmerican taxpayers and make sure that they keep an ever larger part of \ntheir hard-earned money. That is the real difference between what the \nPresident proposes and what we are talking about.\n  Oh, yes, we have the fundamental disagreements on Social Security \nreform that the Senator from New Hampshire, who is now presiding, has \njust talked about, and those are fundamental differences. But with that \n38 percent that is left, the President plans to spend it all in one \nform or another. In fact, if you listened to his State of the Union in \nhis budget message, he was like somebody handing out gifts in the form \nof government programs. A little here and a little there, going to \nbenefit this, going to benefit that, going to expand here, and in the \nend, the world is going to be a happier place, and the President is \ngoing to be a more popular guy. Or so it went.\n  What he didn't say was that he actually was growing the potential of \na Federal debt and deficit in combination again and that he was not \noffering substantive reform in the long term that would really benefit \nSocial Security recipients, and most importantly, the young people of \nour country.\n  There is another premise with Social Security: No matter what we do \nwe are going to protect the elderly. But what we have to do is assure \nthat the young people of our country have a good investment in the \nfuture because Social Security today for a young person entering the \nwork force is a lousy investment. There is very little returned for \ntheir money. So those are some of the dynamics of the debate at hand.\n  Mr. President, let me close with this thought--and I believe it \nsincerely, as somebody who has fought for a balanced budget, as \nsomebody who is proud to see a balanced budget gained, and as somebody \nwho has been very surprised over the strength of an economy that can be \ngenerated by the balanced budget and good, sound, monetary policy. It \nis simply this: I believe the President squanders the reward of a \nbalanced budget. I believe the President squanders the hard work that \nwe have done here to assure that the taxpayers of our country can have \nback even more of their hard-earned money. He not only squanders it in \nbad ideas, he squanders it by simply creating a greater liability on \nfuture earnings of our government or future taxes by our citizens.\n  We are standing at the threshold of a unique time in our Nation's \nhistory, a true opportunity to fix Social Security, to reform it, and \nto change it into a positive investment for the young people of our \ncountry while still continuing to hold safe and reward the elderly of \nour country for their hard-earned days, but also to assure long-term \neconomic growth in our country that keeps our work forces working, that \nkeeps our taxpayers happy, and that strengthens our country among other \nnations in the world.\n  That is an opportunity that can be accomplished with this budget. \nThat is why I think what we are standing for today is the right \ndirection and course for this country to take.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho. I \nyield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici of New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Coverdell very much. I hope I will not \nuse 10 minutes because there are other Senators here.\n  Let me say to the distinguished occupant of the Chair, Senator Gregg, \nI was here when he made his remarks. I think the most salient aspect of \nthose remarks--while I agree with almost all of it--the most salient \narea can be formulated into a question.\n  My question is this: For at least 10 years we have been struggling in \nthis land with commission after commission, study group after study \ngroup trying to tell us how we could repair Social Security so that it \nwill be available in the next millennium, because of the terrible \nimpact on that Social Security fund, of the actual demographics of \nAmerica, and the baby boomers hitting pension time. Now, does it seem \nlogical that after all of that discussion that essentially we don't \nhave to do anything to save Social Security?\n  I asked the question so I can answer it because I believe everybody \nthat is working so hard at it would say the answer is, no; you can't \nfix Social Security by doing nothing for or to or in any way reform or \nchange it.\n\n[[Page S1128]]\n\n  Now the only thing the President of the United States did in this \nbudget is make a proposal that will never pass the Congress, that a \ntiny piece of this so-called surplus that belongs to Social Security be \ninvested in the equities market of America by a government-controlled \nboard, who would be subject to all kinds of pressures that would \ndistort the market of America. I don't say that singularly. The \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board has used far stronger words than \nthese: that it won't work, that it will be detrimental. So in a sense, \nthat is the only thing proposed.\n  Now, I am going to lower my voice and say, on the other hand, the \nPresident is going to say that he transfers some of the surplus of \nAmerica to the Social Security fund and it is there and thereby it \nextends the life. But the Senator has so adequately stated, What is \nbeing transferred? In the end, what is being transferred is going to \nresult in debts that have to be paid by somebody, some time, because we \nhave neither enhanced Social Security by investing a significant \nportion in the equities market, nor have we, in any way, if one seeks \nto reform it otherwise, made any changes to it except to add to it.\n  Frankly, that is a missed opportunity. I think I might say it is a \nmissed opportunity, perhaps, because of the clamor that we are in today \npolitically.\n  I think last year the President was on the right track. He had \nmeetings and bipartisan seminars and everybody went. They held one in \nAlbuquerque, NM. And forthrightly, the President used to say to people \nwho opposed investing it in the equities market, in as safe a way as \npossible, Why should the Social Security trust fund yield so much less \nto the Social Security recipients than investing in other pension \nplans? He used to ask that question when people were against investing \nit. What happened, however, as this budget came rolling through under \nthe political turmoil that exists, the President sent us nothing but \nsome words that say we hope we can work together.\n  I hope we can, too, because I think if we did it would be a far \ndifferent proposal than what is in this budget, which is borderline \nnothing with reference to Social Security.\n  There are so many other things to talk about, but I am only going to \ntalk about three and do it very quickly. Fellow Republicans, \nconservatives and moderate conservatives in America, this budget \npresents the best opportunity for those who think conservatively and \nRepublican and moderately conservative, to present a basic issue that \ndisagrees with the President and those who follow him in the Democratic \nParty.\n  My friend from Idaho, it is basically this: When you have a very \nlarge overpayment by the taxpayers of America, an unexpected tax burden \nthat yields billions of dollars that were unexpected, that we don't \nneed, that are now building up a surplus, what do you do with it? And \none approach is to save it. The President says he is being conservative \nand saving it. But I add to that, saving it so it can be spent. And in \nsome instances, spending it under the President's budget or give it \nback to the American taxpayers in proportion to how they paid it to us.\n  That falls simply under the rubric of a tax cut. I have explained it \nas well as I could as to why the time has arrived. Why is this an \nopportunity to debate a difference? Because if you don't give it back \nto the taxpayer, no matter what contortions you go through about \ntransferring it to trust accounts with new IOUs and the like, it is \navailable to be spent, and I am not going to be anymore positive about \nthat, other than to ask another question: Does anyone think that that \nkind of surplus sitting around is going to really stay sitting around, \nor is it going to do something else? I submit that the President is on \na path to showing us already that it is going to be spent.\n\n  My last one--I will do one additional one--is this: Anybody in this \nChamber or across this land who has heard the President speak and has \nheard his budget presented, answer this question for me: Did the \nPresident propose spending some of the surplus which he is going to put \ninto Medicare? Did he propose spending it for prescription drugs? \nFrankly, I surmise that already, among those who are interested, 95 \npercent would answer that question that he proposed spending it for \nprescription drugs. But that would be inconsistent with saving it, \nright? So, as a matter of fact, if you read his speech attentively and \nlisten to two of his witnesses--OMB and Treasury--it is now obvious \nthat he does not propose to spend any of it for prescription drugs.\n  But isn't it interesting? You put it in the trust fund to make the \ntrust fund more solvent, but then you don't propose that any of it gets \nspent. That is what is going to happen to the surplus. That is one \nexample--the big surplus, over and above the Social Security surplus. \nIt is going to find niches in this country, special interest groups of \nall types, small and large, and it is going to be spent.\n  Now, are we undertaxed? Of course not. We would not have this kind of \nsurplus if we were undertaxed. This surplus indicates what a surplus of \nthis size should indicate, which is that tax receipts are very high. In \nfact, the total tax receipts of the Federal Government are the highest \npercentage of the gross domestic product that they have been in 50 \nyears. You can pick pieces of the taxpayers and draw different \nconclusions for different groups. But essentially it is true that the \ntotal tax take is going up as a percentage of our gross domestic \nproduct, and that sends a signal: It is time to take a look and make \nsure you don't spend at that level, because then you move America into \na high tax country. Our success is not as a high tax country; our \nsuccess is as a low tax country. That is why we are succeeding over and \nabove other countries in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for his presentation this afternoon.\n  I yield up to 3 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Thomas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have been listening with great attention \nto what we are talking about. Certainly, there is nothing more \nimportant before us now than the budget. We have heard all kinds of \nexplanations, and we will hear many more. We will argue about the \nallocation over time. But it seems to me, as I think about it, that the \nidea of a budget is where we really set our priorities.\n  There is more to a budget than simply the question of where we spend \nevery dollar. What we do with the budget is, we put into reality the \nthings we would like to see in our Government. What size Government \nwould you like to have? What do we do with respect to our working with \nthe State and local governments? How does that fit? What do we do about \ntaxes? Is there something we want to do there? I look at it as really \nan opportunity for us to, philosophically and from an ideal standpoint, \nlook at why we are here and what it is we want to accomplish.\n\n  For those who want a simpler and smaller Government, does this budget \ndo that? I don't think so. This is an increase in size. This is more \nGovernment. This is larger.\n  What if your goal was really to move more and more of the choices and \nmore and more of the responsibility closer to people and State and \nlocal governments? Does this budget do that? No, I don't think so.\n  What if you want to really feel strongly about spending caps and say \nthat this is the way you control spending? Does this budget stay with \nthe caps that we argued so much about just 2 years ago? No, it doesn't \ndo that.\n  If you had an idea that you would really like to take care of paying \ndown this debt on a dependable program over a period of time, a little \nbit like, I suppose, a mortgage, and you wanted to do that, does this \ndo that? No, it doesn't.\n  So I hope that as we go through this whole process--and it will be, \nunfortunately, almost all of the year--I hope we start with the \nprinciples that we would like to see enunciated when we are through. We \nwill have different views. Some people want more Government, more \nspending and more taxes--a legitimate idea, but not one that I share. I \nthink we do much of that in the budget.\n  So I hope, Mr. President, that we really take a look at measuring \nthis budget in terms of our values, the reason we came here, the reason \nwe have given to our constituents as to why we\n\n[[Page S1129]]\n\nare here. Much of it will be reflected in this budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, that is going to close the discussion \non our side on the President's budget. I am going to yield the \nremainder of our time at this point to the distinguished Senator from \nTexas on another matter.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield the remainder of our time to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for up to 30 minutes \nthereafter, and I further ask that following my remarks Senator Gorton \nbe recognized, followed by Senator Graham of Florida and then followed \nby Senator Brownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Gorton pertaining \nto the introduction of S. 346 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

The \nSenator has that right.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I want to bring to the Senate's \nattention something that, when I first saw it, I found it just to be \nunbelievable, that the type of situation that is going on is happening \nin the world today, in 1999.\n  I am speaking of what is taking place and the human rights abuses \nthat are occurring in the Sudan today. The northern Sudanese Government \nis waging a vicious war in the south against its own people, who are \nsuffering extraordinary human rights abuses on a massive scale. \nSlavery--slavery--and Government-induced famine not only exist but are \nincreasing. It is unpardonable that slavery continues in the modern \nworld today, that in 1999 we have slavery going on in the world. And it \ndoes in the Sudan.\n  It is even more dismaying that this offense against humanity is \nofficially tolerated, even perpetrated, by a national government \nagainst its own people. I believe that America has the moral authority \nand the duty to protest this outrageous practice.\n  Joined by other Members of Congress, I will be introducing a \nresolution which demands the end of slavery in the Sudan. Legislation \nwill also be introduced which challenges the famine-induced practices \nof the Government. Consider this a modern-day abolitionist movement, \ninspired by the legacy of some of the great freedom advocates such as \nMartin Luther King or William Wilberforce who ended the slavery trade \nin Britain nearly two centuries ago.\n  Let the facts speak for the victims. There are 1.9 million Sudanese \nwho have died at the hands of their own Government, more people than \nBosnia, Rwanda, and Kosovo combined. Over 2 million people have been \ndisplaced, driven from their ancient communities--that is nearly 10 \npercent of the population--and they now wander homeless, without \nresources, education, or hope for a decent future for their children. \nThis is the largest internally displaced population in Africa. Most \nalarming, 2.6 million risk starvation this year--this year--because of \nGovernment policies deliberately calculated to produce food shortages.\n\n  Reportedly, 1998 was the worst famine in 10 years because of the \nofficial Government practices of denying food distribution to its own \nstarving people. Experts warn that 1999 will even be worse because of \nthe now weakened condition of the population. How could this happen \nwhen so much aid stands waiting for shipment? The answer is because the \nGovernment denies humanitarian aid organizations access to famine-\nstricken areas in the south. They deliberately withhold American-\nsponsored aid from the starving population to manufacture a famine.\n  Now, why would a government deliberately starve its own people? They \nhave made starvation a weapon of war to crush those fighting for self-\ndetermination and religious freedom. Through this weapon of starvation, \nthey can drive the people into refugee centers, which they cynically \ncall ``peace camps,'' and there break them with humiliating treatment, \ndeprivation, rape, more starvation, and even bombings in peace camps.\n  The Sudanese people suffer terrible treatment in these so-called \npeace camps; they are forced to renounce their own deeply held \nreligious beliefs as a condition to being given food. Christians and \ntraditional tribal believers report this is a routine practice.\n  The U.S. Committee for Refugees issued a report recently which \ndescribes the bombing of refugee centers by the Government. The \nGovernment bombs these unarmed refugees, the women, the children, the \nsick, the starving, the elderly, all of whom have taken refuge in these \ncamps as their last resort for food.\n  Recently, reports on female refugees state that virtually every woman \ninterviewed--virtually every woman interviewed--was raped or nearly \nraped during induction to the camps. Moreover, young boys in these \ncamps are abducted into the northern cause and used as front-line \nfodder. These are the so-called peace camps.\n  Yet the most incredible crime against humanity practiced in the Sudan \ntoday is slavery. In 1999, slavery still exists in this world, and it \nis officially tolerated, even perpetrated, by the National Government \nagainst its own people. Tens of thousands of Sudanese presently exist \nas chattel property, owned by masters who force their captives into \nhard labor and sexual concubinage. They are branded, beaten, starved, \nand raped at their master's whim. Forced religious conversion is \nroutine. Christian and tribal traditional believers experience \nstarvation and whippings until they renounce their own personal faiths. \nAll slaves with Christian or African names are given new Arab names by \ntheir masters. The girls undergo a terrible practice, lightly referred \nto as ``female circumcision,'' better described as ``female genital \nmutilation,'' which is permanently disfiguring, extremely painful, and \nphysically dangerous. Some Moslems also have this act forced upon them.\n  I asked my personal staff to investigate this situation in September. \nThat trip to the Sudan produced extraordinary photos of children who \nhave been redeemed by John Eibner of Christian Solidarity \nInternational.\n  Mr. Eibner is a modern-day abolitionist, an American who redeems \npeople from slavery for about $50 a person--50 bucks a person to redeem \na slave today. He has rescued over 5,000 people from slavery in the \nSudan since 1995. These photos from that trip show some of those \nredeemed slaves. I want to show those photos to the Senate. These are \npeople my staff went and met with, who have been enslaved in the \nnorthern part of Sudan. You can see young children here in this picture \nwho were gathered together, beautiful young children who have suffered \nthe bonds of slavery in 1999. Here is the broader group, and a picture \nof the group they met with who had all been enslaved.\n  Then I want to show you these next two pictures up close. This is the \nface of slavery today in the world, in Sudan. This young boy, \napproximately the age of my son, was a slave in 1999, in this world \ntoday in the Sudan. You can see he is holding his arm out here as they \nwere looking at his arm and his slave brand that he had. We have a \ncloser picture of that brand that this young boy suffered that was put \non under his slave master's hand--slavery in the world today. It still \ngoes on. It still goes on. And it is going on in the Sudan.\n  Both victims and experts report that the slave practice has actually \neven increased since 1996. It appears that the Sudanese Government \nemploys slavery as a deliberate means of demoralizing the civilian \npopulation and fragmenting communities. Slavery is also used to reward \ngovernment soldiers fighting\n\n[[Page S1130]]\n\nthis civil war. These women and children are captured as war booty, as \na type of salary for the soldiers. It is repugnant that any country \nwould permit, let alone promote the demeaning cruelties described here. \nTherefore I invite anyone who is touched by this account of suffering \nto join me in this cause to end slavery before the next millennium and \nstop this insane practice of man-made famines in the Sudan.\n  We have the capacity to do this. We need to do this. And we must do \nit now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, I thank you for yielding me this time in \nmorning business to address the issue of the Federal budget. This time \nof year, as America starts to look forward to spring training in \nFlorida and Arizona for the baseball season, Members of the U.S. Senate \nand House of Representatives get involved in their own grapefruit \nleague, their own spring training, which starts with our speeches on \nthe Federal budget process. And I am sure that many people who would \nwitness this debate would scratch their heads and say, What can that \npossibly mean to my family in Chicago, IL, or Springfield, IL? In fact, \nit has a great deal of importance and not only defines who we are as a \nnation and what our priorities will be in the coming year, but it also \naffects a lot of programs and a lot of taxes that directly impact \nfamilies across America. So this kind of runup to the serious debates \non the budget resolution is an important part of the annual ritual in \nCongress. And I am happy to be part of it today.\n  I have listened to my Republican colleagues, as they have spoken \nabout their view of the budget, the budget process, and where we are in \nAmerica, and it is a slightly--well, no, it is a significantly \ndifferent point of view than I have. Because I take a look at this \nNation and I do not see it in somber and serious terms. I don't find it \ndepressing. I am not saddened by it. I really look at the state of \ngovernment today in Washington, DC, and see so many hopeful signs that \nI wonder sometimes if my Republican colleagues are looking at the same \npicture that I am looking at.\n  There are certain things which I think we ought to accept as a \nreality. The fact that two out of three Americans today say the Clinton \nadministration is doing a good job suggests to me that most Americans--\nDemocrats, independents and even almost a majority of the moderate \nRepublicans--have come to the conclusion that this country is on the \nright track, this administration is doing a good job. And there is \nample reason for them to reach this conclusion.\n  Think about where we were 6 years ago when this administration began. \nThe budget deficit stood at nearly $300 billion a year with no relief \nin sight. At the time, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting \nthat the deficit would reach $350 billion in 1998. At that time, no \none--absolutely no one--would have expected, instead of a $350 billion \ndeficit, we would be running a $70 billion surplus.\n  The first step on our road to recovery and sanity in the budget \nprocess was the passage of President Clinton's 1993 Deficit Reduction \nAct. I remember that vote as if it were yesterday. That vote taken over \n5 years ago is imprinted in my memory, because we were told by our \nRepublican critics that if we voted for this Clinton deficit-reduction \nplan we would drive this economy into a tailspin, we would have even \ndeeper deficits, we would have a wholesale reaction from the American \npeople against this new policy. And as a result of it, we didn't garner \na single Republican vote in support of the Clinton deficit-reduction \nplan. Here in the Senate, before I arrived, when the vote was cast, it \nwas up to Vice President Gore to cast the deciding vote for this \ndeficit-reduction plan.\n  It turns out the President and the Vice President were correct and \nthe critics of the plan were wrong. Because, as you see, we have now \nreached the point where that deficit reduction put us on a road toward \na balanced budget, which we enjoy today. Giving credit where it is due, \nthere was a second installment on deficit reduction done on a \nbipartisan basis by Republicans and Democrats which completed this \neffort. I am glad that we were able to do that on a bipartisan basis. \nBut history records that the first important and most painful step in \nthis process began in 1993 with President Clinton's proposal.\n  A lot of my friends on the Republican side have argued that we have \nbeen able to eliminate the deficit but at the expense of raising taxes \non ordinary Americans. I have heard this so often you almost start to \nbelieve it. And then you look at the facts. The facts are these: The \nTreasury Department shows that a median income family of four currently \npays less in taxes as a percentage of their income than at any time in \nthe last 20 years. It is also true for families of four at one-half the \nmedian income level and a family of four at twice the median income \nlevel.\n  So the Republican claims that the President has balanced the budget \non the backs of working people just simply are not true. Nor is it true \nthat the administration has increased the size of government. All of \nthese claims about big government and big taxing just do not wash when \nyou take a look at the facts. According to the Center for Budget and \nPolicy Priorities, spending has declined to its smallest share of our \ngross domestic product in 25 years. Furthermore, under the President's \nproposal, spending will continue to decline as a percentage of our \ngross domestic product to its lowest level in 33 years.\n  Sound fiscal policy has translated into economic resurgence in \nAmerica which still baffles even the experts. Here we are enjoying the \n95th consecutive month of economic expansion, the longest peacetime \nexpansion in our history; interest rates stable and falling; \nunemployment rates coming down; welfare rolls coming down; inflation at \nits lowest combined rate with interest rates and unemployment in a \ngeneration.\n  As the President announced to Congress 2 weeks ago, the state of our \nNation is strong. As Vice President Gore often says, everything that we \nwant to go down has gone down. We are talking about the unemployment \nrate and welfare rolls. And things we want to go up, like family income \nand housing starts and new businesses, continue to go up. So when I \nhear these funereal tones from my Republican colleagues about how sad \nit is that this administration just can't get it, can't get it right, I \nlook around at our economy and I am baffled, I cannot find the evidence \nfor their claim.\n  Despite these promises of surpluses in our budget as far as the eye \ncan see, we all know that budget projections in the future are a guess, \nan educated guess but a guess. Four years ago, the Congressional Budget \nOffice forecast the deficit would exceed $300 billion this year and \napproach $500 billion by the year 2005.\n  With $5 trillion of Federal debt hanging over our heads, now is not \nthe time to abandon fiscal prudence in favor of tax cuts for the \nwealthiest Americans, as many of my colleagues have suggested. We \nshould take advantage of the opportunity to redirect and invest our \nsurpluses at this moment in history where they can pay off for America \nin the long run. We need a responsible fiscal course to begin with. The \nPresident's budget wisely preserves 62 percent of the projected surplus \nfor Social Security and I hope both parties can agree to this. Let me \nsay this: If at this moment in time--this year--as we debate the \nbudget, as we envision surpluses for years to come, if we cannot muster \nthe will, on a bipartisan basis,\n\n[[Page S1131]]\n\nto save Social Security, we never will. It will be less painful now \nthan any time in our future. And we have to accept the responsibility \nof dedicating the surplus to Social Security.\n  The President said it last year, and repeated it again this year: \n``Save Social Security first.'' And those who want to embark on a \ndifferent course, so be it. I believe the American people agree with me \nand the President that this money should go to Social Security, and \nalso to Medicare. The Medicare Program, important to millions of \nelderly, is a program that is in trouble. There is no doubt about it. \nAs health care costs go up, as the elderly population increases, \nMedicare faces strains and pressures never envisioned.\n  The President has suggested taking 15 percent of the surplus and \nputting it into Medicare to make sure that we have an additional 10 \nyears of a solid Medicare system for senior citizens. That, to me, is \neminently sensible. That, again, is an investment of the surplus in \nsomething good for the long-term benefits of our Nation, not just for \nelderly--of course it benefits them directly--but for their children as \nwell.\n  When senior citizens cannot pay their health care bills, many times \nthey turn to the government but they often turn to their children. Let \nus relieve that generation from a burden they shouldn't carry, by \ninvesting a portion of the surplus in Medicare. Medicare and Social \nSecurity are entitlements but they are earned entitlements. Let's put \nthe ``security'' back in Social Security and put quality health care \ninto Medicare.\n  When we think about what to do with the surplus, it makes sense to \nconsider the perspective of Alan Greenspan. If there is one man who is \ncredited with leading us through this out-of-the-deficit desert and \ninto the sunshine of surpluses, it is the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, Alan Greenspan. In testimony to the Senate Budget Committee \nlast week, the Chairman said that the single-best use of the surplus is \nto pay down the national debt. This is exactly what the President is \ndoing by dedicating the surplus to Social Security and Medicare.\n\n  There is also a proposal for tax relief. It is perfectly reasonable \nthat once we have taken care of our obligations to save and preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare and thereby reduce the national debt, we \nalso help families in America who need tax relief. The President's \nproposal is a sensible approach which gives working families more \nincome security, more spending power, and a greater ability to save for \nthe future.\n  The President's proposal finds $34 billion in tax relief to working \nfamilies. His budget reserves 12 percent of the projected surplus to \nprovide low- and moderate-income Americans with a tax cut to help fund \npersonal retirement accounts. Millions of Americans and millions of \nFederal employees, including most of the people who work in this \nbuilding, have availed themselves of savings opportunities for their \nretirement, whether it is the Federal Thrift Savings Plan, individual \nretirement accounts, or Roth IRAs--named after Senator Roth from \nDelaware. In order to make certain that low- and middle-income families \nhave that same option, the President suggests that we create these \npersonal retirement accounts that will help them. I think that makes \nsense.\n  The President also suggests that we provide tax relief for child care \ncosts for 3 million working families. A couple years ago, I went across \nIllinois and talked to working families and in particular, working \nmothers, about their major concerns. Do you know what the number one \nconcern was? It was, what will I do with my kids when I go to work? I \ncan't afford to send them to the very best day care, and I worry myself \nto death when I am on the job and I am not certain that they are safe. \nThat is a natural human reaction. It is the right reaction from a \nparent. What the President is saying is that we need to be sensitive to \nthese working families by giving them some tax relief to help pay for \nday care and child care.\n  The same thing is true for many of the working families who have \nelderly parents or parents who are sick or disabled who need help with \nlong-term care. Here again, the President's proposal offers tax relief \nto millions of Americans who want to provide for loved ones that are in \ntheir golden years.\n  You will also hear a cry for tax cuts from our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. But it is almost as predictable as night \nfollowing day that when you go beyond the surface appeal of tax cuts \nproposed by the Republicans, you find the same story year in and year \nout. Let me give you some graphic examples of what I am talking about.\n  This chart which we had prepared looks at the proposed 10-percent tax \nrate cut that the Republicans have brought forward. Of course, we had \nto analyze it to see what it would mean to most families. This is no \nsurprise if you have followed Republican tax breaks in years gone by. \nThe bottom sixty percent of America's families, based on income, would \nsee an average of a tax break of just $99 a year, roughly $8 and a few \ncents each month. Then you get to the top 1 percent of incomes, people \nmaking over $300,000 a year, and look what their average tax break is \nunder the Republican plan--$20,697. I just can't understand this. I \ncan't understand why low- and middle-income families making below \n$38,000 a year should get an average annual tax break of a little over \n$8 a month while we turn around and give $1,600 or $1,700 a month to \nthe wealthiest among us.\n  If there is to be a tax break, if we are to use the surplus to help \nAmerican families, should we not dedicate that surplus first and \nforemost to the low- and middle-income families who absolutely need it \nthe most?\n  When I take a look at where money can be spent in this Federal \nbudget, I am sometimes troubled that my friends on the Republican side \nof the aisle suggest that spending on domestic priorities is creating \nwasteful, new programs. In one particular area I take exception; that \nis in the area of education and training.\n  It was only last year that we had the major corporations in Silicon \nValley and across the country lobbying Congress to change the \nimmigration laws in America so that these companies could bring in \nskilled and trained personnel, immigrants from overseas, to fill gaps \nin their employment. That is a sad commentary on America's educational \nsystem. And it really troubles me that we have reached the point these \ncompanies cannot find within America the skills that they need to make \na profit.\n  Then we hear from the U.S. Navy that it is suggesting it needs a \nchange in policy. The Navy, an All-Volunteer Navy, relies on those who \ncome forward and those they can recruit, and they have fallen short of \ntheir goals. Some 22,000 seaman are needed and not available, \nparticularly 18,000 for service on ships at sea. So the Navy has come \nto Congress and said we think the answer to this is for Congress to \nallow us to increase the number of recruits who don't have high school \ndiplomas from 5 percent of the total to 10 percent. Now, that is a \ntroubling admission to say that we have so many young people without a \nhigh school education that we need to turn to the Armed Forces to give \nthese young people a basic education.\n  When the President comes before Congress and says we can do a better \njob in our schools, I think most American families agree. And money \ninvested there, I think, is money well invested. We have a skills gap \nin our country which needs to be addressed. We need a commitment to \neducation that includes afterschool and summer school programs. We need \n100,000 new teachers. We need to improve teacher skills and hold them \naccountable to make certain that when they come into the classroom, \nthey are prepared to teach. The vast majority of teachers will meet \nthis threshold requirement without breaking a sweat. But you know as \nwell as I that there are people standing in classrooms across America \nreading from textbooks on subjects they know little or nothing about.\n  In my old home town of East St. Louis, last year or so I talked to \nsome of the people on the school board and they say they will literally \ngive a job to anyone who tells us they are prepared to try and teach \nscience and math--``prepared to try and teach.'' They don't require any \ndegrees, they can't, because they can't attract the people to do the \njob. We need to increase teacher skills and training to do so.\n  In addition, I think we need to put more money into school \nconstruction,\n\n[[Page S1132]]\n\nnot just because the school-age enrollment is going to mushroom \ndramatically over the next several decades, but because our current \nschool buildings in America for the most part are not prepared to \naccept the new technology necessary to educate our children. When \nPresident Clinton suggests $25 billion in tax credits for that school \nconstruction and renovation, I think he is talking about an issue that \nmost Americans and most families can certainly understand.\n  This is a time to invest in America, not a time to provide a windfall \ntax break for the wealthiest people in our country. The President \nmaintains strong fiscal discipline, targets his tax relief to Americans \nwho need it, and makes certain that our highest priority of preserving \nSocial Security and Medicare and reducing national debt is met.\n  There is also a suggestion that we increase defense spending. As a \nmember of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I am going to watch \nthis carefully. I understand, as most people do, that national defense \nis one of our highest priorities. I want to make certain that we \ndedicate our resources, first and foremost, to the men and women in \nuniform to make certain that they are compensated well and have a fair \nretirement plan.\n  It is a personal embarrassment to me, and it should be to every \nMember of Congress, to learn that so many members of the U.S. military \ntoday qualify for food stamps. That shouldn't be the case. We ought to \nmake certain that the amount of money paid to our military personnel is \nadequate not only to maintain their families, but to attract and retain \nthe very best in uniform across America. We owe our freedom to these \nmen and women. We should compensate them accordingly. Of course, \ntechnology is part of that, but let's make sure the technology demands \nare consistent with the post-cold war world, that it is a technology \ndemand that really envisions America's future role in the world in \nrealistic terms.\n  I conclude by saying that I think that the President's budget has \nareas where I might disagree and probably will. It has areas that \nCongress will certainly address in a different way, but it is a budget \nbased on the right principles, a budget to keep America on a track for \nprosperity and economic improvement. When we look at the growth in our \ndomestic product each and every quarter, the encouragement it gives us, \nI think it suggests that we ought to think long and hard before we \nabandon this course we have been on--a successful course, with 95 \nconsecutive months of economic expansion. Those who want to experiment \nwith another approach, perhaps they can make that case to the American \npeople; but, today, two-thirds of the American people say: Stay on this \ncourse, keep us moving forward in the right way, helping working \nfamilies and preserving the programs that mean so much to America.\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to turn our \nattention to an exciting and worthwhile project for America's young \npeople: the Children's Scholarship Fund.\n  Last June, two great Americans, concerned about the state of \neducation in America, particularly about the way in which children of \nlow-income families are often without educational options, founded the \nChildren's Scholarship Fund with their own substantial private \ninvestments. I speak of Ted Forstmann of Forstmann-Little and Company \nand Gulfstream Aerospace and of John Walton of Wal-Mart Stores. Based \non their firm belief that a child should not be denied educational \nopportunity because of his or her family's financial situation, these \ntwo citizens are improving the education of young Americans, and \nthereby improving the lives of all Americans.\n  When Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton announced the creation of the \nChildren's Scholarship Fund in June 1998, they began with programs in \nfive cities. The demand and enthusiasm with which they were greeted was \nso overwhelming that scarcely three months later they joined with \ndonors around the country to make scholarships available in forty three \ncities and three entire states. Now, only eight months after the launch \nof the Children's Scholarship Fund, low-income children throughout the \nentire United States are eligible for scholarships. As of today, the \nChildren's Scholarship Fund is nationwide, and will provide \napproximately 40,000 scholarships worth nearly $170 million. All low-\nincome families throughout this country with children entering \nkindergarten through eight grade next fall may now be eligible to \nreceive scholarships.\n  On April 22nd, the names of the Children's Scholarship Fund \nscholarship recipients will be selected in a random drawing. Families \nmust have submitted their completed applications no later than March \n31st to be eligible. I urge my colleagues to make a note of these \nimportant dates.\n  In the meantime, I commend Ted Forstmann and John Walton and everyone \nassociated with the Children's Scholarship Fund for the invaluable \ncontributions they are making to improve the lives of so many of our \nyoung people. They set an example for all of us. The enormous public \nresponse to the Children's Scholarship Fund serves as an important \nreminder to those of us in Congress of the need to creatively expand \neducational opportunities for all of our citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1132-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1132-S1133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF TREVA TURNER\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to today to recognize the \ndilligent service of Ms. Treva Turner, who is retiring from the \nCongressional Research Service after 33-years of providing invaluable \nassistance to Senators, Representatives, and members of their staffs.\n  It is probably safe to say that the images that most people associate \nwith the United States Congress are those of the Capitol Building or \nthe 535 men and women who serve in the Senate and House Chambers. \nAfterall, millions of Americans see us cast votes as they watch C-SPAN \nand C-SPAN2, or recognize the Capitol from a trip to Washington, DC, or \nfrom seeing it used as a backdrop for television news reports or in \nmovies. What most Americans do not realize is that the Congress extends \nfar beyond the Capitol Building, and those that work in these two \nchambers are not limited to those of us who hold office.\n  As each of us knows, we rely on what is literally a small army of men \nand women to provide us with advice, support, and analysis. Among those \norganizations which support our work, perhaps the greatest treasure is \nthe Congressional Research Service, commonly known as ``CRS''. For more \nthan the past three decades, Treva Turner has been a loyal, dilligent, \nand selfless employee of CRS, and her efforts have been of immeasurable \nhelp to many of us as we have debated any number of matters before the \nSenate.\n  Treva's speciality was education issues, and as each of us places a \ngreat priority on providing for the future of America's children, she \nwas kept busy with any number of projects and research requests. \nDespite her heavy workload, Treva was always pleasant, outgoing, and \nready to share her wry sense of humor with her many friends. \nFurthermore, she was always ready to lend assistance to people, whether \nthey were co-workers in the Congressional Research Service, or staffers \nwho wandered into the Senate Reference Center. Treva's professionalism \nand expertise assured that she provided prompt and impartial \ninformation and analysis to all Members of Congress and their staffs.\n  As with any professional, Treva's dedication to her job did not end \nwith her assigned duties. Her work as a founding member of the Library \nof Congress Professional Association, along with her service on the \nReference Forum, help to assure that CRS met\n\n[[Page S1133]]\n\nthe needs and expectations of its primary users.\n  Mr. President, I know that Treva Turner is going to be missed by all \nthose who had the opportunity to work with her. I also know that each \nof us is grateful for the dedicated service and support she has \nrendered to the United States Congress and that we wish her health, \nhappiness, and success in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1132-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE DENVER BRONCOS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I recognize the members of the \nWorld Champion Denver Broncos of the National Football League and their \nstunning Super Bowl victory this past weekend.\n  For the second consecutive year, the Denver Broncos have proven the \nvalue of dedication, preparation and execution as they played through \nthe regular football season, into the playoffs and in the league \nchampionship, Super Bowl XXXIII.\n  I would also like to recognize the Atlanta Falcons for a terrific \nseason. They deserve praise for their efforts and a well fought game. \nFew gave them a chance to make it as far as they did; but, they proved \nto everyone that they are a team of the future.\n  Most folks know how close the Denver Broncos came during the past \nseason to going undefeated. In addition, the Denver Bronco players and \nthe entire organization won more games during the three most recent \nseasons than any other NFL team. Great teams are measured by sustained \nsuccess and by any measure, the Denver Broncos rank among the greatest \nteams in history. For the first time in nearly 20 years the Broncos, an \nAmerican Football Conference team, won back to back Super Bowls. A \ntotal team effort was exemplified by the Denver Broncos this season.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to recognize several members of the \nDenver Broncos organization for their outstanding achievements during \nthis past season. Specifically, Owner Pat Bowlen and Head Coach Mike \nShanahan for their proven ability to assemble the necessary players and \ndevelop game plans that consistently provide victories for this \nfranchise; Quarterback John Elway, Super Bowl XXXIII's Most Valuable \nPlayer and a consistent Pro Bowl caliber quarterback who for 16 seasons \nhas been the uncontested leader of the Denver Broncos and a valuable \ncivic leader and role model for young Americans; and running back \nTerrell Davis, the NFL's Most Valuable Player for the 1998-99 season.\n  These people are the most recognizable names in the Broncos' \norganization and are major contributors to the Broncos' success. But, \nlike in my office, the total team effort is what made the Broncos \nvictorious. The entire team worked together and went after and achieved \na common goal. Each team member deserves to be recognized and I will \nmention them in numerical order: Jason Elam, Bubby Brister, Brian \nGriese, Tom Rouen, Tory James, Darrien Gordon, Vaughn Hebron, Darrius \nJohnson, Eric Brown, Steve Atwater, Tito Paul, Howard Griffith, Derek \nLoville, Tyrone Braxton, Anthony Lynn, Ray Crockett, Detron Smith, \nGeorge Coghill, John Mobley, Bill Romanowski, Nate Wayne, Keith Burns, \nGlenn Cadrez, K.C. Johns, Dan Neil, David Diaz-Infante, Tom Nalen, Mark \nSchlereth, Trey Teague, Cyron Brown, Harry Swayne, Tony Jones, Matt \nLepsis, Chris Banks, Rod Smith, Marcus Nash, Justin Armour, Shannon \nSharpe, Willie Green, Byron Chamberlain, Ed McCaffrey, Dwayne Carswell, \nNeil Smith, Alfred Williams, Trevor Pryce, Keith Traylor, Marvin \nWashington, Harald Hasselbach, Mike Lodish, Maa Tanuvasa, Seth Joyner, \nSteve Russ, Jeff Lewis, Chris Gizzi, Andre Cooper, Tori Noel, Curtis \nAlexander, Viliami Maumau, Marvin Thomas; and the coaching staff, Frank \nBush, Barney Chavous, Rick Dennison, Ed Donatell, George Dyer, Alex \nGibbs, Mike Heimerdinger, Gary Kubiak, Pat McPherson, Brian Pariani, \nRicky Porter, Greg Robinson, Greg Saporta, Rick Smith, John Teerlinck, \nBobby Turner, and Rich Tuten.\n  Many people also underestimated the strength of the Denver Broncos' \ndefense. When push came to shove, the defense kept the second best \nrunning back in the game this season from gaining 100 rushing yards and \nintercepted three passes from the opposing quarterback in the Super \nBowl. Defense wins championships, and Denver's defense proved this to \nbe true.\n  Mr. President, the offensive line needs to be recognized for an \noutstanding effort--season after season. The reason the Denver Broncos \nrunning and passing attack was so dominant was, in large part, due to \nthe efforts of the offensive line.\n  The Denver Broncos have come a long way since their introduction into \nthe American Football League in 1960, with their mustard and brown \nvertical striped socks, to the Denver Broncos of today which have \ndominated the NFL with two consecutive world championships.\n  It is a special honor for me to make a Senate floor statement for the \nsecond year in a row to congratulate the Denver Broncos. Today I invite \nmy Senate colleagues to join me in a Mile High Salute to the World \nChampion Denver Broncos.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1133-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1133-S1134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PRESIDENT CLINTON'S ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE BUDGET CUTS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, even as the Senate has been weighing \nhistoric matters, the important work of the Judiciary Committee has \ngone forward as well. I am pleased to report that the Judiciary \nCommittee is working to develop an agenda that will continue the \nSenate's commitment to the American people to make our streets safe \nfrom crime, to ensure that the benefits of this great technological and \ncommunications age reach all our people unencumbered by artificial \nlegal barriers, and to ensure that we preserve and protect the rule of \nlaw. I will have more to say in the coming days about this agenda. \nToday, however, I would like to focus my comments on what I believe are \nhighly irresponsible cuts to administration of justice programs in the \nPresident's budget proposal.\n  This year, criminal justice issues should and will once again require \nthe attention of the Senate. Many of our communities are not sharing \nequally in the decline in crime rates. For instance, according to FBI \ndata, while the rate of violent crimes decreased nationally by four \npercent in 1997, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports demonstrate that in \nthe Mountain West, the decline was only 2.4 percent, and my state of \nUtah posted a slight increase. Similarly, property crimes decreased \nnationally 3.1 percent, but only decreased one-half of one percent in \nthe Mountain West. Again, my state of Utah actually had an increase in \nproperty crime. Compared to rates in the Northeast, the violent crime \nrate is 46.4 percent higher in the West and 52.1 percent higher in the \nSouth.\n  And it is not just crime rates that need further improvement. The \nyouth drug epidemic continues to plague us. According to the National \nInstitute of Drug Abuse's Monitoring the Future surveys, drug use among \nour youth has grown substantially, and recent marginal improvement \ncannot hide the fact that more of our young people than ever are \nensnared by drugs. From 1991 to 1998, the lifetime use of marijuana--\nthe gateway to harder drugs--has increased among school-age youth. The \nnumber of 8th graders reporting to have ever used marijuana has \nincreased by 55 percent from 1991 to 1998, and the number of 8th \ngraders who have used marijuana within the past year has increased by \n173 percent in that same time.\n  Not surprisingly, then, use of harder drugs has also increased. The \nnumber of 8th graders who have used cocaine within the past year has \nincreased by 181 percent from 1991 to 1998, and the number these \nstudents who have used heroin within the past year has increased by 86 \npercent in the same time period. And significantly, 1997 to 1998, \nlifetime heroin use by 8th and 10th graders has increased by 0.2 \npercent, meaning that the use of this deadly drug is still on the rise \namong our youth.\n  Because we have so far to go in our fight against crime and drugs, I \nam particularly disturbed by the President's proposed budget for the \nDepartment of Justice. The Clinton budget provides only a marginal 1.6 \npercent increase in DOJ funding for FY 2000. But even this slight \nincrease pales compared to the massive cuts President\n\n[[Page S1134]]\n\nClinton is proposing in assistance to state and local law enforcement. \nLet me alert my colleagues to what the President is proposing.\n  Undisclosed by the Administration's spin machine and most media \nreports, President Clinton is proposing more than $1.5 billion in cuts \nto state and local crime fighting efforts. Among the programs on the \nPresident's chopping block is the entire Violent Offender and Truth in \nSentencing Incentive Grant program. This program has, by any measure, \nbeen a tremendous success, providing critical seed money to states for \nbricks and mortar prison construction and thus making our streets \nsafer.\n  Incarceration deters crime. Dramatic and historic reductions in \nsentence lengths and the expectation of punishment from the 1950s \nonward fueled steep increases in crime in the Sixties, Seventies, and \nEighties. Only after these incarceration trends began to be reversed in \nthis decade, did crime rates start to fall also.\n  The Violent Offender and Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grant program \nhas been an important component of this effort. In response to federal \nassistance, states have changed their sentencing laws. As the \nPresident's own Justice Department reported just last month, because of \nthis program, 70 percent of prison admissions in 1997 were in states \nrequiring criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentence. The \naverage time served by violent criminals has increased 12.2 percent \nsince 1993. With such success, why would the President want to \neliminate this program?\n  And he doesn't stop there. Also eliminated in the President's budget \nis the highly successful Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program, \nwhich since 1995 has provided more than $2 billion in funding for \nequipment and technology directly to state and local law enforcement. \nThe President wants to cut 20 percent from the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act, which he signed into law just last year, to \nprovide vests to protect officers whose departments otherwise could not \nafford this life-saving equipment. The President wants to cut $50 \nmillion from the successful and popular Byrne Grant program, which \nprovides funding for numerous state crime-fighting initiatives, and he \nproposes funding changes that put this program at further risk in \nfuture budgets. The President wants to cut by $85 million funding that \nreimburses states for the costs of incarcerating criminal aliens. He \nwants to cut $4 million from the Violence Against Women program, and \n$12.5 million from COPS grants targeting violence against women. And \nthe Clinton budget slashes the entire juvenile accountability block \ngrant, which over the past two years has provided $500 million for \nstates and local government to address the single most ominous crime \nthreat we face--serious and violent juvenile crime.\n\n  Mr. President, the recent gains of state and local law enforcement in \nthe fight against violent crime are fragile, and have been based \nlargely on the Congress's endless push to place the interests of the \nlaw abiding over the establishment of new social spending programs. \nTime and again, Congress has had to remind President Clinton that \ngovernment's first domestic responsibility is to keep our streets and \ncommunities free from crime.\n  From the earliest days of the Clinton Administration, the President \nproposed severe cuts in law enforcement. For example, in March 1993, \nthe President took the unprecedented step of firing every incumbent \nUnited States Attorney, a move the Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts later said contributed to significant declines in federal \nprosecutions.\n  In 1994, the President proposed cutting 1,523 Department of Justice \nlaw enforcement positions, including 847 in the FBI, 355 in the DEA, \nand 143 in U.S. Attorney's offices. Congress said no.\n  In 1996, 1997, and 1998, the President has proposed cuts to state and \nlocal law enforcement assistance. Congress has said no.\n  And ever since 1995, the President has wanted to use badly needed \nprison construction grants intended for bricks and mortar to fund drug \ntreatment and other social programs not shown to have the same crime \ndeterrent effect. Congress has said no.\n  Now the President wants to cut the program entirely, and make further \ncuts in assistance to state and local law enforcement. Let me summarize \nthese cuts:\n  $50 million in Byrne grants for state and local law enforcement--Cut.\n  $523 million in Local Law Enforcement Block Grants--Cut.\n  $645 million in Truth in Sentencing Grants--Cut.\n  $85 million for criminal alien incarceration--Cut.\n  $250 million for juvenile crime and accountability grants--Cut.\n  $4 million in Violence Against Women Grants--Cut.\n  $12.5 million in COPS grants targeting domestic violence--Cut.\n  Even the President's own COPS program--$125 million Cut.\n  And what does the President want to fund? $200 million for a program \nto turn prosecutors into social workers, who ``focus on the offender, \nrather than the specific offense,'' and provide punishments such as \nrecreational programs for criminals up to age 22 who commit violent \noffenses, including weapons offenses, drug distribution, hate crimes, \nand civil rights violations.\n  It appears that Congress will have to say no again, and once again \nremind President Clinton that our government's first domestic duty is \nto protect the people from crime and violence. I will have more to say \nin the coming days about the President's budget and the Judiciary \nCommittee's agenda, but suffice it to say, however, that I find \nPresident Clinton's budget for Administration of Justice spending is in \nneed of significant attention.\n  I intend to see that this budget and administration of justice \nprograms get that attention. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \nwould like to advise my colleagues that a priority of the Committee \nthis year will be the reauthorization of the Department of Justice. \nIncluded in this will be efforts to address expiring authorizations \nfrom the 1994 crime law, a number of which have been vital to assisting \nstate and local government in reducing crime. I hope and expect that we \nwill consider, on a bipartisan basis, the important funding and policy \nquestions inherent in this effort, so to ensure that the Department can \ncontinue into the next century its important mission of upholding the \nrule of law.\n  We will hold a series of hearings, both in the newly established \nCriminal Justice Oversight Subcommittee and at Full Committee, with the \ngoal being to ensure that the Department of Justice is making the most \nof the precious law enforcement dollars appropriated and that essential \nlaw enforcement priorities are being met for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues' attention. I look forward \nto working with them on these important matters. I thank the Chair, and \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1133-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RECORD CORRECTION\n\n  Mr. REID.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the \n     State of New Jersey; ordered to be printed and to lie on the \n     table.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 166\n\n       Whereas, the establishment of high occupancy vehicle \n     (``HOV'') lane restrictions on Interstate Highway Route No. \n     287 (``I-287'') was intended as a means of promoting car \n     pooling in an effort to improve the State's air quality; and\n       Whereas, the number of eligible vehicles that use the HOV \n     lanes on I-287 has not come close to meeting the State's \n     expected projections for land usage, which shows that the HOV \n     lane restrictions have not had the effect of encouraging car \n     pooling at satisfactory levels; and\n       Whereas, because of the HOV lane restrictions on I-287, a \n     much larger number of citizens who use the non-restricted \n     lanes of that highway are subjected to frequent heavy traffic \n     situations, which result in high costs in fuel burned and \n     hourly wages lost, while the overall levels of air pollution \n     and noise increase, all of which represent a severe reduction \n     in the quality of life of those citizens; and\n       Whereas, since a considerable amount of effort is used by \n     the State Police in enforcing the HOV lane restrictions on I-\n     287, the availability of the State Police in combating other \n     motor vehicle-related crimes on other highways of this State \n     is diminished; and\n       Whereas, it is appropriate for this House to express this \n     policy to protect the citizens of this State who are \n     adversely affected by excessive automobile, bus and truck \n     traffic as a result of the HOV lane restrictions; and\n       Whereas, it is altogether fitting and proper that the \n     Legislature memorialize Congress to enact Congresswoman \n     Roukema's amendment to H.R. 4328 which would require the \n     United States Secretary of Transportation to waive repayment \n     of any Federal-aid highway funds expended on the construction \n     of HOV lanes on I-287 if the New Jersey Commissioner of \n     Transportation assures the Secretary that the removal of HOV \n     lane restrictions on I-287 is in the public interest; now, \n     therfore, be it\n       RESOLVED by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The Congress of the United States is respectfully \n     memorialized to enact Congresswoman Roukema's amendment to \n     H.R. 4328 which would require the United States Secretary of \n     Transportation to waive repayment of any Federal-aid highway \n     funds expended on the construction of high occupancy vehicle \n     (``HOV'') lanes on Interstate Highway Route 287 if the New \n     Jersey Commissioner of Transportation assures the Secretary \n     that the removal of HOV lane restrictions on Interstate Route \n     287 is in the public interest.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the \n     State of New Jersey; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 119\n\n       Whereas, the U.S. Department of Transportation, pursuant to \n     the 1996 Immigration Reform Act, has proposed regulations \n     requiring states to follow federal guidelines in producing \n     and issuing drivers' licenses; and\n       Whereas, these regulations would mandate that all states \n     collect and verify the social security numbers of licensed \n     drivers and that these numbers be placed on the licenses of \n     these drivers in a form that is electronically readable, \n     unless the state explicitly prohibits this practice; and\n       Whereas, these regulations would further allow the federal \n     government to dictate the acceptable evidence and \n     documentation of identity required to obtain a state driver's \n     license; and\n       Whereas, these regulations would impose a significant cost \n     burden on New Jersey by requiring the reformatting of its \n     driver's license and the establishment of an electronic \n     verification system with the Social Security Administration; \n     and\n       Whereas, the placement of social security numbers on New \n     Jersey driver's licenses, unless a law expressly prohibiting \n     this practice is enacted, raises serious concerns about the \n     security of the personal information of this State's drivers \n     in an era when ``identity theft'' and other breaches of \n     privacy are on the increase; and\n       Whereas, these regulations would impose an unfunded federal \n     mandate on the states that promises to far exceed, in total, \n     the maximum $100 million permitted under the Unfunded Mandate \n     Reform Act of 1994 and, contrary to the provisions of that \n     act, have been put forth without ``timely and meaningful \n     input'' from state elected officials or their national \n     organizations, according to the National Council of State \n     Legislatures; and\n       Whereas, by proposing these regulations to implement a \n     provision of the Immigration Reform Act, the U.S. Department \n     of Transportation is, in effect, seeking to federalize the \n     production and issuance of driver's licenses, functions which \n     heretofore have remained in the domain of the states; now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. That this House respectfully petitions the Congress of \n     the United States to prevent this costly and unnecessary \n     intrusion on the prerogatives of the states to produce and \n     issue drivers' licenses in keeping with the dictates of their \n     citizens by repealing Section 656(b) of the Immigration \n     Reform Act of 1996, which the proposed Department of \n     Transportation regulations are intended to implement.\n       2.

A bill to amend the Federal Agriculture Improvement and \nReform Act of 1996 to improve the farmland protection program; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n       federal agriculture improvement and reform act amendments\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to have Senators Torricelli, \nDeWine, Jeffords, Kennedy, Harkin, Mikulski, Levin, Kerry, Murray and \nBoxer join me today to reauthorize a program that has helped hundreds \nof farmers across the country save their farms and stay in the business \nof farming. Today, we are introducing a bill to reauthorize the \nFarmland Protection Program at a funding level of $55 million a year. \nThis new authorization supports the efforts of President Clinton to \nrestart the program with $50 million in Fiscal Year 2000.\n  Since its creation in the 1996 Farm Bill, the Farmland Protection \nProgram has been instrumental in curbing the loss of some of our \nnation's most productive farmland to urban sprawl. The Farmland \nProtection Program help shield farmers from development pressures by \nproviding federal matching grants to state and local conservation \norganizations to purchase easements on farms.\n  We have all seen the impact of urban sprawl in our home states, \nwhether it be large, multi-tract housing or mega-malls that bring \nnational superstores and nation-sized parking lots. We are losing \nfarmland across the country at an alarming rate. This bill will step up \nour efforts to halt this disturbing trend before too many of America's \nfarms are permanently transformed into asphalt jungles.\n  In Vermont, we are also seeing the impact of development on our \nfarmland. Increasing land prices and development pressure have forced \ntoo many Vermont farmers to sell to developers instead of passing on \ntheir farms to the next generation. With the former Farms for the \nFuture program and the Farmland Protection Program, farmers now have a \nfighting chance against development. Since its inception in Vermont, \nthese programs have helped conserve 78,000 acres of land on more than \n220 Vermont farms.\n  The success of the program should not just be measured in acres \nthough. The program also has helped farmers expand and re-invest in \nfarm facilities and equipment. Some of the farm projects have also led \nto construction of affordable housing and preservation of wildlife \nhabitat. There are now success stories all over Vermont. One is the \nstory of Paul and Marian Connor of Bridport, Vermont. Working with the \nVermont Land Trust they were able to conserve their 221-acre farm while \ncontinuing their dairy operation, raising seven children and retire \ntheir mortgage.\n  Although Vermont is making great progress, across the nation we \ncontinue to lose as much as one million acres of prime farmland \nannually. This land is critically important to agriculture. For \nexample, nearly three-quarters of America's dairy products, fruits and \nvegetables are grown in counties affected by urban growth.\n  For American farmers and ranchers, farmland protection is an issue of \nthe survival of both family farms and agricultural regions. When urban \npressure pushes up the value of agricultural land above its \nagricultural value, it threatens the end of family farms because the \nnext generation simply cannot afford to farm land valued at development \nprices. As some farmers sell their land for development, it places \nincreasing pressure on their neighbors to sell as well.\n  The 1996 Farm Bill recognized this problem by directly providing $35 \nmillion for farmland protection matching funds that have leveraged \nmillion more from local and private programs. The Farmland Protection \nProgram is a model of what new federal conservation programs ought to \nbe, enjoying the unanimous support of the National Governors \nAssociation. It preserves the private property rights of farmers.\n  It offers the Congress a way to demonstrate a realistic and \nmeaningful commitment to the conservation of America's natural heritage \nwithout expanding the role of the federal government, and it encourages \nlocal communities and states to contribute their own efforts. The \nprogram's overwhelming success though has led to increased demand for \nthe program--applicants requested a federal match of more than $130 \nmillion.\n  Our bill will help address some of this demand and encourage more \nstate governments, local communities and private groups to start new \nmatching programs. This modest federal investment will maintain our \ncommitment to the protection of our rural heritage and working \nlandscape.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Levin, Mr. Durbin, \n        and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 335. A bill to amend chapter 30 of title 39, United States Code, \nto provide for the nonmailability of certain deceptive matter relating \nto games of chance, administrative procedures, orders, and civil \npenalties relating to such matter, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n       DECEPTIVE MAIL PREVENTION AND ENFORCEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, during National Consumer \nProtection Week, I am introducing the Deceptive Mail Prevention and \nEnforcement Act, a comprehensive bill designed to stem the rising tide \nof deceptive mailings that are flooding the mailboxes of the people of \nMaine and people throughout the country.\n  I am very pleased to have the cosponsorship of a trio of \ndistinguished Senators in this regard: Senator Cochran, the chairman of \nthe subcommittee with legislative jurisdiction over these types of \nmailings, who has been a leader in the effort to curtail deceptive \nmailings and sweepstakes fraud; Senator Levin, who serves as the \nranking minority member of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, and who has played an active role not only in the \nhearings held last year, but also in introducing his own legislation on \nthis issue, which I am pleased to cosponsor. He has a longstanding \ninterest in curtailing deceptive mailings. I am also pleased to have \nthe support of Senator Durbin, with whom I have worked very closely on \nmany consumer issues.\n  Mr. President, several months ago, prompted by complaints that I have \nreceived from my constituents in Maine, I initiated an investigation \ninto sweepstakes fraud and deceptive mailings. Over the course of this \ninvestigation, I have seen countless examples of mailings that \ndeceptively promise extravagant prizes in order to entice consumers to \nmake unnecessary and unneeded purchases. Unfortunately, this calculated \nconfusion works far too often. In one particularly egregious example, \none deceptive mailing prompted some of its victims to fly to Florida, \nbelieving that they then would be the first to claim the grand prize \npromised in a major sweepstakes.\n  Deceptive mailings take many forms. One such form that I find \nparticularly offensive is ``Government look-alike mailings,'' which \nappear deceptively like a mailing from a Federal agency or other \nofficial entity. An example of such a deceptive mailing was recently \nsent to me by a woman from Machiasport, ME. The postcard that she \nreceived was marked ``Urgent Delivery, a Special Notification of Cash \nCurrently Being Held by the U.S. Government is ready for shipment to \nyou.'' I have blown up a copy of the postcard she received so you can \nsee just how deceptive this mailing was. On the back of the postcard, \nthe consumer was asked to send $9.97 to learn how to receive this cash. \nOf course, this was not a legitimate mailing from the Federal\n\n[[Page S1146]]\n\nGovernment, but simply a ploy used by an unscrupulous individual to \ntrick an unsuspecting consumer into sending money.\n  Mr. President, millions of Americans have received sweepstakes \nletters that use deceptive marketing ploys to encourage the purchase of \nmagazines and other products. A common tactic is a ``promise'' of \nwinning printed in large type, such as this example: ``You Were \nDeclared One of Our Latest Sweepstakes Winners and You're About to be \nPaid $833,337 in Cash.'' A constituent of mine from Portland, ME, \nreceived this mailing, but, of course, he wasn't really a winner. It \ntakes an awfully sharp eye and very careful scrutiny to notice the very \nfine print that states that the money is won only ``if you have and \nreturn the grand prize-winning number in time.''\n  Mr. President, thousands of consumers have made very frequent \npurchases, often of more than $1,000 a year, in response to deceptive \nsweepstakes mailings. I have heard sad stories from many people who \nhave described personal horror stories caused by these deceptive \nmailings. Some people have told me of their elderly parents spending \n$10,000, $20,000, even as much as $60,000 in one case, hoping that \ntheir next purchase would result in a large prize. Senior citizens are \nparticularly vulnerable, as they generally trust the statements made by \nthese marketing appeals, particularly if they are pitched by \ncelebrities, or if the mailing appears to be connected or in some way \nsanctioned by the Federal Government.\n  To increase consumer protections, and to punish those who use such \ndeceptive mailings to prey on our senior citizens, the bill that I am \nintroducing today, along with Senators Cochran, Levin and Durbin, will \nattack sweepstakes fraud and deceptive mailings on four fronts.\n  First, the bill will prevent fraud and deception by requiring \ncompanies to be more honest with the American people when using \nsweepstakes and other promotional mailings. My legislation would \nestablish new standards for sweepstakes, including clear disclosure. In \naddition, my legislation would strengthen the law against mailings that \nmimic Government documents. Mailings could not use any language or \ndevice that gives the appearance that the mailing is connected, \napproved, or endorsed by the Federal Government.\n  Second, this bill provides strong new financial penalties for sending \nmail that does not comply with these and existing standards. Civil \npenalties include fines ranging from $50,000 to $2 million would be \nallowed depending on the number of mailings sent.\n  Third, the bill strengthens Federal law enforcement efforts and makes \nthem more effective by giving the U.S. Postal Inspection Service \nadditional tools to combat these deceptive practices.\n  Fourth, my legislation would preserve the important role the States \nplay in fighting this type of fraud and deception. Our bill would not \npreempt States and local laws protecting consumers from fraudulent and \ndeceptive mailings.\n  Mr. President, hundreds of millions of these promotional materials \nare sent out each year to consumers across the country. By design, they \nare meant to confuse their recipients and to trick them into spending \nmoney needlessly under the false pretense that doing so will earn them \nhuge rewards.\n  As the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I \nwill shortly be holding hearings on this issue in the coming months to \ndocument the nature and extent of the problem and how these deceptive \nmailings affect Americans, particularly our senior citizens.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, particularly the \nsubcommittee's ranking member, Senator Levin, who has been such a \nleader in this area. It is my hope that Congress will enact the \nDeceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Improvement Act to increase \nconsumer protections, to improve law enforcement efforts, and to \nprovide effective penalties for those who deceive American consumers.\n  Mr. President, I yield any remaining time to the Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Maine for her \nleadership, her kind words, and for her bill, which I am proud to \ncosponsor. The bill I am introducing today, with her support and the \nsupport of Senator Durbin, addresses the same kinds of practices. These \ntwo bills together, if adopted, would go a long way toward addressing \nthe deceptive mailing practices that we see under the general heading \nof ``sweepstakes.''\n  The bill that I am introducing, with the cosponsorship of Senator \nCollins and Senator Durbin, will help eliminate the deceptive practices \nin mailings that use games of chance, like sweepstakes, to induce \nconsumers to purchase a product that they may not need and to play a \ngame that they will not win.\n  I originally introduced this bill last year. It was not enacted. It \nwas introduced late in the session. I am very hopeful that this bill \nand Senator Collins' bill will be enacted this year following the \nhearings that she has just described--important hearings which I \ncommend our chairman of the subcommittee for scheduling, for \ninitiating.\n  The bill that I am introducing--this part of the remedy for the \ncurrent abuses--will stiffen the penalties for deceptive mailings, will \ngive the Postal Service administrative subpoena power, will restrict \nthe use of misleading language and symbols, and require better \ndisclosure about chances of winning and statements that no purchase is \nnecessary to win.\n  The elderly are easy prey for the gimmicks used in these kinds of \ncontests, such as a large notice declaring the recipient a winner--\noftentimes a ``guaranteed'' winner or one of two final competitors for \na large cash prize--and these gimmicks have proliferated to the point \nthat American consumers are being duped into purchasing products they \ndon't want or need because they think they have won or will win a big \nprize if they do so. Complaints about these mailings are one of the top \nten consumer complaints in the nation. I have received numerous \ncomplaints from my constituents in Michigan asking that something be \ndone to provide relief from these very misleading mailings.\n  In early September 1998, we held a hearing in our Governmental \nAffairs Committee federal services subcommittee on the problem of \ndeceptive sweepstakes and other mailings involving games of chance. We \nlearned from three of our witnesses, the Florida Attorney General, the \nMichigan Assistant Attorney General and the Postal Inspection Service, \nthat senior citizens are particular targets of these deceptive \nsolicitations, because they are the most vulnerable. State Attorneys \nGeneral have taken action against many of the companies that use \ndeceptive mailings. The states have entered into agreements to stop the \nmost egregious practices, but the agreements apply only to the states \nthat enter into the agreements. This allows companies to continue their \ndeceptive practices in other states. That's one reason why federal \nlegislation in this area is needed. The bill I'm introducing today will \nhelp eliminate deceptive practices by prohibiting misleading \nstatements, requiring more disclosure, imposing a $10,000 civil penalty \nfor each deceptive mailing, and providing the Postal Service with \nadditional tools to pursue deceptive and fraudulent offenders.\n  Sweepstakes solicitations are put together by teams of clever \nmarketers who package their sweepstakes offers in such a way so as to \nget people to purchase a product by implying that the chances of \nwinning are enhanced if the product being offered is purchased.\n  That is not allowed. You cannot require that a purchase be made in \norder to win a prize. But these deceptive practices are such and they \nare so finely honed that, no matter what the fine print says about no \npurchase being necessary, the recipient of the mailing often is led to \nbelieve, by the nature of the mailing, that a purchase indeed will \nenhance the opportunity to win the prize. Senator Collins addresses the \nsum of those issues in her bill.\n  Rules and important disclaimers are written in fine print and hidden \naway in obscure sections of the solicitation or on the back of the \nenvelope that is frequently tossed away. Even when one can find and \nread the rules, it frequently takes a law degree to understand them.\n\n[[Page S1147]]\n\n  The bill I am introducing will help to protect consumers from \ndeceptive practices by directing the Postal Service to develop and \nissue regulations that restrict the use of misleading language and \nsymbols in direct mail game of chance solicitations, including \nsweepstakes. The bill also requires additional disclosure about chances \nof winning and the statement that no purchase is necessary. Any mail \nthat is designated by the Postal Service as being deceptive will not be \ndelivered. This will significantly reduce the deceptive practices being \nused in the direct mail industry to dupe unsuspecting consumers into \nthinking they are grand prize winners. The direct mail industry also \nwould benefit, in that the adverse publicity recently aimed at the \nindustry because of ``You Have Won a Prize'' campaigns has maligned the \nindustry as a whole. Cleaning up deceptive advertising could improve \nthe industry's image.\n  For those entities that continue to use deceptive mailings, my bill \nimposes a civil penalty of $10,000 for each piece of mail that violates \nPostal Service regulations. Currently the Postal Service can impose a \nfine for noncompliance with a Postal Service order. My bill imposes a \nfine whether or not the order actually has been issued. This has the \neffect of applying the penalty to the deceptive offense, not for \nnoncompliance with the order.\n  My bill also allows the Postal Service to quickly respond to changes \nin deceptive marketing practices by giving the Postal Service the \nauthority to draft regulations that will be effective against the \n``scheme du jour.'' A deceptive practice used today, may not be used \ntomorrow. As soon as the Post Office learns about one scheme, it \nchanges. If legislation is passed that requires a specific notice, it \ncan take just a short time before another deceptive practice pops up to \nby-pass the legislation. My bill gives the Postal Service the authority \nto evaluate what regulatory changes will be required to keep pace with \nthe ever changing deceptive practices. This will help weed out \ndeceptive practices in a timely manner.\n  The bill also gives the Postal Service administrative subpoena power \nto respond more quickly to deceptive and fraudulent mail schemes. \nCurrently the Postal Service must go through a lengthy administrative \nprocedure before it can get evidence to shut down illegal \noperations. Currently the $10,000 fine--and civil penalty which \nexists--can only be imposed for noncompliance with a Postal Service \norder. There has to be an order issued which is violated before there \ncan even be a civil fine. Our bill would impose a fine for violating \nthe law, a penalty for perpetrating the deceptive offense or practice, \nand it would not require that there be an order previously entered. By \nthe time the Postal Service gets through all the administrative hoops, \nthe sweepstakes promoter may have folded up operations and disappeared, \nor has destroyed all the evidence. By granting the Postal Service \nlimited subpoena authority to obtain relevant material records for an \ninvestigation, the Postal Service will be able to act more efficiently \nagainst illegal activities. Subpoena authority will make the Postal \nService more effective and efficient in its pursuit of justice.\n\n  The Deceptive Sweepstakes Mailings Elimination Act of 1999 takes a \ntough approach to dealing with sweepstakes solicitations and other \ngames of chance offerings that are sent through the mail. If you use \nsweepstakes or a game of chance to promote the sale of a legitimate \nproduct, provide adequate disclosure, and abide with Postal Service \nregulations, then the Postal Service will deliver that solicitation. If \ndeceptive practices are used in a sweepstakes or a game of chance \nsolicitation, the Postal Service will be able to stop the solicitation \nand impose a significant penalty.\n  So we are going to take a tough approach, both through Senator \nCollins' bill which I have cosponsored, through my bill which she has \ncosponsored, along with others, and this tough approach that is \nabsolutely essential if we are going to protect seniors and others from \nthe kind of deceptive practices which cost them so much money by \nencouraging them, through these practices, to buy items that they \nreally do not want in order to win prizes that truly are unlikely or \nimpossible to win.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Durbin and Mr. Collins):\n  S. 336. A bill to curb deceptive and misleading games of chance \nmailings, to provide Federal agencies with additional investigative \ntools to police such mailings, to establish additional penalties for \nsuch mailings, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n       deceptive games of chance mailings elimination act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Levin and Collins, today in introducing the \nDeceptive Games of Chance Mailing Elimination Act of 1999.\n  It's rare that any American household has escaped receipt of a flurry \nof envelopes boldly proclaiming ``You're our next million-dollar \nwinner!'' or similar claim of impending good fortune. Most of us \nrecognize these prominent lines as the special language of direct mail \nsweepstakes. While many companies have used sweepstakes responsibly, \nothers have bilked consumers out of millions of dollars by falsely \nsuggesting a purchase is necessary to qualify for the sweepstakes or to \nincrease the odds of winning a prize. Some of these operators promise \nfame and fortune, but they deliver fraud and false promises.\n  As Senator Levin has outlined, this bill sharpens the teeth of the \ncurrent postal statutes by directing the Postal Service to develop and \nissue rules that restrict the use of misleading language and symbols on \ndirect mail games of chance such as sweepstakes that mislead the \nrecipient into believing they've already won or will win a prize. This \nrulemaking authority will allow the Postal Service to respond more \nrapidly to emerging deceptive practices. The bill also requires that \nadditional disclosures be given to recipients of mailed solicitations \ninvolving sweepstakes giveaways about their chances of winning and that \nno purchase is necessary to enter the contest. Furthermore, the bill \ngives the Postal Service administrative subpoena power so it can react \nand respond more rapidly to deceptive and fraudulent mail schemes. \nUnder our bill, civil fines can be imposed upon the issuance of an \nenforcement order, or alternatively, in lieu of an enforcement order, \nrather than awaiting a violation of that order.\n  By giving the Postal Service these additional tools and authority, \nthis legislation will help combat the growing problem of consumer fraud \nin the form of deceptive or misleading mailings that use games of \nchance or sweepstakes contests to solicit the purchase of a product. \nOther deceptions have included packaging sweepstakes solicitations to \nclosely resemble government documents and promising recipients that \nthey have already won, even though the fine print reveals minuscule \nodds of winning.\n  The elderly are particularly vulnerable to sweepstakes fraud. Some \nsenior citizen sweepstakes recipients have traveled thousands of miles \nto claim prizes they thought they had been assured of winning. Others \nspend thousands of dollars on magazines and other merchandise because \nthey are convinced it will boost their chances of winning.\n  Like Senators Levin and Collins, I have heard from numerous \nconstituents about how some crafty purveyors prey on the public, often \npersons on fixed or limited incomes, through these deceptive envelopes \nand packaging techniques. Recently, one constituent related how her \nelderly mother has become ``hooked'' on sweepstakes. She shared with me \na bulky stack of envelopes, representing just a sample of the mailings. \nShe remarked how her mother is convinced that the company will think \nbetter of her if she orders lots of merchandise, and that buying more \nproducts will accord her special consideration and improve her chances \nto win a lucrative prize. She noted that some companies, by using \nclever typefaces, sophisticated and official-looking symbols, gimmicky \nlabels, and personalization, lead people to believe the company is \nwriting to them personally, and that the odds of winning are high. Her \nstory is but one example of what we have heard, and why it is so \nimportant to ensure that strong laws are enacted to address deceptive \npractices.\n  I am pleased that the United States Postal Inspector, the National \nFraud\n\n[[Page S1148]]\n\nInformation Center, the Direct Marketing Association, the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, and a special committee of the \nAssociation of Attorneys General are among those who are actively \nseeking ways to ensure that consumers are informed and protected from \ndishonest marketing ploys.\n  I look forward to the hearings planned by Senator Collins in the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations to examine the problem of \ndeceptive mailings and legislative solutions. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting enactment of legislation to promote more honesty \nby product marketers, clearer disclosure for consumers, tighter \npenalties for violators, and quicker and more effective enforcement \ntools for more rapid response to unscrupulous practices.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Mack, \n        Mr. Craig, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Warner, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Helms. Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Bond, Mr. Gorton, Mr. \n        Frist, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Allard, Mr. Grams, Mr. Kyl, \n        Mr. Roberts, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 337. A bill to preserve the balance of rights between employers, \nemployees, and labor organizations which is fundamental to our system \nof collective bargaining while preserving the rights of workers to \norganize, or otherwise engage in concerted activities protected under \nthe National Labor Relations Act; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    TRUTH IN EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am honored to have the opportunity \nto introduce today an important piece of legislation which will provide \nthousands of businesses in my home state of Arkansas and across the \nnation with a defense against an unscrupulous practice which is \nliterally crippling them. The Truth in Employment will protect these \nbusinesses and curtail the destructive abuse of the union tactic known \nas salting.\n  ``Salting abuse'' is the calculated practice of placing trained union \nprofessional organizers and agents in the non-union workplace whose \nsole purpose is to harass or disrupt company operation, apply economic \npressure, increase operating and legal costs, and ultimately put a \ncompany out of business. The objectives of these union agents are \naccomplished through filing frivolous and unfair labor practice \ncomplaints or discrimination charges against the employer with the \nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration (OSHA), and the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission (EEOC). Salting campaigns have been used successfully to \ncause economic harm to construction companies and are quickly expanding \ninto other industries across the country. It can cost employers \nanywhere from $5,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend him \nor herself against this practice.\n  Salting is not merely a union organizing tool. It has become an \ninstrument of economic destruction aimed at non-union companies. Union \nsend their agents into non-union workplaces under the guise of seeking \nemployment. Hiding behind the shield of the National Labor Relations \nAct, these ``salts'' use its provisions offensively to bring hardship \non their employers. They deliberately increase the operating costs of \ntheir employers through actions such as sabotage and frivolous \ndiscrimination complaints.\n  In the 1995 Town & Country decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that \npaid union organizers are ``employees'' within the meaning of the \nNational Labor Relations Act. Because of their broad interpretation of \nthis Act, employers who refuse to hire paid union employees or their \nagents violate the Act if they are shown to have discriminated against \nthe union salts.\n  This leaves employers in a precarious position. If employers refuse \nto hire union salts, they will file frivolous charges and accuse the \nemployer of discrimination. Yet, if salts are employed, they will \ncreate internal disruption through a pattern of dissension and \nharassment. They are not there to work--only to disrupt. In a classic \nexample of salting abuse, John Gaylor of Gaylor Electric had to fire \none employee after this refusal to wear his hard hat on his head. This \nemployee would strap the hard hat to his knee and then dare Gaylor to \nfire him because he said the employee manual stated only that he had to \nwear the hard hat, it didn't state where he had to wear it.\n  As a result of the salting abuse, whenever many small businesses make \nhiring decisions, the future of the company, and its very existence, \nmay be at stake. A wrong decision can mean frivolous charges, legal \nfees, and lost time, which may threaten the very existence of their \nbusiness.\n\n  I have received many accounts from across the nation of how salting \nabuse is affecting small businesses. The following examples were \nreceived as testimony in Congressional hearings. In my home state of \nArkansas, Little Rock Electrical Contractors, Inc. incurred in excess \nof $80,000 in legal fees over the course of one year to fight 72 unfair \nlabor practice charges, of which 20 were dismissed, 45 were set for \ntrial, and 7 were appealed. In Cape Elizabeth, Maine, over a period of \nfour years, Bay Electric incurred $100,000 in legal fees plus lost time \nto defend itself against 14 unfair labor practices, all of which were \ndismissed. In Delano, Minnesota, Wright Electric incurred $150,000 in \nlegal fees and lost between $200,000 and $300,000 in lost time to win \nthe dismissal of 14 of 15 unfair labor practices charges. And, in \nClearfield, Pennsylvania, R.D. Goss incurred $75,000 battling \napproximately 20 unfair labor practices; while all but one of the \ncharges were dismissed, the company was forced to close its doors after \ndoing business for thirty-eight years. Finally, in Union, Missouri, it \ncost the Companies $150,000 to win the dismissal of 47 unfair labor \npractices charges and to achieve one settlement for $200.\n  Another common salting abuse is for salts to actually create \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations and \nthen report those violations to OSHA. When the employer terminates \nthese individuals, they file frivolous unfair labor practices against \nthe employer. This results in wasted time and money, as well as bad \npublicity for the company.\n  These are just a few of the many examples of how devastating salting \nabuse can be to small businesses. What makes this practice even more \nappalling is how organized labor openly advocates its use. According to \nthe group, the ``Coalition For Fairness For Small Businesses And \nEmployees,'' the labor unions are even advocating this practice in \ntheir manuals.\n  The Union Organizing Manual of the International Brotherhood of \nElectrical Workers explains why salts are used. Their purpose is to \ngather information that will ``. . . shape the strategy the organizer \nwill use later in the campaign to threaten or actually apply the \neconomic pressure necessary to cause the employer to . . . raise his \nprices to recoup additional costs, scale back his business, leave the \nunion's jurisdiction, go out of business, and so on. . .''\n  Thomas J. Cook, a former ``salt,'' explained the ultimate goal of \nsalting abuse. Mr. Cook said, ``Salting has become a method to stifle \ncompetition in the marketplace, steal away employees, and to inflict \nfinancial harm on the competition.'' Mr. Cook concluded by stating that \n``[i]n a country where free enterprise and independence is so highly \nvalued, I find these activities nothing more than legalized \nextortion.''\n  The balance of rights must be restored between employers, employees \nand labor organizations. The Truth in Employment Act seeks to do this \nby inserting a provision in the National Labor Relations Act \nestablishing that an employer is not required to employ any person who \nis not a bona fide employee applicant, in that such person is seeking \nemployment for the primary purpose of furthering interests unrelated to \nthose of that employer. Furthermore, this legislation will continue to \nallow employees to organize and engage in activities designed to be \nprotected by the National Labor Relations Act.\n  This measure is not intended to undermine those legitimate rights or \nprotections. Employers will gain no ability to discriminate against \nunion membership or activities. This bill only seeks to stop the \ndestructive results of\n\n[[Page S1149]]\n\nsalting abuse. Salting abuse must be curtailed if we are to protect the \nsmall business owners and employees of this nation. This legislation \nwill insure these protections are possible.\n  It is for these reasons that I am introducing the Truth in Employment \nAct. I ask that my colleagues support this bill and restore fairness to \nthe American workplace.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 338. A bill to provide for the collection of fees for the making \nof motion pictures, television productions, and sound tracks in units \nof the Department of the Interior, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    National Park Service Commercial Filming Permit Fee Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the National Park \nService Commercial Filming Permit Fee Act of 1999. This bill gives the \nNational Park Service (NPS) and the National Wildlife Refuge System \n(NWRS) the authority to require fee-based permits for the use of Park \nService and National Wildlife Reserve lands in the production of motion \npictures, television programs, advertisements or other similar \ncommercial purposes. This bill is based on legislation which I \nintroduced in the 105th Congress, S. 1614.\n  Our National Parks are among our nation's most valuable resources. \nThe National Park Service Commercial Filming Permit Fee Act of 1999 \nwould help us to protect them and ensure that future generations will \nbe able to enjoy their beauty by making sure the parks are reimbursed \nfor their commercial use.\n  The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service already have a \nsimilar permit and fee system for commercial filming on public lands. \nIt doesn't make sense that our National Parks, which have been deemed \nto be even more precious by their designation, should be used \ncommercially for free. This is especially important now when taxpayers \nare facing increased fees to enter the national parks and more people \nare enjoying our natural wonders every year in record numbers.\n  My bill allows the National Park Service to collect a fair return fee \nwhen the American peoples' parks are used in these commercial media \nventures and then devotes those fees to the preservation of our \nNational Parks. Common sense directs us to do this, and I believe this \nbill is fair for the commercial users of our National Parks, and more \nimportantly, for the American taxpayers.\n  This bill builds upon progress made through hearings, conferences, \nand other valuable input received during the 105th Congress. The \nrevised legislative language reflects input from the administration, \nindustry groups--including the Motion Picture Association of America--\nand public interest groups such as the National Parks and Conservation \nAssociation. This bill is similar to legislation that my friend and \ncolleague from Colorado, Congressman Hefley, introduced in the 105th \nand reintroduced in the 106th Congress as H.R. 154.\n  Mr. President, I have letters from two key interested associations in \nsupport of my bill's goals. I ask unanimous consent that these letters \nof support from the Motion Picture Association of America and the \nNational Parks and Conservation Association and my bill be printed in \nthe Record. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 338\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. USE OF LAND; FEE AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Interior (referred to \n     in this Act as the ``Secretary'') may permit the use of land \n     and facilities in units administered by the Secretary for--\n       (A) motion picture production;\n       (B) television production;\n       (C) soundtrack production;\n       (D) the production of an advertisement using a prop or a \n     model; or\n       (E) any similar commercial project.\n       (2) Exception.--The Secretary shall not permit a use of \n     land or a facility described in paragraph (1) if the \n     Secretary determines that a proposed use--\n       (A) is not appropriate; or\n       (B) will impair the value or resources of the land or \n     facility.\n       (3) Bonding and insurance.--The Secretary may require a \n     bond, insurance, or such other means as is necessary to \n     protect the interests of the United States in connection with \n     an activity conducted under a permit issued under this Act.\n       (b) Fees.--\n       (1) In general.--For any use of land or a facility in a \n     unit described in subsection (a), the Secretary shall \n     assess--\n       (A) a reimbursement fee; and\n       (B) a special use fee.\n       (2) Reimbursement fee.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall require the payment of \n     a reimbursement fee in an amount that is not less than the \n     amount of any direct and indirect costs to the Government \n     incurred--\n       (i) in processing the application for a permit for a use of \n     land or facilities;

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ben: I am writing to you today about your legislation \n     dealing with the filming of motion pictures in national park \n     and public lands. I would like to lend my support for the aim \n     of this bill and pledge to work with you on some areas of \n     concern to our industry.\n       Right now, the National Parks Service cannot charge fees \n     for filming. Although the parks can be reimbursed for costs \n     of filming, these reimbursements do not provide real \n     financial support to the parks. As a result, park \n     administrators can become indifferent to filming, or even \n     hostile because their efforts to promote movie making in the \n     park don't produce for them any direct return.\n       Your legislation provides a reasonable solution by setting \n     forth a fee schedule that is predictable. We think the fee \n     schedule approach is an improvement over the ``fair market \n     value'' approach from previous legislation. The fee schedule \n     provides a more simple, clear and predictable way of \n     collecting fees. Furthermore, we urge you to limit the \n     factors as much as possible to the number of people in the \n     crew and the number of days in the shoot.\n       As the bill moves through the legislative process, we hope \n     to work with you further. A particular area of concern is the \n     provision related to regular visitor entrance fees.\n       All in all, I applaud your efforts. I know that you, \n     Senator are one who particularly appreciates the treasure of \n     our national park system and public lands. I am pleased that \n     the American movie, exhibited in over 150 countries, \n     advertises to the world the unduplicatable beauties of our \n     national parks, irreplaceable treasures which belong to the \n     American citizenry.\n       I look forward to working with you and your staff.\n           With great affection,\n     Jack Valenti.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    National Parks\n\n\n                                 and Conservation Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 1999.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: The National Parks and Conservation \n     Association appreciates your efforts to close the ``equity \n     gap'' between visitors to the National Park System and those \n     in Hollywood and on Madison Avenue who have profited from \n     their commercial use of the national parks.\n       For the past five decades, the National Park Service has \n     been prohibited from collecting anything but a nominal \n     permitting fee and a modest amount of cost recovery \n     (associated with monitoring filming activity and any \n     necessary site remediation) from those who undertake \n     commercial filming projects in our national parks. Yet, the \n     individuals and institutions using the parks as a backdrop \n     for their films, commercials, television programs, etc. have \n     profited handsomely.\n       It is grossly unfair to allow a few businesses to profit \n     from the parks while the visiting public is being asked to \n     pay more in entrance and use fees, and while the parks suffer \n     from a significant and ongoing budgetary shortfall.\n       We are optimistic that your legislation will help generate \n     the debate necessary to result in the remedying of this \n     inequity. Thank you for taking this first and positive step \n     towards solving this problem.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              William J. Chandler,\n                           Vice President for Conservation Policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 339. A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n            INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Inouye, to propose the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \nAmendments of 1999. The good Senator and I have sponsored this bill for \nthe past four years because of our continuing belief that we must \nstrengthen the Indian gaming law and protect the authority of tribal \ngovernments to engage in gaming activities.\n  Senator Inouye and I have sat through hundreds of hours of \ndiscussions with Indian tribes, the States and interested parties over \nthe expansion of Indian gaming. While the interest grows stronger in \namending IGRA, a proposal has not been endorsed by either the Tribes or \nthe States. Our intention in forwarding this bill is to once again set \nforth a balanced and fair discussion over necessary changes to the \nIndian gaming law.\n  The bill we are introducing today will provide for minimum federal \nstandards in the regulation and licensing of class II and III gaming as \nwell as all of the contractors, suppliers, and industries associated \nwith such gaming. This will be accomplished through the Federal Indian \nGaming Regulatory Commission which will be funded through assessments \non Indian gaming revenues and fees imposed on license applicants.\n  In addition, this bill is consistent with the 1987 decision of the \nU.S. Supreme Court in the case of California v. Cabazon Band of Mission \nIndians in that it neither expands or further restricts the scope of \nIndian gaming. The laws of each State would continue to be the basis \nfor determining what gaming activities may be available to an Indian \ntribe located in that State.\n  Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, Indian tribes are \nrequired to expend the profits from gaming activities to fund tribal \ngovernment operations or programs and to promote tribal economic \ndevelopment. Profits may only be distributed directly to the members of \nan Indian tribe under a plan which has been approved by the Secretary \nof Interior. Virtually all of the proceeds from Indian gaming \nactivities are used to fund the social welfare, education, and health \nneeds of the Indian tribes. Schools, health facilities, roads, and \nother vital infrastructure are being built by the Indian tribes with \nthe proceeds from Indian gaming.\n  In the years before the enactment of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \nand in the years since its enactment, we have heard concerns about the \npossibility for organized criminal elements to penetrate Indian gaming. \nI believe the Act provides for a very substantial regulatory role and \nlaw enforcement role by the States and Indian tribes in class III \ngaming and by the Federal government in Class II gaming. The record \nclearly shows that in the few instances of known criminal activity in \nclass III gaming, the Indian tribes have discovered the activity and \nhave sought Federal assistance in law enforcement.\n  Indian gaming will continue to be scrutinized because of its \nincreasing prominence in our nation's economy and political spectrum. I \nbelieve that any proposal to amend the Indian gaming law should respect \nboth the rights of the Indian tribes and the States, while recognizing \nthe benefits of well-regulated gaming to both Indian and non-Indian \ncommunities. I look forward to working with my colleagues and all \naffected entities on a continuing dialogue to protect the integrity of \nIndian gaming.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the item was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Sections 1-3 set forth the title, findings and purpose of \n     the Act.\n       Section 4 amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to revise \n     definitions.\n       Section 5 establishes (in lieu of the National Indian \n     Gaming Commission) the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory \n     Commission as an independent U.S. agency. It directs the \n     Commission to establish minimum Federal standards for \n     background investigations, internal control systems, and \n     licensing. The Commission is granted investigatory authority.\n       Section 6 sets forth the powers of the Chairperson of the \n     Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Commission.\n       Section 7 sets forth the powers and authority of the \n     Commission.\n       Section 8 sets forth the regulatory framework for class II \n     and III gaming.\n       Section 9 directs the President to establish the Advisory \n     Committee on Minimum Regulatory Requirements and Licensing \n     Standards.\n       Sections 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 set forth requirements for: \n     (1) licensing; (2) conduct of class I, II, and III gaming on \n     Indian lands; and (3) contract review.\n       Sections 15 and 16 set forth civil penalty and judicial \n     review provisions.\n       Sections 17 and 18 fund the Commission from authorized \n     appropriations and class II and III gaming fees.\n       Section 19 applies specified tax withholding and bank \n     reporting requirements to Indian gaming operations. Requires \n     the Commission to make certain law enforcement information \n     available to State and tribal authorities.\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 340. A bill to amend the Cache La Poudre River Corridor Act to \nmake technical corrections, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    technical corrections to the cache la poudre river corridor act\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to amend the \nCache La Poudre River Corridor Act to make technical corrections.\n  This Act became Public Law on October 19, 1996 thanks to the \ndiligence and hard work of Senator Brown, my predecessor. The purpose \nof this Act is to designate the Cache La Poudre Corridor with the Cache \nLa Poudre River Basin. The Poudre Corridor provides an educational and \ninspirational benefit to both present and future generations, as well \nas unique and significant contributions to our national heritage of \ncultural and historical lands, waterways, and structures within the \nCorridor.\n  It is important that the following technical corrections be made to \nensure that this act is interpreted and implemented correctly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 342. A bill to authorize appropriations for the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and \n2002, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\nthe national aeronautics and space administration authorization act for \n                        fy 2000, 2001, and 2002\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the authorization bill \nfor the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal years \n2000, 2001, and 2002.\n  NASA's unique mission of exploration, discovery, and innovation has \npreserved America's role as both a world leader in aviation and the \npreeminent spacefaring nation. It is NASA's mission to:\n  Explore, use, and enable the development of space for human \nenterprise;\n  Advance scientific knowledge and understanding of the Earth, the \nSolar System, and the Universe and utilize the environment of space for \nresearch; and\n  Research, develop, verify and transfer advanced aeronautics, space \nand related technologies.\n  This bill is essentially the same as reported by the Commerce \nCommittee last year. It contains provisions that had bi-partisan \nsupport and would have been included in a manager's amendment had the \nbill been brought up for discussion on the Senate floor.\n  The bill, which authorizes $13.4 billion for NASA in FY 2000, $13.8 \nbillion for FY 2001, and $13.9 billion for FY 2002, provides for the \ncontinued development of the International Space Station, Space Shuttle \noperations and safety and performance upgrades, space science, life and \nmicro gravity sciences and applications, the Earth Science program, \naeronautics and space transportation technology, mission \ncommunications, academic programs, mission support and the Office of \nthe Inspector General.\n  The FY 2000 levels are consistent with the President's request with \nthe exception of a reduction of $200 million for the International \nSpace Station account. This reduction eliminates the funding requested \nfor the Russian Program Assurance activities. I feel that it is only \nappropriate to withhold judgement on providing additional funding to \nassist Russia with their financial problems until NASA provides \nadditional explanation on how these funds will be used. The situation \nin Russia is changing daily and we must fully understand the impact on \nthe Station schedule and overall cost before committing more funds.\n  The FY 2001 and FY 2002 levels represent a 3 percent increase over \nthe previous year's amount with the exception of the Space Station. The \nSpace Station has been authorized in accordance with NASA outyear \nprojections for FY 2001 and FY 2002.\n  The bill contains a price cap on the development costs of the \nInternational Space Station. The price cap language provides NASA with \nadditional funding Space Station development and allows for additional \nSpace Shuttle flights by exempting certain activities at the point when \nresearch, operating and crew return vehicles activities' costs comprise \nmore than 95 percent of the annual funding for the Station. At this \npoint, the majority of the activities are truly beyond the development \nphase of the project.\n  The bill provides for liability cross-waivers for the Space Station. \nThe provision authorizes, but does not require NASA to enter into \nagreements with any cooperating party participating in the Space \nStation program, whereby all involved parties agree to take the risk of \ndamage to their own assets, and agrees not to sue other entities. These \ncross waivers would not apply in the case of sabotage or other \ndeliberate and willful acts.\n  NASA has indicated that these liability cross-waivers will be needed \nto fully commercialize the Space Station. I support the \ncommercialization of the Station as a means of achieving a return on \ninvestment for the public through the creation of new industries and \njobs for the Nation.\n  I am concerned with the cost and schedule delays in other programs as \nwell. The X-33 test vehicle and the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics \nFacility programs represents major investments of public funds and \ntherefore should be managed such that program requirements are met in a \ntimely manner.\n  The balance between manned and unmanned flight, as well as the \nbalance between fundamental science and development activities, is in \nneed of review. I intend to pursue these balances further when the \nCommerce Committee holds hearings on the NASA budget and associated \nactivities in the upcoming weeks.\n  Therefore, I, along with my co-sponsors, urge the Members of this \nbody to support this bill and allow NASA to continue its mission of \nsupport for all space flight, for technological progress in \naeronautics, and for space science.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) authorization bill \nfor fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. As Chairman of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, I am able to work closely with \nNASA and to review the agency's achievements on a continual basis. I am \nproud of NASA's accomplishments and want to applaud its sustained \ndominance throughout the world as the premier leader in basic \naeronautics and space research.\n  Yet leadership has a price. All one has to do is open the newspaper \nto learn about NASA's endless difficulties with the International Space \nStation, the agency's most comprehensive and complex endeavor to date.\n  This one-of-a-kind research facility bears a lifetime price tag of \napproximately $100 billion dollars to the American taxpayers. Although \nthis program is a long-term investment which will bring discoveries \nunimaginable to scientists today, it is our duty to protect the \nAmerican people from the repeated inconsistent performance of the \nparticipating foreign partners, prime contractor, and program managers.\n  During the 105th Congress, I offered an important amendment to this \nlegislation that would impose a price cap on the development costs of \nthe International Space Station. The language would ensure maximum \nprogram flexibility by providing NASA additional funding for Space \nShuttle flights to service the Station, and by exempting specific \nactivities when development costs are 5 percent or less of the \nStation's annual budget. I will again personally encourage my \nCongressional colleagues to enact a cost-cap measure this year to \nimpose some semblance of fiscal restraint, however, it is up to NASA to \nprove that it is a responsible steward of public resources.\n  The recent political and economic uncertainty in Russia has only \nexacerbated the development delay of the Russian components. Congress \nmust pledge to work with NASA to bring further accountability to the \nSpace Station if the United States is going to continue its leadership, \nboth financially and managerially.\n  NASA is not, and should not become a one mission agency. Congress \nmust ensure that the Space Station does not impede progress on NASA's \nother important programs such as the Reusable Launch Vehicle, commonly \nreferred to as the RLV.\n  During the past year Congress has expressed its grave concerns about \nthe alleged illegal transfers of U.S. missile technology to China and \nother nondemocratic nations. Yet, neither the\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\ntransferring of licensing control from the Commerce Department back to \nState, nor an embargo on foreign launches will solve the underlying \nissues which result in American companies choosing foreign launch \nsites. Additional work is needed to substantially change the current \nenvironment for the domestic commercial launch industry.\n  What the community needs is cheaper access to space including less \nexpensive vehicles, launching costs, and insurance. The X-33, a joint \nventure between NASA and private industry, and X-34 programs are \nexamples of promising flight demonstrators which will lead the path to \nstimulating the industry.\n  Mr. President, we are at a unique juncture in the history of space \ndiscovery. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and to \nhelp restore Congressional confidence in NASA and the Nation's valuable \nspace program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 341. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe amount allowable for qualified adoption expenses, to permanently \nextend the credit for adoption expenses, and to adjust the limitations \non such credit for inflation, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                         HOPE FOR CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Hope for Children \nAct, which is also being introduced today in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Tom Bliley of Virginia.\n  I think all of us--no matter what party or philosophy--share the hope \nthat every child in the world has a loving, permanent home. The Hope \nfor Children Act is aimed at making that hope a reality for more \nchildren, by making it possible for more families to open their homes \nand hearts to a child through adoption.\n  In the past few years, Congress has taken a number of steps to \npromote adoption in this country. I commend my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle and in both chambers for their dedication to this effort. \nAs an adoptive father myself, and co-chair of the bipartisan, bicameral \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption, I've been pleased to see more and \nmore American families formed through adoption, and I sincerely believe \nthe work of Congress has been a contributing factor.\n  However, we have some unfinished business to take care of, and that's \nwhat I'm here to talk about today.\n  Many of my colleagues will remember back in 1996, we succeeded in \nenacting a tax credit for adoption expenses. We did so, because we \nrealized that adopting families face extraordinary challenges: not only \nmust they forge a new family unit while navigating a labyrinth of legal \nor regulatory requirements, but they also have financial challenges \nabove and beyond the usual expenses of caring for and raising children. \nThe cost of adoption can easily push into the tens of thousands of \ndollars, counting legal fees, travel, medical bills and other expenses. \nAll too often, it is the financial challenge that becomes an \ninsurmountable obstacle to bringing a child who is alone in the world \ntogether with a loving family.\n  We knew the adoption tax credit wouldn't eliminate the expense of \nadoption outright, but would only allow eligible adoptive families to \nkeep a bit more of their own hard-earned income to devote to those \nexpenses. As a result, adoptive parents may be eligible to receive a \ntax credit of $5000 to help cover out-of-pocket expenses related to \neach adoption, or a $6000 tax credit for the adoption of a ``special \nneeds'' child.\n  If the comments I've been hearing from families across the nation are \nany gauge, the credit has helped make adoption a reality for a lot of \nchildren. As more individuals explore the adoption option, they are \nfinding the credit a small but significant cushion against the \nfinancial impact. Even so, I've received a number of constructive \nsuggestions from families as to how the adoption tax credit could be \nimproved, to make it more effective in promoting adoption in the United \nStates.\n  Furthermore, back in 1996 when we originally debated this matter, \nthere were political and fiscal considerations that caused Congress to \ninclude a sunset provision for the adoption tax credit. Unless we act \nsoon to extend this enormously helpful tool, it will expire.\n  For all of those reasons, I am introducing the Hope for Children Act. \nIt builds on the work done by our previous Congress, to improve and \nextend the adoption tax credit.\n  Specifically, it would make the tax credit permanent, and adjust it \nfor inflation. It would also exclude the credit from calculation of the \nalternative minimum tax. The full credit would be available for \ntaxpayers with adjusted gross incomes under $150,000; those with \nadjusted gross incomes between $150,000 and $190,000 would be able to \ntake a reduced credit. No credit would be available to those with \nadjusted gross incomes of more than $190,000.\n  I should say at this point that I do not think this bill is the final \nword on the subject.

Mr. President, small businesses today face enormous burdens \nwhen it comes to taxes. Each year they pay a growing portion of their \nrevenues on income, employment, and excise taxes. Yet even before they \nwrite the tax check, they spend more than 5% of their revenues just to \ncomply with the tax laws. These revenues are spent on accountants, \nbookkeepers, and lawyers to sort out the countless pages of tax laws, \nregulations, forms, instructions, rulings, and other guidance published \nby the IRS. In addition, small business owners must dedicate valuable \ntime and energy on day-to-day recordkeeping and other compliance \nrequirements, all of which keep them from doing what they do best--\nrunning their business.\n\n  As the Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have heard from \nsmall business owners in Missouri and across this country that they are \nmore than willing to pay their fair share of taxes. But what they \nobject to is paying high tax bills and vast amounts for professional \ntax assistance only to end up the victim of an unfair tax code.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will \neliminate two major sources of that unfairness and provide a level \nplaying field for the millions of men and women who work exceedingly \nhard to make their small enterprises a success. These bills are common-\nsense measures that respond to the calls from small businesses for tax \nfairness and simplicity.\n  My first bill, the ``Self-Employed Health Insurance Fairness Act of \n1999,'' will end one of the most glaring inequities that has existed in \nour tax law--the deductibility of health-insurance costs for the self-\nemployed. For nearly five years, I have been working to see that the \nself-employed receive equal treatment when it comes to the \ndeductibility of health insurance.\n  During the 105th Congress, we made substantial progress. First, in \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we broke through the long-standing cap \non the deduction to provide 100% deductibility. Then, last Fall, we \npassed legislation that will speed up the date that self-employed \npersons can fully deduct their health-insurance costs to 2003. We also \nsignificantly increased the deductible amounts in the intervening years \nover the prior law. While I strongly supported these improvements, the \nself-employed still cannot wait four more years for 100% deductibility \nwhen their large corporate competitors have long been able to deduct \nsuch costs in full.\n  With the self-employed able to deduct only 60% of their health-\ninsurance costs today, it comes as no surprise that nearly a quarter of \nthe self-employed still do not have health insurance. In fact, five \nmillion Americans live in families headed by a self-employed individual \nand have no health insurance. And those families include 1.3 million \nchildren who lack adequate health-insurance coverage.\n  Mr. President, it is time to finish the job once and for all in this \nCongress. My bill will increase the deductibility of health insurance \nfor the self-employed to 100% beginning this year. A full deduction \nwill make health insurance more affordable to the self-employed and \nhelp them and their families get the health insurance coverage that \nthey need and deserve.\n  The ``Self-Employed Health Insurance Fairness Act'' also corrects \nanother inequity in the tax law affecting the self-employed who try to \nprovide health insurance for themselves, their families, and their \nemployees. Under current law, the self-employed lose all of the health-\ninsurance deduction if they are eligible to participate in another \nhealth-insurance plan--whether or not they actually participate.\n  This provision affects self-employed individuals like Steve Hagan in \nmy hometown of Mexico, Missouri. Mr. Hagan is a financial planner who \nruns his own small business. Although he has a group medical plan for \nhis employees, Mr. Hagan cannot deduct the cost of covering himself or \nhis family simply because his wife is eligible for health insurance \nthrough her employer. The inequity is clear. Why should he be able to \ndeduct the insurance costs for his employees but not for himself and \nhis family? What if the insurance available through his wife's employer \ndoes not meet the needs of their family?\n  Besides being patently unfair, this is also an enormous trap for the \nunwary. Imagine the small business owner who learns that she can now \ndeduct 60% of her health-insurance costs this year, and with the extra \ndeduction, she can finally afford a group medical plan for herself and \nher employees. Then later in the year, her husband gets a new job that \noffers health insurance. Suddenly, her self-employed health-insurance \ndeduction is gone, and she is left with two choices. She can bear the \nentire cost of her family's coverage, or terminate the insurance \ncoverage for all her employees. The tax code should not force small \nbusiness owners into this kind of ``no win'' situation when they try to \nprovide insurance coverage for their employees and themselves.\n  My bill eliminates this problem by clarifying that the self-employed \nhealth-insurance deduction is limited only if the self-employed person \nactually participates in a subsidized health insurance plan offered by \na spouse's employer or through a second job. It's simply a matter of \nfairness, and a step we need to take now.\n  The second bill that I introduce today is the ``Independent \nContractor Simplification and Relief Act of 1999.'' This bill will \nprovide clear rules and relief for entrepreneurs seeking to be treated \nas independent contractors and for businesses needing to use \nindependent contractors. As the Chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee, I have heard from countless small business owners who are \ncaught in the environment of fear and confusion that now surrounds the \nclassification of workers. This situation is stifling the \nentrepreneurial spirit of many small business owners who find that they \ndo not have the flexibility to conduct their businesses in a manner \nthat makes the best economic sense and that serves their personal and \nfamily goals.\n  The root of this problem is found in the IRS' test for determining \nwhether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee. Over the \npast three decades, the IRS has relied on a 20-factor test based on the \ncommon law to make this determination. On first blush, a 20-factor test \nsounds like a reasonable approach--if a taxpayer demonstrates a \nmajority of the factors, he is an independent contractor. Not \nsurprisingly, the IRS' test is not that simple. It is a complex set of \nextremely subjective criteria with no clear weight assigned to any of \nthe factors. As a result, small business taxpayers are not able to \npredict which of the 20 factors will be most important to a particular \nIRS agent, and finding a certain number of these factors in any given \ncase does not guarantee the outcome.\n  To make matters worse, the IRS' determination inevitably occurs two \nor three years after the parties have determined in good faith that \nthey have an independent-contractor relationship. And the consequences \ncan be devastating. The business recipient of the services is forced to \nreclassify the independent contractor as an employee and must pay the \npayroll taxes the IRS says should have been collected in the prior \nyears. Interest and penalties are also piled on. The result for many \nsmall businesses is a tax bill that bankrupts the company. But that's \nnot the end of the story. The IRS then goes after the service provider, \nwho is now classified as an employee, and disallows a portion of her \nbusiness expenses--again resulting in additional taxes, interest and \npenalties.\n  Mr. President, all of us in this body recognize that the IRS is \ncharged with\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\nthe duty of collecting Federal revenues and enforcing the tax laws. The \nproblem in this case is that the IRS is using a procedure that is \npatently unfair and subjective. And the result is that businesses must \nspend thousands of dollars on lawyers and accountants to try to satisfy \nthe IRS' procedures, but with no certainty that the conclusions will be \nrespected. That's no way for businesses to operate in today's rapidly \nchanging economy.\n  For its part, the IRS has adopted a worker classification training \nmanual, which according to the agency is an ``attempt to identify, \nsimplify, and clarify the relevant facts that should be evaluated in \norder to accurately determine worker classification * * *.'' There can \nbe no more compelling reason for immediate action on this issue. The \nIRS' training manual is more than 150 pages. If it takes that many \npages to teach revenue agents how to ``simplify and clarify'' this \nsmall business tax issue, I think we can be sure how simple and clear \nit is going to seem to taxpayers who try to figure it out on their own.\n  The ``Independent Contractor Simplification and Relief Act'' is based \non the provisions of my Home-Based Business Fairness Act, which I \nintroduced at the start of the 105th Congress. My bill removes the need \nfor so many pages of instruction on the 20-factor test by establishing \nclear rules for classifying workers based on objective criteria. Under \nthese criteria, if there is a written agreement between the parties, \nand if an individual demonstrates economic independence and \nindependence with respect to the workplace, he will be treated as an \nindependent contractor rather than an employee. And the service \nrecipient will not be treated as an employer. In addition, individuals \nwho perform services through their own corporation or limited \nliability company will also qualify as independent contractors as long \nas there is a written agreement and the individuals provide for their \nown benefits.\n\n  The safe harbor is simple, straightforward, and final. To take \nadvantage of it, payments above $600 per year to an individual service \nprovider must be reported to the IRS, just as is required under current \nlaw. This will help ensure that taxes properly due to the Treasury will \ncontinue to be collected.\n  Mr. President, the IRS contends that there are millions of \nindependent contractors who should be classified as employees, which \ncosts the Federal government billions of dollars a year. This assertion \nis plainly incorrect. Classification of a worker has no cost to the \ngovernment. What costs the government are taxpayers who do not pay \ntheir taxes. My bill has three requirements that I believe will improve \ncompliance among independent contractors using the new rules I propose. \nFirst, there must be a written agreement between the parties--this will \nput the independent contractor on notice at the beginning that he is \nresponsible for his own tax payments. Second, the new rules will not \napply if the service recipient does not comply with the reporting \nrequirements and issue 1099s to individuals who perform services. \nThird, an independent contractor operating through his own corporation \nor limited liability company must file all required income and \nemployment tax returns in order to be protected under the bill.\n  In the last Congress, concerns were raised that permitting \nindividuals who provide their services through their own corporation or \nlimited liability company to qualify as independent contractors would \nlead to abusive situations at the expense of workers who should be \ntreated as employees. To prevent this option from being abused, I have \nadded language that limits the number of former employees that a \nservice recipient may engage as independent contractors under the \nincorporation option. This limit will protect against misuse of the \nincorporation option while still allowing individuals to start their \nown businesses and have a former employer as one of their initial \nclients.\n  Another major concern of many businesses and independent contractors \nis the issue of reclassification. My bill provides relief to these \ntaxpayers when the IRS determines that a worker was misclassified. \nUnder my bill, if the business and the independent contractor have a \nwritten agreement, if the applicable reporting requirements were met, \nand if there was a reasonable basis for the parties to believe that the \nworker is an independent contractor, then an IRS reclassification will \nonly apply prospectively. This provision gives important peace of mind \nto small businesses that act in good faith by removing the \nunpredictable threat of retroactive reclassification and substantial \ninterest and penalties.\n  A final provision of this legislation, Mr. President, is the repeal \nof section 1706 of the 1986 Tax Reform Act. This section affects \nbusinesses that engage technical service providers, such as engineers, \ndesigners, drafters, computer programmers, and systems analysts. In \ncertain cases, Section 1706 precludes these businesses from applying \nthe reclassification protections under section 530 of the Revenue Act \nof 1978. When section 1706 was enacted, its proponents argued that \ntechnical service workers were less compliant in paying their taxes. \nLater examination of this issue by the Treasury Department found that \ntechnical service workers are in fact more likely to pay their taxes \nthan most other types of independent contractors. This revelation \nunderscores the need to repeal section 1706 and level the playing field \nfor individuals in these professions.\n\n  In the last two Congresses, proposals to repeal section 1706 enjoyed \nwide bipartisan support. The bill I introduce today is designed to \nlevel the playing field for individuals in these professions by \nproviding the businesses that engage them with the same protections \nthat businesses using other types of independent contractors have \nenjoyed for more than 20 years.\n  Mr. President, the bills I introduce today are common-sense measures \nthat answer small business' urgent plea for fairness and simplicity in \nthe tax law. As we work toward the day when the entire tax law is based \non these principles, we can make a difference today by enacting these \ntwo bills. Entrepreneurs have waited too long--let's get the job done!\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a \ncopy of each bill and a description of its provisions.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 343\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Self-Employed Health \n     Insurance Fairness Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEDUCTION FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS OF SELF-EMPLOYED \n                   INDIVIDUALS INCREASED.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 162(l)(1) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to special rules for health insurance \n     costs of self-employed individuals) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) Allowance of deduction.--In the case of an individual \n     who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), \n     there shall be allowed as a deduction under this section an \n     amount equal to the amount paid during the taxable year for \n     insurance which constitutes medical care for the taxpayer, \n     the taxpayer's spouse, and dependents.''\n       (b) Clarification of Limitations on Other Coverage.--The \n     first sentence of section 162(l)(2)(B) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows: \n     ``Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any taxpayer for any \n     calendar month for which the taxpayer participates in any \n     subsidized health plan maintained by any employer (other than \n     an employer described in section 401(c)(4)) of the taxpayer \n     or the spouse of the taxpayer.''\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1998.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Self-Employed Health Insurance Fairness Act of 1999--Description of \n                               Provisions\n\n       The bill amends section 162(l)(1) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code to increase the deduction for health-insurance costs for \n     self-employed individuals to 100% beginning on January 1, \n     1999. Currently the self-employed can only deduct 60% percent \n     of these costs. The deduction is not scheduled to reach 100% \n     until 2003, under the provisions of the Omnibus Consolidated \n     and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1998, which \n     was signed into law in October 1998. The bill is designed to \n     place self-employed individuals on an equal footing with \n     large businesses, which can currently deduct 100% of the \n     health-insurance costs for all of their employees.\n       The bill also corrects a disparity under current law that \n     bars a self-employed individual from deducting any of his or \n     her health-insurance costs if the individual is eligible to \n     participate in another health-insurance plan. This provision \n     affects self-employed individuals who are eligible for, but\n\n[[Page S1155]]\n\n     do not participate in, a health-insurance plan offered \n     through a second job or through a spouse's employer. That \n     insurance plan may not be adequate for the self-employed \n     business owner, and this provision prevents the self-employed \n     from deducting the costs of insurance policies that do meet \n     the specific needs of their families. In addition, this \n     provision provides a significant disincentive for self-\n     employed business owners to provide group health insurance \n     for their employees. The bill ends this disparity by \n     clarifying that a self-employed person loses the deduction \n     only if he or she actually participates in another health-\n     insurance plan.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 344\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Independent Contractor \n     Simplification and Relief Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The bill is designed to provide certainty for \n     businesses that enter into independent-contractor \n     relationships and minimize the risk of huge tax bills for \n     back taxes, interest, and penalties if a worker is \n     misclassified after the parties have entered into an \n     independent-contractor relationship in good faith.\n\n\n                 Clear Rules for Worker Classification\n\n       Under the bill's new worker-classification rules, an \n     individual will be treated as an independent contractor and \n     the service recipient will not be treated as an employer if \n     either of two tests is met--the ``general test'' or the \n     ``incorporation test.''\n       General Test: The general test requires that the \n     independent contractor demonstrate economic independence and \n     workplace independence and have a written contract with the \n     service recipient.\n       Economic independence exists if the independent contractor \n     has the ability to realize a profit or loss and agrees to \n     perform services for a particular amount of time or to \n     complete a specific result or task. In addition, the \n     independent contractor must either incur unreimbursed \n     expenses that are consistent with industry practice and that \n     equal at least 2% of the independent contractor's adjusted \n     gross income from the performance of services during the \n     taxable year, or have a significant investment in the assets \n     of his or her business.\n       Workplace independence exists if one of the following \n     applies: the independent contractor has a principal place of \n     business (including a ``home office'' as expanded by the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997); he or she performs services at \n     more than one service recipient's facilities; he or she pays \n     a fair-market rent for the use of the service recipient's \n     facilities; or the independent contractor uses his or her own \n     equipment.\n       The written contract between the independent contractor and \n     the service recipient must provide that the independent \n     contractor will not be treated as an employee and is \n     responsible for his or her own taxes.\n       Incorporation Test: Under this test, an individual will be \n     treated as an independent contractor if he or she conducts \n     business through a corporation or a limited liability \n     company. In addition, the independent contractor must be \n     responsible for his or her own benefits, instead of receiving \n     benefits from the service recipient. The independent \n     contractor must also have a written contract with the service \n     provider stating that the independent contractor will not be \n     treated as an employee and is responsible for his or her own \n     taxes.\n       To prevent the incorporation test from being abused, the \n     bill limits the number of former employees that a service \n     recipient may engage as independent contractors under this \n     test. The limitation is based on the number of people \n     employed by the service recipient in the preceding year and \n     is equal to the greater of 10 persons or 3% of the service \n     recipient's employees in the preceding year. For example, \n     Business X has 500 employees in 1998. In 1999 up to 15 \n     employees (the greater of 3% of Business X's 1998 employees \n     or 10 individuals) could incorporate their own businesses and \n     still have Business X as one of their initial clients. This \n     limitation would not affect the number of incorporated \n     independent contractors who were not former employees of the \n     service recipient or independent contractors meeting the \n     general test.\n       Additional Provisions: The new worker-classification rules \n     also apply to three-party situations in which the independent \n     contractor is paid by a third party, such as a payroll \n     company, rather than directly by the service recipient. The \n     new worker-classification rules, however, will not apply to a \n     service recipient or a third-party payor if they do not \n     comply with the existing reporting requirements and file \n     1099s for individuals who work as independent contractors. A \n     limited exception is provided for cases in which the failure \n     to file a 1099 is due to reasonable cause and not willful \n     neglect.\n       New Worker-Classification Rules Do Not Replace Other \n     Options: In the event that the new worker-classification \n     rules do not apply, the bill makes clear that the independent \n     contractor or service recipient can still rely on the 20-\n     factor common law test or other provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code applicable in determining whether an individual \n     is an independent contractor or employee. In addition, the \n     bill does not limit any relief to which a taxpayer may be \n     entitled under Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. The \n     bill also makes clear that the new rules will not be \n     construed as a prerequisite for these other provisions of the \n     law.\n\n\n                      Relief From Reclassification\n\n       The bill provides relief from reclassification by the IRS \n     of an independent contractor as an employee. For many service \n     recipients who make a good-faith effort to classify the \n     worker correctly, this event can result in extensive \n     liability for back employment taxes, interest, and penalties.\n       Relief Under the New Worker-Classification Rules: The bill \n     provides relief for cases in which a worker is treated as an \n     independent contractor under the new worker-classification \n     rules and the IRS later contends that the new rules do not \n     apply. In that case, the burden of proof will fall on the \n     IRS, rather than the taxpayer, to prove that the new worker-\n     classification rules do not apply. To qualify for this relief \n     the taxpayer must demonstrate a credible argument that it was \n     reasonable to treat the service provider as an independent \n     contractor under the new rules, and the taxpayer must fully \n     cooperate with reasonable requests from the IRS.\n       Protection Against Retroactive Reclassification: If the IRS \n     notifies a service recipient that an independent contractor \n     should have been classified as an employee (under the new or \n     old rules), the bill provides that the IRS' determination can \n     become effective only 30 days after the date that the IRS \n     sends the notification. To qualify for this provision, the \n     service recipient must show that:\n       there was a written agreement between the parties;\n       the service recipient satisfied the applicable reporting \n     requirements for all taxable years covered by the contract; \n     and\n       there was a reasonable basis for determining that the \n     independent contractor was not an employee and the service \n     provider made the determination in good faith.\n       The bill provides similar protection for independent \n     contractors who are notified by the IRS that they should have \n     been treated as an employee.\n       The protection against retroactive reclassification is \n     intended to remove some of the uncertainty for businesses \n     contracting with independent contractors, especially those \n     who must use the IRS's 20-factor common law test. While the \n     bill would prevent the IRS from forcing a service recipient \n     to treat an independent contractor as an employee for past \n     years, the bill makes clear that a service recipient or an \n     independent contractor can still challenge the IRS's \n     prospective reclassification of an independent contractor \n     through administrative or judicial proceedings.\n\n\n           Repeal of Section 1706 of the Revenue Act of 1978\n\n       The bill repeals section 530(d) of the Revenue Act of 1978, \n     which was added by section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of \n     1986. This provision precludes businesses that engage \n     technical service providers (e.g., engineers, designers, \n     drafters, computer programmers, systems analysts, and other \n     similarly qualified individuals) in certain cases from \n     applying the reclassification protections under section 530. \n     The bill is designed to level the\n\n[[Page S1157]]\n\n     playing field for individuals in these professions by \n     providing the businesses that engage them with the same \n     protections that businesses using other types of independent \n     contractors have enjoyed for more than 20 years.\n\n\n                            Effective Dates\n\n       In general, the independent-contractor provisions of the \n     bill, including the new worker- classification rules, will be \n     effective for services performed after the date of enactment \n     of the bill. The protection against retroactive \n     reclassification will be effective for IRS determinations \n     after the date of enactment, and the repeal of section 530(d) \n     will be effective for periods ending after the date of \n     enactment of the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 345. A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to remove the \nlimitation that permits interstate movement of live birds, for the \npurpose of fighting, to States in which animal fighting is lawful; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                    amendment to animal welfare act\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to amend the \nAnimal Welfare Act to remove the limitation that permits interstate \nmovement of live birds for the purpose of fighting to States in which \nanimal fighting is lawful.\n  Currently, the Animal Welfare Act makes it unlawful for any person to \nknowingly sponsor or exhibit an animal in any animal fighting venture \nto which the animal was moved in interstate or foreign commerce. This \nmeans that if an animal crosses state lines and then fights in a state \nwhere cockfighting is not legal, that is a crime. However, the law \nfurther states, ``the activities prohibited by such subsections shall \nbe unlawful with respect to fighting ventures involving live birds only \nif the fight is to take place in a State where it would be in violation \nof the laws thereof.'' This means that the law applies to all animals \ninvolved in all types of fighting--except for birds being transported \nfor cockfighting purposes to a state where cockfighting is still legal. \nBecause of the loophole, law enforcement officers have a more difficult \ntime prosecuting under their state cockfighting bans.\n  As introduced this legislation will close the loophole on \ncockfighting, and prohibit interstate movement of birds for the purpose \nof fighting from states where cockfighting is illegal to states where \ncockfighting is legal. This legislation will clarify that possession of \nfighting birds in any of the 47 states would then be illegal, as \nshipping them out for cockfighting purposes would be illegal.\n  I believe that my colleague from states where cockfighting is illegal \nwill benefit from this change because it will make law enforcement \neasier. I also believe that my colleagues from states or territories \nwhere cockfighting is currently legal should not oppose this change as \nit merely confines cockfighting to within that state's borders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \n        Abraham, Mr. McConnell, Mr. McCain, Mr. Lott, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Smith of Oregon, Mr. Gorton, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Frist, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Kyl, \n        Mr. Lugar, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Mack, Mrs. Lincoln, \n        Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Gramm, and Mr. \n        Thompson):\n  S. 346. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprohibit the recoupment of funds recovered by States from one or more \ntobacco manufacturers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  states rights protection act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill, \nalong with 27 other cosponsors. The prime one is Senator Bob Graham of \nFlorida, who has worked very hard with me over the last year to make \nsure that the State tobacco settlements which our States have worked so \nhard to achieve will remain in control of the States because, in fact, \nthe President's budget which was just released this week assumes that \nit will still seize $18.9 billion of the State tobacco settlement funds \nfor Medicaid recoupment. Mr. President, that is just not right, and the \nbill I am introducing with Senator Graham of Florida, Senator Gorton, \nand 26 others, on a bipartisan basis, will keep that from happening.\n  The bill is strongly supported by the National Governors' \nAssociation, the National Association of Attorneys General, the \nNational Conference of State Legislators, and several other groups.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from these groups be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hutchison and Graham: A major priority for \n     the nation's Governors during the 106th Congress is ensuring \n     that state tobacco settlement funds are protected from \n     unwarranted seizure by the federal government. The Governors \n     believe it is critical that access to full, unencumbered \n     recoupment protection be afforded to all states. We are \n     pleased that you have introduced legislation to accomplish \n     this goal. Your legislation would prohibit the federal \n     government from attempting to recover a staggering 57% of the \n     entire settlement amount.\n       Our states' Attorneys General carefully crafted the tobacco \n     agreement to reflect only state costs. Medicaid costs were \n     not a major issue in negotiating the settlement. In fact, the \n     final agreement reached by the Attorneys General on November \n     23, 1998 does not mention Medicaid. Therefore, there is no \n     legitimate federal claim on the settlement.\n       Without the states' leadership and years of commitment to \n     initiating state lawsuits, the nation would not have achieved \n     one of its major goals--a comprehensive settlement with the \n     tobacco industry. After bearing all of the risks and expenses \n     in the arduous negotiations and litigation necessary to have \n     proceeded with their lawsuit, states are now entitled to all \n     of the funds awarded to them in the tobacco settlement \n     agreement without federal seizure.\n       We look forward to working with you and other Members of \n     Congress to enact this legislation and prevent federal \n     seizure of state tobacco settlement funds.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas R. Carper.\n     Michael O. Leavitt.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 1999.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: On behalf of the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), I write in support \n     of bipartisan legislation that Senator Bob Graham and you \n     will soon introduce to ensure that states retain all of their \n     tobacco settlement funds. NCSL has made this legislation its \n     top priority for 1999. NCSL is very appreciative of the \n     leadership you provided on this issue during the 105th \n     Congress. I am grateful for your willingness to lead the way \n     again in 1999. The nation's state legislators will work \n     steadfastly with you and all of your Senate colleagues to \n     ensure that this legislature is enacted.\n       It is through the sole efforts of states that the historic \n     settlement of November 23, 1998 and four prior individual \n     state settlements were finalized. States initiated the suits \n     that led to the settlements without any assistance from the \n     federal government. States consumed their own resources and \n     accepted all of the risks with their suits. Additionally, the \n     November 23, 1998 agreement makes no mention of Medicaid, \n     which is the program cited by those who want to establish a \n     basis for seizing state tobacco settlement funds. It is clear \n     to me that the federal government has no claim to these \n     funds. I fully appreciate, however, the need for \n     clarification that federal legislation would provide.\n       As you well know, states are no finalizing the settlement, \n     carrying out the terms of the accord and making final fiscal \n     determinations about how to most responsibly apply settlement \n     funds to public health and other needs. Threats of recoupment \n     and related uncertainties only compromise our ability to \n     progress with finalizing the settlement and working to reduce \n     youth smoking, abating youth access to tobacco products and \n     addressing the economic impact of anticipated reduced demand \n     for tobacco products. Enactment of your federal legislation \n     would eliminate these threats and permit states to move \n     forward.\n       I look forward to working closely with you to a successful \n     and mutually acceptable resolution of this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Dan Blue,\n     President, North Carolina House of Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 1999.\n     Hon.

On \n     behalf of the Association, thank you for your leadership \n     early in the new session on this issue.\n\n[[Page S1158]]\n\n       Building on the strong bipartisan support evidenced on \n     January 21, we want to continue to work with you and your \n     colleagues on legislation that will ensure that the states \n     retain all of their tobacco settlement funds. We hope this \n     legislation will be enacted as early as possible in the 106th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Christine O. Gregoire,\n       Attorney General of Washington.\n     Betty Montgomery,\n       Attorney General of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 27, 1999.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: I am writing to let you know that \n     the National Association of Counties (NACo) strongly endorses \n     the bill to be introduced by you and Senator Bob Graham (D-\n     FL) that would prevent the federal recoupment of states' \n     tobacco settlement funds. NACo is adamantly opposed to any \n     attempt by the federal government to go after these funds and \n     applauds the introduction of this straightforward, bipartisan \n     legislation.\n       The $206 billion settlement agreed to on November 23, 1998 \n     by the state Attorneys General and the major United States \n     tobacco companies settles more than 40 pending lawsuits. \n     These lawsuits, which were initiated by state and local \n     governments with no assistance, in any form, from the federal \n     government, were based on a variety of claims, including \n     consumer fraud, antitrust protections, conspiracy, and \n     racketeering. In addition, the state Attorneys General \n     negotiated the settlement to reflect only state costs and \n     damages. Therefore, the federal government's claim that these \n     settlement monies represent Medicaid funds and should be \n     returned to federal coffers is simply not an accurate \n     portrayal of the settlement agreement. The agreement does not \n     claim to or intend to recover Medicaid costs. Attempts by the \n     federal government to claim these funds would likely result \n     in lengthy and costly legal battles between the states and \n     the federal government and would not be a wise use of \n     government resources.\n       NACo applauds your efforts and those of Senator Graham to \n     protect these funds. We will continue to work to prevent the \n     federal recoupment of the states' tobacco settlement monies, \n     and we support this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Betty Lou Ward,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    National League of Cities,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: On behalf of 135,000 cities and \n     towns, I would like to express the National League of Cities' \n     support for the legislation you are introducing today along \n     with Senator Bob Graham that would prevent the federal \n     government from taking a portion of state tobacco settlement \n     revenues.\n       If the federal government were able to take a portion of \n     state settlement funds, cities and towns would bear the brunt \n     of this loss. This could mean that local tobacco cessation \n     programs and teenage smoking prevention programs would not be \n     funded and indigent care costs would not be compensated. \n     Cities and towns are often the last means of defense in \n     covering health care costs, particularly indigent care costs.\n       For example, California's cities and counties stand to \n     receive half of the state's share of the settlement. This \n     money will directly assist cities and towns in helping to pay \n     for health care programs and costs. Other local governments \n     are currently working with their state legislatures to \n     address uncompensated costs related to tobacco illnesses and \n     to address local health care needs with settlement funds.\n       The National League of Cities adopted a resolution at the \n     December 1998 Congress of Cities in Kansas City, Missouri, \n     that addresses municipal interests in the tobacco settlement. \n     A provision in the resolution states that any revenues \n     received by states or municipalities from any settlement with \n     the tobacco industry should not be required to be paid to the \n     federal government for Medicaid/Medicare or any other \n     program.\n       We support the legislation introduced today, and your \n     continued effort to protect the interest of our nation's \n     cities and towns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Clarence E. Anthony,\n                           NLC President and Mayor, South Bay, FL.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, 46 States reached a settlement last \nNovember which added them to the other States that already had settled \nwith the tobacco companies, making every State in America now in a \nsettlement with the tobacco companies. These States have not just \nchosen to put the money that is coming in from the tobacco settlement \non Medicaid and health care issues. There are myriad State issues that \nthis money is going to be used for. But that is in limbo today because \nthe President has given notice that he is going to seize this money \nfrom them. So everything is going to be held in abeyance until we \nsettle this issue once and for all.\n  That is what our bill will do. There is no reason--no reason \nwhatsoever--that we should take money from the Medicaid funds that go \nto the States which provide a safety net for the millions of low-income \nand disabled Americans who depend on Medicaid for their health care \nneeds. We cannot allow that to happen, and we will not.\n  I intend to work with the cosponsors of this bill to find the first \navailable vehicle to attach it so that we can make sure that this money \nthat our States have worked alone to achieve, with no help from the \nFederal Government, will remain in their sole jurisdiction; that they \nwill be able to make the choices on what their States need and not have \ndictated to them by the Federal Government what they will spend this \nmoney for.\n  Many States--I was talking to Senator Abraham from the State of \nMichigan, and they are going to create scholarship funds for low-income \nstudents in Michigan, a very worthy cause. Other States are going to be \ndoing education to try to encourage teenagers not to smoke. We don't \nwant to substitute our judgment for the judgment that the States are \nmaking for their best and most important priorities.\n  So I am pleased to have the 28 cosponsors of this bill. I think we \nwill pass it. I hope that we can do it quickly so that these States \nwill have the freedom to spend this money on the much needed programs \nin those States.\n  I am happy to yield to Senator Gorton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the federal government has done quite \nenough to impede states efforts to recover damages from and change the \npractices of tobacco manufacturers. Though they asked, the state \nAttorneys General received no help from the federal government in their \nlitigation. When, despite this, the states in mid-1997 proposed to \nsettle their claims for almost $400 billion and asked the \nAdministration and Congress to codify the agreement, the federal \ngovernment instead blew it up by spending the states' money, and then \nsome, on this Administration's pet social projects. It was only through \nthe ingenuity, hard work, and unwavering perseverance of people like \nWashington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire that states were \nable to take the tobacco manufacturers back to the table in late 1998 \nand obtain a settlement agreement for $206 billion.\n  Though it did none of the work, the Administration now wants to share \nin the reward. Using an old provision in the Social Security Act, a \nprovision that I understand was intended to permit federal Medicaid \nrecoupment in cases of fraud or over billing, the federal government is \nnow claiming over 50% of the states' settlement money. To exact what it \nclaims is its share, the Administration intends to withhold Medicaid \npayments, payments that go to the neediest residents of Washington and \nother states.\n  This is no idle threat: three days ago, the President sent us a \nbudget in which he spent $16 billion of the states' settlement money in \nthe next five years. The President did indicate, however, that he would \nrelinquish this claim to the money for one year if states agree to \nspend the money as he and other Washington, D.C. bureaucrats see fit. \nThis is just wrong.\n  The bill that we are introducing today rights this wrong. It allows \nstates to keep the monies they fought for. No strings attached. The \nfederal government has not earned this money, and does not know better \nthan states how it should be spent. I urge my colleagues to join me and \nmy friends from Texas and Florida in seeing that this bill is passed \nthis session.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in support \nof the ``States Rights Protection Act of 1999.'' I believe that states \nare entitled to retain the tobacco funds that were agreed upon under \ntheir settlement agreements.\n  These funds result from an historic accord reached in November 1998 \nbetween 46 states, U.S. Territories and commonwealths, the District of \nColumbia, and tobacco industry representatives. State Attorneys General \nworked diligently to initiate and negotiate a settlement with the \ntobacco industry. States are now in the midst of finalizing the \nsettlement, carrying out the\n\n[[Page S1159]]\n\nterms of the settlement agreement and making fiscal decisions about how \nto apply settlement funds to public health and other needs.\n  Although the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services initially \nnotified states in the fall of 1997 of its intention to recoup the \nfederal match from funds states received through the suits, citing a \nprovision in existing Medicaid law, it has suspended recoupment \nactivities. For this reason, I join my Senate colleagues in introducing \nthis legislation to prohibit the federal government from trying to \nrecoup any funds from state governments recovered from tobacco \ncompanies as part of their tobacco settlement or from determining how \nthese funds should be spent.\n  I strongly believe that each state should have the right to determine \nwhere this money is needed and how it is best spent. In my own state of \nArkansas, Governor Mike Huckabee has reached an agreement with the \nSpeaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives, Bob Johnson, the \nPresident Pro Tempore of the Arkansas Senate, Jay Bradford, and the \nArkansas Attorney General, Mark Pryor, regarding the use of this money \nsolely for health-related purposes. Specifically, the settlement funds \nwill be used to prevent smoking by young people, to treat tobacco \nrelated illnesses, and to establish a foundation to provide for \ncontinued funding of these programs even when the tobacco settlement \nmoney expires. I'm proud that my home state of Arkansas will use these \nfunds towards such valuable programs.\n  I support the Arkansas state government and all other state \ngovernments in retaining their tobacco settlement funds and exercising \ntheir authority to determine how the funds are spent.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Matt \nBarry of our staff be given floor privileges for the remainder of the \nconsideration of this issue during this session of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Hutchison and 21 \noriginal cosponsors--Republicans and Democrats--to introduce \nlegislation designed to prevent the federal government from seizing the \nState settlement proceeds negotiated with the tobacco industry.\n  Just over 1 year has passed since the State of Florida received an \nominous warning from the federal government which said in essence: \n``Prepare to hand over half of your money or we will be prepared to \nwithhold your Medicaid funds.''\n  This action was a slap in the face to States like Florida--a State \nwhich spent countless hours and millions of dollars preparing to wage \nwar against the tobacco industry in court--with no guarantee of success \nand with no assistance from anyone--including the federal \ngovernment. The State of Florida specifically asked the Federal \nGovernment to assist us, to join in a joint lawsuit. We the States will \nassume the responsibility of suing the tobacco industry for the \nMedicaid and other nonspecific medical program costs. The Federal \nGovernment will assume the responsibility for Medicare, the Veterans \nAdministration, and other Federal health program costs. What was the \nresponse to that request for joint action? ``Not interested.''\n\n  In fact, only after it became clear that States were going to be \nsuccessful in their lawsuits did the federal government become \ninterested in the State settlements.\n  And so the Health Care Financing Administration sent collection \nnotices to States based on a twisted reading of an obscure provision in \nMedicaid law--section 1903(D) of the Social Security Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter dated \nNovember 3, 1997, from Ms. Sally K. Richardson, Director, Center for \nMedicaid and State Operations to the State Medicaid director of each of \nthe 50 States be printed in the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the federal government is attempting to \ncollect almost $19 billion over 5 years, and, presumably almost $100 \nbillion over the 25 year settlement agreement period, based on a little \nknown provision in Medicaid which was never intended to apply to a \nlawsuit of this magnitude or character.\n  The regulations interpreting the Statutory language of 1903(D) read \nas follows:\n\n   Subpart F--Refunding of Federal Share of Medicaid Overpayments to \n                               Providers\n\n       This Subpart Implements Section 1903(d)(2) (C) and (D) of \n     the Act, which provides that a State has 60 days from \n     discovery of an overpayment for Medicaid services to recover \n     or attempt to recover the overpayment from the provider.\n\n  The regulation then goes on to define ``overpayment'': Overpayment \nmeans the amount paid by a Medicaid agency to a provider which is in \nexcess of the amount that is allowable for services furnished under \nsection 1902 of the act.\n  Mr. President, applying the provisions of this statute which was \ndesigned to collect overpayments paid by a Medicaid State agency to a \nprovider, to attempt to apply this provision to the State tobacco \nlawsuits is absurd. This provision was intended and has been used to \napply to billing errors made by providers.\n  As an example, if a State finds that a provider has over billed \nMedicaid, the State collects the overpayment, then remits the \ncommensurate share back to the federal government.\n  Essentially, the federal government is stating that the revenues from \nthe lawsuits should be interpreted as ``overpayments'' made to medical \nproviders by state Medicaid agencies--that the services rendered by \nthese providers to Medicaid beneficiaries should not have been rendered \nunder the statute.\n  This logic is twisted and absurd.\n  The State lawsuits were not premised on a technical collections \nprocess--providers overbilling Medicaid. Rather, they were premised on \nthe fact that the tobacco industry defrauded the taxpayer, violated the \nState civil racketeering statutes, and subjected the taxpayers to \nenormous smoking-related illness costs.\n  Further, as an example, Mr. President, the suit of the State of Iowa, \nwhich was premised on Medicaid, was thrown out of court, but Iowa is \nstill 1 of the 46 States which will receive their share of the proceeds \nunder the nationwide settlement.\n  How could the Federal Government lay any claim to Iowa's proceeds \nbased on the overpayment provision in Medicaid since the court had \nspecifically thrown out its suit based on Medicaid? The answer is, it \ncannot.\n  The legislation that Senator Hutchison and my colleagues are \nintroducing today is simple. It clarifies that the overpayment \nprovision does not apply to either the comprehensive settlement agreed \nto in November of 1998, nor does it apply to any of the State \nsettlements agreed to prior to the comprehensive settlement.\n  Here is what the bill will do. It will prevent the Federal Government \nfrom stifling important bipartisan public health initiatives which will \nbe paid for through the settlements.\n  In my State of Florida, for instance, our former colleague and good \nfriend, Democratic Governor Lawton Chiles, provided health insurance to \nover 250,000 previously uninsured poor children. Just 2 weeks ago, \nFlorida's new Governor, Republican Jeb Bush, announced the \nestablishment of a $2 billion endowment fund which will be named in \nhonor of Governor Chiles. This fund will assure that the tobacco funds \nwill be used exclusively for children's health, child welfare, and \nseniors' health programs.\n  Mr. President, as you know, Florida is not unique. Other States will \nbe just as innovative and be held to just as high standards of \naccountability by their citizens for the use of these tobacco \nsettlement funds. It is important that States be given the green light \nto move forward on important public health initiatives and to do so as \nsoon as possible. If we do not pass this legislation, funds that could \notherwise be spent on improving America's health will be tied up in \nlitigation between States and the Federal Government for the \nforeseeable future.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort, to support this \nlegislation,\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\nand I urge that it be adopted by this Senate and by the Congress and \nsigned by the President of the United States at the earliest possible \ndate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           Center for Medicaid and\n\n\n                                             State Operations,\n\n                                                 November 3, 1997.\n       Dear State Medicaid Director: A number of States have \n     settled suits against one or more tobacco companies to recoup \n     costs incurred in treating tobacco-related illnesses. This \n     letter describes the proper accounting and reporting for \n     Federal Medicaid purposes of amounts received from such \n     settlements that are subject to Section 1903(d) of the Social \n     Security Act.\n       As described in the statute, States must allocate from the \n     amount of any Medicaid-related expenditure recovery ``the \n     pro-rata share to which the United States (Federal \n     government) is equitably entitled.'' As with any recovery \n     related to a Medicaid expenditure, payments received should \n     be reported on the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for \n     the Medicaid Assistance Program (HCFA-64) for the quarter in \n     which they are received. Specifically, these receipts should \n     be reported on the Form HCFA-64 Summary Sheet, Line 9E. This \n     line is reserved for special collections. The Federal share \n     should be calculated using the current Federal Medicaid \n     Assistance Percentage. Please note that settlement payments \n     represent a credit applicable to the Medicaid program whether \n     or not the monies are received directly by the State Medicaid \n     agency. States that have previously reported receipts from \n     tobacco litigation settlements must continue to report \n     settlement payments as they are received.\n       State administrative costs incurred in pursuit of Medicaid \n     cost recoveries from tobacco firms qualify for the normal 50 \n     percent Federal financial participation (FFP). They should be \n     reported on the Form HCFA-64.10, Line 14 (Other Financial \n     Participation).\n       Only Medicaid-related expenditure recoveries are subject to \n     the Federal share requirement. To the extent that some non-\n     Medicaid expenditures and/or recoveries were also included in \n     the underlying lawsuits, HCFA will accept a justifiable \n     allocation reflecting the Medicaid portion of the recovery, \n     as long as the State provides necessary documentation to \n     support a proposed allocation.\n       Under current law, tobacco settlement recoveries must be \n     treated like any other Medicaid recoveries. We recognize that \n     Congress will consider the treatment of tobacco settlements \n     in the context of any comprehensive tobacco legislation next \n     year. Given the States' role in initiating tobacco lawsuits \n     and in financing Medicaid programs, States will, of course, \n     have an important voice in the development of such \n     legislation, including the allocation of any resulting \n     revenues. The Administration will work closely with States \n     during this legislative process as these issues are decided.\n       If you would like to discuss the appropriate reporting of \n     recoveries with HCFA, please call David McNally of my staff \n     at (410) 786-3292 to arrange for a meeting or conversation. \n     We look forward to providing any assistance needed in meeting \n     a State's Medicaid obligation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Sally K. Richardson,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed \ncolleagues--Senators Hutchison, Graham, Voinovich, Abraham, and \nothers--in sponsoring legislation to protect the States' tobacco \nsettlement funds from the Clinton Administration's spurious recoupment \nclaims.\n  Members of the U.S. Senate will recall quite vividly that this \nchamber engaged in a lengthy, detailed debate on a national tobacco \nsettlement bill last year. While those discussions proved inconclusive, \nthe States--on their own--achieved much of what Congress and the White \nHouse identified as priorities through direct settlement agreements \nwith the tobacco companies.\n  As part of the comprehensive settlement with 46 states and the prior \nindividual State agreements, the tobacco companies are required to take \nspecific action to address public health concerns regarding teen \nsmoking. First, they must fund a major anti-smoking advertising \ncampaign to prevent youth smoking and to educate consumers about \ntobacco-related illnesses. Second, they must establish a charitable \nfoundation to support the study of programs to reduce teen smoking and \nsubstance abuse. Third, the settlement prohibits tobacco advertising \nthat may target youth, like the commercial use of cartoon characters \nlike ``Joe Camel'' and outdoor advertising such as billboard, stadium \nand transit ads as well as tobacco sponsorship of sporting and cultural \nevents. In addition, the States have plans to spend their tobacco \nsettlement funds for advancing the public health and welfare.\n  Much to the dismay of the nation's governors and state legislators, \ninstead of receiving a commendation from the President for a job well \ndone, they got a multi-billion dollar collection notice. Despite the \nfact that the States filed lawsuits asserting a number of non-Medicaid \nclaims, the Clinton Administration argues that every state who agreed \nto the $206 billion settlement should fork over from 50 to 79 percent \nof their share to the federal government--including states like \nKentucky who didn't even file a lawsuit but joined the settlement. As \nsuch, the President's FY 2000 budget states that the federal government \nhas the right to withhold at least $16 billion Medicaid dollars from \nthe States over the next five years.\n  Simply put, Mr. President, this bogus claim will deny Kentucky's most \nneedy citizens over $2.4 billion in Medicaid funds over the term of the \nsettlement agreement. I cannot excuse the fundamental conflict created \nby an Administration that claims it is fighting for the health of our \nchildren while it gobbles up the money specifically designated for \nthem. This effort to hold state Medicaid programs hostage in exchange \nfor federal strings on how the States spend their own money is \nintolerable and unacceptable.\n  Unlike the Administration, I believe all wisdom does not reside in \nWashington. It's clear to me that our state's elected officials are in \na better position to determine Kentucky's needs than a federal \nbureaucrat sitting 600 miles away in Washington. I am proud to serve as \nan original sponsor to this legislation which makes clear that the \nfederal government has no claim to the tobacco settlement funds \nattained by the States. I commend my fellow sponsors for their \ncommitment to preserving common-sense in government, and urge my \ncolleagues to approve this legislation expediently and without \ncompromise.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of the \nStates' Rights Protection Act. This bill will ensure that the states \nretain the use of the settlement proceeds from the tobacco litigation \nsettlement announced in November, 1998, as well as the prior \nsettlements with Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and Minnesota. The bill \nwill entitle the states to keep all of the money from the settlement, \nwithout federal recoupment of a Medicaid share.\n  I believe this is the right thing to do for several reasons. First, \nand foremost, the settlement was of litigation initiated and pursued by \nthe states. The President announced in his State of the Union address \nthat the Department of Justice will be filing an action on behalf of \nthe United States against the tobacco companies. This is the right way \nfor federal claims to be addressed, rather than taking this hard-\nfought, negotiated money from the states.\n  Second, not all of the states raised Medicaid claims in their \nlawsuits. The courts dismissed the Medicaid claims in other cases. \nThus, in some states, the federal government is not truly entitled to \nshare in the settlement proceeds. Allowing recoupment from some of the \nstates, but not all of the states, will lead to disparate and unfair \nresults.\n  Finally, federal and state governments alike share in the goal of \naddressing public health needs. It is not necessary that this goal only \nbe accomplished through federally mandated programs. The states' \nsettlement also includes funding for counter-advertising and cessation \nefforts. These efforts may be complemented by federal programs, but do \nnot need to be duplicated simply to give the federal government an \nexcuse to spend money. In addition, many states have other existing \npublic health programs related to tobacco use or children's health on \nthe books. The federal government does not need to attempt to duplicate \nthose programs through federal mandates. Most importantly, I am \nconfident that the state will spend their settlement money wisely and \nin the best interests of their citizens. These decisions are best \nreached through discussion and consensus reached at the state and local \nlevels.\n  I regret that Congress was unwilling to accept the opportunity \npresented to us with the 1997 proposed settlement agreement. \nComprehensive legislation would have benefited the nation by addressing \nkids smoking and limiting the excessive attorney's fees paid in these \ncases. Nevertheless, I applaud the Attorneys General for reaching \nsettlement of their litigation and for the\n\n[[Page S1161]]\n\npublic health advances they have made in the settlement agreement. They \nhave ensured a win for every state, without years of litigation and \nvaried results. They have ensured an end to Joe Camel on billbroads \nthroughout the country. They have established a mechanism to police \nadvertising. They have achieved more in this joint settlement than any \none state could have achieved alone with a court verdict.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Hutchison, for introducing this bill, \nand am pleased to join with so many other distinguished friends in \nsponsoring this important piece of states' rights legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hutchison and \nSenator Graham and a bipartisan group of my colleagues to introduce \nlegislation to prohibit the Federal government from recouping any part \nof the multi-state settlement between the tobacco industry and the \nState Attorneys General.\n  To the surprise of many state officials, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration has threatened to seek reimbursement for its share of \nMedicaid costs for treating tobacco-related diseases from the multi-\nstate tobacco settlement. In other words, the Federal government may \nwant to take more than half of the total multi-state settlement based \non the federal share of Medicaid, which is approximately 60 percent of \ntotal Medicaid costs.\n  For my home State of Vermont, that means the Federal government may \ntry to take more than $15 million annually out of Vermont's share of \nthe settlement. Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell settled with \nthe tobacco industry for more than $800 million to be distributed over \nthe next 25 years. But now the Federal government may seek more than \n$400 million of Vermont's tobacco settlement for its own use.\n  Washington State Attorney General Christine Gregoire, one of the lead \nattorneys generals in the settlement negotiations with the tobacco \nindustry, recently stated: ``These lawsuits were brought by the States \nbased on violations by the industry of state laws. The settlement was \nwon by the states without any assistance from Congress or the \nAdministration. As far as we are concerned the States did all the work \nand are entitled to every dollar of their allocated share to invest in \nthe future health care of their citizens.'' I could not agree more with \nGeneral Gregoire.\n  The States, not the Federal government, deserve the full amount of \ntheir settlements because the States and their Attorneys General took \nthe risks in bringing the novel lawsuits against Big Tobacco. Without \nthe willingness of the State Attorneys General acting on behalf of the \ncitizens of their states and taking significant financial and \nprofessional risks and pursuing these matters so diligently, we would \nnot have any legal settlements by the tobacco industry. These State \nAttorneys General deserve our gratitude and our respect for their \nextraordinary efforts. I commend them all for their diligence on behalf \nof the public.\n  When tobacco companies were fighting any and all lawsuits against \nthem, the State Attorneys General pursued their legal challenges \nagainst great odds. Men and women whose lives were cut short by cancer \nand other adverse health consequences from tobacco deserved better \ntreatment than the years of obstruction and denial by the tobacco \nindustry. Only now as the internal documents are being disclosed and \nthe legal tide is beginning to turn have tobacco companies decided to \nchange their strategy and pursue settlements. The tobacco industry did \nnot agreed to these settlements out of some new found sense of public \nduty. The truth is that giant tobacco corporations came to the \nbargaining table only after they realized that they might lose in \ncourt.\n  In my home state, General Sorrell took the financial and legal risks \nin bringing suit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the people \nof Vermont. General Sorrell and his legal team put together a powerful \ncase in support of the public health of all Vermonters. General Sorrell \ndid this without any assistance from the Federal government. As a \nresult, the people of Vermont deserve the full amount of their tobacco \nsettlement.\n  If the Federal government wants to recover its costs for tobacco-\nrelated diseases, the appropriate avenue to do that is a Federal \nlawsuit. Indeed, President Clinton announced during the recent State Of \nThe Union address that the Department of Justice is planning litigation \nagainst the tobacco industry. I applaud the President and Attorney \nGeneral Reno for pursuing legal action against the tobacco industry so \nthat the Federal government may recoup its costs for tobacco-related \ndiseases. That is the proper approach for the Federal government.\n  The multi-state tobacco settlement provides an historic opportunity \nto improve the public health in Vermont and across the nation. I \nbelieve that the States, not the Federal government, are in the best \nposition to determine their public health needs. Our bipartisan bill \ngrants the States that flexibility by permitting each state to use its \nsettlement payments in whatever way that state deems best.\n  That is why the National Governors Association, National Association \nof Attorneys General, National Conference of State Legislatures, \nNational Association of Counties, National League of Cities, and U.S. \nConference of Mayors support our bipartisan legislation. In my home \nstate, our bipartisan bill is supported by Governor Dean, Attorney \nGeneral Sorrell, the Vermont Health Access Oversight Committee, and the \nVermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems.\n  I want Governor Dean and the Vermont legislature to have the \nflexibility to use Vermont's settlement funds in whatever way they deem \nis best for the public health of Vermonters. It is only fair for the \nother 49 Governors and state legislatures to have that same flexibility \nto use their settlement funds in whatever way they deem is best for \ntheir citizens.\n  In the final analysis, I trust the people of Vermont and the other 49 \nStates to determine how best to use their tobacco settlement funds. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues as Congress moves forward on \nlegislation to ensure that the interests of Vermont and the other \nStates are protected in the multi-state tobacco settlement.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the \nState tobacco settlement protection bill, a bill to protect state \ntobacco settlement funds from seizure by the federal government. I want \nto thank Senators Hutchison and Graham for their leadership on this \nissue. I stand today for fiscal responsibility, local control and \nfairness. I stand today to protect our children's health, to assist \nthose who have become addicted to tobacco.\n  This is really about fairness. Is it fair for the federal government, \nhaving sat on the sidelines during this uphill battle against Big \nTobacco, to come in after the fact and claim a large share of the \nvictory? If nothing else, this proves the old adage that victory has \nmany parents, while defeat is an orphan.\n  I have said repeatedly that the federal government does not have all \nthe answers. Much of what has gone right in this country in the last \nseveral years is a direct result of moving decisions and power out of \nthis city and into small towns and communities. I came to Washington to \nstand up for what is right, to protect Indiana's values, and to speak \nup when the federal government oversteps its bounds.\n  Does the federal government have a right to take more than 60% of \nIndiana's tobacco settlement to spend on federal priorities? Absolutely \nnot. Indiana's share of the settlement is $4 billion over 25 years, but \nthe federal government's claim could take two and a half billion away. \nWhile the President's budget acknowledges the difficulty in collecting \nthis money in the coming fiscal year, I am disappointed they have laid \nclaim to a substantial share of state settlement funds in their budget \nfor use on federal discretionary programs in years to come. The \nfiscally responsible approach is to ensure this money is spent wisely \nat the local level, not to allow it to be dumped into the black pit of \nthe federal bureaucracy in Washington.\n  Indiana began this fight to protect our kids from the dangers of an \naddictive, life-threatening habit. The State fought a lonely battle, \nwithout any federal assistance and invested considerable resources in \nprosecuting this case.\n  The Governor of Indiana, Frank O'Bannon, is in the planning stages \nfor using this money to improve public health, promote teen smoking \ncessation programs and children's health\n\n[[Page S1162]]\n\ncare, the purposes originally outlined in the lawsuit. But with more \nthan 60% of the funds at risk it is hard to sketch out a reliable plan.\n  The confrontation between states and the federal government that \nwould result from an attempt by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration to take these state settlement funds would only hurt the \npeople in each of our states. It would tie us up in needless court \nactions over who has the legal right to these funds. That is wasted \ntime. While the courts decide what to do with the funds, we lose the \nopportunity to cover uninsured children, start anti-smoking campaigns \nand improve the lives of Hoosiers and the people in all our states.\n   Mr. President, I hope all my colleagues become a part of this \nbipartisan coalition. I hope we can all--Democrats and Republicans, \nStates and the federal government--work together to ensure these funds \nare used in the states to improve health, deter smoking and educate \nkids about the dangers of this addiction. I look forward to working to \npass this very important legislation this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 347. A bill to redesignate the Boundary Waters Canoe Area \nWilderness, Minnesota, as the ``Hubert H. Humphrey Boundary Waters \nCanoe Area Wilderness''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n        hubert h. humphrey boundary waters canoe area wilderness\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nrename the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCA) in Minnesota \nand in doing so, salute the father of our Nation's wilderness system, \nthe late Senator from Minnesota and Vice President, Hubert H. Humphrey. \nMy bill would redesignate the BWCA as ``The Hubert Humphrey Boundary \nWaters Canoe Area Wilderness.''\n  Mr. President, my home state is known for a number of things uniquely \nMinnesotan. If you've seen the movie ``Grumpy Old Men'' you're aware of \nour love of ice fishing. If you've flown into Minneapolis, you've seen \nthe Mall of America. If you watched the national weather maps, you've \nseen our bonechilling winter temperatures. And our new Governor--well, \nwe are proud to say that he is uniquely Minnesotan as well. But if \nyou've ever visited one of our Nation's wilderness areas, you would not \nnecessarily have realized that its creation was due in large part to \nanother uniquely Minnesotan individual, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey.\n  In the early 1960s, right here in these halls and in this Chamber, \nthen-Senator Humphrey lead the charge in helping Congress recognize the \nwisdom of creating a wilderness preservation system in the United \nStates. Senator Humphrey, as a member of the Senate Committee on \nAgriculture and Forestry, authored the 1964 Wilderness Preservation \nAct, and by doing so, created the BWCA. Many in our state feel that if \nit weren't for Senator Humphrey's tireless commitment, there would be \nno wilderness system and no BWCA. Senator Humphrey worked closely with \nthe people of Northern Minnesota to win their trust and gain their \nacceptance of a federally designated wilderness area--one that would \nsurely change the way they recreated and the way they lived. In fact, \nSenator Humphrey's legislation was very controversial and took several \nyears to complete. Last year's passage of legislation to restore two \nmotorized portages in the BWCA was consistent with both Senator \nHumphrey's vision for the BWCA and his promises to the people of \nnorthern Minnesota. Through his dedication and willingness to address \nthe concerns of everyone, we now have a wilderness system that is the \nenvy of the world.\n  Through Senator Humphrey's hard work and dedication to the National \nWilderness Preservation System, Americans today have countless \nprotected wilderness areas throughout this country in which they can \nexperience nature as it was 50, 75, or 100 years ago, knowing with \ncertainty that these precious areas will be left intact for generations \nto come.\n  Senator Humphrey's vision endures to this very day, and Minnesotans \nare proud to claim the BWCA, one of the nation's true national \ntreasures, as our own. Boy Scouts wait every year for their trip into \nthe Boundary Waters. Families know that every summer they can get away \nfrom their jobs, their studies, their cars and their phone, and enjoy \nat least a few days of peace and quiet. And elderly folks know that \ntheir favorite fishing hole is still a fishing hole and still \naccessible for them and their grandchildren.\n  Like Paul Bunyan, lutefisk, and our State Fair, the Boundary Waters \nis something uniquely Minnesotan and uniquely identifiable as our own \nacross the country. It is for that reason that I believe it should bear \nthe name of the father of the Wilderness system and be redesignated, \n``The Hubert H. Humphrey Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 349. A bill to allow depository institutions to offer negotiable \norder of withdrawal accounts to all businesses, to repeal the \nprohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, and for \nother purposes, to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                 the small business banking act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Banking Act of 1999. I am again joined in the effort by my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who is the \nprincipal cosponsor of this important legislation.\n  We originally introduced this legislation during the last Congress. \nThis legislation was incorporated into a more comprehensive financial \nregulatory relief bill that was unanimously reported out of the Senate \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. We fully expect it \nwill be enacted into law during this Congress.\n  Passage of this bill will remove one of the last vestiges of an \nobsolete interest rate control system. Abolishing the statutory \nrequirement that prohibits incorporated businesses from owning interest \nbearing checking accounts will provide America's small business owners, \nfarmers, and farm cooperatives with a funds management tool that is \nlong overdue.\n  Passage of this bill will ensure America's entrepreneurs can compete \neffectively with larger businesses. My experience as a businessman has \nshown me, firsthand, that it's extremely important for anyone trying to \nmaximize profits to be able to invest funds wisely for maximum \nefficiencies. Let me quote from a December, 1997 letter I received from \na constituent, Mary Jo Bousek. Mary Jo owns a commercial property \ncompany. She writes:\n\n       ``I was very pleased to see that you sponsored a bill to \n     allow banks to pay interest on checking accounts for \n     partnerships and corporations. When we changed our rental \n     properties from a sole proprietorship to a Limited Liability \n     Company, we suddenly began losing about $1500 a year in \n     interest on our bank account. This seems totally unreasonable \n     and unfair.''\n\n  Mary Jo is right. It is unfair.\n  During President Ronald Reagan's first term, one of his early actions \nwas to abolish many provisions of the antiquated interest rate control \nsystem the banking system was required to use. With this change to the \nlaws, Americans were finally able to earn interest on their checking \naccounts deposited in banks. Unfortunately, one aspect of the old \nsystem left untouched by the change in law was not allowing America's \nbusinesses to share in the good fortune.\n  Complicating matters is the growing impact of nonbanking institutions \nthat offer deposit-like money accounts to individuals and corporations \nalike. Large brokerage firms have long offered interest on deposit \naccounts they maintain for their customers. This places these firms at \nan advantage over community banks that can't offer their corporate \ncustomers interest on their checking accounts.\n  While I support business innovation, I don't believe it's fair when \nany business gains a competitive edge over another due to government \ninterference through overregulation. This is exactly the case we have \nwith banking laws that stifle bankers, especially America's small \ncommunity bankers, and give an edge to another segment of the financial \ncommunity. The Small Business Banking Act of 1999 seeks to correct this \nimbalance and allow community banks to compete fairly with brokerage \nfirms.\n  I'm pleased to say our bill has the strong support of America's \nCommunity Bankers, the National Federation\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\nof Independent Businesses, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation. This bill has the support of many of \nthe banks, thrifts, and small businesses in my home state of Nebraska. \nThese important organizations represent a crosscurrent of the type of \nsupport Senator Reed and I have for our bill. Senator Reed and I also \nhave the support of the Federal banking regulators. In their 1996 Joint \nReport, ``Streamlining of Regulatory Requirements'', the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the \nOffice of Thrift Supervision, stated they believe the statutory \nprohibition against payment of interest on business checking accounts \nno longer serves a public purpose. I heartily agree.\n  Mr. President, this is a straightforward bill that will do away with \nan unnecessary regulation that burdens American business. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nHagel in introducing the Small Business Banking Act of 1999, \nlegislation that eliminates a Depression-era federal law prohibiting \nbanks from paying interest on commercial checking accounts. Last year, \nI cosponsored a similar bill with Senator Hagel that was incorporated \ninto a financial institutions regulatory relief bill which passed the \nBanking Committee.\n  The prohibition against the payment of interest on commercial \naccounts was originally part of a broad prohibition on the payment of \ninterest on any deposit account. At the time of enactment in 1933, it \nwas the popular view that payment of interest on deposits created an \nincentive for rural banks to shift excess deposits to urban money \ncenter banks which made loans that fueled speculation. Moreover, it was \nbelieved that such transfers created liquidity crises in rural \ncommunities. However, a number of changes in the banking system since \nenactment of the prohibition have called into question its usefulness.\n  First, with the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulatory \nand Monetary Control Act of 1980, Congress allowed financial \ninstitutions to offer interest-bearing accounts to individuals--a \nchange which has not adversely affected safety and soundness. Second, \nmany banks have developed complex mechanisms called sweep accounts to \ncircumvent the interest rate prohibition. Because of the costs \nassociated with developing sweep accounts, large banks have become the \nprimary offerors of these accounts. As a result, many smaller banks are \nat a competitive disadvantage with larger banks which can offer their \ncommercial depositors interest-bearing accounts. Most importantly, the \nvast majority of small businesses cannot afford to utilize sweep \naccounts because the cost of opening these accounts is relatively high \nand most small businesses do not have a large enough deposit base to \njustify the administrative costs.\n  In light of these developments, it has become clear that the \nprohibition on interest-bearing commercial accounts is nothing more \nthan a relic of the Depression-era that has effectively disadvantaged \nsmall businesses and small banks, and led large banks to dedicate \nsignificant resources to circumventing the prohibition. I am, \ntherefore, pleased to cosponsor this legislation that will eliminate \nthis prohibition and level the playing field for small banks and small \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, as we move into a new millennium, I think it \nappropriate that we eliminate this vestige of the early twentieth \ncentury that is no longer useful and is indeed burdensome.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 350. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve the \nhealth care benefits under the TRICARE program and otherwise improve \nthat program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n            the military health care improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Military \nHealth Care Improvement Act of 1999. This bill is a first step to \nreform the military health care system known as TRICARE. We are trying \nto recruit and retain the best people for our nation's military. To do \nthis, we must pay them better, maintain good retirement benefits and \nimprove the health care we provide them and their families.\n  Mr. President, there is a growing perception among active duty \nmilitary, their dependents and military retirees that the military \nhealth care benefit is no longer much of a benefit. We have not done a \nvery good job of keeping the promise the government made to military \npersonnel: That in return for their service and sacrifices, the \ngovernment will provide health care to active-duty members and their \nfamilies even after they retire. In the past 10 years, the military has \ndownsized by over one-third, and the military health care system has \ndownsized by one-third as well. While hospitals have been closed as a \nresult of BRAC or downsized in the past decade, the number of personnel \nthat rely on the military and the military health care system has \nremained constant. Today, our armed forces have more married service \nmembers with families than ever before. In addition, those who have \nserved and are now retired were promised quality health care as well.\n  In place of the promise, these individuals and families have been \ngiven, instead, a system called ``TRICARE.'' TRICARE is not health care \ncoverage, but a health care delivery system that provides varying \nlevels of benefits depending largely on where a member of the military \nor a retiree lives.\n  Unfortunately, what we find is that the TRICARE program often \nprovides spotty coverage. My offices and those offices of my colleagues \nin the Senate no doubt have received thousands of complaints regarding \naccess to care, unpaid bills, inadequate providers and difficulties \nwith claims.\n  For their part, the doctors who participate in TRICARE complain about \na host of administrative problems including delayed payments and a very \ncumbersome claims process. Many doctors have simply left the program, \nand in some locations, there are simply no providers at all in certain \nspecialties. This is unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, I am introducing this bill to improve the health care \nbenefits under the TRICARE program by ensuring that the health care and \ndental coverage available under TRICARE is substantially similar to the \nhealth care coverage and dental care coverage available under the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits program. This bill will:\n  Raise reimbursement levels for TRICARE, the military health-care \ndelivery system, to attract and retain more participating doctors to \nthe program.\n  Expedite and reduce the costs of TRICARE claims processing, which has \nbeen a thorn in the side of both beneficiaries and providers.\n  Require portability of benefits between regions. This would make it \neasier for military personnel and their families to receive health care \nbenefits when they travel to different regions.\n  Minimize the cumbersome pre-authorization requirements for access to \ncare.\n  Mr. President. This bill will help break down the bureaucracy that \nexists in the current system. There is no single solution to this \nproblem, but we must begin now to ensure we honor our commitments. This \nis a critical issue to recruiting and retaining qualified people in the \nmilitary--which is critical to the security of our country.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Allard and Hagel \nand look forward to working with my colleagues to keep the promise and \nimprove the military health care system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS (for himself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. \n        Bennett):\n  S. 351. A bill to provide that certain Federal property shall be made \navailable to States for State and local organization use before being \nmade available to other entities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               taxpayer oversight of surplus property act\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Taxpayer \nOversight of Surplus Property Act. I am pleased that Congressman John \nPeterson of Pennsylvania will soon introduce companion legislation in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Among the many programs administered by hundreds of federal agencies, \nthere are some initiatives that depend\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\nupon the active involvement of both the federal government and the \nstates in order to ensure the wisest use of taxpayer dollars and meet \nthe needs of the American people. One such effective partnership \ninvolves the distribution of federal surplus personal property to \nstates and local organizations.\n  In 1976, President Ford signed legislation which established the \ncurrent system for the fair and equitable donation of federal surplus \npersonal property. Personal property declared ``surplus'' consists of \nitems other than land or real property, naval vessels, and records of \nthe federal government. This includes office supplies, furniture, \nmedical supplies, hardware, motor vehicles, boats, airplanes, and \nconstruction equipment.\n  Under the federal personal property utilization and donation program, \nthe General Services Administration is responsible for the transfer of \nfederal surplus personal property to the states. Each state agency for \nsurplus property receives the transfer of property and distributes \nthese items to eligible recipients. Property that is not selected by \nthe states is offered for sale to the general public. Importantly, the \ninterests of the American taxpayers guide this entire process.\n  Mr. President, there are close to 70,000 recipients of federal \nsurplus property located throughout the United States. Each day, \ncities, counties, Indian tribes, hospitals, schools, and public safety \nagencies are among the public and nonprofit organizations that look \ntoward the state agencies for surplus property to help meet their \nneeds.\n  Last April, I had the opportunity to visit the Minnesota surplus \nproperty agency, where I was joined by the lieutenant governor, the \nexecutive director of the Minnesota Sheriffs Association, and the \ncommissioner of the state Department of Corrections. While there, I \nquickly became more familiar with the success of the donation program \nthroughout Minnesota. I am very confident that my Senate colleagues \nwill find that the donation program has achieved a comparable level of \nsuccess in each of their states.\n  In fiscal year 1997, the Minnesota surplus property agency donated \nequipment and supplies with an original federal acquisition cost of \n$7.7 million to 1,700 eligible recipients, saving precious tax dollars \nif these items had been purchased new or on the open market. I was \nimpressed to learn that 414 cities, 80 medical institutions, 19 \nmuseums, 237 public schools, 110 county entities, 160 State agencies, \nand 353 townships are among the active participants in the donation \nprogram.\n\n  Equally impressive is how effectively the state agencies for surplus \nproperty and the GSA have worked together to respond quickly and \nefficiently during times of natural disasters. Together they have \nsuccessfully identified and transported sandbags, blankets, cots, \ntools, trucks and other items to disaster sites. I know that \nMinnesotans who suffered through the 1997 Midwest floods are gratified \nto have received over $3.7 million worth of federal surplus property to \nassist flood relief efforts during that horrible time.\n  Quite simply, the donation program has provided taxpayers with the \nequipment, supplies and material used to educate our children, maintain \nroads and streets, keep utility rates reasonable, train the workers of \ntomorrow, protect families from crime, provide needed relief during \nnatural disasters, and treat the health of our nation's sick and needy. \nIn fact, the original acquisition value of property distributed through \nthe state agencies for surplus property totaled over $1.5 billion \nbetween fiscal years 1995 through 1997.\n  Because of the importance my constituents place upon the availability \nof this property, I am very concerned about current programs which \nlimit the donation of property to the states. My concern is based in \npart upon comments expressed to me by constituents such as Mayor \nRichard Nelson of Warren, Minnesota.\n  Mayor Nelson recently wrote,\n\n       When we inquired about the shortage of heavy equipment we \n     were told that a large majority of that equipment is shipped \n     overseas to other countries for humanitarian aid. I feel that \n     our taxes paid for this equipment and it seems only fair that \n     we should have the first opportunity to benefit from it. \n     Being the mayor of a community that has suffered from four \n     floods within two years, I believe that we have unmet needs \n     in this country that need to be addressed before we can look \n     at any outside interests.\n\n  Mr. President, Mayor Nelson's concerns go to the heart of the \nlegislation that I am introducing today. I believe that the volume of \ndistributed federal surplus property would increase if the intent of \nCongress when it passed the 1976 reforms was more closely followed.\n  If Congress continues to allow surplus federal property to go abroad, \nor not make its way through proper channels to eligible recipients, \ntaxpayers such as those in the community of Warren will stand to lose. \nAs someone who has always worked to ensure the wisest possible use of \ntaxpayer dollars, this gives me great concern. The legislation I am \nintroducing will help to address these concerns through the following \nprovisions.\n\n  First, this measure would ensure that when distributing surplus \nfederal personal property, domestic needs are met before we consider \nforeign interests. It would, however, grant the President the authority \nto make supplies available for humanitarian relief purposes before \ngoing to the states, in the case of emergencies or natural disasters.\n  Under the Humanitarian Assistance Program (HAP), the Secretary of \nDefense is permitted to make nonlethal Department of Defense supplies \navailable by the State Department to foreign countries as part of \nhumanitarian relief activities. I was disturbed to learn that over $1 \nbillion worth of excess supplies was made available to the State \nDepartment between fiscal years 1987 through 1997 before GSA had been \ngiven an opportunity to review the property and make it available for \ndonation to the states.\n  Mr. President, I understand that some officials may argue that the \nHumanitarian Assistance Program is an important part of our nation's \nforeign assistance efforts. Many foreign countries and organizations \nclearly have benefited from nonlethal Department of Defense excess \nproperty finance by American taxpayers. Although I have serious \nconcerns about this initiative, my legislation does not eliminate the \nHumanitarian Assistance Program.\n  However, I believe we must prioritize the needs of disaster victims \nin Minnesota, rural hospitals in Arkansas, police departments in \nWashington state, school districts in Idaho, homeless assistance \nproviders in Florida, and other communities and organizations which \nhave invested their tax dollars in government property and the donation \nprogram. For these reasons, I oppose the continued priority status \ngranted to foreign recipients under programs such as the Humanitarian \nAssistance Program.\n  Second, my bill would amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nprohibit the transfer of Government-owned excess property to foreign \ncountries or international organizations for environmental protection \nactivities in foreign countries unless GSA determined that there is no \nfederal or state use for the property.\n  Third, this legislation would require GSA to report to Congress on \nthe effectiveness of all statutes relating to the disposal and donation \nof personal property and recommend any changes that would further \nimprove the Donation Program.\n  Mr. President, my bill is based on the principle that eligible \nrecipients should be able to maximize their tax dollars through \nexpendable federal property that meets their needs. It takes an \nimportant step toward stopping publicly-owned property from being \nshipped abroad and given to other organizations before it is \ndistributed through each state agency for surplus property.\n  My legislation will fulfill the public's right to know how and where \ntheir tax dollars are being spent. In many ways, it will serve as the \nsecond phase of the reforms overwhelmingly passed by Congress in 1976, \nby preserving the active role of states in the handling and \ndistribution of surplus federal property.\n  Members of Congress and state and local officials all have an \nobligation to see that the government distributes this property fairly \nand equitably, ensuring accountability to the taxpayers. Too often, \nfederal agencies forget that the owners of this property are the \nAmerican people--the federal government is merely its public custodian.\n  Mr. President, the best interests of America's taxpayers have always \nbeen at the top of my agenda. I look forward to improving Congressional \noversight\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\nof government property and securing passage of this legislation during \nthe 106th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Craig, Mr. Helms, \n        Mr. Crapo, Mr. Grams, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 352. A bill to amend the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \nto require that Federal agencies consult with State agencies and county \nand local governments on environmental impact statements; to the \nCommittee on Environmental and Public Works.\n\n\n          state and local government participation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Nickles, \nCraig, Helms, Crapo, Grams, and Enzi, to introduce the State and Local \nGovernment Participation Act of 1999 which would amend the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA). This bill is designed to guarantee \nthat federal agencies identify state, county and local governments as \ncooperating agencies when fulfilling their environmental planning \nresponsibilities under NEPA.\n  NEPA was designed to ensure that the environmental impacts of a \nproposed federal action are considered and minimized by the federal \nagency taking that action. It was supposed to provide for adequate \npublic participation in the decision making process on these federal \nactivities and document an agency's final conclusions with respect to \nthe proposed action.\n  Although this sounds simple and quite reasonable, NEPA has become a \nreal problem in Wyoming and many states throughout the nation. A \nstatute that was supposed to provide for additional public input in the \nfederal land management process has instead become an unworkable and \ncumbersome law. Instead of clarifying and expediting the public \nplanning process on federal lands, NEPA now serves to delay action and \nshut-out local governments that depend on the proper use of these \nfederal lands for their existence.\n  The State and Local Government Participation Act is designed to \nprovide for greater input from state and local governments in the NEPA \nprocess. This measure would simply guarantee that state, county and \nlocal agencies be identified as cooperating entities when preparing \nland management plans under NEPA. Although the law already provides for \nvoluntary inclusion of state and local entities in the planning \nprocess, to often, the federal agencies choose to ignore local \ngovernments when preparing planning documents under NEPA. \nUnfortunately, many federal agencies have become so engrossed in \nexamining every environmental aspect of a proposed action on federal \nland, they have forgotten to consult with the folks who actually live \nnear and depend on these areas for their economic survival.\n  Mr. President, states and local communities must be consulted and \nincluded when proposed actions are being taken on federal lands in \ntheir state. Too often, federal land managers are more concerned about \nthe comments of environmental organizations located in Washington, D.C. \nor New York City than the people who actually live in the state where \nthe proposed action will take place. This is wrong. The concerns, \ncomments and input of state and local communities is vital for the \nproper management of federal lands in the West. The State and Local \nGovernment Participation Act of 1999 will begin to address this \ntroubling problem and guarantee that local folks will be involved in \nproposed decision that will affect their lives.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in introducing \nthe State and Local Government Participation Act.\n  This legislation would amend the National Environmental Policy Act \n(NEPA) to provide the opportunity for State, local, and county agencies \nto participate in land management decisions by identifying them as \ncooperating agencies in the NEPA process.\n  NEPA was passed in 1969 to, among other things, ``declare a national \npolicy which will encourage harmony between man and his environment.'' \nI support the intent of NEPA, to protect our public resources from \nenvironmental degradation. However, in the last twenty years, the NEPA \nprocess has become a very time consuming and cumbersome public process. \nIn almost every instance, an Environmental Impact Statement or \nEnvironmental Assessment must be completed under NEPA before any action \ncan take place on the public lands.\n  My state, Idaho, is 63 percent federal land, and management of those \nlands is of vital importance, especially to the communities that are \neconomically dependent on the public lands. In far too many instances, \nland management decisions are being made without allowing those most \naffected by a land management decision or in many cases, those most \nknowledgeable about the resource, to play a meaningful role in the NEPA \nprocess.\n  In the Pacific Northwest, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement are currently working on a comprehensive ecosystem \nmanagement plan for the Columbia River Basin, the Interior Columbia \nBasin Ecosystem Management Plan (ICBEMP). This plan, in the form of a \ndraft EIS, has been in the works for four years at an expense of more \nthan $40 Million. County governments and state officials in my state \nfeel alienated by the process to date. The situation has gotten so bad \nthat in last year's omnibus appropriations act, I worked to have report \nlanguage encouraging the administration to include affected state and \ncounty governments in this process as cooperating agencies.\n  I would submit that every western Senator has at least one horror \nstory involving a public land managing agency that ran roughshod over \nthe local government in the NEPA process. Rather than legislating that \nFederal agencies must work with the local governments on a case-by-case \nbasis, this bill would provide the opportunity to fix a problem that \nhas arisen with the original NEPA legislation.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the State and \nLocal Government Participation Act of 1999. I would like to thank \nSenator Thomas for introducing this simple, but very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  As Senator Thomas said in his introductory remarks, this legislation \nwould make state and county governments ``cooperating agencies'' in the \nNational Environmental Policy Act process. For example, when the Forest \nService decides to undertake a timber sale, it will have to by law \nconsult and obtain the input of state and county governments during the \nNEPA process. Current law, however, only requires the federal \ngovernment to consult with other federal agencies.\n  The underlying concept of this legislation is something most people \nwould assume already takes place. Average Americans assume that the \nfederal government considers state and local governments partners in \nall land-use and environmental decisions. After all, it is an \nestablished fact that local citizens and officials can best meet local \nproblems with local solutions. And in those matters, people expect the \nfederal government to help out where needed and take the lead where \nappropriate. But average Americans, unfortunately, often aren't aware \nof the complete picture.\n  Too often, the federal government adopts its ``I know best'' \nphilosophy and ignores the input of local officials or even excludes \nthem from the decision making process. One of the first things locally \nelected officials in the northern part of my state--an area which deals \nwith the National Environmental Policy Act regularly--say to me when we \nsit down to talk is that the federal government doesn't care about \ntheir needs. They feel the federal government, be it the Forest \nService, Park Service, or EPA, just doesn't seem to realize that \ncounties are having a tough time making ends meet and providing basic \nservices to its residents in an era of increased land-regulation and \ndecreased logging, mining, and access. And when they show you the \nnumbers and make their case, it is impossible to disagree with them.\n  There are a number of counties in northern Minnesota which are \npredominantly federally owned. St. Louis County is 62 percent federally \nowned, Cook County is 82 percent federally owned, and Lake County is 92 \npercent federally owned. They are home to the Superior National Forest \nand the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Not far away is \nVoyageurs National Park and not far from that is the Chippewa National \nForest. Not surprisingly, they are often placed in the\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n\nmiddle of many disputes over land-uses. They continue to see their PILT \npayments funded at barely 50 percent of authorized amounts. They \ncontinue to witness more and more restrictions on the use of lands \nwithin their counties and the Forest Services declining timber sales. \nAnd they continue to see their populations declining as a result of \nlost economic opportunities. They deserve to be heard when the federal \ngovernment is going to take actions in their communities.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that in the last half of this century \npower has shifted from our nation's cities and states to Washington, \nDC. No one disputes that. And while many of us would like to see that \nshift back the other way, it may take some time to get it done. But \nwhat we should all be able to agree upon, is that locally elected \nofficials should have a seat at the table and should be treated as \nequals and as partners by federal agencies. They know what is happening \non their land and they know the people who will be impacted by changes \nin the law. They also know what the impact will be on a county or state \nbudget. But most importantly, Mr. President, county and state officials \nare closer to the people. Their phone numbers are actually in the phone \nbook and they aren't a long distance call away. They answer their door \nwhen someone comes knocking. And they aren't a bureaucrat hidden away \nin Washington, DC, making one size fits all policy decisions.\n  As I stated earlier, I think those people deserve a role in the NEPA \nprocess and I think the American people would agree. I urge my \ncolleagues to protect their state and local government's right to \nparticipate by supporting this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Thurmond):\n\n  S. 353. A bill to provide for class action reform, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 The Class Action Fairness Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenators Kohl and Thurmond, the Class Action Fairness Act of 1999, a \nbill that will help curb class action lawsuit abuse. Last year, Senator \nKohl and I introduced the Class Action Fairness Act of 1998, S. 2083. \nThat bill was marked up in the Administrative Oversight and the Courts \nSubcommittee on September 10, 1998, and we favorably voted out of \nsubcommittee a substitute amendment to the bill. Unfortunately, this \nlegislation was not considered further by the Senate because of the \npress of other legislative business scheduled before the full Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  We are now reintroducing the substitute amendment to last year's \nclass action bill, with minor modifications, as the Class Action \nFairness Act of 1999. This modest bill will go a long way toward ending \nclass action lawsuit abuses where the plaintiffs receive very little \nand their lawyers receive a whole lot. This bill will preserve class \naction lawsuits as an important tool that brings representation to the \nunrepresented and result in important discrimination and consumer \ndecisions.\n  In October 1997, my Judiciary Subcommittee held a hearing on the \nproblem of certain class action lawsuit settlements. I found one \nexample of class action lawsuit abuse to be particularly disturbing. In \nan antitrust case settled in the Northern District of Illinois in 1993, \nthe plaintiff class alleged that multiple domestic airlines \nparticipated in price-fixing, which resulted in plaintiffs paying more \nfor airline tickets than they otherwise would have had to pay.\n  In the settlement, all of the class plaintiffs were awarded a book of \ncoupons which could be used toward the purchase of future airline \ntickets. These coupons varied in amount and number, based on how many \nplane tickets a particular plaintiff had purchased. The catch was that \nthe plaintiff still had to pay for most of any new airline ticket out \nof his or her own pocket. This meant that only $10 worth of coupons \ncould be used toward the purchase of a $100 ticket; up to $25 worth of \ncoupons for a $250 ticket; up to $50 worth of coupons for a $500 \nticket, and so on. In addition, these coupons could not be used on \ncertain blackout dates, which appeared to include all holidays and peak \ntravel times.\n  Interestingly enough, the attorneys did not get paid with these \ncoupon books. Rather, the attorneys were paid cash--$16 million in \ncash. Now, if the coupons were good enough for their clients--the \npeople that actually got ripped off--I wonder why those same coupons \nwere not good enough for their lawyers.\n  Another example of an egregious class action lawsuit settlement was \nhighlighted at the subcommittee hearing. Mrs. Martha Preston was a \nmember of the plaintiff class in the case Hoffman versus Banc Boston, \nwhere some plaintiffs received under $10 each in compensation for their \ninjuries, yet were docked from $75 to $90 for attorneys' fees. This \nmeans that attorneys who were supposed to be representing these \npeople's best interests, agreed to a settlement that cost some of the \nplaintiffs more money than they received in compensation for being \nwronged.\n\n  These class action lawsuit abuses happen for a number of reasons. One \nreasons is that plaintiffs' lawyers negotiate their own fees as part of \nthe settlement. This can result in distracting lawyers from focusing on \ntheir client's needs, and settling or refusing to settle based on the \namount of their own compensation.\n  During our hearing, evidence was presented that at least one group of \nplaintiffs' lawyers meets on a regular basis to discuss initiating \nclass action lawsuits. They scan the Federal Register and other \npublications to get ideas for lawsuits, and only after they have \nidentified a wrong, do they find clients for their lawsuits. Instead of \nhaving clients who complain of harms going to hire attorneys, these \nattorneys find the harms first and then recruit potential clients with \nthe promise of compensation.\n  On the other hand, the defendants do not always have clean hands. \nPlaintiffs' lawyers say that they are approached by lawyers from large \ncorporations who urge them to find a class and sue the corporation. The \ncorporations may use the class action lawsuit as a tool to limit their \nliability. Once a lawsuit is initiated and settled, no member of the \nclass may sue based on that claim. In other words, if a corporation \nsettle a class action lawsuit by paying all class members $10 as \ncompensation for a faulty product, the plaintiffs can no longer sue for \nany harm caused by the faulty product. This is one way of buying \nimmunity for liability.\n  A Rand study on class action litigation stated that,\n\n       It is generally agreed that fees drive plaintiffs' \n     attorney's filing behavior, that defendants' risk aversion in \n     the face of large aggregate exposures drives their settlement \n     behavior. . . . In other words, the problems with class \n     actions flow from incentives that are embedded in the process \n     itself.\n\n  The Rand study also found that the number of class actions is rising \nsignificantly, with most of the increase concentrated in State courts. \nState courts often are used in nationwide class actions to the \ndetriment of class members and sometimes defendants. In fact, State \ncourts are more likely to certify class actions without adequately \nconsidering whether a class action would be fair to all class members. \nIn addition, class lawyers sometimes manipulate pleadings to avoid \nremoval of the lawsuit to the Federal courts, even to the extent that \nthey minimize their client's potential claims. Class lawyers also \nsometimes defeat the complete diversity requirement by ensuring that at \nleast one named class member is from the same State as a defendant, \neven if every other class member is from a different State.\n\n  The Class Action Fairness Act of 1999 does a number of things. First, \nit requires that notice of proposed settlements in all class actions, \nas well as all class notices, must be in clear, easily understood \nEnglish and must include all material settlement terms, including the \namount and source of attorneys' fees. The notices most plaintiffs \nreceive are written in small print and confusing legal jargon. In fact, \na lawyer testified before my subcommittee that even he could not \nunderstand the notice he received as a plaintiff in a class action \nlawsuit. Since plaintiffs are giving up their right to sue, it is \nimperative that they understand what they are doing and the \nramifications of their actions.\n  Second, our bill requires that State attorneys general be notified of \nany\n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\nproposed class settlement that would affect residents of their States. \nThe notice would give a State attorney general the opportunity to \nobject if the settlement terms are unfair.\n  Third, our bill requires that attorneys' fees in class actions are to \nbe based on a reasonable percentage of damages actually paid to class \nmembers, the actual costs of complying with the terms of a settlement \nagreement, as well as any future financial benefits. In the \nalternative, the bill provides that, to the extent the law permits, \nfees may be based on a reasonable hourly (lodestar) rate. This \nprovision would discourage settlements that give attorneys exorbitant \nfees based on hypothetical overvaluation of coupon settlements, yet \nallows for reasonable fees in all kinds of cases, including cases that \nprimarily involve injunctive relief.\n  Fourth, our bill allows more class action lawsuits to be removed from \nState court to Federal court, either by a defendant or an unnamed class \nmember. A class action would qualify for Federal jurisdiction if the \ntotal damages exceed $75,000 and parties include citizens from multiple \nStates. Currently, class lawyers can avoid removal if individual claims \nare for just less than $75,000--even if hundreds of millions of dollars \nin total are at stake--or if just one class member is from the same \nState as a defendant. However, the bill provides that cases remain in \nState court where the substantial majority of class and primary \ndefendants are from the same State and that State's law would govern, \nor the primary defendants are States and a Federal court would be \nunable to order the relief requested.\n  Fifth, our bill will reduce frivolous lawsuits by requiring that a \nviolation of rule 11 of the Federal rules of civil procedure, which \npenalizes frivolous lawsuits, will require the imposition of sanctions. \nHowever, the nature and extent of sanctions will remain discretionary.\n  We need class action reform badly. Both plaintiffs and defendants are \ncalling for change in this area. The Class Action Fairness Act of 1999 \nis not just procedural reform, it is substantive reform of our court \nsystem. This bill will remove the conflict of interest that lawyers \nface in class action lawsuits, and will ensure the fair settlement of \nthese cases. This bill will preserve the process, but put a stop to the \nmore egregious abuses. I urge all my colleagues to join Senators Kohl, \nThurmond, and me and support this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 353\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply to any civil \n     action commenced on or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Senator Grassley and I today introduce the \nClass Action Fairness Act of 1999. This legislation addresses growing \nproblems in class action litigation, particularly unfair and abusive \nsettlements that shortchange class members while class lawyers line \ntheir pockets with high fees.\n  Let me share with you just a few disturbing examples.\n  First, one of my constituents, Martha Preston of Baraboo, Wisconsin, \nwas an unnamed member of a class action lawsuit against her mortgage \ncompany that ended in a settlement. While at first she got $4 and \nchange in compensation, a few months later her lawyers surreptitiously \ntook $80--twenty times her compensation--from her escrow account to pay \ntheir fees. In total, her lawyers managed to pocket over $8 million in \nfees, but never explained that the class--not the defendant--would pay \nthe attorneys' fees. Naturally outraged, she and others sued the class \nlawyers. Her lawyers turned around and sued her in Alabama--a state she \nhad never visited--and demanded an unbelievable $25 million. So not \nonly did she lose $75, she was forced to defend herself from a $25 \nmillion lawsuit.\n  Second, class lawyers and defendants often engineer settlements that \nleave plaintiffs with small discounts or coupons unlikely ever to be \nused. Meanwhile, class lawyers reap big fees based on unduly optimistic \nvaluations. For example, in a settlement of a class action against \nmajor airlines, most plaintiffs received less than $80 in coupons while \nclass attorneys received $14 million in fees based on a projection that \nthe discounts were worth hundreds of millions. In a suit over faulty \ncomputer monitors, class members got $13 coupons, while class lawyers \npocketed $6 million. And in a class action against Nintendo, plaintiffs \nreceived $5 coupons, while attorneys took almost $2 million in fees.\n  Third, competing federal and state class actions engage in a race to \nsettlement, where the best interests of the class lose out. For \nexample, in one state class action the class lawyers negotiated a small \nsettlement precluding\n\n[[Page S1169]]\n\nall other suits, and even agreed to settle federal claims that were not \nat issue in state court. Meanwhile, a federal court found that the \nfederal claims could have been worth more than $1 billion, while \naccusing the state class lawyers of ``hostile representation'' that \n``surpassed inadequacy and sank to the level of subversion'' and \npursuit of self-interest in ``getting a fee'' that was ``more in line \nwith the interests of [defendants] than those of their clients.''\n  Fourth, class actions are often filed in state courts that are more \nlikely to give inadequate consideration to class certification and \nclass settlements. On several occasions, a state court has certified a \nclass action although federal courts rejected certification of the same \ncase. And in several Alabama state courts, 38 out of 43 classes \ncertified in a three-year period were certified on an ex parte basis, \nwithout notice and hearing. One Alabama judge acting ex parte certified \n11 class actions in 1997 alone. Comparably, only an estimated 38 class \nactions were certified in federal court that year (excluding suits \nagainst the U.S. and suits brought under federal law). This lack of \nclose scrutiny appears to create a big incentive to file in state \ncourt, especially given the recent findings of a Rand study that class \nactions are increasingly concentrated in state courts.\n  Fifth, in nationwide class actions filed in state court, class \nlawyers often manipulate the pleadings to avoid removal to federal \ncourt, even by minimizing the potential claims of class members. For \nexample, state class actions often seek just over $74,000 in damages \nper plaintiff, and forsake punitive damage claims, to avoid the $75,000 \nfloor that qualifies for federal diversity jurisdiction. Or they defeat \nthe federal requirement of complete diversity by naming one class \nmember who is from the same state as a defendant, even if all other \nclass members are from different states.\n  Finally, out-of-state defendants are often hauled into state court to \naddress nationwide class claims, although federal courts are a more \nappropriate and more efficient forum. For example, an Alabama court is \nnow considering a class action--and could establish a national policy--\nin a suit brought against the big three automakers on behalf of every \nAmerican who bought a dual-equipped air bags over an eight-year period. \nThe defendants failed in their attempt to remove to federal court based \non an application of current diversity laws. And, unlike federal \ncourts, states are unable to consolidate multiple class actions that \ninvolve the same underlying facts.\n  These examples show that abuse of the class action system is not only \npossible, but real. And the incentives and realities of the current \nsystem are a big part of the problem.\n  A class action is a lawsuit in which an attorney not only represents \nan individual plaintiff, but, in addition, seeks relief for all those \nindividuals who suffered a similar injury. Prospective class members \nare usually sent notice about the class action, and are presumed to \njoin it, unless they specifically ask to be left out. When these suits \nare settled, all class members are notified of the terms of the \nsettlement and given the chance to object if they don't think the \nsettlement is fair. A court must ultimately approve a settlement \nagreement.\n  The vast majority of these suits are brought and settled fairly and \nin good faith. Unfortunately, the class action system does not \nadequately protect class members from the few unscrupulous lawyers who \nare more interested in big attorneys' fees than compensation for their \nclients, the victims. The primary problem is that the client in a class \naction is a diffuse group of thousands of individuals scattered across \nthe country, which is incapable of exercising meaningful control over \nthe litigation. As a result, while in theory the class lawyers must be \nresponsive to their clients, the lawyers control all aspects of the \nlitigation.\n  Moreover, during a class action settlement, the amount of the \nattorney fee is negotiated between plaintiffs' lawyers and the \ndefendants, just like other terms of the settlement. But in most cases \nthe fees come at the expense of class members--the only party that does \nnot have a seat at the bargaining table.\n  In addition, defendants may use class action settlements to advance \ntheir own interests. Paying a small settlement generally precludes all \nfuture claims by class members. So defendants have ample motivation to \ngive class lawyers the fees they want as the price for settling all \nfuture liabilities.\n  As a result, it is easy to see how class members are left out in the \ncold. Although the judge is supposed to determine whether the \nsettlement is fair before approving it, class lawyers and defendants \n``may even put one over on the court, a staged performance. The lawyers \nsupport the settlement to get fees; the defendants support it to evade \nliability; the court can't vindicate the class's rights because the \nfriendly presentation means that it lacks essential information,'' \nKamilewicz v. Bank of Boston Corp., 100 F.3d 1348, 1352 (Easterbrook, \nJ., dissenting) (7th Cir. 1996).\n  Although class members get settlement notices and have the \nopportunity to object, they rarely do so, especially if they have \nlittle at stake. Not only is it expensive to get representation, but \nalso it can be extremely difficult to actually understand what the \nsettlement really does. Settlements are often written in long, finely \nprinted letters with incomprehensible legalese, which even well-trained \nattorneys are hard pressed to understand. And settlements often omit \nbasic information like how much money will go toward attorneys' fees \nand where that money will come from. In Martha Preston's case, one \nprominent federal judge found that ``the notice not only didn't alert \nthe absent class members to the pending loss but also pulled the wool \nover the state judge's eyes,'' id.\n\n  We all know that class actions can result in significant and \nimportant benefits for class members and society, and that most class \nlawyers and most state courts are acting responsibly. Class actions \nhave been used to desegregate racially divided schools, to obtain \nredress for victims of employment discrimination, and to compensate \nindividuals exposed to toxic chemicals or defective products. Class \nactions increase access to our civil justice system because they enable \npeople to pursuant claims collectively that would otherwise be too \nexpensive to litigate.\n  The difficulty in any effort to improve a basically good system is \nweeding out the abuses without causing undue damage. The legislation we \npropose attempts to do this. It does not limit anyone's ability to file \nor settle a class action. It seeks to address the problem in several \nways. First, it requires that State attorneys general be notified about \nproposed class action settlements that would affect residents of their \nstates. With notice, the attorneys general can intervene in cases where \nthey think the settlements are unfair.\n  Second, the legislation requires that class members be notified of a \npotential settlement in clear, easily understood English--not legal \njargon.\n  Third, it limits class attorneys' fees to a reasonable percentage of \nthe actual damages received by plaintiffs or to reasonable hourly fees. \nThis will deter class lawyers from using inflated values of coupon \nsettlements to reap big fees. Some courts have already embraced this \nstandard, which parallels the recent securities reform law.\n  Fourth, it permits removal to federal court of certain class actions \ninvolving citizens of multiple states, at the request of unnamed class \nmembers or defendants. This provision eliminates gaming by class \nlawyers to keep cases in state court and, through consolidation of \nrelated cases in federal court, helps prevent a race to settlement \nbetween competing class actions.\n  Finally, it amends Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures \nto require the imposition of sanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits, \nalthough the nature and extent of sanctions remains discretionary. This \nprovision will deter the filing of frivolous class actions.\n  Let me emphasize the limited scope of this legislation. We do not \nclose the courthouse door to any class action. We do not require that \nState attorneys general do anything with the notice they receive. We do \nnot deny reasonable fees for class lawyers. And we do not mandate that \nevery class action be brought in federal court. Instead, we simply \npromote closer and fairer scrutiny of class actions and class \nsettlements.\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\n  These proposals have earned a broad range of support. Even Judge Paul \nNiemeyer, the Chair of the Judicial Conference's Advisory Committee on \nCivil Rules, who has studied class actions closely and testified before \nCongress on this issue, expressed his support for this ``modest'' \nmeasure, noting in particular that increasing federal jurisdiction over \nclass actions will be a positive ``meaningful step.'' Last year, our \nbill passed the Judiciary Administrative Oversight and the Courts \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. President, right now, people across the country can be dragged \ninto lawsuits unaware of their rights and unarmed on the legal \nbattlefield. What our bill does is give regular people back their \nrights and representation. This measure may not stop all abuses, but it \nmoves use forward. It will help ensure that good people like Martha \nPreston don't get ripped off.\n  Mr. President, Senator Grassley and I believe this is a moderate \napproach to correct the worst abuses, while preserving the benefits of \nclass actions. It is both pro-consumer and pro-defendant. We believe it \nwill make a difference.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Smith of \n        Oregon, and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 354. A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory trade \nstatus to the products of Mongolia; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n                  Mongolia Most-Favored-Nation Status\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs to introduce S. 354, a bill to authorize \nthe extension of nondiscriminatory treatment--formerly known as ``most-\nfavored nation status''--to the products of Mongolia. I am pleased to \nbe joined by Senator McCain, chairman of the Commerce Committee; \nSenator Kerry, the ranking minority member of my subcommittee; and \nSenator Robb and Senator Smith or Oregon as original cosponsors.\n  Mongolia has undergone a series of remarkable and dramatic changes \nover the last few years. Sandwiched between the former Soviet Union and \nChina, it was one of the first countries in the world to become \ncommunist after the Russian Revolution. After 70 years of communist \nrule, though, the Mongolian people have recently made great progress in \nestablishing a democratic political system and creating a free-market \neconomy. Since that time, there have been successive successful \nnational and regional elections.\n  Mongolia has demonstrated a strong desire to build a friendly and \ncooperative relationship with the United States on trade and related \nmatters since its turn towards democracy. We concluded a bilateral \ntrade treaty with that country in 1991, and a bilateral investment \ntreaty in 1994. Mongolia has received nondiscriminatory trading status \nsince 1991, and has been found to be in full compliance with the \nfreedom of emigration requirements of Title IV of the Trade Act of \n1974. In additions, it has acceded to the Agreement Establishing of the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n  Mr. President, Mongolia has clearly demonstrated that it is fully \ndeserving of joining the ranks of those countries to which we extend \nnondiscriminatory trade status. The extension of that status would not \nonly serve to commend the Mongolians on their impressive progress, but \nwould also enable the U.S. to avail itself of all its rights under the \nWTO with respect to Mongolia.\n  I have another, more parochial, reason for being interested in MFN \nstatus for Mongolia. Mongolia and my home state of Wyoming are sister \nstates; a strong relationship between the two has developed over the \nlast four years. Many of Mongolia's provincial governors have visited \nthe state, and the two governments have established partnerships in \neducation, agriculture, and livestock management. Like Wyoming, \nMongolia is a high plateau with mountains on the northwest border, \nwhere many of the residents make their living by raising livestock. I \nam pleased to see the development of this mutually beneficial \nrelationship, and am sure that the extension of nondiscriminatory trade \nstatus will serve to strengthen it further.\n  Mr. President, I introduced an identical bill in the last Congress, \nbut Congress adjourned sine die before the bill could be acted on by \nboth houses. I was very appreciative that last year the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, indicated his \nwillingness to favorably consider the legislation early in this \nCongress, and look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous that the text of S. 354 be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 354\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Mongolia has received nondiscriminatory trade treatment \n     since 1991 and has been found to be in full compliance with \n     the freedom of emigration requirements of title IV of the \n     Trade Act of 1974;\n       (2) Mongolia has, since ending its nearly 70 years of \n     dependence on the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, \n     established a parliamentary democracy and a free-market \n     economic system;\n       (3) Mongolia concluded a bilateral trade treaty with the \n     United States in 1991 and a bilateral investment treaty in \n     1994;\n       (4) Mongolia has acceded to the Agreement Establishing the \n     World Trade Organization;\n       (5) Mongolia has demonstrated a strong desire to build a \n     friendly and cooperative trade relationship with the United \n     States; and\n       (6) The extension of nondiscriminatory trade status to the \n     products of Mongolia would enable the United States to avail \n     itself of all the rights available under the World Trade \n     Organization with respect to Mongolia.\n\n     SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF APPLICATION OF TITLE IV OF THE TRADE \n                   ACT OF 1974 TO MONGOLIA.\n\n       (a) Presidential Determinations and Extensions of \n     Nondiscriminatory Treatment.--Notwithstanding any provision \n     of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et \n     seq.), the President may--\n       (1) determine that such title should no longer apply to \n     Mongolia; and\n       (2) after making a determination under paragraph (1) with \n     respect to Mongolia, proclaim the extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of that country.\n       (b) Termination of Application of Title IV.--On or after \n     the effective date of the extension under subsection (a)(2) \n     of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of Mongolia, \n     title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 shall cease to apply to \n     that country.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to cosponsor legislation \nwith Senators Thomas, Robb, and Kerry to grant nondiscriminatory trade \nstatus to Mongolia. Passage of this legislation will play an important \nrole in aiding Mongolia's transition to a democratic government and a \nmarket-oriented economy.\n  There has been a stunning political transformation in Mongolia since \nit broke away from Communist rule in 1990. In the past seven years, \nthere have been two presidential elections and three parliamentary \nelections. All of these have been open and democratic, and have not \nsuffered from violence or fraud.\n  The most important aspect of these elections is that they show the \ntriumph of democracy and democratic forces. In 1996, the Mongolian \nSocial Democratic Party (MSDP) and Mongolian National Democratic Party \n(MNDP) joined forces to win an unexpected victory in the parliamentary \nelections. By fulfilling its ``Contract with the Mongolian Voter,'' \nthis coalition is ensuring the establishment of a political system \nbased on our cherished democratic principles. After a few months of \nuncertainty, the Mongolian government is now back on track and \ncommitted to continue its reforms. I am happy to say that the \nInternational Republican Institute is continuing to play a major role \nin showing these political parties how to establish a stable democratic \ngovernment.\n  This democratic transformation has established a firm human rights \nregime. The Mongolian Constitution allows freedom of speech, the press \nand expression. Separation of Church and state is recognized in this \npredominantly Buddhist nation as well as the right to worship or not \nworship. Full freedom of emigration is allowed, and Mongolia now is in \nfull compliance with sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974, \nalso known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. An independent judiciary has \nbeen established to protect these rights from any future violation.\n  Mongolia is also in the middle of an economic transformation. As part \nof the ``Contract with the Mongolian\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\nVoter,'' the democratic coalition of the MNDP and MSDP ran on promises \nto establish private property rights and encourage foreign investment. \nThe Mongolian government is now steadily creating a market economy. A \nprogram has been set up to allow residents of government-owned high \nrise apartments to acquire ownership of their residence. In 1997, \nMongolia joined the international trading system by joining the World \nTrade Organization and eliminating all tariffs, except on personal \nautomobiles, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco. On January 1, 1999, the \nstate-run press became privatized. The economic news also continues to \nbe good. The 1997 GDP growth was 3.3%, and the inflation rate has \ndropped from 53.2% in 1996 to 9.2% in June, 1998. The Mongolian \ngovernment is now boldly moving to set the nation on a course to \nprivatize large-scale enterprise and reform the state pension system.\n  When I was in Mongolia in 1997, I saw the effects of this economic \ntransformation firsthand. At a town hall meeting in Kharakhorum, the \nancient capital of the Mongol Empire, I met a herdsman and asked him \nabout the economic liberalization. First, I asked him how many sheep he \nhad under Communism. He said none, because the Communists didn't allow \nprivate property. Then I asked him how many sheep he owned after \nprivatization. He answered that he had three sheep then, which is not \nmuch in a country with 25 million sheep. So I asked him how many sheep \nhe has now. He answered that he now has 90 goats, 60 sheep, 20 cows and \n6 horses. I asked him if that was considered successful. He replied \nthat he was successful as were many herdsmen in this new economy. He \nthen told me that he would never want to change the system back to what \nit was, because ``now Mongols have control over their own life and \ndestiny.'' That is the new culture of a market Mongolian economy.\n  There are many benefits to supporting Mongolian democracy and \neconomic liberalization. In 1991, Secretary of State James Baker \npromised Mongolia that the United States would be Mongolia's ``third \nneighbor.'' We remain committed to that course of action to encourage \nMongolia in its endeavors and promote it as an example of how nations \ncan successfully convert from a Communist totalitarian state to a \nmarket democracy. The democratic Mongolia has already begun to promote \npeace and stability among its neighbors by becoming the world's first \nnational nuclear-free zone. Furthermore, the United States will be able \nto count on the liberalized Mongolian economy as an important market \nfor American goods and services.\n  I hope that my colleagues here in the Senate will join me in passing \nthis legislation to grant nondiscriminatory trade status to Mongolia to \nhelp it continue its successful democratic transformation and \ntransition to a market economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 355. A bill to amend title 13, United States Code, to eliminate \nthe provision that prevents sampling from being used in determining the \npopulation for purposes of the apportionment of Representatives in \nCongress among the several States; to the Committee on Government \nAffairs.\n\n\n                a just apportionment for all states act\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Bingaman, a bill to allow the use of \nsampling in determining the populations of the states for use in \nreapportionment. The Supreme Court has ruled that the 1976 amendments \nto the Census Act do not permit sampling in determining these \npopulations. We believe sampling is vital to achieving the goal of the \nmost accurate census possible, and to a fair and accurate \nredistricting.\n  The Bureau of the Census proposes to count each census tract by mail \nand then by sending out enumerators until they have responses for 90 \npercent of the addresses. The Bureau proposes to then use sampling to \ninfer who lives at the remaining ten percent of addresses in each tract \nbased on what they know of the 90 percent. This would provide a more \naccurate census then we get by repeatedly sending enumerators to hard-\nto-count locations and would save $500 million or more in personnel \ncosts.\n  The Census plan is supported by the National Academy of Sciences' \nNational Research Council, which was directed by Congress in 1992 to \nstudy ways to achieve the most accurate population count possible. The \nNRC report finds that the Bureau should ``make a good faith effort to \ncount everyone, but then truncate physical enumeration after a \nreasonable effort to reach nonrespondents. The number and character of \nthe remaining nonrespondents should then be estimated through \nsampling.''\n  Mr. President, the taking of a census goes back centuries. I quote \nfrom the King James version of the Bible, chapter two of Luke: ``And it \ncame to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar \nAugustus that all the world should be taxed (or enrolled, according to \nthe footnote) * * * And all went to be taxed, everyone into his own \ncity.'' The early censuses were taken to enable the rule or ruling \ngovernment to tax or raise an army.\n\n  The first census for more sociological reasons was taken in \nNuremberg, in 1449. So it was not a new idea to the Founding Fathers \nwhen they wrote it into the Constitution to facilitate fair taxation \nand accurate apportionment of the House of Representatives, the latter \nof which was the foundation of the Great Compromise that has served us \nwell ever since.\n  The Constitution says in Article I, Section 2:\n\n       Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among \n     the several States which may be included within this Union, \n     according to their respective numbers, which shall be \n     determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, \n     including those bound to Service for a term of years, and \n     excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other \n     persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three \n     years of the first meeting of the Congress of the United \n     States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in \n     such manner as they shall direct by law.\n\n  Those who cite this as saying the Constitution requires an ``actual \nenumeration'' should consider whether the phrase is being taken out of \ncontext. The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality \nof sampling. Rather the Court has ruled on the census laws last amended \nin 1976.\n  I also note that we have not taken an ``actual enumeration'' the way \nthe Founding Fathers envisioned since 1960, after which enumerators \ngoing to every door were replaced with mail-in responses. The \nConstitution provides for a postal system, but did not direct that the \ncensus be taken by mail. Yet we do it that way. Why not sample if that \nis a further improvement?\n  Sampling would go far toward correcting one of the most serious flaws \nin the census, the undercount. Statistical work in the 1940's \ndemonstrated that we can estimate how many people the census misses. \nThe estimate for 1940 was 5.4 percent of the population. After \ndecreasing steadily to 1.2 percent in 1980, the 1990 undercount \nincreased to 1.8 percent, or more than four million people.\n  More significantly, the undercount is not distributed evenly. The \ndifferential undercount, as it is known, of minorities was 5.7 percent \nfor Blacks, 5.0 percent for Hispanics, 2.3 percent for Asian-Pacific \nIslanders, and 4.5 percent for Native Americans, compared with 1.2 \npercent for non-Hispanic whites. The difference between the black and \nnon-black undercount was the largest since 1940. By disproportionately \nmissing minorities, we deprive them of equal representation in Congress \nand of proportionate funding from Federal programs based on population. \nThe Census Bureau estimates that the total undercount will reach 1.9 \npercent in 2000 if the 1990 methods are used instead of sampling.\n  Mr. President, I have some history with the undercount issue. In 1966 \nwhen I became Director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and \nHarvard, I asked Professor David Heer to work with me in planning a \nconference to publicize the non-white undercount in the 1960 census and \nto foster concern about the problems of obtaining a full enumeration, \nespecially of the urban poor. I ask unanimous consent that my foreword \nto the report from that conference be printed in the Record, for it is, \nsave for some small numerical changes, disturbingly still relevant. \nSampling is the key to the problem and we must proceed with it so that \nwe have one accurate census count for all purposes, all uses. I also \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord and I hope my colleagues will support it.\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Heer)\n\n\n                                FOREWORD\n\n       At one point in the course of the 1950's John Kenneth \n     Galbraith observed that it is the statisticians, as much as \n     any single group, who shape public policy, for the simple \n     reason that societies never really become effectively \n     concerned with social problems until they learn to measure \n     them. An unassuming truth, perhaps, but a mighty one, and one \n     that did more than he may know to sustain morale in a number \n     of Washington bureaucracies (hateful word!) during a period \n     when the relevant cabinet officers had on their own reached \n     very much the same conclusion--and distrusted their charges \n     all the more in consequence. For it is one of the ironies of \n     American government that individuals and groups that have \n     been most resistant to liberal social change have quite \n     accurately perceived that social statistics are all too \n     readily transformed into political dynamite, whilst in a \n     curious way the reform temperament has tended to view the \n     whole statistical process as plodding, overcautious, and \n     somehow a brake on progress. (Why must every statistic be \n     accompanied by detailed notes about the size of the \n     ``standard error''?)\n       The answer, of course, is that this is what must be done if \n     the fact is to be accurately stated, and ultimately accepted. \n     But, given this atmosphere of suspicion on the one hand and \n     impatience on the other, it is something of a wonder that the \n     statistical officers of the federal government have with \n     such fortitude and fairness remained faithful to a high \n     intellectual calling, and an even more demanding public \n     trust.\n       There is no agency of which this is more true than the \n     Bureau of the Census, the first, still the most important, \n     information-gathering agency of the federal government. For \n     getting on, now, for two centuries, the Census has collected \n     and compiled the essential facts of the American experience. \n     Of late the ten-year cycle has begun to modulate somewhat, \n     and as more an more current reports have been forthcoming, \n     the Census has been quietly transforming itself into a \n     continuously flowing source of information about the American \n     people. In turn, American society has become more and more \n     dependent on it. It would be difficult to find an aspect of \n     public or private life not touched and somehow shaped by \n     Census information. And yet for all this, it is somehow \n     ignored. To declare that the Census is without friends would \n     be absurd. But partisans? When Census appropriations are cut, \n     who bleeds on Capitol Hill or in the Executive Office of the \n     President? The answer is almost everyone in general, and \n     therefore no one in particular. But the result, too often, is \n     the neglect, even the abuse, of an indispensable public \n     institution, which often of late has served better than it \n     has been served.\n       The papers in this collection, as Professor Heer's \n     introduction explains, were presented at a conference held in \n     June 1976 with the avowed purpose of arousing a measure of \n     public concern about the difficulties encountered by the \n     Census in obtaining a full count of the urban poor, \n     especially perhaps the Negro poor. It became apparent, for \n     example, that in 1960 one fifth of nonwhite males aged 25-29 \n     had in effect disappeared and had been left out of the Census \n     count altogether. Invisible men. Altogether, one tenth of the \n     nonwhite population had been ``missed.'' The ramifications of \n     this fact were considerable, and its implications will \n     suggest themselves immediately. It was hoped that a public \n     airing of the issue might lead to greater public support to \n     ensure that the Census would have the resources in 1970 to do \n     what is, after all, its fundamental job, that of counting all \n     the American people. As the reader will see, the scholarly \n     case for providing this support was made with considerable \n     energy and candor. But perhaps the most compelling argument \n     arose from a chance remark by a conference participant to the \n     effect that if the decennial census were not required by the \n     Constitution, the Bureau would doubtless never have survived \n     the economy drives of the nineteenth century. The thought \n     flashed: the full enumeration of the American population is \n     not simply an optional public service provided by government \n     for the use of sales managers, sociologists, and regional \n     planners. It is, rather, the constitutionally mandated \n     process whereby political representation in the Congress is \n     distributed as between different areas of the nation. It is a \n     matter not of convenience but of the highest seriousness, \n     affecting the very foundations of sovereignty. That being the \n     case, there is no lawful course but to provide the Bureau \n     with whatever resources are necessary to obtain a full \n     enumeration. Inasmuch as Negroes and other ``minorities'' are \n     concentrated in specific urban locations, to undercount \n     significantly the population in those areas is to deny \n     residents their rights under Article I, Section 3 of the \n     Constitution, as well, no doubt, as under Section 1 of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment. Given the further, more recent practice \n     of distributing federal, state, and local categorical aid on \n     the basis not only of the number but also social and economic \n     characteristics of local populations, the constitutional case \n     for full enumeration would seem to be further strengthened.\n       A sound legal case? Others will judge; and possibly one day \n     the courts will decide. But of one thing the conference had \n     no doubt: the common-sense case is irrefutable. America needs \n     to count all its people. (And reciprocally, all its people \n     need to make themselves available to be counted.) But if the \n     legal case adds any strength to the common-sense argument, it \n     remains only to add that should either of the arguments bring \n     some improvement in the future, ti will be but another \n     instance of the generosity of the Carnegie Corporation, which \n     provided funds for the conference and for this publication.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of this \nimportant legislation being introduced today by my friend from New \nYork, Senator Moynihan. This bill turns into law what we all recognize \nis the only practical way to count our citizens in the decennial \ncensus. There is no question--the science is unequivocal--sampling is \nthe only way to assure an accurate census.\n  Not only does sampling provide a better census, it costs less than \nall other alternative methods--as much as $3 billion less. What could \nbe clearer? Sampling gives a better answer at a lower cost. This bill \nought to pass the Senate unanimously.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution says the census shall be conducted in \na manner that Congress shall by law direct. The recent Supreme Court \ncase found that under the current law sampling may be used for all \naspects of the census except for the decision on how many \nrepresentatives each state will have. In fact, current law says \nsampling shall be used for every other purpose of the census.\n  My state now has three House members and that number isn't going to \nchange after this census one way or the other. However, we now know New \nMexico had the second highest undercount rate in the 1990 census--3.1 \npercent, or nearly 50,000 New Mexicans were simply left out, including \n20,000 children. Among New Mexico's native American community, the \nundercount rate was an astounding 9 percent. This undercount is \nliterally costing New Mexico millions of dollars every year.\n  In Albuquerque, our largest city, 12,000 men, women, and children \nwere left out. Nationwide, 4 million Americans were not accounted for.\n  Mr. President, this massive undercount is unacceptable to New Mexico \nand should be unacceptable to every Senator, especially when the Census \nBureau has a solution that is tried, tested, and reliable. I believe \nevery citizen counts, and every citizen should be counted.\n  Federal funding for education, transportation, crime prevention and \nother priorities is allocated to states based on population. The \nmajority of people overlooked in the past census are poor, the very \ncitizens we must assure are not being left out. If the existing \nundercount is repeated in future censuses, New Mexico will again be \ndenied its fair share of critical federal funds.\n  Under current law we can have a two-number census, one without \nsampling for apportionment and one with sampling for all other \npurposes. I can appreciate why some people don't want a two-number \ncensus. The country would be better served with only a single-number \ncensus as long as it's the best number the Census Bureau can come up \nwith. However, some in Congress would use the appropriations process to \nstymie the census.\n  Mr. President, the census is done only once per decade, it is too \nimportant to decide this issue as part of the annual appropriation \nprocess. This bill will assure that the Census Bureau has available the \nvery best tools for this important task. Science-based sampling is the \nonly way to give America the quality we demand in our census. It is \ninconceivable to me that anyone would support a second-rate census.\n  I am pleased to support this bill, and I hope the Senate will take \nprompt action on it. I also urge the House to move forward quickly to \npass this important legislation. I thank Mr. Moynihan for his efforts.\n\n[[Page S1173]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 356.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to transfer \ntitle to the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District in Yuma, \nArizona from the Federal government to the project beneficiaries. If \nyou think this sounds like deja vu, you would be correct--it is. In May \nof 1998, during the 105th Congress, I introduced the same bill. The \nversion I introduce today is the same version the passed the Senate at \nthe end of last Congress. The bill was approved by all the relevant \nHouse and Senate Committees, passed by the Senate, included in a \npackage of similar bills in the House, but, for reasons that I have not \nbeen able to determine, never managed to get signed into law. And this \nparticular project transfer was one Regional Director Bob Johnson \ncalled ``low hanging fruit.'' In a meeting in my office, he assured me \nthat the Wellton-Mohawk project was a ``perfect example'' of the kind \nof project that should transfer under the administration's 1995 \nFramework for Transfer. So this is exactly the kind of project the \nDepartment of the Interior should transfer project title from the \nDepartment to the project beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator John McCain for \ncosponsoring this bill with me and I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 356\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       Sec. 1.

Mr. President, I have a number of bills I want to \nintroduce today. I want to start out by talking a little bit about the \nthree bills dealing with budget reform, and then also an important bill \nleading to crop insurance reform.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce these bills that would \nreform the Federal budget process, strengthen fiscal discipline and \nrestore Government accountability to ensure that taxpayers are fully \nrepresented in Washington.\n  I commend Leader Lott and Chairman Domenici for including budget \nprocess reform as one of the top five priorities in the 106th Congress. \nI believe this should be our immediate priority as we prepare to make \nour budget process work better.\n  Mr. President, the Federal budget process has become a reckless game \nin which the team roster is limited to a handful of Washington \npoliticians and technocrats while the taxpayers are relegated to the \nsidelines.\n  This has not only weakened the nation's fiscal discipline but also \nundermined the system of checks and balances established by the \nConstitution.\n  The most recent example of this abusive process was the 1998 Omnibus \nAppropriation legislation. The bill included $520 billion in funding \nfor many essential Government programs, representing 8 out of Congress' \n13 annual appropriations bills.\n  But the entire negotiations were exclusive, arbitrary, and conducted \nbehind closed doors by only a few congressional leaders and White House \nstaff.\n  Few Members of the Congress had any idea what was in the bill but \nwere asked to approve it, without debate, without adequate review, \nwithout amendments, and without roll call votes.\n  As a result, Washington broke the spending caps mandated in last \nyear's Balanced Budget Act by spending more than $21 billion of the \nsurplus for so-called ``emergency'' purposes.\n  Budget negotiators magically invented a new smoke and mirrors budget \nterm--``forward funding'' which shifted $9.3 billion into future \nbudgets. Long-criticized ``backdoor spending'' thrived: for example, \nlawmakers sneaked $1 billion to fund programs to achieve initiatives \nunder the Kyoto treaty. The White House has not sent up the Treaty and \nthe Congress has many reservations about it.\n  Without any policy consideration, hundreds of millions of taxpayer \ndollars went to fund such pork programs as, amazingly, caffeinated \nchewing gum research.\n  The budget process is seriously flawed. Twenty-five years ago, \nCongress tried to change its budget practices and get spending under \ncontrol by passing the Congressional Budget Act. Yet, over these 25 \nyears, our national debt has grown from $540 billion to $5.6 trillion.\n  Spending is at an all-time high, and so are taxes. The budget process \nhas become so complicated that most lawmakers have a hard time \nunderstanding it. Of course, that hasn't stopped the proliferation of \nbudget gimmicks to circumvent the intent of the Congress.\n  Before the situation explodes completely, Congress must immediately \nreform the budget process to ensure the integrity of our budget and \nappropriations process. We can begin in the 106th Congress by taking a \nfew simple steps.\n  The first step is to ensure our government's continued operation \nwithout any interruption. Last week, I introduced important legislation \nthat would continue funding for the Government at the prior year's \nlevel when Congress and the President fail to complete appropriations \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\n  Mr. President, we all still have a fresh memory of the 1995 Federal \nGovernment shutdown, the longest one in history, which caused financial \ndamage and inconvenience to millions of Americans when the President \nrefused to support a Balanced Budget Act and tax relief for Americans.\n  However, the most serious damage done by the 27-day shutdown was that \nit shook the American people's confidence in their Government and in \ntheir elected officials.\n  I am concerned that President Clinton would use this technique again \nto force Congress into spending more money. I believe we can do better \nfor the taxpayers and believe my legislation, the Good Government bill, \nwill help to do that.\n  In May of 1997, I first proposed this as a stand-alone vote in an \neffort to pass the flood relief bill for Northern Minnesota. The Senate \nDemocratic leader agreed and supported my proposal. I was able to \nobtain a commitment from the Senate leadership of both parties to \npursue the legislation separately in the near future.\n  Last summer, I sought to offer it as an amendment to an \nappropriations bill. This amendment, originally sponsored by Senator \nMcCain, would have created an automatic procedure for a CR at the end \nof each fiscal year. Unfortunately, my efforts were not successful.\n  If I had succeeded, we would not have had to go through the debacle \nlast year's omnibus spending bill.\n  Mr. President, we all have different philosophies and policies on \nbudget priorities, and of course we will not always agree.\n  But there are essential functions and services of the Federal \nGovernment we must continue to fund regardless of our differences in \nbudget priorities. Program funding must be based on merits, not on \npolitical leverage.\n  This legislation would continue funding for the Federal Government at \n100 percent of the previous year's level when Congress and the \nPresident fail to complete appropriations legislation at the end of any \nfiscal year.\n  The virtue of this legislation is that it would allow us to debate \nissues concerning spending policy and the merits of budget priorities \nwhile we continue to keep essential Government functions operating. The \nAmerican taxpayer will no longer be held hostage to a Government \nshutdown.\n  Mr. President, there are still plenty of uncertainties involved in \nour budget and appropriations process, particularly this year. We must \nensure that this good-government contingency plan is adopted to keep \nthe Government up and running in the event a budget agreement is not \nreached.\n  Another step we must take is to control our emergency spending. \nEmergency spending is spending over the budget allotment and is \nsupposed to cover true emergencies, such as natural disaster relief.\n  Instead, Congress and the Administration have used this as an \nopportunity to bust the budget for a lot of spending that is not \nemergency related at all. Most of this spending can be planned within \nour budget limits. Even natural disasters happen regularly--why not put \nsomething in our budget to pay for them?\n  That is why I am introducing the ``Emergency Spending Control Act'' \ntoday as well. This legislation would require the President to submit a \nline item in his budget for natural disaster relief funding. The \nfunding levels for this line item would be based on the average \nspending of the last five years on natural disaster relief.\n  The amount in this line item would not be subject to the current \nspending caps. The funding of this budget line item must be used \nexclusively for natural disaster relief--any use for non-natural \ndisasters is strictly prohibited.\n  Mr. President, as a Senator whose State has been previously \ndevastated by the 1997 flood of the Red and Minnesota Rivers, \ntornadoes, snow, ice and other natural disasters, I know how important \nenacting this legislation is not only for Minnesotans, but for all \nAmericans.\n  Fortunately, city mayors, the State of Minnesota, and the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency acted quickly in the Red River Valley, and \nthe rebuilding process moved relatively fast.\n  Local governments continue to work closely with my office and with \nState and Federal agencies to answer the many questions that still \narise as people seek to rebuild their homes, their businesses, and the \nrest of their lives.\n  We owe it to these Minnesotans and other Americans who have been \nfaced with a natural disaster to require the President to submit a line \nitem in his budget for natural disaster relief funding.\n  Local and State officials should not be required to come to \nWashington and lobby for funding every time that a natural disaster \noccurs. We should not have to consider and pass separate ``emergency'' \nlegislation which becomes a magnet for other so-called emergency \nspending. Disasters occur every year, we should budget for them.\n  Mr. President, the second to the last bill I am introducing today is \na bill to enforce and expand the statutory spending caps. Spending \nlimits are a good tool to control spending--if the President and \nlawmakers stick to them. But since the establishment of statutory \nspending limits, Washington has repeatedly broken them.\n  Washington set forth new spending caps in 1990 after it failed to \nmeet its deficit reduction targets. In 1993, President Clinton broke \nthe statutory spending caps for his new spending increases and created \nnew caps.\n  But in 1997, the President could not live within his own spending \ncaps, and he broke them again. Last year, President Clinton proposed \nover $22 billion of so-called ``emergency spending'' in the omnibus \nspending legislation and again broke the caps.\n  Again and again, Washington lowers the fiscal bar and then jumps over \nit at the expense of the American taxpayers.\n  This is wrong. Mr. President. If we commit to living within the \nstatutory spending caps, we must stick to it. We must use every tool \navailable to enforce these spending limits.\n  My legislation will help Congress to enforce its fiscal discipline by \ncreating a new budget point of order to allow Congress to exceed \nspending limits only if two-thirds of its members vote to do so.\n  In addition, my bill would extend the limits beyond the year 2000. \nDoing so will ensure that spending increases won't grow faster than the \nincome growth of working Americans.\n  There are many other budget process reforms I support as well, \npromoted by other Senators. One I would like to highlight is the \nbiennial budget, which is proposed by our distinguished colleague, \nSenator Domenici. Biennial budgeting will allow us to examine our \nfiscal discipline as well as providing valuable time for our oversight \nresponsibilities.\n  If the Congress adopts each of these changes, it will ensure a budget \nprocess that serves the best interests of the nation, allows careful \npolicy and spending deliberation, and strengthens our political \ninstitution of government through representation as established by the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. President, finally I want to take a few minutes to introduce a \nbill which takes an important step toward improving the nation's \nfederal crop insurance program--and that is a bill that I have \nintroduced, the ``Crop Insurance Reform Act.''\n  Last year, we witnessed devastating circumstances come together to \ncreate a crisis atmosphere for many of our nation's farmers. I know \nthat in my own state of Minnesota, multiple years of wet weather and \ncrop disease--especially scab--coupled with rising production costs and \nplummeting commodity prices have devastated family farms in record \nnumbers.\n  With the increased opportunities that accompany Freedom to Farm come \nincreased risks. We've seen this first hand.\n  Freedom to Farm can work, but a necessary component of it, as I have \nargued repeatedly, is an adequate crop insurance program. This \ncomponent has been missing so far. One of the promises made during \ndebate of the 1996 Farm Bill was that Congress would address the need \nfor better crop insurance.\n  We must not let another growing season pass without having instituted \na new, effective crop insurance program.\n  This overhaul is a major undertaking, and instituting a program of \ncomprehensive reform should be and is now a legislative priority.\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\n  In fact, the President has included a number of ideas for reforming \nthe federal crop insurance program in his recent budget proposal. Most \nimportantly, the President has suggested increasing the federal \nsubsidies on crop insurance premiums and eliminating disparities in \nsubsidy rates. Essentially, this is similar to legislation I introduced \nlast year and am introducing again today. Unfortunately, while the \nPresident claims to support crop insurance reform, he has failed to \nidentify any money in his budget to fund it. However, now that he has \nrecognized the urgency of the situation, I hope we can work together to \naccomplish meaningful reform.\n  Furthermore, we must resume the debate now so that we can have the \nbest system in place in time, and that we can do it in time for the \nyear 2000 crops. The bill I am introducing today is a first step. It is \nthe result of months of work from my Minnesota Crop Insurance Work \nGroup.\n  The Work Group consists of various commodity groups, farm \norganizations, rural lenders, and agriculture economists. We have also \nworked closely with USDA's Farm Service and Risk Management Agencies. \nBut it was my primary intention to assemble a committee of farmers and \nlenders--people who know the situation and have seen the problems \nfirsthand.\n  The Crop Insurance Reform Act is designed to address the coverage \ndecision a farmer must make at the initial stages of purchasing crop \ninsurance. Producers have been telling us that they need better \ncoverage, but that it is currently too expensive.\n  My bill will allow more options for producers to choose from when \nmaking risk-management decisions. It essentially provides farmers with \nan enhanced coverage product at a more affordable price.\n  Currently, producer premium subsidies range from nearly 42 percent at \nthe 100 percent price election for 65 percent coverage, to only 13 \npercent at the 100 percent price election for 85 percent coverage. \nAlthough the Risk Management Agency has recently provided better \nproduct options, the relatively low subsidy levels at the higher ends \nof coverage make them cost prohibitive.\n  My bill will put in place a flat subsidy level of 31 percent across \nthe 100 percent price election and at all levels of coverage.\n  This will adjust the producer premiums to make better coverage more \naffordable, thereby removing the incentive from purchasing lesser-grade \ncoverage. The Crop Insurance Reform Act puts the focus of the coverage \ndecision on what really matters: and that is the type of coverage which \nwould be needed in the event of a disaster or loss, rather than simply \nmaking the decision based upon up-front costs.\n  When farmers are armed with the necessary risk management tools, I \nbelieve everybody will save. The government saves in ad hoc disaster \npayments, arguably the most expensive way to address any kind of \nfinancial crisis. But more importantly, the family farmer saves.\n  This bill is part of a continued effort to reform Federal Crop \nInsurance.\n  Over the next few months, I will continue to work with my Crop \nInsurance Work Group, and my colleagues, Senators Lugar and Roberts, to \ncraft a comprehensive program which directly benefits producers and \nalso will be here to protect the taxpayers.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the second bill I am introducing with my \ngood friend, Senator Crapo of Idaho, is lockbox legislation.\n  Before being elected to the Senate in 1998, Mike Crapo led the fight \nto enact the Lock Box legislation in the House of Representatives. His \nversion of the Lock Box legislation was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives on four different occassions, both as a free standing \nbill and as an amendment. I am pleased to have Senator Crapo as a \npartner on this legislation in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, our short-term fiscal situation has improved greatly \ndue to the continued growth of our economy. It is reported that we may \nend up with a unified budget surplus of over $80 billion this year and \na $4.5 trillion surplus in the next 15 years.\n  Of course, tax dollars are always considered ``free money'' by the \nbig spenders here in Washington, and the thought of all that new ``free \nsurplus money'' is creating a feeding frenzy on Capitol Hill.\n  If we don't lock away this increased revenue for the taxpayers, the \ngovernment will spend every penny of it. Despite the rhetoric about \nreserving it all for Social Security, Washington has already spent $30 \nbillion of last year's budget surplus.\n  We need a lockbox to dedicate any increased revenue in the future and \nreturn it to the taxpayers as tax relief, debt reduction, and Social \nSecurity reform.\n  Since the unexpected revenue has come directly from working \nAmericans, I believe it is only fair to return it to them. The tax \nburden on the American people is still historically high. It's sound \npolicy to use our non-Social Security surplus to lower the tax burden \nand allow families to keep a little more of their hard-earned money.\n  Over the past 30 years, as I mentioned, we have amassed a $5.6 \ntrillion national debt thanks to Washington's culture of spending. A \nnewborn child today will bear over $20,000 of that debt the moment he \nor she comes into the world. Each year, we sink more than $250 billion \ninto the black hole of interest payments, which could be better spent \nfighting crime, maintaining roads and bridges, and equipping the \nmilitary. It's sound policy to use part of any surpluses to begin \npaying down the national debt and reducing the financial burden on the \nnext generations.\n  The budget surpluses also give us a great opportunity to address our \nother long-term financial imbalances. Federal unfunded liabilities \ncould eventually top $20 trillion, bankrupting our government if no \nreal reform occurs.\n  It's vitally important that we use the entire Social Security surplus \nexclusively for Social Security, and we should even use a portion of \nthe non-Social Security surplus to finance Social Security reforms.\n  If we don't lock in the surplus, Washington will spend all of it to \nexpand the government. That's what they are doing now. Last month \nalone, President Clinton proposed 41 new programs. The spending \nincreases he outlined could reach $300 billion a year, the highest \nincrease proposed by any President in our history.\n  Mr. President, we must never, never, never repeat the mistake we made \nin 1997 and 1998, and allow Washington take a huge bite into the \ntaxpayers' money. We must do everything we can to ensure we reserve any \nincreased revenue for Social Security, tax relief and debt reduction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 362. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Coastal Heritage \nTrail Route in New Jersey, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n LEGISLATION TO REAUTHORIZE THE NEW JERSEY COASTAL HERITAGE TRAIL ROUTE\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nreauthorize the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route so that we can \nallow the National Park Service, together with its partners, to \ncomplete its work in bringing recognition to New Jersey's rich coastal \nhistory. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Torricelli in sponsoring \nthis legislation.\n  The Coastal Heritage Trail Route was first authorized in 1988 through \nlegislation sponsored by former Senator Bill Bradley and myself. This \nlegislation authorized the Secretary of the Interior to design a \nvehicular route that would enable the public to enjoy the nationally \nsignificant natural and cultural sites along the New Jersey coastline. \nThanks to the work of the National Park Service, the Coastal Heritage \nTrail Route will, at completion, have five theme trails to allow for \nthe self-discovery of topics ranging from maritime history to wildlife \nmigration. These five vehicular discovery trails will travel along the \ncoast of New Jersey, through eight different counties, by way of the \nGarden State Parkway and State Highway 49.\n  The first theme trail completed is the Maritime History trail. The \npurpose of this trail is to explore the coastal trade, defense of the \nnation, and fishing and ship building industries. The second trail is \nthe Coastal\n\n[[Page S1176]]\n\nHabitats trail. This trail enables visitors to learn about the special \nnatural resources of the New Jersey coast and the plants, animals and \nespecially birds that live there. The recently opened Wildlife \nMigrations trail, allows individuals to explore the special places that \nmigrating species depend on along New Jersey's coast. A fourth trail is \nthe Historic Settlements trail. When completed, this trail will bring \nthe historic communities whose economies were based on local natural \nresources to life. The final tour, Relaxation and Inspiration, will \ndepict how people have traditionally used their leisure time, at places \nsuch as religious retreats and historic boardwalks.\n  The project, which was originally conceived and designed to recognize \nthe importance of New Jersey's coastal areas in our nation's history, \nhas grown into a rich partnership between the federal government, state \nand local governments, and private individuals. This partnership \ndemonstrates a commitment among many levels of government and the \nprivate sector to bringing history to life.\n  Mr. President, the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route is clearly \none of the National Park Service's success stories. Legislation to \nrenew authorization for the trail enacted in 1994 appropriately called \nupon the Park Service to match 50 percent of its federal funding with \nnon-federal funds. I am pleased to report that the Service has gone \nwell beyond that matching requirement. Since 1994, appropriations for \nthe Trail Route totaled $1.8 million. During that same period, the Park \nService has raised $2.8 million in matching funds.\n  However, the work is not yet finished. Even though the Park Service \nhas been able to meet the funding requirements, at this time, only the \nfirst three trails have been completed. The Park Service plans call for \ncompleting the two remaining trails, and adding three new visitor \ncenters and interpretive materials to aid school children as they learn \nabout New Jersey's history. Our bill would make this possible by \nincreasing the authorization level for the trail to $4 million, and \nextend the authorization to the Year 2004, which would give the Park \nService the additional time it needs to complete the Trail Route.\n  The Coastal Heritage Trail Route brings national recognition and \nstature to many of New Jersey's special places, and helps to contribute \nto New Jersey's number two industry, tourism. Most importantly, the \nTrail Route provides residents and visitors with an opportunity to \nexplore New Jersey's natural and cultural history and develop an \nappreciation for its importance. But what should happen if we don't \nreauthorize the funds for this program? Among other effects, New Jersey \nresidents and visitors to our state will have lost valuable educational \nopportunities. Much of the $2 million in grants that the project has \nsuccessfully generated will have been lost. And there would be a severe \nimpact on tourism if the five themes are not fully developed.\n  Mr. President, I just wanted to take a moment to commend Senator \nMurkowski, the Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and Senator Thomas, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nNational Parks, Historic Preservation, and Recreation. They and the \nmembers of their staff worked hard in the last Congress to mark up this \nlegislation and report it favorably to the full Senate. Although this \nbill was approved overwhelmingly by my colleagues in the Senate in the \nlast Congress, the House of Representatives did not vote on this \nlegislation prior to adjournment, and thus we must begin again. I have \nevery confidence that this important legislation will pass both houses \nof Congress in a timely fashion during this session. Just today, the \nHouse Resources Committee reported out the House version of this bill, \nH.R. 171, introduced by Rep. Frank A. LoBiondo.\n  The completion of the Coastal Heritage Trail Route is an important \npriority for New Jersey. The trail system will provide a sense of \nhistory, not solely for the residents of New Jersey, but for its \nvisitors as well. By repealing the sunset provision on the original \nact, and increasing the authorization, the National Park Service will \nbe allowed to complete the project that deserves to be finished.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 362\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Section 6 of Public Law 100-515 (16 U.S.C. 1244 note) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``$1,000,000'' and \n     inserting ``$4,000,000''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c), by striking ``five'' and inserting \n     ``10''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 363. A bill to establish a program for training residents of low-\nincome rural areas for, and employing the residents in, new \ntelecommunications industry jobs located in rural areas, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n    THE RURAL EMPLOYMENT IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure to \nintroduce ``The Rural Employment in Telecommunications Industry Act of \n1999.''\n  The introduction of this Bill marks a historic opportunity for rural \ncommunities to create jobs within the telecommunications industry. The \nBill establishes a program to train residents of low income rural areas \nfor employment in telecommunications industry jobs located in those \nsame rural areas.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have an initiative called ``rural \npayday'' and I believe this Bill is yet another step in creating jobs \nfor our rural areas. All too often a rural area is characterized by a \nhigh number of low income residents and a high unemployment rate.\n  Moreover, our rural areas are often dependent upon a small number of \nemployers or a single industry for employment opportunities. \nConsequently, when there is a plant closing, a downturn in the economy, \nor a slowdown in the area's industry the already present problems are \nonly compounded.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take a moment and talk about New \nMexico.\n  While New Mexico may be the 5th largest state by size with its \nbeautiful mountains, desert, and Great Plains and vibrant cities such \nas Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Las Cruces it is also a very rural state. \nThe Northwest and Southeast portions of the state are closely tied to \nthe fortunes of the oil and gas industry. Additionally, a community can \nbe dealt a severe blow with the closing or downsizing of an employer or \nmanufacturing plant.\n  I would also like to mention that communities like Clovis and Roswell \nare already taking steps to lay the foundation for creating jobs \nthrough the Call Center Industry. Just recently in Clovis, over a 1,000 \npeople participated in a Career Expo that focused on attracting Call \nCenter companies to the area.\n  As I stated before, all too often rural areas do not possess the \nresources of more metropolitan areas and can be devastated by a single \nevent or downturn in the economy. The Bill I am introducing today will \nallow communities, like those I just mentioned, to apply for Federal \naid to assist them in taking the next step in attracting \ntelecommunications jobs.\n  The Bill will allow the Secretary of Labor to establish a program to \npromote rural employment in the telecommunications industry by \nproviding grants to states with low income rural areas. The program \nwill be a win win proposition for all involved because employers \nchoosing to participate in the project by bringing jobs to the rural \narea will be assured of a highly skilled workforce.\n  The program will provide residents with intensive services to train \nthem for the new jobs in the telecommunications industry. The intensive \nservices will include customized training and appropriate remedial \ntraining, support services and placement of the individual in one of \nthe new jobs created by the program.\n  And that is what this bill is about, providing people with the tools \nneeded to succeed. With these steps we are embarking on the road of \nproviding our rural areas throughout our nation with a vehicle to \ncreate jobs. We are creating opportunities and an environment where our \ncitizens can succeed and our communities can be vibrant.\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 364. A bill to improve certain loan programs of the Small Business \nAdministration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness.\n\n\n           small business investment improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business \nInvestment Improvement Act of 1999. I am pleased to announce that two \nof my colleagues from the Committee on Small Business, Senator Kerry \nand Senator Lieberman, have joined as principal cosponsors. This is an \nimportant bill for one simple reason: it makes more investment capital \navailable to small businesses that are seeking to grow and hire new \nemployees.\n  In 1958, Congress created the SBIC Program to assist small business \nowners obtain investment capital. Forty years later, small businesses \ncontinue to experience difficulty in obtaining investment capital from \nbanks and traditional investment sources. Although investment capital \nis readily available to large businesses from traditional Wall Street \ninvestment firms, small businesses seeking investments in the range of \n$500,000-$2.5 million have to look elsewhere. SBICs are frequently the \nonly sources of investment capital for growing small businesses.\n  In 1992 and 1996, the Committee on Small Business worked closely with \nthe Small Business Administration to correct earlier deficiencies in \nthe law in order to ensure the future of the program. Today, the SBIC \nProgram is expanding rapidly in an effort to meet the growing demands \nof small business owners for debt and equity investment capital.\n  Last year, the Committee on Small Business approved a bill similar to \nthe bill being introduced today. Today's bill includes two technical \nchanges in the SBIC program. The first change removes a requirement \nthat at least 50 percent of the annual program level of the approved \nparticipating securities under the SBIC Program be reserved for funding \nwith SBICs having private capital of not more than $20 million. The \nrequirement has become obsolete following SBA's imposition of its \nleverage commitment process and Congressional approval for SBA to issue \nfive year commitments for SBIC leverage.\n  The second technical change requires SBA to issue SBIC guarantees and \ntrust certificates at periodic intervals of not less than 12 months. \nThe current requirement is six months. This change will give maximum \nflexibility for SBA and the SBIC industry to negotiate the placement of \ncertificates that fund leverage and obtain the lowest possible interest \nrate.\n  The Small Business Investment Improvement Act of 1999 clarifies the \nrules for the determination of an eligible small business or small \nenterprise that is not required to pay Federal income tax at the \ncorporate level, but that is required to pass income through to its \nshareholders or partners by using a specified formula to compute its \nafter-tax income. This provision is intended to permit ``pass through'' \nenterprises to be treated the same as enterprises that pay Federal \ntaxes for purposes of SBA size standard determinations.\n  The bill would also make a relatively small change in the operation \nof the program. This change, however, would help smaller, small \nbusinesses to be more attractive to investors. SBICs would be permitted \nto accept royalty payments contingent on future performance from \ncompanies in which they invest as a form of equity return for their \ninvestment.\n  SBA already permits SBICs to receive warrants from small businesses, \nwhich give the investing SBIC the right to acquire a portion of the \nequity of the small business. By pledging royalties or warrants, the \nsmall business is able to reduce the interest that would otherwise be \npayable by the small business to the SBIC. Importantly, the royalty \nfeature provides the smaller, small business with an incentive to \nattract SBIC investments when the return may otherwise be insufficient \nto attract venture capital.\n  Lastly, the bill increases the program authorization levels to fund \nParticipating Securities. In Fiscal Year 1999, the authorization level \nwould increase from $800 million to $1.2 billion; in Fiscal Year 2000, \nit would increase from $900 million to $1.5 billion. The two increases \nhave become necessary as the demand in the SBIC program was growing at \na rapid rate. Higher authorization levels are necessary if the SBIC \nProgram is going to meet the demand for investment capital from the \nsmall business community.\n  Mr. President, this is a sound legislative proposal, which has the \nsupport of many of my colleagues on the Committee on Small Business.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       ``This Act may be cited as the `Small Business Investment \n     Act of 1958'.''.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join Chairman Bond in support of \nthe Small Business Investment Company Technical Corrections Act.\n  The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program is vital to our \nfastest growing small companies that have capital needs exceeding the \ncaps on SBA's loan programs, but are not large enough to be attractive \nto traditional venture capital investors. The demand is clear: Last \nyear, participating securities in the SBIC program invested $360 \nmillion in 495 financings. In Massachusetts, where there is an \nimpressive community of fast-growing companies, particularly in the hi-\ntech industry, there were 140 SBIC financings, worth $145.4 million.\n  This legislation sets out to make five technical changes. They range \nfrom improving the incentive for SBIC's to loan money to small \ncompanies to structuring a fairer formula for determining whether \ncompanies of the same revenue size can quality for SBIC financing. One \nof the most important changes will increase the authorized levels for \nparticipating securities.\n  The Participating Securities component of the SBIC program invests \nprincipally in the equities of new or expanding businesses. To leverage \nthe private capital of participating securities and better serve these \nfast-growing businesses, I supported Senator Lieberman's amendment to \nH.R. 3412 during the last Congress, which would have raised the \nauthorization level for participating securities from $800 million to \n$1 billion in fiscal year 1999 and from $900 million to $1.2 billion in \nfiscal year 2000. This bill passed the Senate Small Business Committee \nand the full Senate by unanimous consent, but unfortunately, the House \nwas unable to act on it before the 105th Congress ended.\n  Since that amendment was introduced, we have seen that the need is \neven greater than those levels. The Administration anticipates faster \ngrowth in the SBIC program because of both its increasing popularity \nand the increase in additional personnel at the Small Business \nAdministration to its SBIC licensing unit. In fiscal years 1997 and \n1998, SBA licensed approximately 30 new SBIC's per year. With more \nstaff devoted to the licensing unit, SBA projects that it will license \nmore than double that amount in fiscal year 1999. Accordingly, Senator \nBond's Act would increase the authorization level to $1.2 billion in \nFY99 and to $1.5 billion in FY2000.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation and I \napplaud the work of my colleagues on the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, Chairman Bond and Senator Lieberman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 365. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act, to \nallow States to use the funds available under the State children's \nhealth insurance program for an enhanced matching rate for coverage of \nadditional children under the Medicaid program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                      children's health equity act\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President. In 1997, Congress and the President agreed \nto provide $48 billion over the next 10 years as an incentive to states \nto provide health care coverage to uninsured, low-income children. To \nreceive this money, states must expand eligibility levels to children \nliving in families with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty \nlevel.\n  Washington State has a strong record of ensuring that its low-income \nkids have access to health care. Five years ago, my state decided to do \nwhat Congress and the President have just last year required other \nstates to do. In 1994, Washington expanded its child Medicaid \neligibility level to 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL) all the \nway through to the age of 18.\n  During the negotiations of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA), \nCongress and the Administration recognized that certain states were \nalready undertaking Medicaid expansions up to or above 200 percent of \nFPL, and that they would be allowed to use the new SCHIP funds. \nUnfortunately, this provision was limited to those states that enacted \nexpansions on or after March 31, 1997 and disallowed Washington from \naccessing the $230 million in SCHIP funds it had been allocated through \n2002. As a result, Washington State cannot use its SCHIP allotment to \ncover the 90,000 children currently eligible, but not covered for \nhealth care at or below 200 percent of poverty. Exacerbating this \ninequity is the fact that many states have begun accessing their SCHIP \nallotments to cover kids at poverty levels far below Washington's \ncurrent or past eligibility levels.\n  The bill I am introducing today, along with Senator Murray, corrects \nthis technicality and is a top priority for the Washington State \ndelegation in the 106th Congress. Congresswoman Dunn has introduced a \ncompanion measure in the House of Representatives that is cosponsored \nby the entire Washington delegation.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral initiative represents a thoughtful, \ncarefully-crafted response to the unintended consequences of SCHIP and \nbrings much needed assistance to children currently at risk. Rather \nthan simply changing the effective date included in the BBA, this \ninitiative includes strong maintenance of effort language as well as \nincentives for our state to find those 90,000 uninsured kids because we \nfeel strongly that they receive the health coverage for which they are \neligible.\n  This bill does not take money from other states nor does it provide \nadditional federal subsidies for children the state is now covering, it \nsimply allows Washington to continue to do the good work they have \nalready started by focusing on new, uninsured children at low income \nlevels first.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Frist):\n  S.J.

Mr. President, I intend to offer an amendment to \nS. 4 when it is debated in the Senate to extend the authority to pay \ncertain bonuses and special pays for three years. These special \nincentives are critical to recruiting and retention of military \npersonnel. This amendment will be a significant improvement to S. 4 \nbecause it is narrowly focused on enlistment and retention incentives.\n  Although these bonuses and special pays are in effect now, the \nauthority to pay them expires on December 31, 1999.\n  These bonuses and special pays are proven recruiting and retention \nincentives. Our Service Personnel Chiefs need to know that they will \ncontinue to be available for the long term to address recruiting and \nretention shortfalls. They should not have to wonder if the authority \nto pay them will be renewed a year at a time.\n  By extending the authority to pay these bonuese and special pays for \nthree years, we give the Services valuable tools the Chiefs need to \naddress a very real and complex problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   ROBB (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 5\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Cleland) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the bill, S. 4, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following new sections:\n\n     SEC. 104.

Mr. President, the men and women of the Armed Forces \nare being asked to do more and more with less and less, to the point \nwhere it is becoming difficult to recruit and retain the best and \nbrightest. Looking at just two salient examples, last year the Navy's \nrecruiting efforts fell short by over 7,000 sailors, and last year Air \nForce first-term aircrew reenlistment was only 61 percent.\n  To help meet these and other personnel challenges, the Armed Services \nCommittee recently approved S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmens' and \nMarines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. S. 4 authorizes significant pay \nraises, improves retirement pay, and enhances GI Bill benefits. This \nlegislation will be brought up soon for consideration by the full \nSenate. It is an important step--one of several--that the Congress must \ntake this year to help the military pull out of what the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs described as a ``nosedive that might cause irreparable \ndamage to this great force.''\n  But I believe S. 4 missed some excellent opportunities to directly \nimprove recruiting and retention--opportunities recognized by the \nAdministration in their FY 2000 defense budget submission. In \nparticular, certain categories of military service present our most \ndifficult retention challenges because they involve recruiting highly \nskilled personnel, providing costly training, and retaining these \nindividuals in the face of uniquely difficult and dangerous missions \ncoupled with powerful financial incentives to leave the military for \nthe civilian sector. Examples include aircrews, Navy SEALs, and Navy \nSurface Warfare Officers.\n  Only 25 percent of Surface Warfare Officers remain on active duty to \ntheir Department Head tour. In the Navy SEAL community, attrition has \nincreased over 15 percent in the past three years. FY 1998 Navy diver \nmanning was below 85 percent. That same year, only about 60 percent of \nmilitary career linguists met or exceeded the minimum requirements in \nlistening or reading proficiency. A host of retention problems exist \nfor Nuclear-Qualified Officers.\n  This amendment which I am filing today along with Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Cleland does several things. It provides bonuses for Surface \nWarfare Officers and Navy SEALs to encourage them to remain in the \nservice. It provides added pay for enlisted aircrews. Several existing \nbonuses are increased, including those for divers, Nuclear Qualified \nOfficers, linguists and other critical specialties. Finally, the \nEnlistment Bonus Ceiling is increased. These are critical remedies for \ncritical specialties. The nation simply can't afford to pay so much to \nrecruit and train these talented individuals only to see them leave the \nservice out of frustration over the inadequacies of their pay and \nbenefits.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to offering this amendment to S. 4 when \nit is taken up by the Senate. I also want to thank Senators Cleland and \nKennedy for their help in developing this provision and for their \nunequivocal commitment to the uniformed personnel who serve our nation \nso ably.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1180-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                      Committee on small business\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, today I rise to express my \nsupport for S. 6, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, a bill to guarantee \nall Americans with private health insurance, and particularly those in \nHMOs or other managed care plans, certain fundamental rights regarding \ntheir health care coverage.\n  Over the past decease, our health care system has changed \ndramatically. Today, approximately 161 million Americans receive \nmedical coverage through some type of managed care organization. \nRegrettably, the change has had some unfortunate consequences. Many in \nmanaged care plans experience increasing restrictions on their choice \nof doctors, growing limitations on their access to necessary treatment, \nand an overriding emphasis on cost cutting at the expense of quality.\n  This shift to managed care, largely a response to rapidly increasing \nmedical costs, has resulted in a health care system overly driven by \nthe need to secure healthy profit margins. The impact these market \nforces have on the health care Americans receive must be moderated. \nAccess to quality health care is an essential human need, and in a \ndemocratic society, it must be recognized as a fundamental right.\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\n  Our bill would guarantee basic patient protections to all consumers \nof private insurance. It would ensure that patients receive the \ntreatment they have been promised and have paid for. This bill would \nprevent HMOs and other health plans from arbitrarily interfering with \ndoctors' decisions regarding the treatment their patients require.\n  Our bill would restore patients' ability to trust that their health \ncare practitioners advice is driven solely by health concerns, not cost \nconcerns. HMOs and other health care plans would be prohibited from \nrestricting which treatment options doctors may discuss with their \npatients. In addition, our bill would outlaw the use of financial \nincentives to reward doctors for cutting costs by recommending against \npotentially necessary treatments.\n  One of the most critical patient protections that would be provided \nunder our bill is guaranteed access to emergency care. The Patients' \nBill of Rights Act would ensure that patients could go to any emergency \nroom during a medical emergency without calling their health plan for \npermission first. Emergency room doctors could stabilize the patient \nand focus on providing them the care they need without worrying about \npayment until after the emergency has subsided.\n  S. 6 would also ensure that health plans provide their customers with \naccess to specialists when needed because of the complexity and \nseriousness of the patient's sickness. This provision is extremely \nimportant to ensure that persons suffering from serious, ongoing \nconditions, like cancer, have access to care by oncologists or other \nspecialists.\n  Many managed care plans provide exemplary coverage for their members, \nincluding innovative preventive care benefits, because they recognize \nthat it is more efficient to keep people healthy than to treat them \nafter they become ill. Unfortunately, not all plans are administered \nwith this philosophy. Many Americans, enrolled in poorly run plans, are \nnot obtaining the care they need and are entitled to receive. The \nimproved health of millions of Americans depends on the enactment of \nthis bill. It will establish Federal requirements ensuring that private \nhealth care plans provide their members with a minimum level of \ncoverage.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nCromwell High School Boys' Varsity Soccer team for winning the 1998 \nConnecticut State Soccer Championship. This achievement reflects the \nproud soccer tradition that has been established at Cromwell High \nSchool and the outstanding caliber of its student athletes.\n  With a first-rate team and a phenomenal level of play, the Cromwell \nPanthers concluded their season with an impressive record of 20-1. The \nPanthers became known throughout Connecticut for their strong defensive \nplay and balanced team of players. In soccer, as in so many sports, a \nblend of smart players and smart decisions results in victories. The \nCromwell Panthers proved they have this combination. The strength of \nthis team was demonstrated by their ability to hold their opponents to \na total of only 6 goals for the entire season.\n  The state championship game was played with emotion against an \nequally talented opponent, the Old Saybrook Rams. Although the Panthers \nwere favored to win, neither the team's coaches nor its athletes took \nvictory for granted. After receiving two yellow cards in the first half \nand being outshot by their opponents for most of the game, the Panthers \nentered the second half with a refocused energy. The Panthers' first \ngoal came late when Justin Linehan received a pass from Steve Dworak \nand sent the ball soaring just out of reach of the Rams' goalie. Steve \nrepeated his superb passing performance when he sent a left cross pass \nto Mike Flanagan who headed the ball past a diving goalie with only two \nminutes left in the game. This final goal was a turning point in the \ngame, bringing it to a 2-0 score in the Panther's favor and helping to \nguarantee their win.\n  This championship game also took on a more personal meaning for its \nplayers and, most especially, its head coach. Sadly, Coach Mike \nPitruzzello's father, Manny, passed away a week before the start of the \nseason. In his honor, Coach Pitruzzello dedicated the Panthers' second \nchampionship win to his late father. Even during a time of personal \nhardship, Coach Pitruzzello continued to guide and nurture his team to \na near-perfect regular season and a championship win. Nothing better \nreflects his love for the sport and his players than the dedication \nCoach Pitruzzello has shown throughout this season. I am sure his \nfather would have not only been proud of his son, but also honored by \nthe sportsmanship exhibited by these talented young men on the field.\n  Winning a state championship is an exciting and gratifying moment for \nany young student athlete. In their win over the Old Saybrook Rams, the \nCromwell Panthers demonstrated a talent they had perfected throughout \ntheir regular season with hard work and the guidance of an experienced \nand caring coaching staff. Furthermore, as with any team sport, it is \nnot just one player who makes the amazing pass or singlehandedly scores \nthe critical goal, but rather a cooperative effort from each player who \noffers his own special talent which ultimately adds to the success of \nthe entire team. The Cromwell High School Boys' Varsity Soccer team \nexemplifies the true spirit of teamwork and tenacity, and it is because \nof those qualities that they are now the state champions.\n  At this time I would like to recognize all the members and coaches of \nthe Boys' Varsity Soccer team and, again, congratulate them all on \ntheir momentous and well-deserved victory:\n  Head Coach Mike Pitruzzello, Assistant Coach Bruce Swanson, Freshman \nCoach John Harder, Paul Dworak, Steve Dworak, Tony Faienza, Mike Fazio, \nMike Flanagan, Bryce Gibson, Eric Harrison, Nick Libera, Steve Libera, \nJustin Linehan, Shawn Maher, Jason Negrini, Mike Simeone, Ryan Steele, \nRon Szymanski, Colin Whalen, and Sean Whalen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1184-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1184-S1185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the great Leo Tolstoy once confided \nin his diary that he would be the unhappiest of men if he could not \nfind a purpose for his life. As we all know, Tolstoy did, indeed, find \npurpose. As a novelist, philosopher, and social reformer, he brought \nentertainment, meaning, and direction into the lives of millions--his \ninfluence continuing even into our day and age.\n  The need to bring meaning and success into our lives--the need to \nhave a purpose, to be anxiously engaged in a good cause--is, as Tolstoy \npointed out,\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\none of the most basic in our nature. With this in mind, it is my \npleasure to join Senators Moynihan, Jeffords, and Kennedy to introduce \nlegislation that while simple in purpose will be infinite in \napplication and influence. Our objective? To help people with \ndisabilities go to work.\n  In 1990, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act. That \nlaw made an important statement about this nation's commitment to \nindependence and opportunity for people with disabilities. Since then, \nbarriers that had made some of even the simplest daily tasks difficult \nor even impossible have been lifted. Millions of Americans have gone \nback to work or found their daily chores to be more accessible--easier \nto address and accomplish.\n  Despite these successes and the progress that has been made in the \nensuing eight years, there are still serious obstacles for too many \npeople with disabilities--obstacles that stand in the way of their \nrealizing the most basic and important opportunity of getting a job.\n  With this legislation, we begin to address some of the remaining \nimpediments to employment for people with disabilities. These include \nthe lack of access to health insurance and fundamental job assistance.\n  At a hearing held by the Finance Committee last July, witness after \nwitness testified about the importance of health insurance for people \nwith disabilities trying to enter the workforce. Jeff Bangsberg of the \nMinnesota Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities put it best when he \nsaid that ``having appropriate, affordable health care is a critical \nfactor in decisions people with disabilities make about working. Many \nindividuals are afraid to work because they can't afford to lose access \nto continued Medicaid coverage.''\n  The simple fact, Mr. President, is that people with disabilities are \noften presented with a Catch-22 between working and losing their \nMedicaid or Medicare. This is a choice they should not have to make. \nBut even modest earnings can result in a loss of eligibility for \nMedicaid or Medicare. Without health insurance, medical treatment often \nbecomes prohibitively expensive for individuals with disabilities, and \nwithout medical treatment it becomes impossible for many to work.\n  My constituents in Delaware have made it clear that lack of access to \nhealth insurance is a real and seemingly insurmountable barrier to \nemployment. Larry Henderson, Chair of Delaware's Developmental \nDisabilities Planning Council, supports our bill ``because it does not \npenalize persons with disabilities for working in that it allows for \ncontinued access to health care.''\n  Our bill is designed to empower States to break this cycle of \nuncertainty by making it possible for people with disabilities who \nchoose to work to do so without jeopardizing health insurance access.\n  We do this by creating two new Medicaid options. The first option \nbuilds on a change enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). \nThat law allows States to permit people with disabilities to buy-in to \nMedicaid who would otherwise be eligible except that they earned too \nmuch. The new change would eliminate the income cap on this buy-in \noption.\n  The second Medicaid change would make it possible for States to \npermit a similar Medicaid buy-in option for individuals with a severe, \nmedically determinable impairment who would otherwise lose eligibility \nbecause of medical improvement.\n  Let me also note that both Medicaid expansions would be voluntary on \nthe part of each State.\n  Under both options, States would be able to set their own cost-\nsharing requirements for people with disabilities who enroll. States \ncould require individuals buying into the program to pay 100 percent of \npremium costs in order to participate. The bill also extends Medicare \nPart A coverage for a ten-year trial period for individuals on SSDI who \nreturn to work.\n  In addition to these health coverage innovations, the bill also \nprovides a user-friendly, public-private approach to job placement. \nBecause of a new, innovative payment system, vocational rehabilitation \nagencies will be rewarded for helping people remain on the job, not \njust getting a job.\n  Mr. President, this combination of health care and job assistance \nwill help disabled Americans succeed in the work place. And our society \nwill be enriched by unleashing the creativity and industry of people \nwith disabilities eager to go to work.\n  I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. And it is my \nintention to hole a hearing on the bill in the Finance Committee next \nweek and mark it up later this spring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1184-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BATTLESHIP ``MISSOURI'' MEMORIAL\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today because this is a \nspecial day in our nation's history. On this day in 1944, Harry S. \nTruman, a proud Missourian and U.S. Senator at the time, authorized the \nchristening of the U.S.S. Missouri. The Missouri is this country's last \nand most celebrated battleship. Senator Truman's 19-year old daughter, \nMargaret, christened this great battleship and sent the ``Mighty Mo'' \nand her crew on missions for our Armed Forces in World War II, the \nKorean War, and Operations Desert Storm--a time of service spanning \nnearly half a century. Today she begins a new era of service as a \nmemorial to educate and remind new generations of Americans about the \ngreat sacrifices and even greater victories that have occurred during \nher military service. She is a symbol of American triumph and spirit as \nshe majestically stands watch over the U.S.S. Arizona memorial in Pearl \nHarbor, Hawaii.\n  Today, in this unstable world, we should re-commit ourselves to \nhonoring lasting symbols of unity and dedication. The 900-foot \nBattleship Missouri is one such symbol. This era of patriotism, \nsacrifice, bravery, and duty will not be forgotten, and in fact must be \nrevered, remembered, and taught to our children and grandchildren.\n  For the United States, World War II began with a surprise attack on \nthe naval base at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. It finally ended on \nthe decks of the ``Mighty Mo'' on September 2, 1945. On that day, \nGeneral Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, and \nChester Nimitz, Fleet Admiral of the U.S. Navy, signed the Instrument \nof Surrender on behalf of the Allied Powers and the United States. It \nis a moment that will now forever be immortalized to America and \ncitizens of the world.\n  Most importantly, we need to remember that the ``Mighty Mo'' would \nnot have played such an important role without the brave and true \nservice of America's servicemen and their families. These men risked \ntheir lives at great personal sacrifice, all in the name of our \ncountry. They are the backbone of the great history of the U.S.S. \nMissouri. Many of these veterans are form the State of Missouri, \nincluding Seaman John C. Truman, the nephew of our 33rd president.\n  Today, January 29, 1999, is yet another significant day in the \nservice of the U.S.S. Missouri--for today she opens permanently to the \npublic as the Battleship Missouri Memorial. I urge all Missourians and \nall Americans to go see this great ship and experience her glorious \nhistory firsthand. I thank the U.S. Navy and the U.S.S. Missouri \nMemorial Association for creating such a special memorial for the world \nto enjoy for generations to come.\n  Congratulations to all involved for getting this memorial up and \nrunning. Congratulations to my friend Senator Daniel Inouye, who has \nbeen personally involved in this project. Finally, congratulations to \nthe U.S. Navy, the people of Hawaii, the people of Missouri, and all \nAmericans who now have the opportunity to visit and experience a \ncrucial part of our great state's heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1185-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1185-S1186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIONAL APPRECIATION DAY FOR CATHOLIC SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, today I want to recognize \nNational Appreciation Day for Catholic Schools, a day to acknowledge \nthe important and valuable contributions Catholic schools make to our \nnation's children, to local communities, and to the nation. Nationally, \nthere are over 7.6 million students in 8,200 Catholic schools. In my \nhome state of Illinois, there are over 215,000 students in 598 Catholic \nschools. In addition, I am a product of Catholic education, having \nattended Catholic schools for both elementary and high school.\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\n  Last year, 40 Catholic secondary schools were awarded the Excellence \nin Education Award, the nation's highest honor in education, by the \nU.S. Department of Education. In my home state, Boyland Catholic High \nSchool in Rockford, Illinois, was awarded the Excellence in Education \nAward for outstanding educational achievement.\n  Two students from St. Patrick School in Ottawa, Illinois, Justyna and \nAlexsandra Ratajczak, wrote me about how much they enjoy going to \nCatholic school. Justyna wrote that St. Patrick School ``is like a \nsecond home for me and I can not imagine my world without it.'' This \ngirl's love of school testifies to the fact that Catholic schools are \ndoing something right. Mr. President, I applaud Catholic schools and \nall their outstanding teachers for their high success rate among \nstudents and thank them for their important contribution to educating \nAmerica's youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1185-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO MR.

Mr. President, today I recognize Hartford, \nConnecticut's selection as a site for a Job Corps Center. The \nDepartment of Labor recently announced that Connecticut's capital city \nwas one of four locations selected nationwide. Many years of planning \nhave gone into Hartford's bid and the new Center enjoys the \nenthusiastic support of leaders in government, business, education and \njob training. The selection is testimony to the commitment of the \nHartford community to our most disadvantaged young people, and that is \nwhy I endorsed the city's strong proposal.\n  In 1995, the Department of Labor had requested proposals for Job \nCorps Center sites and Hartford's joint application with the city of \nBloomfield was regarded highly. Unfortunately, the funding for proposed \nnew Centers was rescinded in the middle of the review process and no \nnew Job Corps Centers were selected. But Hartford, Connecticut \nresidents did not give up and the Department of Labor vowed to honor \nits commitment to new Centers in the future.\n  Hartford, Connecticut is a thriving business and cultural center, \nheadquarters to major insurance and financial centers and home to \nrenown theater and art museums. It is situated on the banks of the \nhistoric Connecticut River which was heralded as an American Heritage \nRiver last year. Hartford is now embarking on a major waterfront \nresidential, recreational and workplace development plan.\n  The city's overall unemployment rate is at 2.9 percent, but the \nunemployment rate for youth ages 16-19 is much higher. Despite \nConnecticut's economic recovery, too many young people are being left \nout of a job market that demands high-level skills. Hartford has many \nof the problems facing other large cities, including abandoned \nindustrial sites, crumbling schools and double-digit highschool dropout \nrates. At one Hartford high school, the dropout rate was more than 50 \npercent last year. That statistic is unacceptable and why I support the \nneed for a Job Corp Center in Hartford. It will make a critical \ndifference in the lives of so many at-risk youth.\n  Job Corps has been providing education and training for disadvantaged \nyouth for more than 34 years. The program is so successful because it \nis a voluntary year-round program offering education, training and \nsupport services, including meals, child care and counseling. It \nmaintains a zero tolerance for drugs and violence.\n  Hartford is poised to undergo an economic revitalization and the Job \nCorps Center is a true investment in our most under-served youth. The \ncity of Hartford and the state of Connecticut have committed $4 million \ntoward the total development cost of $11.5 million and the Hartford \nHousing authority is contributing the site, valued at $420,000. The \nCenter will be located on 12 acres in the Charter Oak Business Park \nbeing developed by the Housing Authority on the site of the former \nCharter Oak Terrace public housing project.\n  When completed in 2000, the Hartford center will serve more than 200 \nnon-residential students each year in basic education and vocational \ntraining programs and provide on-site child care. Many organizations \nhave pledged resources to ensure the success of the Center and most \nimportant of all, employers stand ready to hire young people who \ncomplete the Job Corps program.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the City of Hartford and I commend the \nDepartment of Labor for their selection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1186-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1186-S1187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nlegislation introduced last week by Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Roth, \nand Moynihan. I commend my colleagues for their dedication to improving \nthe way federal programs serve persons with disabilities. Continuing my \nsupport for this effort from last Congress, I am glad to announce that \nI joined my colleagues as an original co-sponsor this year of S. 331, \nThe Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999.\n  This bill addresses one of the great tragedies of our current \ndisability system, a system that forces many people with disabilities \nto choose between working and maintaining access to necessary health \nbenefits. This was never the intention of these programs. It is \ncritical that we act now to overturn today's policies of disincentives \ntowards work and replace them with thoughtful, targeted incentives that \nwill enable many individuals with disabilities to return to work.\n  Over the years I have heard from Iowans who have been forced to leave \nthe work force because of a disability. While they remain disabled and \nstill require ongoing health benefits, they are eager to return to \nwork. However, because of the risk of losing critical health benefits \ncovered by Medicare and Medicaid, too many capable individuals are \ndeterred from entering or re-entering the work force.\n  It is essential that our public disability programs encourage, not \ndiscourage, employment. This legislation tackles the risks and \nuncertainties disabled individuals face when trying to return to work. \nFor individuals eligible for the Supplemental Security Income\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\n(SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs, this \nlegislation provides for continued coverage of critical benefits under \nthe Medicaid program, such as personal assistance and prescription \ndrugs. These services are vital to many people with disabilities. \nFurthermore, this proposal would provide beneficiaries with \nunprecedented access to private rehabilitation services. Currently, the \nSocial Security Administration is unable to refer many beneficiaries \nfor rehabilitation. This legislation would create opportunities for \nbeneficiaries of both the SSI and SSDI programs to access \nrehabilitation services from either the public or private sector, \nincreasing choice, access and quality of these valuable services.\n  The most encouraging component of this legislative proposal is that \nwhich eliminates work disincentives and facilitates self-sufficiency \namong those with disabilities. This legislation prohibits using work \nactivity as the only basis for triggering a continuing disability \nreview. What's more, the proposal would expedite the process of \neligibility determinations for individuals who have been on disability \ninsurance but who lost it because they were working.\n  The risk of losing health care benefits provided through the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs is a major disincentive for millions of \nbeneficiaries who want to be a part of our nation's dynamic workforce. \nThe intent of these programs was never to demoralize or dishearten \nAmericans who are ready, willing and able to work. I look forward to \nthe passage of this legislation which will unlock the doors to \nemployment for these invaluable citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1186-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF THE MISS USA VOLUNTEERS\n\n Mr. BOND.

You have a significant task \n     ahead--the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act. Today I will share what I believe is the \n     proper role for the federal government in education policy.\n       When the original ESEA legislation passed in 1965, it \n     included just over 30 pages. Today it is more than 300 pages \n     long. The federal government has, with the best of \n     intentions, vastly increased its role in the education of our \n     children. What do we have to show for it? Virtually nothing.\n       The results of the Third International Math and Science \n     Study were reported last year. Our high school's graduating \n     seniors did not fare well. 12th grade students from the \n     United States earned scores below the international average \n     in both science and mathematics. In fact, the United States \n     was outscored by 18 other countries in mathematics, coming in \n     just ahead of Cyprus and South Africa. Verbal and combined \n     SAT scores are lower today than they were in 1970.\n       For the last 35 years, Washington D.C.'s response to crises \n     in public education has been to create one program after \n     another--systematically increasing the federal role in \n     classrooms across the country. While the exact number of \n     federal education programs is subject to dispute, a report \n     released last year by the House Education and the Workforce \n     Committee found more than 700 such programs.\n       A review of the ``Digest of Education Statistics'', \n     compiled by the Department of Education, shows that the \n     federal government funds a multitude of federal education \n     programs spread across 39 departments and agencies. Although \n     the Digest shows that funding for these programs totaled \n     $73.1 billion in 1997, it does not provide a list of the \n     programs included. When asked, the Department was unable to \n     provide a list.\n       One year ago, Dr. Carlotta Joyner of the General Accounting \n     Office testified before the Senate Budget Committee Education \n     Task Force. She informed us about 127 At-Risk and Delinquent \n     Youth programs administered by 15 departments and agencies; \n     more than 90 Early Childhood programs administered by 11 \n     departments and agencies; and 86 Teacher Training programs \n     administered by 9 departments and agencies.\n       The failure of these programs has not gone unnoticed. The \n     federal government's largest education program, Title I, was \n     developed as a part of the original ESEA in 1965 to narrow \n     the achievement gap between rich and poor students. Chester \n     Finn, in a recent article for the Weekly Standard, notes that \n     despite pouring $118 billion into Title I over the past three \n     decades, it has been unable to cause any significant \n     improvement in the achievement of these needy children. \n     Furthermore it is difficult to establish, as Dr. Finn also \n     notes in his article, that the Safe and Drug Free Schools \n     program has made schools either safe or drug free; that the \n     Eisenhower professional development program has produced \n     quality math and science teachers; or that Goals 2000 has \n     moved us any closer to the national education goals set a \n     decade earlier.\n       Such clear and compelling statistics demonstrate that, \n     despite our best intentions, the federal government has \n     failed to create a coherent set of programs that address the \n     varied needs of children around the country. I submit to you \n     that we have failed because we do not and can not possibly \n     know and understand all the challenges faced by school \n     children today.\n       Who does know best? It's simple. Our children's parents, \n     teachers, principals, superintendents and school board \n     members know much better than we what our school children \n     need in their own communities. Even within my own State, the \n     needs of children in Woodinville, Wenatchee and Walla Walla \n     differ greatly. Those working closely with our children \n     should be allowed to make more of the vital decisions \n     regarding their education.\n       This is not to say that the federal government should not \n     continue to target resources to needy populations. We can and \n     should hold States and local communities accountable for \n     results. But we must not begin from a point that immediately \n     ties their hands and strangles innovation.\n       It is time for the federal government to try something new. \n     I'm sure many of you have heard the success stories I have \n     about innovative education practices taking place in the \n     Chicago Public Schools. Paul Vallas, the CEO of the Chicago \n     school system, recently addressed an audience here in \n     Washington, D.C. to discuss the reforms he's instituted that \n     have done so much to turn his school system around. When \n     asked by former Secretary of Education William Bennett what \n     the most important power was that he'd been given, Mr. Vallas \n     replied, ``The flexibility to allocate our resources as we \n     see fit.''\n       In 1995, the Illinois legislature gave that flexibility to \n     Mr. Vallas and the Chicago system by combining all state \n     education programs into two grants--one for special education \n     and one for everything else. The legislature allowed Mr. \n     Vallas and the Chicago School Board to decide how to allocate \n     their resources.\n       A request for similar authority has been made recently by \n     the Seattle School district, in this case to the federal \n     government. Seattle has asked the Department of Education to \n     waive several Title I rules and regulations so it can reform \n     its schools' funding system. It wants to provide a system of \n     open enrollment, in which students can enroll in public \n     schools of their choice. Schools in the district would then \n     be ranked by concentration of poverty. Those with more than a \n     50% concentration of poverty would receive Title I funds, and \n     could use those funds on a school-wide basis. Although the \n     funds would be used to address the needs of all children in a \n     school receiving the funds, particular attention would be \n     given to those who require additional support in achieving \n     state learning standards. It is unclear, however, that the \n     U.S. Department of Education will allow the waiver necessary \n     to implement this innovative reform. The point is, Seattle \n     shouldn't have to ask.\n       I have introduced legislation twice in the past two years \n     that would allow such innovative reforms to take place. \n     Although my amendment passed the Senate on each occasion, it \n     was removed in conference committee discussions under the \n     threat of a veto by President Clinton. I want to let this \n     Committee know that I intend to introduce legislation again \n     that will accomplish my goals of giving states and local \n     communities the ability to implement reforms that they \n     believe will benefit their students and provide them with a \n     quality education. It is, I believe, somewhat more flexible \n     than the similar and meritorious bills introduced by Senators \n     Bond and Hutchinson. To ensure that a\n\n[[Page S1188]]\n\n     quality education is available I believe we need to trust the \n     wisdom of those who spend each day with our children--their \n     parents, teachers, principals, superintendents and school \n     board members.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1187-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO TERRIE ARCHAMBAULT, 1998 MERRIMACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE \n                      BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nrecognize and congratulate Terrie Archambault of New Hampshire for \nbeing selected by the Merrimack Chamber of Commerce as the ``1998 \nBusiness Person of the Year.''\n  Terrie began working with Citizens Bank in 1990 as a part-time teller \nand was quickly promoted through the ranks: first to customer service \nrepresentative, then to assistant manager, and in 1996 she became \nmanager of the Merrimack branch of Citizens Bank.\n  Terrie has shown an unwavering dedication to her community. She \noversees a program at her branch called ``Bank at School.'' This \nprogram allows elementary school students to open new accounts, make \ndeposits and, most importantly, learn the basics of personal banking. \nShe organizes the collection of food and monetary donations for the \nNashua Soup Kitchen and Shelter, and frequently helps serve food at the \nkitchen. In addition, through Operation Santa Claus at the Merrimack \nLioness Club, Terrie helps provide Christmas gifts to families in need \nin her community.\n  Furthermore, Terrie's involvement with the Merrimack Chamber of \nCommerce has strengthened the Chamber's ties with the community. \nCurrently serving as Secretary on the Executive Board, Terrie has \nsecured sponsorships for several of the Chamber's events. Along with \nher husband Dan of 28 years, as well as her two childen and four \ngrandchilden, Terrie is a positive influence on her community.\n  As a former small businessman myself, I understand the hard work and \ndedication required for success in business. Mr. President, I wish to \ncongratulate Terrie Archambault for all of her accomplishments, and \nespecially for being named the ``1998 Business Person of the Year.'' It \nis an honor to represent her in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/03/senate-section/article/S1188-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MILDRED JAMISON\n\n Mr. BOND.

The Faith House is a Child Caring/Placement \nAgency that is committed to helping children with special needs. \nChildren that have been served by the Faith House include those that \nhave been drug exposed, have HIV/AIDS, have been emotionally or \nsexually abused, are medically fragile (including transplant recipients \nand burn victims), physically and mentally challenged children, and \nthose that are developmentally delayed. In the six years that The Faith \nHouse has contributed to the community, over 500 young lives have been \nchanged by Ms. Jamison's vision.\n  I commend Ms. Jamison for her hard work and tireless dedication. I \nencourage communities across the nation to look to The Faith House as a \nmodel and inspiration for similar programs.
