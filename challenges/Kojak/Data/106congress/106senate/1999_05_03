Mr. President. I rise today to oppose the McCain \nResolution.\n  First, I congratulate Reverend Jesse Jackson, Congressman Rod \nBlagojevich, Joan Brown Campbell and religious leaders for the release \nof our three servicemen. I am particularly proud that Joan Campbell, \nthe Secretary General of the National Council of Churches and the \nmother of County Commissioner Jane Campbell, and Father Irinej \nDobrijevic, a Serbian-American Priest from St. Sava Orthodox Cathedral \nin Cleveland, were major participants in the release.\n  I pray that the letter from Jesse Jackson to President Clinton and \nother diplomatic moves this weekend with President Yeltsin of Russia \nwill bring all parties to the table so we can end the bombing, death \nand destruction that is going on in Serbia and Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, I am astonished at the negative reaction. In fact, \nElizabeth Sullivan in today's Cleveland Plain Dealer pointed out that \n``the alliance sneers at Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's latest \noffer, to accept a lightly armed U.N. peace force, refusing to treat it \nas the basis for further talks.''\n  In my opinion, our State Department, President and NATO are allowing \ntheir egos to get in the way of their common sense and good judgment.\n  It was this hubris--which is defined as ``excessive pride or self-\nconfidence; arrogance''--and their miscalculation of the importance of \nKosovo to the Serbian people and Milosevic that got us into this mess.\n  It appears that they are ``hell bent'' to get us into a major war \nthat will have catastrophic impact on our domestic and international \nresponsibilities for years to come and may well ignite destabilization \nof southeast Europe, a new cold war with Russia and the creation of new \nalliances by this country's adversaries who we have been working to \nbring into the international community.\n  I believe it is time to stop the bombing, reduce hostilities on both \nsides and resume negotiations to bring about peace and restore \nstability to the region.\n  I agree with the sentiments expressed yesterday by Majority Leader \nTrent Lott who said ``let's see if we can't find a way to get the \nbombing stopped, get Milosevic to pull back his troops, find a way to \nget the Kosovars to go back in a secure way. Short of that, I see a \nquagmire that is going to go on. It's going to get bloodier.''\n  So, before we vote on this resolution and continue down the path to a \nfurther escalation and a greater involvement, there are three things \nthat we\n\n[[Page S4512]]\n\nhave to ask ourselves: (1) What is the price? (2) What is the risk? (3) \nWhat is the prize?\n  The main price that will be paid will be done so in human lives. \nThere will be casualties--American and NATO troops, Kosovar civilians \nand refugees, Serb civilians as well as civilians in neighboring \ncountries where we've already mistakenly dropped bombs.\n  We have to remember the experience of World War II, where 700,000 \nGerman troops were held-off by 150,000 Serb guerrillas. Are we willing \nto make such a commitment?\n  We also have to consider the financial impact of this war so far. \nThus far, it is being paid for by Social Security. If the war escalates \nto include ground forces and if we're totally honest with the American \npeople, we have to tell them that one of three things will happen to \npay for this war--\n  (1) we'll continue to use Social Security to pay for it and the \ndeficit will go up; (2) we'll reduce spending for domestic programs; or\n  (3) we'll increase taxes.\n  In addition, each passing day further diminishes the readiness of our \narmed forces. We already have a terrible readiness problem--this \ncampaign is only making it worse.\n  Indeed, comments made by General Richard Hawley, head of the U.S. Air \nCombat Command indicate that we could run out of the state-of-the-art \nsatellite-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) for our B-2 \nStealth bombers sometime this month.\n  He is quoted as saying ``it's going to be really touch-and-go as to \nwhether we'll go Winchester on JDAM's.'' That's pilot jargon for \n``running out of bullets.'' He also indicated that because more crews \nare being called up for this campaign, fewer crews are available should \nanother crisis appear elsewhere in the world (North Korea, Iraq, etc.)\n  Our main military goal should be to ensure our readiness to the \nextent that our adversaries know we are prepared.\n  There are projections indicate that it will take at least $30 billion \nto address readiness effectively.\n  The longer we continue our current efforts, the greater the \nopportunity that one or more of our NATO allies may decide enough is \nenough. This could leave the U.S. holding the bag! We could also stir \nregional resentment among Serbia's neighbors, leading to further \npolitical instability and the possibility of a wider war. There are \nalready groups promoting a greater Albania that would include parts of \nMontenegro, Macedonia, and Greece.\n\n  This war could also undermine U.S. and NATO credibility and erode our \nability to deter aggression globally.\n  If we suffer significant casualties, equipment failures, morale loss, \netc. potential adversaries in North Korea, China, Iran and Iraq will \ntake note and could react;\n  Our experience in the Persian Gulf bolstered our credibility but this \nsituation is very different--different terrain, there was an \ninternational consensus that Iraqi aggression against a sovereign \nnation must be reversed, threat of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\n                         And finally--the Prize\n\n  When we win--and I am confident we would win--what do we get?\n  First there is the need to put in a long-term occupation force to \noversee the peace. I am concerned that such a force could be subject to \ncontinual guerrilla attacks which would incur casualties.\n  Then we would have to rebuild the infrastructure and economy of \nKosovo and Serbia and that could cost as much as $100 billion.\n  We would also have to build a new, Western-oriented and democratic \nstate with whatever existing civic institutions there are available. \nThis could lead to a period of ``growing pains'' where there is \nconsiderable political uncertainty for a number of years.\n  Mr. President, as our colleague from Kansas, Senator Roberts, has \npointed out, there would be a precedent for U.S. to intervene \nmilitarily when there are widespread humanitarian abuses.\n  We have a lot of questions to answer before we find ourselves in a \nwar from which we cannot extricate ourselves.\n  Fundamentally, what Senator McCain's resolution does is give our \nPresident carte blanche, and when you look at the price and the risk \nand the prize, you can understand why I am opposed to this resolution.\n  We should not give the President blanket authority to get us into \nanother Viet Nam that could very well have much greater negative impact \nnationally and internationally than Viet Nam.\n  Two weekends ago I visited Arlington Cemetery, the Vietnam and Korean \nmemorials and I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that \nwe do not have a Kosovo Memorial here in Washington.\n  If the Senate passes anything, it ought to be what the House did this \nlast weekend when they had the courage to stand up and be counted.\n  Congress must exert its Constitutional authority in foreign policy \nmatters and demand that the President seek a declaration of war or \nformal authorization before he deploys ground troops.\n  Again, should the Senate decide to offer alternative legislation to \nthe McCain measure, it should include such considerations.\n  The way we have conducted ourselves with NATO in regard to Kosovo has \ncreated an environment that has allowed Slobodan Milosevic and the \nSerbs to do exactly what those responsible for bombing did not want to \nhappen regarding human rights and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.\n  It has resulted in the destruction of the infrastructure in Kosovo to \nthe extent that thousands of Kosavars will never return to their \ndestroyed homeland.\n  The decision also has resulted in death and destruction in Serbia \nthat is also unconscionable when one realizes that the alleged purpose \nis to force Slobodan Milosevic to sign an agreement which is tantamount \nto the Serbs and giving up their sovereignty.\n  Think about it, Mr. President. If we had not engaged in ``sign-or-\nbomb'' diplomacy, we could still be at the negotiating table with 1,600 \nobservers in Kosovo.\n  The time has come, Mr. President, where NATO needs to get off its \nhigh horse, restrain its ego and instead of trying to save face over a \nmajor foreign policy blunder and start thinking about saving lives.\n  It's time to stop the bombing and put everyone's efforts into finding \na diplomatic solution that will quickly result in the removal of \nSerbian troops from Kosovo, end the ethnic cleansing, return the \nKosavars to Kosovo and commit to rebuilding both physical and political \ninfrastructure of Kosovo.\n  We need to fully protect all minority rights including the Serbs and \nother minorities who live in Kosovo and full participation of all in \nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia including the Serbian Parliament.\n  Last but not least an international force to guarantee in the \nbeginning that the agreement provisions are fully implemented and \nabided by all parties.\n  Mr. President, let's get to the peace table. Let's all of us get down \non our knees and pray that the Holy Spirit will inspire us to remember \nJesus' exultation to us--``Bless are the peacemakers for they shall be \ncalled the children of God.''\n  This nightmare has to end now.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments \nregarding the tragic shootings in Littleton, CO.\n  Thirteen days after this tragedy occurred, our Nation is still really \nin shock. The hearts of my own family and all Ohio families, and, of \ncourse, all Americans families, go out to the families who have lost \nloved ones. There is nothing that you can say that\n\n[[Page S4513]]\n\ncan take the pain away. Anyone who has lost a child understands that. \nThe loss these families have suffered cannot be repaired. But it is \nimportant that these families know that there are people--many of us \nfar away from Colorado--whose thoughts and prayers are with them at \nthis terrible time.\n  What went wrong? Could the shootings have been prevented? What should \nwe do to prevent other tragedies such as this from occurring in the \nfuture?\n  These are all very difficult questions--difficult issues for a public \nofficial to talk about, because when you do, people will think that you \nare claiming to have ``the answer.'' Let me say flat out that I don't \nclaim to have ``the answer.''\n  What happened in Littleton will always to some extent remain a \nmystery, and why it happened. Evil is a mystery that exists deep in the \nhuman heart. But that brutal fact of human existence that we can't come \nup with ``the answer'' does not excuse us from our moral \nresponsibilities--our responsibilities, as legislators, as parents, as \ncitizens. In fact, it increases our responsibilities. If we don't have \n``the answer,'' we have to work harder to find answers--things we can \ndo to make a difference child by child by child. Some of the things we \nhave to do may not be glamorous, but they will all be helpful. They \nwill save lives.\n  Fred Hiatt pointed out in a powerful Washington Post article recently \nthat 13 children a day--13 children a day--are killed by guns in this \ncountry--in effect, the Littleton massacre every day. Statistically, of \nthese 13 children who die every day, 8 are murdered every day; 4 \ntragically commit suicide every day, and 1 dies accidentally every day.\n  Mr. President, maybe we can't prevent a massacre such as the one in \nColorado, but we can work on initiatives that would save some of the 13 \nchildren a day who are dying in gun-related deaths.\n  What I would like to do this afternoon is talk briefly about a few of \nthose initiatives that I believe would save lives. We don't know whose \nlives they would save, but I have had, I think, enough experience in \nthis area to say that they would save some lives, and, therefore, we \nshould do this.\n  No. 1, I have a bill, which is now included in the juvenile justice \nbill, that we will be considering in just a few days.\n  This provision provides incentives to local governments to coordinate \nthe services they offer to the kids who are the most at risk in their \ncounty, or their area. I am referring, for example, to the children who \nhave been duly diagnosed as having both maybe a psychiatric disorder \nand a substance abuse problem, or some other combination of problems. \nFor too long, kids have been falling between the cracks of the court \nsystem, the children's services system, the mental health system, and \nthe substance abuse system. Other kids are misdiagnosed or don't get \naccess to all the services that they need. My proposal would promote an \napproach that has been successful in Hamilton County, OH--in the \nCincinnati area--an approach that gives our most problematic kids the \nmultiple services they need, under the overall coordination of the \njuvenile court system. These kids should not fall victim of \nbureaucratic turf conflicts. All of them are our kids.\n\n  No. 2, parents, teachers and local service agencies need to explore \nways to reach out and provide appropriate services to at-risk youth \nbefore they end up--before they end up--in the juvenile court system. \nThat is the essence of prevention--to find ways to keep children from \never coming in contact with a juvenile court. That is why a renewed \ninvestment in mental health diagnosis and treatment is so vitally \nimportant with our children.\n  We have to as a country, as a people, make a more serious investment \nin diagnosing and treating these kids with psychological problems. \nThroughout the whole system, everybody--teachers, probation officers, \neveryone--will tell you that we do not now have enough resources.\n  I have talked to so many juvenile court judges who look at these kids \nthey have in front of them, and who know they have mental health \nproblems, and yet who do not have the resources, and try to reach these \nkids and turn them around, to cure them before it becomes too late. We \nneed to get these kids early.\n  A third suggestion of things that are, I think, practical and that we \ncould very easily do is keep closer track of kids who have been \nconvicted of violent crimes. The tracking provisions I, along with \nSenator Sessions, have written into the juvenile crime bill we will be \nconsidering in just a matter of a few days will help do that.\n  When a young person commits a crime, and then, let us say, moves to \nanother State and commits another crime, local law enforcement \nofficials and judges many times do not have the available information. \nThey do not know this person has committed a violent crime, and the \nreason they don't is because we don't have a good nationwide tracking \nsystem for juveniles, and we should. We should do it with juveniles who \nhave already demonstrated that they will commit and can commit and may \nin the future commit a violent crime.\n  When it comes to making key decisions about juvenile offenders, \njudges and probation officers need to make judgments based on the best \npossible information. That is what my provision would give them.\n  No. 4, we need to get serious about background checks on gun \npurchases. Everybody talks about the Brady bill. But very few people \nrealize that the Brady background checks are only as effective as the \ninformation that goes into them. That is why I have been fighting for \nalmost 15 years for improved law enforcement information systems. That \nmeans good criminal records, knowing who has done what.\n  Last year, I wrote a bill on crime technology. Senators Gregg and \nHollings were very helpful in the appropriations process in getting the \nmoney for that.\n  The fact is that 60 percent of the States have criminal records that \nare less than 80 percent complete. In other words, our criminal record \nsystem isn't as good as it should be. The Brady bill will only work as \nwell as the underlying criminal justice system it is based on. We need \nto fix it and do a better job.\n  No. 5, we need to get serious about confronting our cultural \nproblems. I thank our colleagues, Senators McCain and Lieberman. I \nthink they were right when they encouraged the President to call a \nsummit meeting of the leaders in the media community--TV, radio, \nmovies, video games and the recording industry--to talk about the \nresponsibility in shaping the messages that we are sending kids.\n  We can't force them not to air trash that is harmful to people. The \nfirst amendment doesn't allow that. I hope the President's summit is a \nsuccess. The fact is, the President does have, as Theodore Roosevelt \nsaid, a bully pulpit, and he needs to use it on this issue. We need to \nbe upfront about the costs of excessive violence in the media--the \nprice paid not just in lives lost in tragic events such as the shooting \nin Littleton, but also in the day-to-day harm that occurs in the \nemotional lives of children.\n  Many have blamed the toxic culture for the shootings in Littleton. I \npersonally have no doubt that if the culture were not as coarsened as \nit is today, those kids very well may not have committed this crime. We \nwill never be able to prove it or know for sure. It is too simplistic \nto say the culture caused the shootings; but to deny a connection would \nalso be simplistic, and, I believe, naive. The culture that thrives on \ncruelty and hatred did not create these killers, but it offered them an \noutlet, a particular way of self-expression, that ended up devastating \na whole community.\n\n  We need to work on creating and promoting the alternative to a \nculture based on death and violence, a culture based, rather, on the \nvalue of life, on the principle that every human life is unique, \npriceless, and worth defending.\n  We can't ban movie and video games we don't like. But there are \nthings that we can do. I think there are positive steps the media could \ntake to improve our culture and protect children to some extent.\n  The most important measure of all is parental involvement. Parents \nare the most important teachers for their kids. They should be their \nmost important influence.\n  We need to reach out to our children. We need to listen to them. We \nneed to pay attention. It is not a cliche to say\n\n[[Page S4514]]\n\nthat tragic events are a cry for help. It is the simple truth.\n  In conclusion, there is no bill we can pass to make any of this \nhappen. For this we have to look inside ourselves. In the meantime, \nthose who are in public life need to do everything they can to make \nthis task just a little bit easier. I mentioned five ideas that I have. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and \nconcerned people at the local community level in Ohio and across our \nNation to make sure we are doing all that we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/03/senate-section/article/S4514-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4514-S4547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEPLOYMENT OF U.S. ARMED FORCES TO THE KOSOVO REGION IN YUGOSLAVIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 20, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.J. Res. 20) concerning the deployment of \n     United States Armed Forces to the Kosovo region in \n     Yugoslavia.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent the time today for consideration of S.J. Res. 20 be for debate \nonly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know Senator Byrd wants to speak. I wonder whether I \ncould ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from West Virginia speak, I be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Today, Mr. President, the Senate should begin a \nconstructive, long overdue, and thorough debate on America's war with \nSerbia. But we will not. We will not because the Senate leadership, \nboth Republican and Democrat, with the passive cooperation of the \nPresident of the United States, has determined that we will limit \ndebate on war and peace to a few hours this afternoon. Apparently, the \nhard facts of war need not inconvenience the Senate at this time, and \nthe solemn duties that war imposes on those of us privileged to lead \nthis nation can be avoided indefinitely.\n  I heard my friend, the Democratic Leader, say the other day that now \nis not the time for this debate. When is the right time, Mr. President? \nAfter the war ends? Shall we wait to declare ourselves until the \noutcome is known? Shall those who oppose NATO's attack on Serbia wait \nuntil NATO's defeat is certain before voting their conscience? Shall \nthose of us who believe American interests and values are now so at \nrisk in the Balkans that they must be protected by all necessary force \nwait until victory is certain before voting our conscience?\n  I would hope not, Mr. President. For that would mean that we have \nallowed American pilots and, possibly, American soldiers to risk their \nlives for a cause that we will not risk our careers for. I think we are \nbetter people than that. I think we are a better institution than that. \nAnd I think we should use this debate to prove it.\n  All Senators should, for a start, use the opportunity provided by \ndebate on this resolution to declare unequivocally their support or \nopposition for the war. Having declared their support or opposition, \nSenators should then endorse that course of action allowed Congress \nthat logically and ethically corresponds to their views on the war. If \nSenators believe this war is worth fighting, then recognize that the \nPresident should exercise the authority vested in his office to use the \npower of the United States effectively to achieve victory as quickly as \npossible.\n  If Senators believe that this war is not worth the cost in blood and \ntreasure necessary to win it, then take the only course open to you to \nprevent further bloodshed. Vote to refuse the funds necessary to \nprosecute it. Senators cannot say that they oppose the war, but support \nour pilots, and then allow our pilots to continue fighting a war that \nthey believe cannot justify their loss. If the war is not worth \nfighting for, then it is not worth letting Americans die for it.\n  Last week, a majority in the other body sent just such a message to \nour servicemen and women, to the American public and to the world. They \nvoted against the war and against withdrawing our forces. Such a \ncontradictory position does little credit to Congress. Can we in the \nSenate not see our duty a little clearer? Can we not match our deeds to \nour words?\n  Should we meet our responsibilities honorably, we will not only have \nacted more forthrightly than the other body, we will have acted more \nforthrightly than has the President. The supporters of this resolution \nfind ourselves defending the authority of the Presidency without the \nsupport of the President, a curious, but sadly, not unexpected \nposition.\n  Opponents have observed that the resolution gives the President \nauthority he has not asked for. They are correct. The President has not \nasked for this resolution. Indeed, it is quite evident that he shares \nthe leadership's preference that the Senate not address this matter. \nBut, in truth, he need not ask for this authority. He possesses it \nalready, whether he wants it or not.\n  I cannot join my Republican friends in the other body by supporting \nthe unconstitutional presumptions of the War Powers Act. Every Congress \nand every President since the act's inception has ignored it with good \nreason until now. We should have repealed the Act long ago, but that \nwould have required us to surrender a little of the ambiguity that we \nfind so useful in this city. Only Congress can declare war. But \nCongress cannot deny the President the ability to use force unless we \nrefuse him the funds to do so. By taking neither aciton, Congress \nleaves the President free to prosecute this war to whatever extent he \ndeems necessary.\n  Although I can speak only for myself, I believe the sponsors of this \nresolution offered it to encourage the President to do what almost \nevery experienced statesmen has said he should do--prepare for the use \nof ground troops in Kosovo if they are necessary to achieve victory. \nRegrettably, the President owuld rather not be encouraged. But his \nirresponsibility does not excuse Congress'. I beleive it is now \nimperative that we pass this resolution to distinguish the powers of \nthe Presidency from the muddled claim made upon them by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  During the Foreign Relations Committee's consideration of this \nresolution, my friend, the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, \ncriticized the wording as too broad a grant of authority to the \nPresident, and an infringement of congressional authority. How, Mr. \nPresident, can Congress claim authority that it neither possesses \nconstitutionally nor, as we see, cares to exercise even if we did \npossess it? No, Mr. President, the authority belongs to the President \nunless we deny it to him by means expressly identified in the \nConstitution. In short, and I welcome arguments to the contrary, only \nCongress can declare war but the President can wage one unless we \ndeprive him of the means to do so.\n\n  Therefore, I feel it is urgent that the Senate contradict the actions \nof the other body and clarify to the public, and to America's allies \nand our enemies that the President may, indeed, wage this war. And, \nwith our encouragement, he might wage this war more effectively than he \nhas done thus far. If he does not, the shame is on him and not on us.\n  I regret to say that I have on more than one occasion suspected, as I \nsuspect today, that the President and some of us among the loyal \nopposition suffer from the same failing. It seems to me that the \nPresident, in his poll driven approach to his every responsibility, \nfails to distinguish the office he holds from himself. And some of us \nin Congress are so distrustful of the President that we feel obliged to \ndamage the office in order to restrain the current occupant. Both sides \nhave lost the ability to tell the office from the man.\n  Publicly and repeatedly ruling out ground troops may be smart \npolitics according to the President's pollster, but it is inexcusably \nirresponsible leadership. In this determination to put politics over \nnational security, the President even acquiesced to the other body's \nattempt to deprive him of his office's authority. He sent a letter \npromising that he would seek Congress' permission to introduce ground \ntroops in the unlikely event he ever discovers the will to use them.\n  My Republican colleagues in the House, who sought to uphold a law \nthat\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\nI doubt any of them believed in before last week, should take greater \ncare with an office that will prove vital to our security in the years \nahead. President Clinton will not stand for re-election again. Twenty \nmonths from now we will have a new President. And whoever he or she is \nwill need all the powers of the office to begin to repair the terrible \ndamage that this President has done to the national security interests \nof the United States.\n  It is to avoid further damage to those interests and to the office of \nthe President that I ask my colleagues to consider voting for this \nresolution. The irony that this resolution is being considered only \nbecause of a statute I oppose is not lost on me. But bad laws often \nproduce unexpected irony along with their other, more damaging effects. \nSo we have made what good use of it we can.\n  We are here beginning a debate that many did not want, and few will \nmind seeing disposed of quickly. In my opening comments, I know I have \nspoken provocatively. Although I believe my points are correct, I could \nhave been a little more restrained in offering them. I was not because \nI hope it will encourage, perhaps incite is a better word, greater \ndebate today than is contemplated by our leaders. I meant to offend no \none, but if any took offense, I hope they will come to the floor to \nmake their case. Let us have the kind of debate today that the matter \nwe are considering surely deserves.\n  Mr. President, we are debating war. Not Bill Clinton's war. Not \nMadeleine Albright's war. America's war. It became America's war the \nmoment the first American flew into harm's way to fight it. Nothing \nanyone can do will change that. If we lose this war, the entire \ncountry, and the world will suffer the consequences. Yes, the President \nwould leave office with yet another mark against him. But he will not \nsuffer this indignity alone. We will all be less secure. We will all be \ndishonored.\n  This is America's war, and we are America's elected leaders. As we \nspeak, tens of thousands of Americans are ready to die if they must to \nwin it. They risk their lives for us, and for the values that define \nour good Nation. Can we not risk our political fortunes for them? Don't \nthey deserve more than a few hours of perfunctory and sparsely attended \ndebate? They do, Mr. President, they deserve much better than that.\n  We might lose those vote and we might lose it badly. That would be a \ntragedy. But I would rather fight and lose, than not fight at all. I \nhope that an extended debate might persuade more Members to support the \nresolution. The resolution does not instruct the President to begin a \nground war in Yugoslavia. Nor does it grant the President authority he \ndoes not already possess. Nor does it require the President to pursue \nadditional objectives in the Balkans. But if Members would be more \ncomfortable if those objectives and realities were expressed in the \nresolution than I am sure the sponsors would welcome amendments to that \neffect.\n  But even if a majority of Members can never be persuaded to support \nthis resolution, let us all agree that a debate--an honest, extensive, \nresponsible debate--is appropriate in these circumstances. Surely, our \nconsciences are agreed on that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how is the time controlled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided between the \nproponents and the opponents.\n  Mr. BYRD. Who has control of the time in opposition to the \nresolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No individual Senator has control.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is no division of time here. This is \na unanimous consent agreement, that time today for consideration of \nS.J. Res. 20 be for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am advised that the time control is written \nin the War Powers Act.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you. I stand corrected. I appreciate the \noutstanding work of the Parliamentarian.\n  On behalf of the other side, I ask unanimous consent to allow Senator \nByrd to speak for as long as he may deem necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona. I thank him for his courtesy. I thank him for his leadership \non this resolution and for his leadership on many of the great issues \nthat we have debated in this Senate from time to time. There are \noccasions when I vote with Mr. McCain. There are occasions when I feel \nthat we do not see eye to eye. That is not to say that I do not have \nthe greatest respect for his position, for his viewpoint. I do have.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator McCain, and I commend the other \nSenators, Senator Biden and the others, who have cosponsored this \nresolution, for having the courage of their convictions and for \nstanding up for that in which they believe. I am sorry that I cannot \nagree on this occasion, but there may be a time down the road when we \nwill be working together and I can agree and they can agree with me.\n  I shall not use more than 5 minutes, Mr. President.\n  The course of action that they are advocating--giving the President \nblanket authority to use whatever force he deems necessary to resolve \nthe Kosovo conflict--is a bold and possibly risky stroke. But whatever \nthe outcome, they are forcing the Senate to confront the Kosovo crisis \nhead-on, and that in itself is noteworthy.\n  Unfortunately, this resolution troubles me for a number of reasons. \nFirst, in my judgment, it is premature. In response to a request from \nthe President, the Senate authorized air strikes against Yugoslavia in \nMarch. To date, the President has not requested any expansion of that \nauthority. In fact, he has specifically stated on numerous occasions \nthat the use of ground troops is not being contemplated.\n  I think that has been a mistake from the very beginning, virtually \nsaying to the Yugoslavian leader that we have no intention whatsoever \nof confronting you with ground troops. That loosens whatever bonds or \nchains Mr. Milosevic may otherwise feel constrain him. But the \nPresident has not announced that.\n  Now it is deep into our spring, and by the time we put ground troops \non the ground, I assume it will be nearing winter in the Balkans. I \nthink that the President has made a mistake from the very beginning in \nsaying we have no intent. I would prefer to let Mr. Milosevic guess as \nto our intent than tell him we have no intent of doing thus and so.\n  If the intent of this resolution is to send a message to Slobodan \nMilosevic that the United States is serious about its commitment to the \nNATO operation in Kosovo, there are better ways to accomplish that \nobjective. Swift action on the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill to pay for the Kosovo operation would be a good first step.\n  Second, this resolution has the practical effect of releasing the \nPresident from any obligation to consult with Congress over future \naction in Kosovo. With this language, the Senate is effectively bowing \nout of the Kosovo debate and ceding all authority to the executive \nbranch.\n  My friends may say that the Senate is not entertaining any debate \nanyhow, but at least it might do so. I do not think this is in the best \ninterest of the Nation. The President needs to consult Congress, but \nnobody can seem to agree on just exactly what ``consultation'' means.\n  The President has had a few of us down to the White House upon \nseveral occasions. I have gone upon three occasions, and I have \ndeclined to go upon one, I believe, but those consultations, while they \nare probably beneficial and should be had, are really not enough. But \nthe President does need to consult with Congress, and if he determines \nground troops are needed in Kosovo, he needs to make that case to the \nAmerican people.\n  He has to make the case. Nobody can make that case for him. The \nSecretary of State, Madeleine Albright, cannot make the case. The Vice \nPresident cannot make the case. Who is going to listen to Sandy Berger? \nI am not going to listen very much. So who can make the case? Nobody \nbut the President can really make the case. We in the Senate will do \nthe President no favor by giving him the means to short circuit the \nprocess.\n  Third, this resolution goes beyond policy and infringes on the power \nof\n\n[[Page S4516]]\n\nCongress to control the purse. If the Senate gives the President \nblanket authorization to ``use all necessary force and other means'' to \naccomplish the goals and objectives set by NATO for the Kosovo \noperation, the Senate has no choice but to back that up with a blank \ncheck to pay for it.\n  I think I have to agree with the distinguished Senator from Arizona \nin most of what he said. Practically speaking, he is exactly right. He \nis precisely correct when he says that the only real check that the \nCongress has upon the President is the power over the purse. Money \ntalks. That is the raw power. Congress alone has that power.\n  If we were to adopt this resolution, we would be essentially \ncommitting the United States to pay an undetermined amount of money for \nan unknown period of time to finance an uncertain and open-ended \nmilitary offensive. Mr. President, that, by any standard, is not sound \npolicy.\n  I believe there are better ways for the Senate to address the \nconflict in Kosovo, ways in which we can encourage the administration \nto work with Congress and to listen to the views of the American people \nas expressed through their representatives in Congress. I have \nrepeatedly urged the President to provide Congress--and the American \npeople--with more details on the Kosovo strategy, including the \nprojected level of U.S. involvement in terms of personnel and \nequipment, the estimated cost and source of funding, the expected \nduration and exit strategy, and the anticipated impact on military \nreadiness and morale.\n  Of course, we heard the promises made in connection with Bosnia: We \nwere only going to be there a year. Repeatedly, we put that question to \nthe administration people and they assured us, ``It will only take \nabout a year.''\n  We have heard those promises before. We do not pay much attention to \nthem anymore. Those assurances do not mean anything.\n  The President has certainly made a good faith effort to date to \nconsult on this matter, with Members of Congress, but we are only in \nthe opening stages of this operation, and the path ahead is very \nunclear. The President would be well served to continue consulting \nclosely with Congress and to seek Congressional support for any \ndecision that he contemplates involving ground forces. For its part, \nthe Senate should not take any action that would jeopardize this \ndialog, as I believe this resolution would do.\n  Mr. President, again I commend Senator McCain and Senator Biden, and \nthe other Senators who are cosponsors, for seeking a straightforward \ndetermination of the role that Congress will play in the Kosovo \nconflict.\n  There is no question where the Senator from Arizona stands. He steps \nup to the plate, takes hold of the bat, says, here is how I stand, this \nis what I believe in. He is willing to have the Senate vote. I admire \nhim for that. I admire his patriotism. I admire his determination to \nhave the Senate speak. But I do not believe that this resolution is the \nappropriate action to take at this time. I urge my colleagues to table \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is to be recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask, for planning purposes, how long the Senator \nfrom Minnesota plans to speak?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will try to keep this under 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to Senator McCain, I believe \nsilence equals betrayal, and I think we should be debating this \nquestion. Besides having a great deal of respect for him, I appreciate \nhis efforts. We may be in disagreement, but I thank the Senator from \nArizona for his important efforts.\n  It was with this deep belief in my soul that I voted 6 weeks ago to \nauthorize the participation of the United States in the NATO bombing of \nYugoslavia. I did so with a heavy heart and not without foreboding, \nbecause I knew once unleashed, a bombing campaign led by the world's \ngreatest superpower to put a stop to violence would likely lead to more \nviolence. Violence begets violence, and yet there are those extremely \nrare occasions when our moral judgment dictates that it is the only \nremaining course available to us.\n  I did so because it was my judgment that we had exhausted every \ndiplomatic possibility and that our best and most credible information \nwas that without military action by the United States, a humanitarian \ndisaster was about to occur.\n  Just as the Senate was about to conduct a rollcall vote on the \nsubject, I sought to make sure that the Record reflected the rightness \nof our course of action.\n  I was assured that our purpose was to prevent the imminent slaughter \nof thousands, if not tens of thousands, of innocent civilians living in \nthe Yugoslav province of Kosovo by Serb security forces.\n  I had no doubt about the wisdom and correctness of our decision, and \ntoday I harbor no second thoughts about the morality of the initial \ncourse. Others may question the reasoning of some who embarked upon the \nbombing campaign. History will judge whether there were other \nrationales involved: the significance of prior threats we had made and \nhow our credibility was on the line; the geopolitical factors that \nrequired that we act; the continued viability of NATO as a force to be \nreckoned with throughout the world.\n  Whatever the importance these factors may have played in the \ndecisions of others to authorize the bombing, my own was a simple one: \nInaction in the face of unspeakable, imminent, and preventable violence \nis absolutely unacceptable. In short, the slaughter must be stopped.\n  I have no regrets about that decision. The violence perpetrated \nagainst the innocents of Kosovo has been, indeed, unspeakable. My only \nregret is that our actions have been less effective than I had hoped: \nover a million humans, mostly women and children, uprooted from their \nhomes; hundreds of thousands expelled from their country, and their \nhomes and villages burned; women raped, thousands of the residents \nkilled, and children separated from their families.\n  The catalog of these atrocities expands every single day.\n  Just last week, the Serb paramilitaries in southern Kosovo reportedly \nforced between 100 and 200 young men from a convoy of refugees heading \nfor the border, took them into a nearby field, made them drop to their \nknees, and summarily executed them, leaving their bodies there as a \nwarning to their fellow refugees.\n  The catalog of horror goes on and on and on.\n  I met a woman from Kosovo in my office on Friday with a businessman. \nThey told me of four little children they had met in a refugee camp. \nThe children had bandages over their eyes. They thought perhaps they \nhad been near an explosion. That was not the case. The Serbs had raped \ntheir mother. They had witnessed the rape, and the Serbs cut their eyes \nout--they cut their eyes out. I do not understand this level of hatred. \nI do not understand this frame of reference. I have no way of knowing \nhow people can do this.\n  We have witnessed the destabilization of neighboring countries who \ncannot possibly handle the new masses of humanity heaped on their \ndoorstep. Hundreds of thousands are homeless, without shelter and food, \nwandering throughout the mountains of Kosovo, frightened and in hiding. \nCertainly war crime prosecutions await the perpetrators. And we cry out \nfor justice to be done.\n  We watch the humanitarian relief efforts underway by our own \nGovernment, by our European friends, by the offices of the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, and by countless \nnongovernmental humanitarian relief organizations, and we weep at the \nabundant good that exists in the world in the face of the unspeakable \nhorror.\n  As I said, legitimate questions remain. There will undoubtedly be \nhearings relating to the wisdom and timing of our decision to enter \nthis conflict. But that time is not now. So long as our military forces \nare engaged in this mission, they deserve our full support.\n  I began my statement with the phrase ``silence is betrayal.'' I \nbelieve it is time to speak out once again, this time about where we \nare and where we are headed.\n  First, I want to express my strongest possible support for diplomatic \nefforts\n\n[[Page S4517]]\n\nto resolve this crisis, especially the shuttle diplomacy undertaken by \nDeputy Secretary Strobe Talbott, and the response of the Yeltsin \ngovernment in sending Mr. Chernomyrdin to speak with President Clinton \nhere today about his latest concrete proposals for resolving this \ncrisis.\n\n  As the NATO bombing campaign enters its sixth week, I think it is \nimperative that we put as much energy into pushing and pursuing a \ndiplomatic solution to the Kosovo crisis as we are putting into the \nmilitary campaign. We see exhaustive daily briefings on our success in \nhitting military targets. I would like to see an equal emphasis on \nevaluating our success in achieving our diplomatic goals.\n  I have the greatest respect for Strobe Talbott, and I think he is \nrepresenting us ably in our efforts to engage the Russians in helping \nto forge a negotiated settlement in Kosovo. I have told him recently \nhow important I believe it is that we not simply try to get the \nRussians to agree to NATO's view on how a settlement should be reached.\n  I support the basic military, political, and humanitarian goals which \nNATO has outlined: the safe return of refugees to their homes; the \nwithdrawal of Serb security forces--or at least to halt the bombing, a \nstart on their withdrawal, with a commitment to a concrete timetable; \nthe presence of an armed international force to protect refugees and \nmonitor Serb compliance; full access to Kosovo for nongovernmental \norganizations aiding the refugees; and Serb willingness to participate \nin meaningful negotiations on Kosovo's status.\n  But there are different ways to meet these goals. We need to be open \nto new Russian ideas on how to proceed, including the key issue of the \ncomposition of an international military presence--and it must be a \nmilitary presence--to establish and then keep the peace there.\n  We should welcome imaginative Russian initiatives. I think the \nRussians have shown once again--by President Yeltsin's engagement on \nthis issue and by his appointment as envoy of a former Prime Minister--\na sincere willingness to try to come up with a reasonable settlement.\n  Let's encourage them to put together the best proposals they can and \nassure them that NATO will be responsible and flexible in its response.\n  I am heartened by the former Prime Minister's visit today to the \nUnited States, and that United States-Russian diplomatic channels are \nopen and are being used continuously. These channels should be used \ncontinuously to keep the Russian mediation efforts on track, if \npossible.\n  I think it is imperative that we not sit back and hope that more \nbombing, or expanding the list of targets, will eventually work. We \nreally need to put all the effort we can into our diplomacy. I think, \nas I have said, the Russians may have a key role to play.\n  Second, we must keep uppermost in our mind that a humanitarian \ndisaster of historic proportions is unfolding in refugee camps \nthroughout the region.\n  The American people have been horrified by the situation in Kosovo \nand are anxious to help. Now is not the time for the U.S. Government to \nbe parsimonious about our humanitarian assistance. The lives and well-\nbeing of the Kosovars was at the crux of why we entered this crisis in \nthe first place. I believe we may need to bolster the current funding \nrequest by several hundred million dollars to provide the aid that will \nbe needed by international aid organizations, the religious community, \nand others deeply involved in the refugee effort.\n  If it turns out that it is not necessary, we can return the funds to \nthe Treasury. But we should authorize more now, anticipating that we \nand other NATO allies who will share this burden will be called upon to \ndo much more in the coming months. Medical supplies, food, basic \nshelter, blankets, skilled physicians and trauma specialists to aid the \nrefugees, longer-term economic development, and relocation aid all will \nbe critical to relieving this crisis.\n\n  Third, on the conduct of the military campaign, we must remember that \nNATO forces undertook this bombing campaign to stop the slaughter and \nprotect those living in Kosovo. Let me repeat that. The most immediate \nand important goals of our bombing campaign, from my perspective, were \nto stop the slaughter and mass displacement of millions of innocent \ncivilians throughout Kosovo and deter further Serb aggression against \nthem.\n  So far that goal has gone unmet, with terrible results and a very \nhigh human cost. Some NATO military officers have been quoted as saying \nthe bombing campaign alone will not and cannot stop the ethnic \ncleansing.\n  While it is clear that we made progress in weakening the Serb \nmilitary machine, including its air defenses, supply lines to Kosovo, \noil and munitions sites, other military sites, the hard truth is that \nwhile the bombing campaign has gone on, Kosovo is being looted, \nemptied, and burned.\n  Now that the Apache attack helicopters and accompanying antimissile \nsystems have arrived in the region, we should be pressing forward with \nthese airstrikes against these paramilitary forces in Kosovo most \nresponsible for the most brutal attacks on civilians. There can be no \nexcuse for further delays.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that we have not stopped the slaughter. \nEthnic cleansing, which we sought to stop, goes on and on and on.\n  Our response has been to intensify the bombing, especially in Serbia, \nand to expand the targets to include economic and industrial sites \nthere. Some of these were originally chosen because they were said to \nbe ``dual use.'' I understand that rationale. But now some seemingly \nnonmilitary targets appear to be selected--including the radio and TV \nnetwork, Milosevic party headquarters, the civilian electricity grid, \nand other seeming civilian targets--to put pressure on the people of \nSerbia who, it is hoped, will in turn put political pressure on the \nMilosevic regime to back down. I think this reasoning is pure folly and \ncannot be used to justify the expansion of civilian targets to be \nbombed. True military targets are legitimate. Certain dual-use targets, \nespecially those directly related to the Serb war effort, may be. But I \nknow of no rules of war which allow for the targeting of civilian \ntargets like some of those we have targeted. We should rethink this \nstrategy, not the least because it undermines the legitimate moral and \npolitical claims we have made to justify our military efforts to \nprotect innocent civilians in Kosovo.\n\n  Expanding the target list in this way is wrong. Not only does the \nexpansion of civilian, industrial and economic sites greatly increase \nthe risk of civilian casualties, but it is morally questionable if the \nprimary purpose is to do economic harm to the civilian population--\npeople who have nothing to do with the violent ethnic cleansing \ncampaign being conducted by the Serbian military machine.\n  What are the future military plans being discussed? These now \napparently include an embargo against future shipments of oil to \nYugoslavia. Russia is the Serbs' major oil supplier. What if oil \nshipments continue to come from Russia? Will Russian transports be the \nnext targets of NATO forces?\n  Mr. President, this resolution, as open-ended as it is, is not the \nright way to proceed on this complex and difficult question. It reminds \nme in some ways of the now infamous Gulf of Tonkin resolution which \nhelped trigger the Vietnam war. It is too open-ended, too vague, and I \nwill not vote for it. NATO military commanders have not asked for \nground troops. The President of the United States has not asked \nCongress to authorize them. We should promptly table this resolution \nlater today. Even one of its principal sponsors, Senator Biden, has \nobserved that they did not intend for this resolution to be brought to \nthe Senate floor now under the expedited procedures of the War Powers \nAct. But even though we will likely table it, we must continue to move \nforward in our efforts to achieve a prompt, just and peaceful end to \nthis conflict. And we should have the debate.\n  Once again, I cannot be silent. In short, I think it is time for all \nthe parties to consider a brief and verifiable timeout. Yes, a timeout \nbefore we proceed further down the risky and slippery slope of further \nmilitary action, before it is too late to turn back.\n  There are negotiations underway. There are pivotal efforts being \nundertaken by the Russian leaders. There are discussions. There are \nproposals and counterproposals being discussed.\n\n[[Page S4518]]\n\nSome are being interpreted in different ways by different parties. \nIdeas are being explored.\n  Some of our friends in and out of NATO are discussing various ways to \nend this nightmare. The continued evolution of these plans must be \ngiven a chance. There is no ``light at the end of the tunnel'' unless \nrenewed diplomacy is given a chance to work.\n  With the former Prime Minister and the President talking today, what \nI am proposing on the floor of the Senate for consideration, if it can \nbe worked out in a way which would protect NATO troops and would not \nrisk Serb resupply of the war machine, is a brief and verifiable halt \nin the bombing, a cessation of what seems to be the slide toward the \nbombing of a broader array of nonmilitary targets, a potential oil \nembargo directed at other countries, and toward deeper involvement in a \nwider war that I believe we could come to regret.\n  I am not naive about whether we can trust Milosevic; we have seen him \nbreak his word too many times for that. Nor am I proposing an open-\nended halt in our effort; but a temporary pause of 48 hours or so, \noffered on condition that Milosevic not be allowed to use the period to \nresupply troops or to repair his air defenses and that he immediately \norders his forces in Kosovo to halt their attacks and begin to actually \nwithdraw. It would not require his formal prior assent to each of these \nconditions, but if our intelligence and other means of verification \nconcludes that he is taking military advantage of such a pause by doing \nany of these things, then we should resume the bombing. .I believe that \nwe may need to take the first step, a gesture, in the effort to bring \nthese horrors to an end.\n\n  Such a pause may well be worthwhile, if it works to prompt the \ncessation of the ethnic cleansing and a return of Serb forces to their \ngarrisons. .It may create the conditions for the possibility of further \ntalks on the conditions under which NATO's larger term goals, which I \nsupport, can be met. .A brief cessation might also enable \nnongovernmental organizations and other ``true neutrals'' in the \nconflict to airlift or truck in and then distribute relief supplies to \nthe internally displaced Kosovars who are homeless and starving in the \nmountains of Kosovo, without the threat of this humanitarian mission \nbeing halted by the Serbian military.\n  A Serb guarantee of their safe conduct would be an important \nreciprocal gesture on the part of Milosevic. .These people must be \nrescued, and my hope is that a temporary bombing pause might help to \nenable aid organizations to get to them. .I hope that President Clinton \nand Mr. Chernomyrdin will consider this idea and other similar \nproposals in their discussion today. .I intend to explore and refine \nthese ideas further with administration officials in the coming days to \nsee if it might hold any promise to bring this awful war to a peaceful \nclose.\n  I am not naive. .I understand that the safety of our NATO forces must \nbe held paramount in any such exploration. .But it is, it seems to me, \nworth exploring further. .One thing that is clear is that the situation \non the ground in Kosovo today and in those countries which border it is \nunacceptable and likely to worsen considerably in the coming weeks.\n  I am not just talking about a geographical or geopolitical \nabstraction, the stability of the region. .I am talking about the human \ncost of a wider Balkan conflict. .For 50 years, we have spent the blood \nand treasure of Americans and Europeans to help provide for a stable, \npeaceful Europe. .I believe we must again work with the Europeans, and \nnow with the Russians and others, who have historic ties to the Serbs \nto try to resolve this crisis before the flames of war in Kosovo and \nthe refugee exodus which it has prompted consume the region. .Stepped \nup diplomacy, a possible pause in the airstrikes, and other similar \nefforts to bring a peaceful and just end to this crisis should be \npursued right now.\n  Silence equals betrayal.\n  It was with that belief deep in my soul that I voted, six weeks ago, \nto authorize the United States participation in the NATO bombing of \nYugoslavia.\n  I did so with a heavy heart, and not without foreboding, because I \nknew that, once unleashed, a bombing campaign led by the world's \ngreatest superpower to put a stop to violence will likely lead to more \nviolence. Violence begets violence. And yet, there are those extremely \nrare occasions when our moral judgment dictates that that is the only \nremaining course available to us.\n  I did so because it was my judgment that we had exhausted every \ndiplomatic possibility, and that our best and most credible information \nwas that without military action by the United States, a humanitarian \ndisaster was beginning to occur.\n  Just as the Senate was about to conduct a roll call vote on this \nsubject, I sought to make sure that the record reflected the rightness \nof our course of action. I was assured that our purpose was to prevent \nthe imminent slaughter of thousands, if not tens of thousands of \ninnocent civilians living in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo by Serb \nsecurity forces.\n  I had no doubt about the wisdom and correctness of our decision. And \ntoday, I harbor no second thoughts about the morality of that initial \ncourse.\n  Others may question the reasoning of some who embarked upon the \nbombing campaign. History will judge whether there were other \nrationales involved:\n  The significance of prior threats we had made and how our credibility \nwas on the line; the geopolitical factors that required that we act; \nthe continued viability of NATO as a force to be reckoned with \nthroughout the world.\n  Whatever importance these factors may have played in the decisions of \nothers to authorize the bombing, my own was a simple one--inaction in \nthe face of unspeakable, imminent, and preventable violence was \nabsolutely unacceptable. In short, the slaughter must be stopped.\n  I have no regrets about that decision. The violence perpetrated \nagainst the innocents of Kosovo has indeed been unspeakable. My only \nregret is that our actions have been less effective than I had hoped.\n  Over a million humans, mostly women and children, uprooted from their \nhomes.\n  Hundreds of thousands expelled from their country, their homes and \nvillages burned.\n  Women raped, thousands of the residents killed, children separated \nfrom their families.\n  The catalog of these atrocities expands every single day. From \nAcareva to Zim, villages in Kosovo have been burned by Serb forces. In \nCirez, as many as 20,000 Albanian refugees were reportedly recently \nused as human shields against NATO bombings. In Djakovica, over 100 \nethnic Albanians were reportedly summarily executed by Serb forces. In \nGoden, the Serbs reportedly executed over 20 men, including \nschoolteachers, before burning the village to the ground. In Kuraz, 21 \nschoolteachers were reported by refugees to have been executed in this \nvillage near Srbica, with hundreds more being held there by Serb \nparamilitary forces. In Pastasel, the bodies of over 70 ethnic \nAlbanians, ranging in age from 14 to 50, were discovered by refugees on \nApril 1. In Podujevo, Serb forces may have executed over 200 military-\nage Kosovar men, removing some from their cars and shooting them on the \nspot, at point-blank range.\n  In Pristina, the Serbs appear to have completed their military \noperations in the city and have been ethnically cleansing the entire \ncity. Approximately 25,000 Kosovars were forcibly expelled from the \ncity last month, shipped to Macedonia by rail cars in scenes eerily \nreminiscent of the holocaust trains, and approximately 200,000 more may \nbe detained there, awaiting their forced expulsion. In Prizren, Serb \nforces reportedly executed between 20 and 30 civilians. In Srbica, \nafter emptying the town of its Kosovar inhabitants, Serb forces are \nbelieved to have executed 115 ethnic Albanian males over the age of 18. \nOver twenty thousand prisoners are reportedly still being housed in an \nammunition factory near the town, under Serbian guard. Just last week, \nSerb paramilitaries in southern Kosovo reportedly forced between 100 \nand 200 young men from a convoy of refugees heading for the border, \ntook them into a nearby field, made them drop to their knees, and \nsummarily executed them, leaving their bodies there as a warning to \ntheir fellow refugees. The catalog of horrors goes on and on.\n\n[[Page S4519]]\n\n  We have witnessed the destabilization of neighboring countries who \ncannot possibly handle the new masses of humanity heaped on their \ndoorstep.\n  Hundreds of thousands homeless, without shelter and without food, \nwandering throughout the mountains of Kosovo, frightened and in hiding.\n  Certainly war crime prosecutions await the perpetrators and we cry \nout for justice to be done.\n  We watch the humanitarian relief efforts underway, by our own \ngovernment, by our European friends, by the offices of the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, and by countless non-\ngovernmental humanitarian relief organizations and we weep at the \nabundant good that exists in the world in the face of this unspeakable \nhorror.\n  As I said, legitimate questions remain, and there will undoubtedly be \nhearings relating to the wisdom and timing of our decision to enter \nthis conflict. But that time is not now, and so long as our military \nforces are engaged in this mission they deserve our full support.\n  I began my statement with the phrase ``silence is betrayal.'' And I \nbelieve it is time to speak out once again, this time about where we \nare, and where we are headed.\n  First, I want to express my strongest possible support for diplomatic \nefforts to resolve this crisis, especially the shuttle diplomacy \nundertaken by Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott, and the response of the \nYeltsin government in sending Mr. Chernomyrdin to speak with President \nClinton here today about his latest concrete proposals for resolving \nthis crisis. As the NATO bombing campaign enters its sixth week I think \nit is imperative that we put as much energy into pursuing a diplomatic \nsolution to the Kosovo crisis as we are putting into the military \ncampaign. We see exhaustive daily briefings on our success in hitting \nmilitary targets--I would like to see equal emphasis on evaluating our \nsuccess in achieving our diplomatic goals. I have the greatest respect \nfor Strobe Talbott and I think he is representing us ably in our \nefforts to engage the Russians in helping to forge a negotiated \nsettlement in Kosovo. I have told him recently how important I believe \nit is that we not simply try to get the Russians to agree to NATO's \nviews on how a settlement should be reached.\n  I support the basic military, political and humanitarian goals which \nNATO has outlined: the safe return of refugees to their homes; the \nwithdrawal of Serb Security forces--or at least, to halt the bombing, a \nstart on their withdrawal, with a commitment to a concrete timetable; \nthe presence of an armed international force to protect refugees and \nmonitor Serb compliance; full access to Kosovo for non-governmental \norganizations aiding the refugees; and Serb willingness to participate \nin meaningful negotiations on Kosovo's status. But there are different \nways to meet these goals. And we need to be open to new Russian ideas \non how to proceed, including on the key issue of the composition of an \ninternational military presence to establish and then keep the peace \nthere.\n  We should welcome imaginative Russian initiatives. I think the \nRussians have shown once again--by President Yeltsin's engagement on \nthis issue and by his appointment as envoy of a former Prime Minister--\na sincere willingness to try to come up with a reasonable settlement. \nLet's encourage them to put together the best proposals they can and \nassure them that NATO will be flexible in its response. I am heartened \nby the former Prime Minister's visit today to the U.S., and that US-\nRussian diplomatic channels are open and are being used continuously. \nThese channels should be used continuously to keep the Russian \nmediation efforts on track, if possible.\n\n  I think it is imperative that we not sit back and hope that more \nbombing, or expanding the list of targets, will eventually work. We \nneed to really put all the effort we can into our diplomacy. And I \nthink, as I've said, the Russians may have a key role to play.\n  Second, we must keep uppermost in our mind that a humanitarian \ndisaster of historic proportions is unfolding in refugee camps \nthroughout the region. The situation is so tense that it is being \nreported there have been near-riots in some camps over the desperate \nconditions there, and the situation in camps near Blace in Macedonia \nand at Kukes in northern Albania are especially grim. Shortly, we will \nconsider an emergency supplemental package to fund the military and \nhumanitarian costs for the Kosovo crisis. I am deeply concerned that \nthe amount requested for refugee assistance may not be enough to meet \nthe overwhelming needs of this emergency--the largest refugee crisis \nsince World War II.\n  We are meeting the military challenge by spending millions a day to \nassist NATO in its war against Serb aggression. The humanitarian \nchallenge we face is just as great. If we have learned anything in \nrecent weeks, it is that we must prepare for the worst of the worst-\ncase scenarios.\n  Hundreds of thousands of refugees are still trapped inside Kosovo, \nwaiting for an opportunity to escape. A further massive exodus seems \nlikely. We must be prepared to meet their needs. Extensive medical \nsupplies and possibly another field hospital will also be needed, since \nmore and more new arrivals are requiring medical attention. Our \nexperience in Bosnia has taught us that these refugees will not be \ngoing home anytime soon. Long-term assistance is required. Further, we \nmust support Albania and Macedonia who are struggling to meet basic \nneeds of their own people, let alone those of the Kosovar refugees.\n  The American people have been horrified by the situation in Kosovo, \nand are anxious to help. Now is not the time for the US government to \nbe parsimonious about our humanitarian assistance. The lives and well-\nbeing of the Kosovars was at the crux of why we entered this crisis in \nthe first place. I believe we may need to bolster the current funding \nrequest by several hundred million to provide the aid that will be \nneeded by international aid organizations, the religious community, and \nothers deeply involved in the refugee effort. If it turns out that it \nis not necessary, we can return the funds to the Treasury. But we \nshould authorize more now, anticipating that we and our other NATO \nallies who share this burden will be called upon do much more in the \ncoming months. Medical supplies, food, basic shelter, blankets, skilled \nphysicians and trauma specialists to aid the refugees, longer-term \neconomic development and relocation aid--all will be critical to \nrelieving this crisis.\n  Third, on the conduct of the military campaign, we must remember that \nNATO forces undertook this bombing campaign to stop the slaughter and \nprotect those living in Kosovo. Let me repeat that. The most immediate \nand important goals of our bombing campaign, from my perspective, were \nto stop the slaughter and mass displacement of innocent civilians \nthroughout Kosovo, and to deter further Serb aggression against them. \nSo far that goal has gone unmet, with terrible results and very high \nhuman costs. Some NATO military officers have been quoted as saying \nthat the bombing campaign alone will not and cannot stop the ethnic \ncleansing.\n  While it is clear we have made progress in weakening the Serb \nmilitary machine, including its air defenses, supply lines to Kosovo, \noil and munitions sites, and other military sites, the hard truth is \nthat while the bombing campaign has gone on, Kosovo is being looted, \nemptied and burned. Now that the Apache attack helicopters and \naccompanying anti-missile systems have arrived in the region, we should \nbe pressing forward our air strikes against those paramilitary forces \nin Kosovo most responsible for the most brutal attacks against \ncivilians. There can be no excuse for further delays.\n  There will be time to determine whether our bombing accelerated, or \nwhether it increased, the slaughter. In any case, it now seems clear, \nfrom detailed and credible reports in the media and elsewhere, that the \nSerb ethnic cleansing campaign, labeled the other day by the Washington \nPost as ``one of the most ambitiously ruthless military campaigns in \nEurope in half a century,'' was carefully and meticulously planned for \nmonths before the bombing. The attacks have reportedly seriously \ndamaged over 250 villages, with well over 50 being completely burned to \nthe ground. Systematically integrating Interior Ministry (MUP) forces, \nregular Yugoslav army forces, police units and paramilitary gangs for \nthe first time,\n\n[[Page S4520]]\n\nthis effort was clearly coldly calculated to terrorize the populace, \nand ultimately to rid the entire province of its ethnic Albanian \nmajority. It is clear that we have not stopped the slaughter. Ethnic \ncleansing, which we sought to stop, goes on, and on, and on.\n  Our response has been to intensify the bombing, especially in Serbia, \nand to expand the targets to include economic and industrial sites \nthere. Some of these were originally chosen because they were said to \nbe ``dual use.'' I understand that rationale. But now some seemingly \nnon-military targets appear to be selected--including the radio and tv \nnetwork, the Milosevic Party headquarters, the civilian electricity \ngrid, and other seeming civilian targets--to put pressure on the people \nof Serbia who, it is hoped, will in turn put political pressure on the \nMilosevic regime to back down.\n  I think this reasoning is pure folly and cannot be used to justify \nthe expansion of civilian targets to be bombed. True military targets \nare legitimate. Certain dual use targets, especially those directly \nrelated to the Serb War effort, may be. But I know of no rules of war \nwhich allow for the targeting of civilian targets like some of those we \nhave targeted. We should rethink this strategy, not least because it \nundermines the legitimate moral and political claims we have made to \njustify our military efforts to protect innocent civilians in Kosovo.\n  Expanding the target lists in this way is wrong. Not only does the \nexpansion to civilian industrial and economic sites greatly increase \nthe risk of civilian casualties, but it is morally questionable if the \nprimary purpose is to do economic harm to the civilian population--\npeople who have nothing to do with the violent ethnic cleansing \ncampaign being conducted by the Serbian military machine.\n\n  I am also very concerned about reports from the NATO summit that \nfuture targeting decisions will likely be placed in the hands of NATO \nmilitary officials, without careful review of elected civilian \nrepresentatives--a policy that I think is at odds with our \nconstitutional insistence upon civilian control.\n  And what other future military plans are being discussed? These now \napparently include an embargo against future shipments of oil to \nYugoslavia. Russia is the Serbs' major oil supplier. What if oil \nshipments continue to come from Russia? Will Russian transports be the \nnext targets of NATO forces?\n  While I recognize the legitimate concern of NATO military officials \nthat we must not put pilots' lives at risk to hit oil production and \ndistribution facilities servicing the Serb armies, while allowing oil \nto pour in to them through ports in Montenegro or through other means, \nwe must be very careful as we proceed here.\n  And then there is the question of the introduction of ground troops. \nAfter the NATO summit last weekend, plans are being ``taken off the \nshelf and updated.'' Propositioning of ground troops is being advocated \nby some within our own government. It doesn't take clairvoyance to see \nwhere some seem to be headed.\n  This resolution, as open-ended as it is, is not the right way to \nproceed on this complex and difficult question. It reminds me, in some \nways, of the now infamous Gulf of Tonkin resolution which helped \ntrigger the Vietnam War. It is too open-ended, too vague, and I will \nnot vote for it. NATO military commanders have not asked for ground \ntroops, the President of the U.S. has not asked Congress to authorize \nthem; we should promptly table this resolution later today. Even one of \nits principal sponsors, Senator Biden, has observed that they did not \nintend for this resolution to be brought to the Senate floor now, under \nthe expedited procedures of the War Powers Act. But even though we will \nlikely table it, we must continue to move forward in our efforts to \nachieve a prompt, just and peaceful end to this conflict.\n  And so, once again, I cannot be silent. In short, I think it's time \nfor all the parties to consider a brief and verifiable time-out. Yes, a \ntime-out, before we proceed further down the risky and slippery slope \nof further military action, before it's too late to turn back.\n  There are negotiations underway. There are pivotal efforts being \nundertaken by the Russian leaders. There are discussions. There are \nproposals and counter proposals being discussed. Some are being \ninterpreted in different ways by different parties. Ideas are being \nexplored. Some of our friends, in and out of NATO, are discussing \nvarious ways to end this nightmare. The continued evolution of these \nplans must be given a chance. There is no ``light at the end of the \ntunnel'' unless renewed diplomacy is given a chance to work.\n  With the former Prime Minister and the President talking today, what \nI am proposing for consideration--if it can be worked out in a way \nwhich would protect NATO troops, and would not risk Serb resupply of \ntheir war machine--is a brief and verifiable halt in the bombing, a \ncessation of what seems to be a slide toward the bombing of a broader \narray of non-military targets, a potential oil embargo directed at \nother countries, and toward deeper involvement in a wider war that I \nbelieve we could come to regret.\n  I am not naive about whether we can trust Milosevic; we have seen him \nbreak his word too many times for that. Nor am I proposing an open-\nended halt in our effort. But a temporary pause of 48 hours or so, \noffered on condition that Milosevic not be allowed to use the period to \nresupply troops or to repair his air defenses, and that he immediately \norders his forces in Kosovo to halt their attacks and begin to actually \nwithdraw. It would not require his formal prior assent to each of these \nconditions, but if our intelligence and other means of verification \nconcludes that he is taking military advantage of such a pause by doing \nany of these things, then we should resume the bombing. I believe that \nwe may need to take the first step, a gesture, in the effort to bring \nthese horrors to an end.\n  I know there are risks and costs associated with such an even \ntemporary halt in the airstrikes. I am not yet sure, for example, that \nwe could develop a verifiable time-out plan which would prevent Serb \nforces from quickly repairing their air defense systems such that they \nwould pose new risks to NATO pilots; that cannot be allowed. I know \nthere would be real problems in verifying that Serb attacks on the \nground in Kosovo had stopped, and military and paramilitary units were \nactually pulling back, during any bombing pause. I am no military \nexpert, but I am posing those and other questions to US military \nofficials and others, to see if there is not room for such an \ninitiative.\n  Such a pause may well be worthwhile; if it works to prompt a \ncessation of the ethnic cleansing and a return of Serb forces to their \ngarrisons, it may create the conditions for the possibility of further \ntalks on the conditions under which NATO's longer-term goals, which I \nsupport, can be met.\n  A brief cessation might also enable non-governmental organizations \nand other ``true neutrals'' in the conflict to airlift or truck in, and \nthen distribute, relief supplies to the internally-displaced Kosovars \nwho are homeless and starving in the mountains of Kosovo, without the \nthreat of this humanitarian mission being halted by the Serbian \nmilitary. A Serb guarantee of their safe conduct would be an important \nreciprocal gesture on the part of Milosevic. These people must be \nrescued, and my hope is that a temporary bombing pause might help to \nenable aid organizations to get to them.\n  I hope that President Clinton and Mr. Chernomyrdin will consider this \nidea, and other similar proposals, in their discussion today. I intend \nto explore and refine this idea further with Administration officials \nin the coming days, to see if it might hold any promise to bring this \nawful war to a peaceful close. I am not naive, and I understand that \nthe safety of our NATO forces must be held paramount in any such \nexploration. But it is, it seems to me, worth exploring further.\n  One thing that is clear is that the situation on the ground in Kosovo \ntoday and in those countries which border it is unacceptable and likely \nto worsen considerably in the coming weeks.\n  It has been argued by the Administration and others that an intense \nand sustained conflict in Kosovo, which has sent hundreds of thousands \nof refugees across borders and could potentially draw Albania, \nMacedonia, Greece and Turkey into a wider war would be disastrous. That \nis true. We may not be able to contain a wider Balkan war\n\n[[Page S4521]]\n\nwithout far greater risk and cost than has been contemplated. And we \ncould well face an even greater humanitarian catastrophe than we face \nnow in the weeks and months to come.\n  I am not just talking about a geopolitical abstraction, the stability \nof the region. I am talking about the human cost of a wider Balkan \nconflict. For fifty years, we have spent the blood and treasure of \nAmericans and Europeans to help provide for a stable, peaceful Europe. \nI believe we must again work with the Europeans--and now with the \nRussians and others who have historic ties to the Serbs--to try to \nresolve this crisis before the flames of war in Kosovo and of the \nrefugee exodus which it has prompted consume the region. Stepped-up \ndiplomacy, a possible pause in the airstrikes, and other similar \nefforts to bring a peaceful and just end to this crisis should be \npursued right now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield such time to the Senator from \nArkansas as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I \nespecially thank him for his strong leadership on this issue and for \npushing this issue to the point that we are having this debate on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I have believed for some time that this debate has been sorely needed \nand greatly lacking. Senator McCain is truly an American hero. He is \none that I respect immensely, along with Senator Hagel and the other \ncosponsors of this resolution.\n  Though I disagree with them and though I rise in opposition to the \nresolution, I believe they have taken a principled position, a \nprincipled stand that is justifiable and behind which there are \nrational arguments. I believe they reciprocate that respect for the \nprincipled position and belief that we do not have a vital national \ninterest in the Balkans and that we have made a policy mistake and that \ngiven where we are, the placement of ground troops is not the next step \nthat we should be taking.\n  I regret the silence that has characterized Congress to this point, \nparticularly the Senate. I applaud those who have pushed that we might \nhave this time today.\n  As I read the resolution, I read that it authorizes the use of all \nnecessary force and other means. That, I do believe, is a blank check. \nI believe it grants blanket authority, and it does take us out of what \nis a very, very important role for the Congress. I read also that all \nnecessary force and other means is granted to accomplish NATO's \nobjectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and \nMontenegro.\n  One of the questions I have is, what are our objectives? I do not \nbelieve those objectives have been clearly outlined. Does the \nresolution refer to military objectives, which we have been told means \nto degrade the military capability of Milosevic--whatever that term \n``degrade'' may mean, subjective as it is--or does this reference to \nthe objectives of NATO refer to political objectives, which have been \ndefined in a much broader sense in reference to the withdrawal of \nMilosevic, the incorporation of an international peacekeeping force, \nhumanitarian aid and a number of things?\n  So I am not certain what objectives are in mind in the resolution or \nhow one would determine whether or not they have been achieved.\n  When I made reference to the silence that I think has been \nembarrassing for the Senate, I think Members of the Senate have been \nreluctant to speak on this for a couple of reasons. We have been \nreticent to speak out because nobody wants to be portrayed as not being \nin support of American troops.\n  I went to Aviano. We have the bravest young men and women imaginable \ninvolved in this. They are willing and have been risking their lives \ndaily in pursuit of this policy and the orders they have been given. I \nsupport them and I believe in them. I believe in their effectiveness \nand I believe in their courage. But I think that is one reason people \nhave been hesitant to get into this debate, because they are afraid of \nbeing portrayed as not being supportive of the military, and also \nbecause of the horrible atrocities that have been committed by the \nSerbs and the Milosevic war machine.\n  Nobody wants to be portrayed as being uncaring or not having a \nhumanitarian concern for the ethnic cleansing and for the killing and \nmassacres that have gone on, which truly are deplorable and ought to be \ncondemned by all right-thinking people. I care about that just as I \ncare about the 1.3 million-plus civilians who have died in the Sudan in \nthe Sudanese civil war, and just as I care about those who died in the \nEthiopian civil war, and just as I care about those who died in Rwanda, \nand just as I care about the oppression that goes on today in China. I \ncare about those tragedies that are going on all over the world, not \njust in the Balkans.\n  I have agonized a great deal about what is the right position not \nonly on this resolution but on this, what I believe is a misguided \nconflict. The war in Kosovo reveals the extent to which we have \noverstretched our armed services. They are overdeployed and \nunderfunded. For example, over the last 3 fiscal years, the Congress \nhas added $21 billion to the President's meager defense requests. \nUnfortunately, even these increases have not kept pace with the \nmilitary's increased tempo of operations. The President has committed \nUnited States forces to Haiti, Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia, Macedonia, the \nTaiwan Strait, and now Kosovo. Each of these much-needed congressional \nplus-ups was passed over the administration's objections, and the \nadministration simply said the Pentagon hadn't asked for the additional \nmoney.\n  Between the years 1945 and 1990, the U.S. Army was deployed only 10 \ntimes, Mr. President. But since 1991, the U.S. Army has been deployed \n32 times. That is an increase in deployments of over 300 percent. \nSimultaneous with our 300-percent increase in deployments around the \nworld, we have cut funding for the U.S. armed services by one-third. \nThat is a simple calculation that, if you ask the armed services to do \n300 percent more and you give them one-third less, you are inviting a \ndisaster and you are creating a crisis, and that is what we face today.\n  This overuse of America's limited military might threatens our \nability to execute our national security strategy to be able to fight--\nand this is our stated strategy--and win two near-simultaneous, medium, \nregional conflicts. This past Friday in the Washington Post, Bradley \nGraham authored an important article on this very point. In the \narticle, General Richard Hawley, who heads the Air Combat Command, told \nreporters--and General Hawley is retiring in June and therefore he \nspoke with particular candor--that 5 weeks of bombing Yugoslavia have \nleft United States munitions critically short, not just of air-launched \ncruise missiles, as previously reported, but also of another precision \nweapon, the joint direct attack munition dropped by B-2 bombers. So low \nis the inventory of the new satellite-guided weapons, Hawley said, that \nas the bombing campaign accelerates, the Air Force risks exhausting its \nprewar supply of JDAMs before the next scheduled delivery sometime in \nMay.\n\n  In the past 8 years, the U.S. military has been weakened appreciably. \nWhile we are occupied in Kosovo, United States intelligence assets are \nnecessarily focused on military operations there. If another country \nconducts a ballistic missile test while the bulk of United States \nintelligence assets are focused in Kosovo, and if that country only \nneeds one test before deployment, like North Korea, for instance, then \nwe will not have missed simply the one test, but we will have missed \nall the tests necessary to know what they are deploying and when they \nwill deploy it.\n  There is a great deal going on in our world, including a \ndeteriorating relationship with Japan, with the People's Republic of \nChina, with Russia; a dangerous situation in North Korea; Iraq is busy \nagain on their ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction \nprograms, with no U.N. inspections to inhibit them; India and Pakistan \nlaunching ballistic missiles and testing nuclear weapons; Iran, and \nother surprises yet to come. The United States needs to be sure it has \nthe resources to focus on more than one troubled spot at a time. We \nneed to decide what is important and see that we have the necessary \ncapabilities.\n  As reported in this most recent edition of National Review:\n\n\n[[Page S4522]]\n\n\n       General Henry Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, told Congress, ``Anecdotal and now measurable evidence \n     indicates that our current readiness is fraying and that the \n     long-term health of the total force is in jeopardy.''\n       Today's military is 36 percent smaller than it was during \n     the Gulf War. Last year, the Pentagon determined that there \n     was a high risk of being unable to [fight and] win two [near] \n     simultaneous wars, a capability that current U.S. strategic \n     doctrine demands. And even though [the Pentagon doesn't \n     consider] the Kosovo assaults . . . as one of these major \n     engagements, they have led to fewer patrols being flown over \n     Iraq, and a [substantial] gap in naval forces in the Pacific.\n\n  President Clinton responded to the readiness alert sounded by his \nmilitary chiefs by proposing an additional $12 billion for next year's \ndefense budget. But $8 billion of this ``increase'' represents savings \nfrom lower fuel costs and inflation rates that would be going to the \nmilitary anyway. A good portion of the remaining $4 billion is \ndedicated to items like commissary operations and renovation of the \nPentagon, which leaves precious little to meet our crying readiness \ndemands.\n  I believe that since we started what I believe is a misguided war in \nthe Balkans, it has been flawed since its implementation. President \nClinton and his national security team have mismanaged this operation \nfrom the very beginning.\n  The U.S. and NATO should stop saying what the allies will or will not \ndo. For example: We will hit only these targets. Why should we tell \nthem that?\n  We will only hit those targets at 2 a.m. when nobody will be hurt. We \nare running out of cruise missiles. Why should we tell them that? We \nare bringing in A-10 aircraft, or Apache helicopters, in four weeks.\n\n  Why do we say that? Once again, such statements only help the enemy.\n  It would also seem that the President did not learn many lessons from \na war that he so forcefully and vocally opposed. A ``graduated \nresponse'' didn't work in Vietnam for President Johnson; it won't work \nfor NATO in Kosovo. It will cost lives. If the United States is going \nto get into a fight, if we are going to place America's sons and \ndaughters in harm's way, then it is worth winning, and we should hit \nhard and hit hard up front. Hoping for a measured antiseptic war--\n``immaculate coercion''--to be successful, without deaths on either \nside, is the only hope of the unschooled.\n  The present practice of ``war by committee'' is another area ripe for \nscrutiny. There are too many lives at risk for NATO to continue to \noperate as it has for the first 6 weeks of the air war, with delays for \nthe approval of each of the targets and delays on the dispatching of \nvarious weapons systems, such as the Apaches. If a ``war by committee'' \nis difficult to implement in an air campaign, I believe it would be \nvirtually impossible to execute in a ground campaign.\n  Even Margaret Thatcher, who herself advocates ground troops, has \nharbored doubts about Operation Allied Force and its implementation. \nDuring a speech delivered last week, the former British Prime Minister \nstated:\n\n       So here we are now, fighting a war . . . on treacherous \n     terrain, so far without much effective local support, with \n     imperfect intelligence, and with war aims that some find \n     unclear and unpersuasive.\n\n  The key question that confronts the Senate and the Congress and the \ncountry is, What will guide our national security policy? Will it truly \nbe our vital national security interests, or will it be that guided by \nunderstandable humanitarian concerns? Is Kosovo in our national \nsecurity interest?\n  Another excellent article that appeared recently that I would like to \nquote from, I think, speaks eloquently about this issue of our vital \nnational interest. Ultimately, it says our vital interests must somehow \nbe involved.\n\n       Sometimes, as with President Clinton's attempts to relate \n     America's interest to Kosovo with the outbreak of two world \n     wars in the Balkans, it takes the form of bad history. Apart \n     from the fact that the beginning of World War II had nothing \n     to do with the Balkans, World War I began at a time when the \n     interests of three vast empires collided in the region, \n     making it one of extraordinary geopolitical sensitivity. That \n     is no longer the case. Now, properly considered, it should be \n     an insignificant backwater, and it has taken a good deal of \n     determined and sustainable political effort to make it \n     otherwise.\n\n  The article goes on to conclude with an interview with Lawrence \nEagleburger, whom the article rightly describes as ``one of the few \nAmericans who both understands foreign policy and has a close firsthand \nknowledge of Yugoslavia''. Mr. Eagleburger is quoted as saying:\n\n       Serb nationalism is the real ruler here. Whoever would \n     follow Mr. Milosevic would certainly be just as bad. Or he \n     might even be worse--a true believer in the nationalist \n     cause.\n\n  Mr. Harries continues:\n\n       But if Serb nationalism is the real ruler, it doesn't make \n     a great deal of difference whether the ostensible ruler is or \n     is not a true believer, for in either case he is riding a \n     tiger.\n\n  Mark Helprin, writing recently, raised similar points. He rightly \nasks if it is the policy of the United States to support separatism and \nsecession wherever they may be close to ignition and war?\n  He goes on:\n\n       The Administration's answer is that the Balkans are ``in \n     the heart of Europe.'' The Balkans, of course, are not in the \n     heart of Europe. They are a backwater separated from the \n     European heartland by mountain ranges and salt water. They \n     are entirely unastride the major routes of communication and/\n     or axis of invasion, and they are strategically and \n     economically unessential. In citing them as the origins of \n     the First and, incorrectly, Second World Wars, and therefore \n     as justification for his policy of internationalizing their \n     conflicts, President Clinton seems not to comprehend that one \n     of the reasons for the First World War was that the great \n     powers of the time stupidly, mistakenly and fatally \n     internationalized the conflicts there.\n\n  May I say, Mr. President, that is what we are doing. We are taking \nthe conflict in the Balkans and we are ratcheting it up. We are \ninternationalizing the conflicts in the Balkans.\n  What is the proper role of Congress in all of this? I have applauded \nSenator McCain for ensuring that debate took place. There has been too \nmuch congressional silence--perhaps afraid of the political \nrepercussions, perhaps wanting to make this a political winner for one \nparty or the other.\n  But at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, one of our \nNation's Founding Fathers, James Wilson, a signatory of the \nConstitution, not only implicitly equated declaring war and entering \nwar, but also explicitly foreclosed exercise of the power by the \nPresident acting alone. And he emphasizes the role of our national \ninterests in entering a war.\n  He said:\n\n       This [new] system will not hurry us into war; it is \n     calculated to guard against it. It will not be in the power \n     of a single man, or a single body of men, to involve us in \n     such distress; for the important power of declaring war is \n     vested in the legislature at large; this declaration must be \n     made with the concurrence of the House of Representatives; \n     from this circumstance we may draw a certain conclusion that \n     nothing but our national interest can draw us into a war.\n\n  So it was envisioned by our Founding Fathers that nothing but our \nnational interest can draw us into a war. It has yet to be adequately \ndemonstrated to Congress or the American people that it is our vital \nnational interest that has drawn us into this conflict. In fact, I \nwould say we have stumbled into this conflict. We have slipped into \nthis war.\n  I want to take just a moment, Mr. President, to talk about the \ndifficulties of a ground war.\n  Escalating the conflict in Kosovo to include U.S. ground forces would \nrequire broad and deep public support, which is presently lacking.\n  Deploying a NATO-led force of any consequence, would require the \nbroad consensus of NATO's nineteen member states. Judging by the \nlimited commitment of forces made by some of our NATO allies to the \npresent operation, I strongly doubt that a consensus could be reached \non deploying 200,000 or more soldiers into Kosovo.\n  In fact, as important as this exercise is today, as important as this \ndebate is today, it may truly be a moot point, because the likelihood \nof receiving consensus among our NATO allies is remote.\n  Deploying a NATO-led force large enough to expel the Serbian Army and \nany paramilitary forces would take several months, by which time \nSlobodan Milosevic may have succeeding in expelling all of Kosovo's \nethnic Albanian population. If anyone doubts this point, I would \nencourage them to re-examine just how long it took the Army to deploy \njust 24 Apache helicopters and their supporting equipment from Germany \nto Albania. That deployment alone took over one full month.\n\n[[Page S4523]]\n\n  Any ground operation in Kosovo, however it ends, would require an \narmed NATO-led presence in Kosovo for decades to come. While the \nAmerican people have focused--focused well and focused appropriately--\non the humanitarian disaster in the Balkans, they have not yet focused \non the length and cost of the commitment that this resolution would be \nasking us to make--truly a decade-long commitment. One need only look \nat the Korean peninsula where American troops have been deployed for \nover 45 years.\n  Remember the first time I mentioned the decade-long commitment to the \npress, and the eyebrows went up and a look of skepticism. No one is \nskeptical about tenure with experts in foreign policy now saying 20, \n30, 40 years, or a generation for sure. That is the kind of commitment \nthat we are talking about. Americans must also keep in mind, as Andrew \nBagevich wrote recently:\n\n       . . . success will not come without cost, in blood as well \n     as treasure. Once achieved, it will impose new burdens that \n     few Americans will welcome: the U.S. will inevitably bear the \n     chief responsibility for rebuilding and rehabilitating a \n     post-Milosevic Yugoslavia (Estimates for rebuilding the \n     Balkans already stands at over $30 billion.). Clinton, \n     Albright, Berger, et al., will retire to write their memoirs. \n     The rest of us will end up taking care of the broken \n     crockery.\n  It will be an enormous cost. It is a major commitment. We must ensure \nbefore we take that step that, in fact, this is a vital national \ninterest to us, and therefore worth it and we can do it. Nor should we \npull back, nor should we become isolationists. We do have a burden to \nbear as the leading democracy in the world and the remaining superpower \nin the world, but we must choose our fight well.\n  The other great question as to what would happen with the \nintroduction of American ground troops in Kosovo is the Russian \nquestion. I don't know the answer to that, but I know that we bet a lot \nthat they are bluffing; that we bet a lot when we say they will back \ndown; that they are more concerned about IMF loans than they are in \nbeing a major world power or player. But I do know this: They have \n20,000 nuclear warheads still, which cannot only be used but can be \nsold, and that threat is a serious one and I think arguably a more \nserious one than a bully boy in Serbia.\n  The issue of NATO's credibility comes up repeatedly in the United \nStates, and the argument is that it may have been unwise to go in. \nMaybe we shouldn't have taken this step. But we did. And now that we \nare in it, we have to win it because otherwise we lose credibility. How \nmany times have we heard advocates of escalation put forth the argument \nthat NATO's credibility is at stake?\n  At this time the near consensus among the foreign policy elite in \nWashington is that whatever the flaws of the original case for waging \nwar over Kosovo, there is no alternative to pressing on, even if it \nmeans sending in ground troops. The cost of not doing so, it is \ninsisted, would be prohibitive. But while it is certainly true that it \nwould be very high, that there would be a high cost of not winning it, \nthat in itself, in my estimation, is not a conclusive argument. The \nreal question is whether it would be higher than the cost of the \nalternatives. There will be a high cost if we exit the Balkans without \na clear and unambiguous victory, but we must weigh that against what \nthe cost will be if we go down that road and we then do not have a \nclear and unequivocal victory. That question is not as easy, and I \nsuggest to those who sincerely offer this resolution that is a serious \nissue for us to debate.\n\n  For ordinary Americans, the strongest argument for continuing is \nlikely to be to alleviate the condition of the Kosovar refugees. If you \nask most Americans why, that is their justification for being there. It \nis graphically demonstrated on television screens every night. The \nAmerican people are compassionate people and it is understandable and \ncommendable that they react to those scenes that way.\n  Senator Wellstone spoke earlier. It was the humanitarian disaster \nthat became the primary justification. When President Clinton speaks \nabout this war, it is primarily the humanitarian disaster that becomes \nthe rationale for our involvement. Yet, if that is our rationale, where \ndo we not go--because humanitarian disasters are occurring around the \nworld, oftentimes as a result of bitter ethnic civil wars. Can we ask \nthe American people to bear that burden and to introduce American \ntroops in all of those places?\n  In contrast to the reaction of the American people, for the foreign \npolicy establishment the overriding argument turns on the necessity to \nprotect America's and NATO's future credibility. If, having started the \nthing, we do not now prevail, the future costs all over the world in \nterms of emboldened thugs and rogue states will be steep.\n  While those arguments are both serious and valid, those arguments \nwere equally valid in 1965 when the question of how to proceed with \nrespect to Vietnam was the issue, and in the end the policy they gave \nrise to turned out to be not such a great idea.\n  This administration, I believe, needs to remember the ``Rule of \nHoles.'' If you find yourself in one, stop digging. To simply say that \nbecause we are there, we stumbled in or slipped in, because we are \nthere, we must now stay regardless of the cost, I think, is misguided \nthinking.\n  An infantry campaign in the Balkans will forever alter the unstable \npolitics of Russia, may well provide it with the organizing principle \nfor rearmament, and will most assuredly play into the hands of the \nultra nationalists. When we think about the cost in American \ncredibility, in NATO credibility, this alone will more than cancel out \nthe benefits of impressing potential enemies with our resolve, the fact \nthat we upset that balance of power in Russia. Anyone seriously \nplanning to challenge American interests will be unimpressed if America \nitself cannot clearly define where those interests are, and thus we \nindiscriminately squander our military assets.\n  It has been said nothing is more comforting to a soldier than to see \nthe enemy fire wildly and waste ammunition. We need to ensure that when \nwe go in, we go in with full force and that we have adequate \njustification from a national interest standpoint and that we have \nmarshalled the support of the American people.\n  I fear this resolution provides a carte blanche to the \nadministration. It is a blank check. It takes Congress out of the \nprocess too early. This would be a wrong step to take. If we should go \nin pursuit of a misguided policy and, if, then, NATO fractures, the \nconsensus is lost, and if at some future point we bail out of what we \nhave escalated to the point of ground troops, I suggest to my \ncolleagues that our long-term credibility would be damaged far more in \nthat circumstance than making the prudent decisions denying this \nconflict now.\n\n  I reluctantly, and with enormous respect for those whom I regard as \nAmerican heroes who are sponsoring this resolution, take exception to \ntheir principal position and will vote against the resolution before \nthe Senate today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself 30 seconds to thank Senator Hutchinson for \nhis principled stand and his articulation on his views.\n  I point out that former Secretary of State Eagleburger, who the \nSenator talked about in his remarks, has written a letter strongly \nsupporting this resolution and urging the vote on it. I hope that he \nand other opponents of this resolution recognize that every former \nSecretary of State, every former Secretary of Defense, every former \nNational Security Adviser, in both parties, support this resolution and \nsupport a strong vote on it.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nebraska such time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you. I wish to strongly endorse and \nsupport the McCain-Biden resolution. Mr. President, I'm an original \ncosponsor. I have listened this afternoon to my colleagues, who have \nall made significant contributions to this issue.\n  There are many complicating currents coursing through this very \ncomplicated issue. There are no good answers. But surely one of the \nanswers is not to not deal with this issue. We cannot escape our \nresponsibility in this body to debate this issue. We should have had \nthis debate weeks ago.\n  There are very significant consequences attached to what we're\n\n[[Page S4524]]\n\ndoing. We've heard some of those stated directly and very well from our \ncolleagues this afternoon. First, let's be clear on the making of war. \nIt is not risk-free. It is not antiseptic. It is not without \nuncertainty.\n  One not need read an awful lot of history to understand that. General \nEisenhower's comments and what he wrote and put in his pocket hours \nbefore the D-Day invasion in case D-Day failed. And he wrote out in \nlonghand a paragraph that said essentially, I take full responsibility \nfor the failure. So you see, as we look back even 50 years ago, we \nunderstand that war is uncertain.\n  But we also understand there are things worth going to war for, and \nthere are things worth dying for. Questions raised today will be \ncontinued to be raised about national interests of our country: Should \nwe be at war? All fair questions. Legitimate questions. But first we \nneed to talk about it, debate it, and ask the serious questions.\n  I've heard today, I've heard over the weeks all the reasons for \nfailure, all the complications, all the problems. Yet I hear at the \nsame time over here, well, we have to stop the slaughter and the ethnic \ncleansing. If we could just come together. But sometimes we just can't \ncome together. Sometimes there is no more talk. When people are being \nslaughtered at a rather considerable rate, and genocide is occurring, \nand ethnic cleansing is occurring, and people are being driven from \ntheir homes and their countries at an unprecedented rate, and the other \nside that we're trying to deal with continues to lie and cheat and \nkill--then we must face reality. What do we do now? The geopolitical \nconsequences, the humanitarian consequences involved in this are great. \nThey are deep. And they are serious.\n  I've heard some conversation today about this resolution taking the \nCongress out of play. This doesn't take the Congress out of play. The \npower of the purse still resides in the Congress of the United States. \nAnd no President surely would go forward unilaterally, arbitrarily, \nwithout confiding in, without reaching out to, without wanting the \nsupport of the Congress, and the American people. Why would you do \nthat? And certainly not this President.\n  I don't disagree with many of my colleagues, what they've said \ntoday--the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, Senator Hutchinson \nfrom Arkansas, Senator Wellstone from Minnesota,--about how this war \ninitially was conducted. How irresponsible it was to take off the table \ncertain of our military's abilities to wage this war. So what does that \ndo? Well, I think it's rather obvious what it's done. It's allowed this \ntyrant, this butcher, Milosevic, to go completely unimpeded and \nslaughter people and drive people out of Kosovo--without any pressure \non him other than withstanding the air war. And that's been antiseptic \nand that's been timid. So there's no question the conduct of this war \nfrom the beginning has been questionable.\n\n  There will be much time to debate the miscalculations and the \nmistakes and the problems. But the fact is we are in the middle of \nthis. Our actions will have consequences. There are other Milosevics \nout there.\n  If the word of this Nation, if the word of America--the most powerful \nnation on Earth, the most powerful nation for good--cannot be trusted, \nand NATO--the most effective peacekeeping organization in the history \nof man--if the word of that organization cannot be trusted, then what \nkind of a world are we going to be dealing with as we now move into \nthis dangerous new century?\n  We should think through this very carefully. All the problems that \nsurround this. We are forcing the President to lead. That's what this \nresolution's about. This resolution is not about abdicating our \nresponsibility in the Congress. Although some I suspect wish it be the \ncase.\n  We're asking the United States Senate to take a stand. What does this \ncountry come to--to ask a United States Senator to stand up and take \nsome responsibility for the Nation being at war?\n  This resolution is about getting the Congress involved in it. This \nresolution is about forcing the President to take some leadership and \nresponsibility.\n  Now, we're not going to pass this resolution. Senator McCain and I \nand others know the reality of that. But if we can make it a little \nuncomfortable for some people around here to have to deal with an \nuncomfortable issue, then that's worth it. I've never asked one of my \ncolleagues to support this resolution, nor has Senator McCain, nor has \nSenator Biden, or any of the other cosponsors. But we have asked them \nto take a look and debate it, and take a position and take a stand.\n  There are consequences to our actions, and there are consequences to \nour inactions. If we do not see this through the right way, we will \nleave the world more dangerous than it is today.\n  I happen to believe that the Balkans are in the national security \ninterest of this country for many reasons, aside from the humanitarian \ndynamics of this.\n  Do we really believe that the greatest, most noble, most free nation \non earth can stand aside and watch this butchering and act like it's \nnot there?\n  History has surely taught us that when you defer the tough decisions, \nwhen you let the butchers continue and the tyrants and dictators \ncontinue, it gets worse. And it has gotten worse with Milosevic. For \nten years we've dealt with him. Four wars he's started. He's lied and \ncheated and slaughtered all through those ten years. Don't we have some \nresponsibility to deal with this, as imperfect as all the options are?\n  Again I go back to my first point. As my friend, the sponsor of this \nresolution, John McCain, said earlier--and said it very well--we must \nunderstand something very clearly. Whatever you think of this \nPresident, this President is out of office in a year and a half. But \nthe Presidency remains. The vitalness of this Presidency, this \nExecutive branch that a new leader will inherit, must remain strong and \nmust be able to deal with an international crisis. So we must be very \ncareful not to take advantage of this weakened President.\n  And if that would ever happen--ladies and gentlemen, the world will \nnot be safer and it will not be better. When you weaken the United \nStates of America, you weaken all of freedom everywhere.\n  So it is, Mr. President, for those reasons that I will support this \nresolution. I think it is in the best interest of our country, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nWisconsin may consume.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my good friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, let me first express my feelings and those of the \nSenate and every American that we are so pleased that the three \nsoldiers are freed from their captivity in Yugoslavia. But I do \nreiterate what the administration and others have said. Mr. Milosevic \nand his cohorts should get absolutely no benefit out of those incidents \nthat led to the capture and then the release of these soldiers.\n  I hope no step we take or no comments we make today or at any point \nin the next few days suggest in any way that Mr. Milosevic deserves any \nkind of reward for undoing something that should not have been done in \nthe first place. We are terribly pleased that the soldiers are free. \nThat does not change what Mr. Milosevic has done, which is \nunforgivable.\n  I, of course, praise the main authors of this resolution, my friend \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain, and another good friend, Senator Hagel from \nNebraska. These are two of the best people to work with in this entire \nbody. I know that their goal and the goal of the other cosponsors is a \nvery worthy one, an important one, and that is to bring clarity with \nregard to our policy and our military action concerning Kosovo.\n  I rise today to make what I believe are two important points \nregarding S.J. Res. 20, the McCain-Biden resolution authorizing the use \nof force in the current conflict in Yugoslavia.\n  First, on the one hand, I oppose this resolution because I cannot at \nthis point wholly endorse the current means being employed by the \nPresident to carry out a still murky policy with regard to Kosovo, and \nI cannot, in light of that, expand the authority of the President \nthrough congressional action beyond our current vision and information \nand understanding, even of the facts today, let alone what the facts\n\n[[Page S4525]]\n\nmay be tomorrow or in a couple of weeks. This is why I cannot support \nthe resolution today.\n  On the other hand--and I think this is very important as well--I \nbelieve it is very important that the Senate debate this resolution \nnow, as we are doing, because whatever our divergent views on the \ncurrent crisis may be, we in Congress share a common set of duties \nunder the Constitution and under the War Powers Resolution to do what \nwe are attempting to do this afternoon. I begin by talking a little bit \nabout the process.\n  Our minds are primarily on the current intervention and involvement, \nand that is appropriate. We also have to take a moment at a time like \nthis to realize how this fits into the overall context of the role of \nCongress, the role of the Senate, with regard to the waging of war.\n  In certain respects, the process so far has established, or at least \nreiterated, important precedents. In some other ways, I regret that the \nSenate has at least partially ducked its weighty responsibilities in \nthis regard. There are precedents being set by the consideration of \nS.J. Res. 20.\n  Although it was apparently not the intent of the sponsors, S.J. Res. \n20 has been determined to be privileged under the terms of section 6 of \nthe War Powers Resolution. That is an important moment, because \nsometimes Presidents and others have attempted to not take the War \nPowers Resolution seriously. Not only must it be taken seriously, but \nbecause of the appropriate ruling of the Parliamentarian with regard to \nthe meaning of the War Powers Resolution, it is being taken seriously.\n  I would like to make note of the Parliamentarian's comments at \nFriday's meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on which I \nserve. Even Chairman Helms thought it was legally important enough to \nhave the Parliamentarian's opinion be made part of the record of that \nmeeting, and I thought it was as well.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a memo from Mr. Dove at the conclusion of my remarks. This is a \nmemo that I asked to be sent to me summarizing what the Parliamentarian \nconcluded on Friday. I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me just read to the Senate one sentence. The memo is dated April \n30.\n\n       The War Powers Resolution . . . controls the consideration \n     of any such joint resolution.\n\n  He was referring to the specific language of and the date of \nintroduction of the joint resolution that is before us.\n  Mr. President, that is important in terms of the history of the War \nPowers Resolution.\n  So while this resolution does not actually make a specific reference \nto the War Powers Resolution, the very fact that it triggered the \nprovisions of this law demonstrates the vitality--the vitality--of the \nWar Powers Resolution to a degree that I think is often forgotten or \nignored when we are between crises of this kind.\n  The determination by the Parliamentarian leaves no doubt that the \ndebate the Senate is engaged in today is an explicit and required \nexercise in war powers under the law of this country.\n  I am pleased about that. But I do have a few concerns about other \naspects of the process that we have undertaken.\n  First, I am concerned about the President's action. I remain \nconcerned that although the President did send a letter to the Congress \nacknowledging that hostilities had broken out, he did not submit the \nreport required under section 4(a) of the War Powers Resolution.\n  Now, nonetheless, as the Parliamentarian has ruled, the language of \nthe resolution still triggered the War Powers Resolution on its own. \nBut I believe it required, in a situation like this, the President \nto specifically refer to the War Powers Resolution. As a number of \npeople have said, obviously, we are at war, or certainly we are in a \nsituation that involves hostilities or imminent hostilities insofar as \nthe War Powers Resolution applies.\n\n  Second, I am concerned about the way the Senate has handled this \nmatter. The resolution, of course, has been hurriedly considered. That \nis in part because I do not think the authors intended, and many people \ndid not realize for a while, that the War Powers Resolution and its \nclock were ticking. So it was understandable that there had to be some \nhurry. But there was enough time, in my view, for a more thorough \nconsideration of this matter before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  A business meeting on this was hastily scheduled. There really was no \ntime to consider the matter except for a brief hour, hour and a half \ndiscussion. There was not really a proper markup. We did not have a \nchance to offer any amendments or modifications to the language of the \nresolution, which the distinguished chairman himself properly called \none of the most important matters that had ever been taken up by the \ncommittee in his tenure on the committee--which is a lengthy tenure. \nAnd then, after all of that, the committee reported out the resolution \nwithout recommendation, without taking a stand for or against the \nresolution. Then, finally, it was reported out to the full Senate \nwithout a written report.\n  I do not understand what the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is \nfor if it is not the committee which would take a real look at and \namend and mark up and consider, in some detail, a matter of this \nimportance. Again, given the tremendous courtesy and skill of the \nmembers of the committee, this is not said out of any disrespect. We \nwere put in a very difficult time constraint, but it seems somehow we \nshould have had a process that was more in keeping with the importance \nof the resolution and its role within the War Powers Resolution law.\n  Mr. President, I also was concerned last week that some Members were \ndiscussing propounding a unanimous consent agreement that threatened to \nweaken the force of the War Powers Resolution, or at least I was \nconcerned about the fact that it might do that, by making it easier to \neliminate the privileged status of future Senate actions related to war \npowers.\n  I want it noted in the record that the proposed unanimous consent \nagreement did not prevail. It was apparently not even propounded \nbecause of concerns. And I am pleased, because I do not think we should \ntake it upon ourselves to make exceptions or weaken the importance and \nbinding character of the War Powers Resolution. That has been attempted \nfar too many times in the past.\n  We need this law that was passed to give some real content and \nmeaning to the constitutional role of Congress under article I and \nthroughout the Constitution with regard to the conduct of war or \nhostilities by the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I also want to agree with some comments I at least \nread by the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, who, of course, is \ndoing a very, very brave job of leading this whole issue. He did \ncomment that this problem--and correct me if I am wrong, Senator--that \nthis is not really a long enough debate for a matter of this \nimportance. Four hours, split between the two sides, 2 hours each, is \nnot in keeping with the magnitude of this situation or the magnitude of \nthis resolution.\n  In fact, although I am certainly sometimes guilty of not always being \nout here on the Senate floor, the fact that I have only seen five or \nsix Senators on the floor for what is soon to be over half of the \nentire debate on this matter does not remind me of the effort and the \ncare and the listening that went into a similar debate when it came to \nthe Iraq intervention some 8 years ago.\n\n  So the debate surely should be longer. And as Senators start arriving \nand hope to find time to speak before 5:30, I think there may be some \nfrustration. In any event, we certainly should all be listening to each \nother when it comes to a matter of this importance, as much as we were \nduring the impeachment trial.\n  Mr. President, finally, I also am a little troubled about the idea of \nthe tabling of this resolution. A motion to table can be interpreted--\noften is interpreted--as a procedural vote. On something this \nimportant, we should be voting on the merits of the language. I do not \nunderstand why at 5:30 tonight we are not going to just vote up or down \non this resolution.\n\n[[Page S4526]]\n\n  A tabling motion seems, to me, to be not in keeping with the \nsignificance of this. Mr. President, as I have indicated, in the past \nthe War Powers Resolution has sometimes been ignored, but sometimes we \nhave come very close to getting it right.\n  Two examples where we came close were the Lebanon intervention and \nthe 1990-1991 Iraqi situation. In the Lebanon case, Congress actually \nauthorized continued participation of Marines in the multinational \npeacekeeping force. Although the 18-month duration of the authorization \nrepresented a compromise to get the administration to agree to it, the \ncongressional authorization represented the first time since the War \nPowers Resolution had become law where Congress obtained a signature by \nthe President on legislation that actually invoked the War Powers \nResolution, and also, as I just alluded to a moment ago, with regard to \nIraq and the Persian Gulf.\n  In the case of that war, President Bush actually requested \ncongressional support, which ended up being granted. There was a \nproblem in that case. That request, of course, came significantly after \nPresident Bush had already deployed thousands of troops to the area, \nbut at least the President of the United States, in that situation, \nexplicitly acknowledged the applicability of the law in that case.\n  So despite my concerns--that I did think were important to put in the \nrecord for future reference in situations like this--in the end, \nconsideration of this resolution remains an appropriate exercise of the \nSenate's responsibilities under the War Powers Resolution. We have \nbegun to do our duty, and the vitality of the War Powers Resolution has \nagain been affirmed and respected.\n  President, as I said, although I would have preferred to vote up or \ndown on the merits of the Senate joint resolution, I will support the \nmotion to table this resolution because I do not support the scope of \nthe resolution and I have real doubts about the policy which it seeks \nto endorse. Especially given the breadth of the authority that is given \nunder the resolution I am concerned. But I have concerns about the \npolicy in Kosovo in any event.\n  First, Mr. President, I do not understand how this decision to \nintervene in Kosovo and to continue and broaden the intervention really \nfits in with an overall post-cold war American foreign policy strategy. \nI do not see how this fits in with our long-term goals.\n  Obviously, the tragedies and the horrors that are being perpetrated \nin Kosovo demand a response. That response must include the United \nStates. But I do not think the question has been well answered why in \nKosovo and not in other places. I give the Senator from Nebraska credit \nfor just attempting to address the issue. He spoke a little bit about \nhis belief that it would be difficult for us to act in some of the \nplaces in Africa and other places where there are similar tragedies. I \nam not sure I agree with that. We are not limited in our ability to act \nonly in Europe or only near our own boundaries, especially in light of \nthe actions that were taken with regard to the Middle East and Iraq. We \nhave shown our ability to act throughout the world. The fact is, in my \nmind we could have acted in Rwanda. In fact, we apologized to Rwanda \nfor having not taken the action that we could have taken to stop the \ngenocide in that place.\n  In Rwanda, in Sierra Leone, in East Timor, in Sudan, there are \natrocities that are comparable, in some cases arguably worse, if that \nis possible, than what is going on in Kosovo. Why is it that--it at \nleast appears to some--an accident of geography is sufficient to allow \ninaction while Kosovo requires a huge commitment? This question needs \nto be answered not so much for me but for the American people, because \nthey do not understand, and I do not understand exactly why one tragedy \ndemands our attention and our action and another one simply does not, \nespecially when it comes to the use of significant military force.\n  Another concern, the Senator from Nebraska was suggesting, in effect, \nis that we must take a stand. He is right, but he assumes this is the \nonly option when he says we must support this resolution. Otherwise, he \nseems to say, we would have to be accused of taking no action, or we \nwould be accused of being unconcerned or not moved by what is happening \nin Kosovo.\n  I am not sure all the other options have truly been explored. What \nabout the possibility of arming the Albanian Kosovars so they have a \nbetter and legitimate chance at their own self-defense? The Secretary \nof State said to me at a hearing recently that they wouldn't be able to \ndo much with the arms anyway. I question that. I bet the Kosovar \nAlbanians would question that. I even remember a briefing the other day \nby some of the NATO officials indicating that resistance from some of \nthe Kosovar Albanians had had a negative impact on the Serbian troops. \nThis is something that we should encourage rather than simply allow \npeople to be herded around and tortured. They have a right to self-\ndefense like anyone else.\n\n  What about support for democratic elements in Serbia, as has been \nsuggested by some of our colleagues in the recently introduced Serbian \nDemocracy Act? Are there further diplomatic efforts that could be \ntaken? What about the United Nations? Have we fully explored all of the \noptions available working with Russia?\n  It is not so clear to me that the only way to proceed is to give a \nbroad, open-ended blank check to the President with regard to this \nsituation. I don't think it is the only option.\n  I am also concerned how this fits in with our overall policy just \nwith respect to the Balkans. I am amazed at how infrequently in this \ndebate people even refer to the fact that we are still stuck in the \nBosnia intervention. We were promised at the time of the Bosnia \nintervention that it would be 1 year, that the troops would be home by \nDecember 1996, that it would cost no more than $2 billion. But here we \nare, in 1999, it has cost, I am told, over $9 billion. We no longer \neven hear any talk about when the troops will come home. It is \nChristmas after Christmas after Christmas after the time when all of \nour troops were supposed to be out of Bosnia.\n  How does this policy in Kosovo connect with the policy in Bosnia? \nWhat is the strategy for getting in and for getting out? Sometimes I \nbelieve with respect to what we are doing in Bosnia, the \nadministration's policy is sort of a ``less said the better'' attitude. \nIf you don't mention it, nobody is going to remind you that we have \nbeen there for an awfully long time and have not been able to get out.\n  I am also concerned, and I say this carefully, about what I consider \nto be a somewhat inconsistent application of international law by the \nadministration with regard to this action. Again, I have no sympathy \nfor Mr. Milosevic and his regime. But the fact is, our country \nrecognizes Kosovo as being part of Yugoslavia, and yet we proceed with \nthis action without a real explanation of how this comports with the \nrules of international law. I can tell you, most experts in \ninternational don't have a good explanation of how we can go about \ndoing this.\n  It would be one thing if we were talking about recognizing an \nindependent Kosovo, but we have not taken that position. I asked the \nSecretary of State the other day whether that might be in the offing, \nand she indicated that was not a likely scenario. In the same \nconversation, I asked her, what about lifting the arms embargo on the \nAlbanian Kosovars? She said we couldn't do that because of \ninternational law. Well, this is sort of a cavalier attitude, where we \nrely on international law as an excuse to not do something we should do \nin one case, the case of lifting the arms embargo, but we disregard \ninternational law or suggest that it is a technicality when it comes to \nthe idea of not recognizing an area separate from Serbia and then going \nahead and proceeding to take military action with what our own policy \napparently regards as, in effect, a province of Serbia. This troubles \nme.\n\n[[Page S4527]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Albright's comments in this \nregard from an April 20, 1999, hearing of the Senate Committee on \nForeign Relations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Excerpts From Hearing, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, April 20, \n                                  1999\n\n       Senator Russell Feingold. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madame \n     Secretary, I've been critical of some of the decisions that \n     have been made getting into this policy, so let me take his \n     opportunity to publicly thank you for your devotion and \n     effort with regard to this. I'm sure it's incredibly \n     difficult, and I thank you for it.\n       In light of what's happened, are there any circumstances \n     under which the administration would support an independent \n     Kosovo?\n       Secretary Albright. I think that we do not consider it a \n     useful end to this because of the additional problems that it \n     would cause within the region, where the--we see it as \n     potentially destabilizing Albania and Macedonia, then if \n     Macedonia were to fall apart, there's a whole--I don't want \n     to predict all the dire things, but I think it basically is a \n     destabilizing effect for the region, and it is not our \n     position to support independence.\n       Senator Feingold. Well, I'm still thinking it through as \n     well, but I do hope the administration will at least keep an \n     open mind with regard to whether that is not the way things \n     should end up. And this relates as well to Senator Dodd's \n     comments. I take a little different tack, at least \n     potentially, with regard to the issue of arming the Kosovar \n     Albanians. I think one of the reasons that we ended up having \n     to send ground troops to Bosnia was the failure of the United \n     States to lift the arms embargo for the Bosnian Muslims when \n     we could have. And I notice that we are there many years and \n     many dollars more than we intended to be.\n       I recognize your comment about the arms embargo that's in \n     place.\n       At the same time, I wonder about our legal status in terms \n     of bombing a nation with regard to a question having to do \n     with an area that we consider part of that nation, in terms \n     of international law. I'm wondering why in the one instance \n     we are so concerned about an international arms embargo, but \n     we are not particularly concerned about the issues of \n     international law that apply to a situation where we regard \n     Kosovo as part of Serbia.\n       So, what I'm interested in is what would be the practical \n     effect, on the ground, of arming the Kosovar Albanians?\n       Secretary Albright. Well, the practical effect is that they \n     still--their numbers are not sufficient so that they can \n     defend themselves. Two, and this goes to why are we nice \n     about one legal regime and not another, it's a practical \n     issue, which is that in both the Bosnia case and here the \n     minute that you break an arms embargo it means that the other \n     side is entitled to be also supplied, and I think that we \n     have great concern about the Serb--breaking the arms embargo \n     because the Serbs would definitely be supplied.\n       I think there is also the effect that we are part of an \n     alliance and this is in Europe, and the Europeans are very \n     much opposed, as are we, to the arming of the KLA and to the \n     independence.\n       Senator Feingold. Madame Secretary, with regard to Bosnia, \n     I believe that at least one of the factors that helped us \n     leading up to Dayton was the ability of the Bosnian Muslims, \n     through different means, to get greater arms, and I am not at \n     all convinced that this situation wouldn't be assisted. In \n     fact, in listening to one of the NATO briefings the other \n     day, I think there was a specific reference to some of the \n     resistance that the Kosovar Albanians were able to put up as \n     helpful with regard to fighting the Serbian troops. So I \n     would ask that that be kept on the table.\n       And finally, I notice that Congressman Campbell in the \n     house has introduced two separate resolutions, one to declare \n     war and the other to demand an immediate retreat. I am glad \n     that the senators who have talked earlier today have \n     introduced a resolution in the Senate with regard to our \n     involvement. And I'm wondering, in light of your answer to \n     Senator Hagel's question, whether we're really at war. You \n     seem to have indicated that we are not, at this point. What \n     criteria would need to be met in order for you to agree with \n     those who believe that our action in Kosovo amounts to a war \n     or could amount to a war in the near future?\n       Secretary Albright. I think that a lot of those are legal \n     questions. I think that politically, though, there are a \n     number of reasons why a declaration of war is not helpful in \n     terms of how we operate in the region and with our allies, \n     and so we are opposed to a declaration of war.\n       Senator Feingold. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would like to make just a couple other points \nregarding my concern about supporting this resolution with respect to \nthe substance of it, with respect to the intervention itself.\n  This is almost a cliche--almost every Member of the Congress has said \nit--but it is still correct; that is, that our strategy is unclear. I \ndon't believe the administration has fully articulated the policy which \nthe airstrikes were intended to support.\n  I did oppose the airstrikes. I recognize the Senate voted for them. \nBut I didn't see the policy at the time. The goals need to be explained \nmore fully and a better case needs to be made for our continued \nmilitary involvement. Certainly, if we are going to pass a resolution \nof this scope, we need a far clearer understanding. I don't think the \nPresident has adequately explained the national interest and objectives \nand cost estimates and exit strategy in this situation.\n  Finally, with regard to concerns in terms of whether this is a course \nwe should follow, I have to share the view of the Senator from \nArkansas, who indicated that this argument, that maybe we made a \nmistake in the first place but we have to finish it now that we are \nthere, is really a terrible argument. It is a dangerous situation--we \nhave been there before--to suggest that simply because we have gotten \ninto a situation that we have to go full bore into it without really \nbeing sure of how far it will go or what the ultimate consequences \nwould be. The mere fact that we started it does not mean we have to \ntake every possible step in pursuit of a policy that had flaws from the \nbeginning.\n  In any event, after having listed five or six concerns about the \nsubstance of this intervention, let me conclude by making just a couple \nof comments about the fact that the resolution itself is too broad, \neven if it did support what we are doing exactly in Kosovo at this \ntime. I am pleased the Senate is considering a resolution that would \nauthorize the use of military force, but the resolution before us today \ndoes not define parameters of what that military involvement would be. \nThe phrase ``blank check'' is appropriate. That is what this resolution \nprovides. I think it would be irresponsible, very similar to what \nhappened with regard to the Gulf of Tonkin in the Vietnam situation, if \nwe go down this road.\n  As we think about taking this very extensive measure, let us remember \nthat there is a lack of consensus among the American people and the \nCongress about the policy to pursue with regard to Kosovo. Even under \nthe current facts and circumstances that the American people know and \nthat we know, this resolution is too broad. But given its breadth and \nthe implications, we have no idea what the position will be in a few \nweeks, and this resolution gives a blank check.\n  We do have to take a stand. This Senate did take a stand in favor of \nthe bombing a few weeks ago, even though I voted no. But the fact is, \nonly this body supported the airstrikes. Last week the other body, on a \ntie vote, 213 to 213, voted not to support the airstrikes, after having \nwatched the impact and the effects of the airstrikes for the last \nmonth. So there is no joint resolution by this Congress at any point in \nsupport of even the airstrikes. There is no resolution of the kind that \nwent through the House and the Senate in the Iraq intervention. Yes, \nthat was a close vote in the Senate with regard to Iraq, but the \ndifference is, both Houses sent that up to the President as a \nreflection of the will of Congress.\n  I share some of the concerns with regard to some of the votes in the \nother body. I do recognize that it is very hard to understand how some \npeople can vote not to go forward with this action and then in the next \nminute vote to put additional funding in for the action. That is very \nconfusing as well.\n  What I am afraid it reflects is that there is no consensus in the \nCongress or in the country with regard to what we have already done in \nKosovo, let alone a consensus that would justify the sweeping language \nthat we find before us today.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I will vote to table the resolution \nbecause we should not rush into further steps in this matter, including \ndeployment of forces, without a consensus in Congress, without a plan \nfrom the administration, and without some sense of how this decision to \nintervene in this tragedy fits into the broader question of what our \nforeign policy should be in the post-cold-war era, when we are \nconfronted with human tragedy around the world.\n  Let me finally say that I thank the sponsors because they have \ntriggered events that have allowed us today to exercise our roles to \nreaffirm the vitality and continuing need for the War\n\n[[Page S4528]]\n\nPowers Resolution and the obligations of Congress and the President to \ncomply with them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Senator Feingold\n     From: Bob Dove\n     Re: War Powers\n     Date: April 30, 1999\n\n       The Foreign Relations Committee met today on S. J. Res. \n     20--106th Cong., introduced by Senator McCain.\n       The War Powers Resolution (P.L. 93-148) controls the \n     consideration of any such joint resolution.\n\n               Questions raised at Committee Meeting 4/30\n\n       1. Is a privileged joint resolution under the War Powers \n     Resolution subject to a motion to table? Yes, and such a \n     motion would carry with it any amendment then pending.\n       2. Would adoption of an amendment that stated that ``this \n     resolution shall not be privileged under the War Powers \n     Resolution'' kill the privilege. No. That language is not \n     effective until enactment (no bootstrapping). What about \n     language that cuts off funds, text of H.R. 1569 as passed by \n     House on April 28, 1999? Yes it would. That language is as \n     follows:\n\n     PROHIBITION ON USE OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FUNDS FOR \n                   DEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES GROUND FORCES TO \n                   THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA WITHOUT \n                   SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATION BY LAW.\n\n       (a) In General.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available to the Department of Defense may be \n     obligated or expended for the deployment of ground elements \n     of the United States Armed Forces in the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia unless such deployment is specifically authorized \n     by a law enacted after the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--The prohibition in subsection \n     (a) shall not apply with respect to the initiation of \n     missions specifically limited to rescuing United States \n     military personnel or United States citizens in the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia or rescuing military personnel of \n     another member nation of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a \n     result of operations as a member of an air crew.\n\n       3. What is the meaning of subsections 6(a), and (b)? \n     (Section 6 is codified at 50 U.S.C. 1545). Subsection 6(a) \n     requires referral to the Foreign Relations Committee, and \n     requires the committee to report ``one such joint resolution \n     or bill'' by day 36 after the report of the President (or \n     after President should have reported); section 6(b) provides \n     that such joint resolution or bill ``so reported shall become \n     the pending business of the House in question . . . and shall \n     be voted on within three calendar days thereafter . . .''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield myself 60 seconds.\n  Madam President, I will next yield to Senator Lugar for such time as \nhe may consume. I tell my colleagues that the list I have after him is \nSenator Boxer for 10 minutes, Senator Specter for 15 minutes, Senator \nHutchison of Texas for 30 minutes, Senator Gorton for 10 minutes. We \nalso have requests from Senators Shelby, Inhofe, Domenici, Lieberman, \nBiden and Kerry of Massachusetts. I ask my colleagues to come over and \nget in the queue as they can.\n  Clearly, with that number of speakers, I think it would be both \ninappropriate and unfortunate if we had a tabling motion before every \nSenator who wishes to speak would be allowed to speak on this issue. I \nwill strongly resist an effort to table before every Senator who wants \nto speak on this very important issue can do so. I remind my colleagues \nthat in the case of the Persian Gulf resolution, there were two \nopposing resolutions, with two up-or-down votes, and a full day of \ndebate. On Bosnia, there were opposing measures by Senators Dole and \nHutchison of Texas, with separate up-and-down votes, and a full day of \ndebate on final passage. We are not giving this resolution nearly the \nattention the previous resolutions got.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from Indiana, \nSenator Lugar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I thank the distinguished sponsor of this \nlegislation, Senator McCain, for yielding to me. I congratulate him on \nthe resolution. I will advocate that the Senate should affirm the \nMcCain resolution. Certainly, we should not table the resolution.\n  Madam President, a week after the war began, I wrote in the \nWashington Post:\n\n       We are losing the war in Kosovo. President Slobodan \n     Milosevic and his Serbian Armed Forces are killing Kosovar \n     political leaders, expelling Kosovars from their homes, and \n     causing a flow of refugees into countries with few resources \n     to care for them. The United States and NATO have the \n     capacity to reverse this situation, but this will require \n     presidential leadership and a commitment to taking the hard \n     steps necessary to win.\n\n  I wrote, additionally, in the same column:\n\n       President Clinton still has the chance, as our Commander in \n     Chief, to produce victory, even if what he advocated was \n     based on a hopelessly incomplete vision of the end game and a \n     dubious strategy to reach even severely limited aims.\n\n  Madam President, I wrote that on April 1--a month ago--and the \nsituation is identical to that which I described then. We have an \nopportunity to win the war. We have an opportunity to come to the \nlimited objective the President has listed, but this will require very, \nvery substantial Presidential leadership, hard decisions on the part of \nour President, and support of those decisions by the American people, \nas represented by this Congress.\n  I come today not to argue procedure. I regret, as others do, that we \nare in a predicament of a 4-hour debate, and a tabling motion was \nannounced in the national press. The leadership of both parties will \nadvocate tabling and disposing of this resolution, thus ending the \nchapter until, presumably, a more appropriate time to discuss Kosovo. \nBut I come not to lament that fact. It is part of our circumstances, \nand we shall have the vote in due course and I will vote ``no'' on the \nmotion to table.\n  I come today not to argue whether we should specifically authorize \nthe President to use air power, as they have done in the House by a \n213-213 vote, to temporize on that issue, not on the issue of ground \nforces, nor whether we have to be consulted before there are ground \nforces, or any other forces.\n  We are presently talking about a situation in which the President has \nset forth some very limited objectives. In my judgment, we have very \nlittle hope of meeting those limited objectives, and that translates \ninto defeat for the United States of America, and for NATO. People talk \nabout whether this is the right war, the war we were preparing for, \nwhoever that may have been. We are in a war. It is a big war. It is the \nonly war NATO ever had. It is an occasion for the North Atlantic treaty \nalliance to work, or for it to fail.\n\n  While we can fault our President and others while putting NATO at \nstake, and we can fault the President for failing to have the resources \nprepared; for a faulty diplomacy that produced one threat after \nanother, which required some follow-through for credibility; for \nfailure to say from the beginning we have to plan for every potential \nuse of our resources, and we are doing so because we are intent upon \ncoming to the right result.\n  All of that might have occurred. But, it did not. As I pointed out on \nApril 1, it had not happened then, and it hasn't occurred since. But \nwhat has occurred is a very clear statement of objectives, and they \nare: the retreat, the withdrawal, the end of Serbian forces in Kosovo--\nout, all 43,000 of them, whether they are police, special police, \nregular armed forces, or paramilitary forces--these are the people, \nthese particular Serbians, who, in fact, are killing people in Kosovo \nand expelling those they do not kill from their homes and their \ncountry. So, the first objective is all of these forces must leave \nKosovo.\n  The second objective is the Kosovars must be allowed back in. There \nmust be a condition in which people who have lost their loved ones, who \nhave watched atrocities, who have suffered grievously and lost their \nidentities, their bank accounts, their houses, to go back into their \ncountry where there has to be an international security force in which \nthey believe--not in which we believe or that we temporize with others, \nand say a little bit of this or that country, a little balance here and \nthere. The question will be: Do the Kosovars believe in it? Will they \ngo back? If they do not, they are going to be in Macedonia, Albania, \nand increasingly in Italy, Germany, everywhere, spilling out all over \nEurope, hundreds of thousands of souls who require support--expensive \npeople, people who could destabilize the economies and the governments \nof the host countries that have been so generous.\n  We have barely a month of humanitarian relief, and we understand how \ntragic it is for those people, how expensive and dangerous it is for \nthe countries in the surrounding area. That has\n\n[[Page S4529]]\n\nalready happened. You cannot walk away from that. We can take a \nresolution today and say this wasn't our war and we are tired of it or \nthat we are bored with it or, as a matter of fact, we don't even want \nto participate anymore. But for the suffering people that are a \nconsequence of this conflict, there is no walking away, and the \nconsequences for us, for Europe, for NATO, for our Armed Forces morale, \nfor civilian leadership intersecting with the Armed Forces, are very \ngreat.\n  So I am saying that you have to have an international force that \ngives confidence enough to the people who have lost almost everything \nto go back. There has to be money to pay for the houses they go back \nto, for the lights and the water, and the possibilities of making a \nliving, and of some safety net of economic support while all that is \nhappening.\n  Who will pay for that? Congressional leaders asked the President. He \nsaid the Europeans will take the preponderant share of that. I hope \nthat is true. I hope the President has worked that out, or has broached \nthat, or at least has some assurance of exactly how burdensharing will \ngo--for humanitarian purposes or military purposes. This is terribly \nimportant and very expensive, and lying directly ahead, either in \nKosovo, in Macedonia, Albania, or other countries.\n  Madam President, after these expelled people get back and the money \nis spent--and we hope to do much of this before the cold weather \ncomes--as the President has pointed out with regard to the bombing \nraids in September and October--then at this point, negotiations \nproceed on the tortuous path on what kind of democracy in Kosovo, \nwithin the constraints of an autonomous province of Serbia but \nprotected by an international force sufficiently strong, armed, and \ncredible to the Kosovars so that they will come back and try to rebuild \ntheir country. That will be a very difficult negotiation.\n  If you were a Kosovar who had gone through all of this--and there are \npeople advocating independence--the siren song of independence is \npretty strong. Yet European countries all around are advocating no \nindependence; that is not on the table. As the President has outlined \nour objective, independence is not on the table. It is autonomy, where \npeople think about self-government within constraints.\n  Those are the objectives, narrow as they may be. Madam President, we \nhad all better be giving a lot of thought as to how they might be met.\n  I believe that the McCain resolution is important because it says to \nthe President, ``Mr. President, take all necessary ways and means to \nwin, to find your objective, the objectives now shared by 18 other NATO \nallies.'' It is important that the President do that.\n  Normally, there might be a situation in which the President had \nplanned for several months before the war in Kosovo to preposition \nequipment, to consider ground troops in Europe in addition to air \nresources, and other provisions, including provisions for humanitarian \nfallout that might occur. Ideally, all of that might have happened. But \nit didn't happen. As a matter of fact, the nation's attention was not \non Kosovo, except from time to time throughout this period of time. And \ncertainly there were no Presidential messages to the American people \nindicating the gravity of the situation, and very little debate here on \nthe floor of the Senate. So that planning might have happened. But it \ndid not.\n  We are now in a predicament where we are in a very large war, where \nthe consequences are very great. We have limited objectives, but, in my \njudgment--I have expressed this candidly and personally to the \nPresident--we do not have the means to achieve those objectives. We \nhave not had the means from the very beginning of the operation.\n  In his defense, the President stoutly affirms that the bombing \ncampaign will do it, that you can get to those objectives with the \nbombing campaign alone. He would also add, some helpful information \ngetting into a Serbia--some better control of that situation will be \nhelpful. So would help by the Russians--and help by anybody, for that \nmatter. But, nevertheless, the President from the beginning said no \nground forces. He has followed up and said, ``I am not even planning \nfor ground forces.'' He has almost taken pride in saying there will be \nno planning for ground forces; it is the bombing campaign.\n  I have said to the President respectfully, ``Mr. President, you have \nto have at least plan B. There has to be a safety net. We cannot suffer \nfailure. You cannot suffer failure.'' There may be some Members of \nCongress--we read about these people in the paper who say, ``This is \nPresident Clinton's war, and when he falls flat on his face, that is \nhis problem. He deserves it, having ill prepared for this, having very \nlittle strategy that seems to be relevant to getting the job done.''\n\n  Madam President, we got over that very rapidly. This is not the \nPresident falling on his face. It is not a personal failure of the \nPresident. We are in a war. The United States is at war--not President \nClinton.\n  I think what Senator McCain, Senator Hagel, Senator Biden, and others \nhave been saying in essence is, ``Mr. President, we need a much broader \nstrategy. We need more options.''\n  I have said specifically we need, at a minimum, a public declaration \nthat we are planning ground options--lots of them. We don't know what \nthe situation will be on the ground 5 months from now, but we had \nbetter have some options, and it had been better be apparent we are \ndoing that, for our own credibility.\n  Furthermore, we could preposition supplies and equipment \nconspicuously so forces can get there, as opposed to constantly saying \nit will be weeks or months before we can do anything as an excuse for \nnot doing so.\n  I am advised that the American people in various polls have a low \ntolerance for casualties. Some people have crassly suggested: What if \n100 Americans lost their lives? Would you still be in favor of the war? \nWould you be in favor of ground forces? How about 200 or 500? At what \npoint do you say, after America loses, we leave; that is an \nunacceptable set of circumstances?\n  In polls, however, it may test the political courage of the \nPresident, or any of us. If the President is failing even to say, ``I \nwill think about planning for the ground option,'' because he is \nreading polls that say that is very unpopular, very unacceptable, then \nthe President needs to get over that too, as we do here on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  We are talking now about the fate of our country--our credibility \nwith regard to foreign policy and the Armed Forces. We can say, \nregardless of Kosovo, we are ready for the real war, or the big war, or \nwhatever war comes along. But, Madam President, with what? What kind of \npolitical will? What kind of ability to pull this country together, and \nCongress, and the people? What kind of ability to keep the alliance \ntogether with some credibility that we are for real, and that when we \ngo to war, we go to win? And having set the objectives, knowing very \nclearly what they are, we have to get to the point of winning.\n  The McCain resolution is tremendously important, because it simply \nsays, ``Mr. President, you have got to do more--a lot more. You have to \nlead. You have to have a strategy that finally says to whomever--\nPresident Milosevic and anybody else--we are going to win, we are going \nto prevail, the United States means it.''\n  If we are not prepared to give the President that support, if our \ndebate degenerates into the fact that: ``Mr. President, we would like \nfor you to win. We would like for the alliance to be credible. But do \nwe think everything doesn't really work? We certainly don't want to do \nthe ground forces option. We are not really sure about the money, the \nhumanitarian relief, if the Europeans don't do their share. And we \nhaven't worked it out with them. As a matter of fact, we don't know why \nwe are there and why we got there, and we don't really want to know. We \nare tired of hearing about the history of this part of the world over \nthe past thousand years. What we really want to know now is \nspecifically, how do we get out of a bad dream?''\n  As Senators, we are not movie critics. We are not taking a look at a \nscenario which is a bad dream. We have a responsibility, and the \nresponsibility today is to vote no. The responsibility is to say that \nit is not simply the President who is responsible--the President's war, \nthe President's plan, the President's request that, if somehow he is \ninadequate, we simply affirm\n\n[[Page S4530]]\n\nthat and say how sad that he is inadequate.\n  Madam President, if we lose the war, the fact is, the Congress is \ninadequate. We also are elected by the people. We also have a \nconstitutional responsibility and, when it comes to war, a \nresponsibility to win. If the President needs shoring up, that may be \nour job. If the President needs concerted advice and support, we ought \nto provide it.\n  There could be other resolutions today, but we have in front of us a \nbig one.\n  It does not come as a surprise that Senator McCain's resolution has \nbeen well debated throughout the country, even if not here. What will \nbe a surprise today, Madam President, is if Senators, Members of this \nbody, are prepared to take some responsibility as opposed to arguing, \nas I have already heard, that the resolution is too broad, too \nsweeping, a blank check for a President in whom many Senators are not \ncertain they have confidence to prosecute the war.\n  These are useful rationalizations before a war but not in the middle \nof one. It is a war, not just an exercise; however divorced it may be \nfrom our lives, that is not the case for those who are involved.\n  I am hopeful we will vote no on the tabling motion. I propose that we \nleave the options open to the President. I propose that as opposed to \nproscriptive motions--that, in the future we offer advice as to how we \ncan help the President and we try to affirm that certain things should \nbe done, as opposed to taking off the table the necessary means that he \nmay need.\n  In response to my colleague from Pennsylvania, I am happy to yield \nfor a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Indiana. I passed a note to \nthe Senator because I did not want to interrupt the chain of thought.\n  I think there is no one in this Chamber who carries greater respect \nthan Senator Lugar on issues of foreign policy. I noted your comments \nearlier calling for Presidential leadership and referring to your op-ed \npiece which appeared in the Washington Post. I think it not \ninappropriate to comment at this time that the President noted your op-\ned piece in the Washington Post at a meeting with you, Senator Warner, \nand myself in attendance. We were the last three to meet with the \nPresident in a very extraordinary meeting that lasted a little over 2 \nhours. At the very end of the meeting, Senator Warner, Senator Lugar, \nand myself stayed and he commented about your op-ed piece.\n  The Senator made a comment, again referring to your op-ed piece, that \nthe President has a dubious strategy to meet a limited goal.\n  The problem that I have, which leads to my question, is the \nPresident's leadership. He has initiated the airstrikes along with NATO \nwithout a clear-cut strategy, and an overused word, the so-called end \ngame. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the \nNational Security Advisor speculated that Milosevic might relent after \nthe first wave; that there might be a pause; that they might have a \ndifferent attitude after there was some substantial damage done.\n  Absent a relenting on the part of Milosevic, where do we go from \nhere? In lengthy meetings--the President has now had four with \nMembers--the President has not asked for troops nor has he asked for \nthe authority which is present in the pending resolution to allow him \nto use whatever force is necessary.\n  The question I have for my distinguished colleague: In light of the \nabsence of any request by the President and in the absence of any \nshowing of leadership by the President and acknowledging the \ncorrectness of Senator Lugar's assertion that the situation calls for \nPresidential leadership, why is it sensible to, in effect, give the \nPresident a blank check when he has not asked for the resources and has \nnot demonstrated any capability to exercise leadership to effectively \ncarry out that broad guarantee of authority?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I respond briefly to my colleague that I believe the \nPresident must begin to offer that leadership, that he must begin to \noffer the strategy. I find it unacceptable if we were, as critics of \nthe President, simply to note that he has failed to do so.\n  In other words, it seems to me there is about this war a sense of \nunreality. Clearly, if we had been in the so-called cold war period and \nwe were at war with another country at that point, and the President \napparently did not have an adequate strategy and we were losing, it \nwould not be a useful question to ask why the President hasn't asked \nfor what he needs. We have to say at that point that the President \nneeds to ask.\n\n  We respectfully request the President to accept some advice and to \naccept some strategy that we have a responsibility to offer.\n  Simply left to an inadequate President, history would condemn him, \nbut we would lose and the country would suffer grievous harm. That is \nour predicament in this situation. The President clearly hasn't asked \nfor the authority, the arms, or whatever he needs. We are saying he \nneeds to ask, and he needs to do so rapidly. We cannot sit around and \nsimply wish that he did so and then lament that he failed to ask. We \nhave a responsibility to act along with him. I hope and pray that he \nwill do that.\n  I think the President, in this conversation the Senator cited, \nindicated he could ask General Shelton and General Shelton could \nproduce a plan. In fact, allied armed services could be over there \nabout 5 months and the President felt that might win the war.\n  We need to define very carefully, if that is the case, what the \nground forces' objectives are, where they come in, and include all the \noptions. In other words, that was a rather sweeping statement, but it \nhas gone through the President's mind and what we are suggesting might \nhave some impact.\n  I hope this debate pushes that forward.\n  I thank the Senator for his question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \ncontrol the time until such time as an opponent of the resolution \narrives. At that time, I will control the time for the proponents of \nthe resolution, and at a later time a designee of the opponents of the \nresolution will be designated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \nindulgence. He has been very patient as Members have debated--many \nspeaking against his resolution. He has been very generous in his \nattitude toward all Members. I greatly appreciate it.\n  I rise this afternoon to debate the resolution that is before the \nSenate and to also join with all Americans in rejoicing that the three \nprisoners of war have been released and have been united with their \nfamilies.\n  One of these young men, Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, is a constituent of mine \nfrom Los Angeles. I spoke with his mother a few days ago before we knew \nhis release was a possibility. I know how she felt. I heard in her \nvoice the terror of the situation. We are all relieved.\n  I say today to all the families, you did the right thing by coming \nforward, by continuing to look into the cameras when it was difficult \nfor you; yet because you did that, you put the human face on these \nyoung men. That was very, very helpful. I thank Jesse Jackson for \nworking to secure the release of these brave soldiers.\n  The irony of the situation is that Milosevic wrongfully abducted \nthese soldiers. Now he allows them to return home, while at the same \ntime he refuses to allow the million Kosovar Albanians who were \nwrongfully displaced to safely return home.\n  Yes, the three soldiers come home and now we see no move by Milosevic \nat all, at all, to allow so many decent families to return to their \nhomes.\n  Mr. Milosevic could end this war today. I know some have said, let's \ntake a pause in the bombing, and that may be something that NATO wants \nto do. It is going to be up to them as they go about deciding the best \nstrategy. But I say to Mr. Milosevic that he can end this war today. He \nhas to agree to do three things. They are very simple.\n  No. 1, pull your army and your special forces out of Kosovo;\n  No. 2, allow for the safe return of Kosovar refugees to what is left \nof their homes;\n\n[[Page S4531]]\n\n  No. 3, allow for an international peacekeeping force, which includes \nNATO's participation, to ensure the safe return of the refugees.\n  That is very straightforward. It is very simple in many ways. It \ntakes us back to the days when Kosovo had its autonomy and those people \ncould live in peace. So, yes, we welcome the POWs home with our open \narms and open hearts, and we long for the day that Mr. Milosevic will \nstop this war by allowing the refugees to return home, ensuring a \nstable situation by allowing an international peacekeeping force into \nKosovo.\n  I know the McCain-Biden resolution was written with the aim of \nachieving those three goals that I outlined, the three steps that \nMilosevic must take. However I do not support that resolution for the \nfollowing reasons. I stated this in the Foreign Relations Committee, \nbut I wanted to expand my remarks a little bit today. No. 1, the \nresolution is too broad and it is too open ended. Specifically, I am \nvery concerned about the clause that says, ``all necessary force and \nother means.'' I do not believe it was the intention of the Senators to \nopen the door to every weapon known to mankind. But when you read the \nresolution, there is no clarity on that point. I think it opens the \ndoor for Congress to underwrite the use of chemical weapons, biological \nweapons, and nuclear weapons.\n  In the committee, Senator Smith entered into a colloquy with Senator \nBiden and he said: Senator, I am worried about this being so all-\nencompassing that it could include biological, chemical, and nuclear \nweapons. Senator Biden said that was not the intent. We can have a \ncolloquy on the floor to say that is not what we meant; we meant \nconventional weapons. But a colloquy is not enough for Senators to \nhave, it seems to me, when you are voting on a measure so important. It \nought to be clear what we are talking about, and this resolution says, \nin essence, any and all weapons. That is the first reason I oppose it. \nIt is open ended and too broad.\n  Second, the resolution takes Congress out of the decisionmaking \nprocess. In other words, once you pass this sweeping resolution, our \njob is essentially done; you are handing this over to the President.\n  By the way, I think this President has shown tremendous leadership on \nthis issue. I disagree with my friend from Pennsylvania and my friend \nfrom Indiana on their colloquy. If you think it is easy to keep 19 NATO \nnations together on one track, think again. This is not easy. Some of \nthese nations have an inclination not to go along. I give tremendous \ncredit to President Clinton and to Prime Minister Tony Blair on this \nmatter, because I think they are the ones who have kept NATO focused.\n  I am very pleased with the fact that the President has done something \nhere, but I do not want to take the Congress out of this debate. I \nthink this resolution does that. I think my constituents want me to be \nincluded in this every inch of the way. If the President asks us for \nground troops, we need to vote on that. If he asks us for other means, \nwe should be able to vote on that. I do not see it as others do, that \nthe Congress really should just say: Any and all force.\n  I support what we are doing. I want to be clear. I want to respond to \nSenator Hagel who said those of you who do not support this, \nessentially you are not courageous and you are not--I don't want to put \nwords in his mouth, but he basically said we are not standing up with \ncourage. I just want to put that into context, because when I voted to \nsupport the NATO bombing, I was taking a very strong stand. This is not \neasy, to see these bombs falling. This is tough. I believe they will \nbring Milosevic to the table. I do really believe that. So I do not \nview that vote as just some easy vote. It was a hard vote for me to say \nuse force in this circumstance. So I hope colleagues would not think \nthose of us who do not support them on this want us to leave the scene, \nto run away.\n  There are three points of view here that are all very legitimate. One \nthat I have heard represented by several of our colleagues is: Do \nnothing. Do nothing. This is not in the national interest of the United \nStates of America. Do nothing. I do not agree with that. If it is not \nin the national interest to stop the most god-awful ethnic cleansing \nsince Hitler--if that is not in our national interest, I do not know \nwhat is. We are human beings first and foremost. We cannot allow that \nto stand. So I do not subscribe to those who say: Do nothing, in terms \nof military force. I just do not think we have the choice here. \nMilosevic was engaging in this ethnic cleansing. The only difference \nnow is the light is on it and we see it.\n  I also do not agree with those who back this resolution, which is: \nAny and all necessary force, all kinds of weapons, the President has \nthe ability to do that. I think it goes too far, takes us out.\n  So I am in the middle here. I support the current policy. I do think \nit is working. I do think we need to be patient. I do know there has \nbeen bad weather. I do have faith that the conduct of this war will \nlead to what we want, an end of the ethnic cleansing.\n  The President has not asked us for this additional language. I am \nsure any President would welcome it, by the way. But he has not asked \nus. As a matter of fact, he sent us a letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record, \nMadam President.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 28, 1999.\n     Hon: Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I appreciate the opportunity to continue \n     to consult closely with the Congress regarding events in \n     Kovoso.\n       The unprecedented unity of the NATO Members is reflected in \n     our agreement at the recent summit to continue and intensify \n     the air campaign. Milosevic must not doubt the resolve of the \n     NATO alliance to prevail. I am confident we will do so \n     through use of air power.\n       However, were I to change my policy with regard to the \n     introduction of ground forces, I can assure you that I would \n     fully consult with the Congress. Indeed, without regard to \n     our differing constitutional views on the use of force, I \n     would ask for Congressional support before introducing U.S. \n     ground forces into Kosovo into a non-permissive environment. \n     Milosevic can have no doubt about the resolve of the United \n     States to address the security threat to the Balkans and the \n     humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. The refugees must be allowed \n     to go home to a safe and secure environment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Bill Clinton.  \n\n  Mrs. BOXER. What the President said is he is confident we will \nprevail through airpower, and he says, ``I can assure you that'' if we \nneeded ground forces he would ``fully consult with the Congress'' \nbefore he would introduce ground forces into what he called a \nnonpermissive environment.\n  So, I support what we are doing now. I also want to comment on the \nremarks of one of our colleagues, who said, why don't we stop horrible \nthings from happening in other parts of the world? I do not subscribe \nto the theory that if you cannot stop all evil stop no evil. I think \nyou stop it where you can. In this case, because of the President's \nleadership, there are 19 nations united. This is a mission of NATO. We \ncan stop this evil and we should stop this evil.\n  Let me remark on some of the human rights abuses that are being \nreported by Human Rights Watch. They conducted 19 separate interviews, \nwhich showed that 100 men were summarily executed in the town of Meja \non April 27. According to the witnesses, these men were pulled out of \nconvoys headed towards Albania, and executed. Witnesses reported the \ndead bodies covered an area of ground about 12 feet by 20 feet and were \nstacked 4 feet high.\n  I ask people to imagine, what does that remind you of; after World \nWar II, when we saw those bodies piled one on top of the other? How my \ncolleagues can say it is not in our national interest to stop this is \nbeyond my capability to understand.\n  Another witness said he fled his town of Sojevo, leaving behind his \nparalyzed father and elderly mother in their home because they could \nnot get out, and he believed the Serb paramilitary forces would not \nharm the disabled and the elderly and the helpless. He returned home \nhours later to find his father shot dead and his mother's body \nmutilated. How can people say it is not in our national interest to \nstop that?\n\n[[Page S4532]]\n\n  Violence against women in Kosovo has been reported widely. One woman \ninterviewed by Human Rights Watch reported police held a knife to her \n3-year-old son, saying he would be killed if she did not produce money \nor gold.\n  We know there are several accounts of women being raped by Serb \nforces in front of their children. I heard a quote on CNN that \nMilosevic said: ``There are bad things happening in Kosovo, but it's \nnot the military, it's the paramilitary.''\n  I say to Milosevic: Stop it; you can stop it. The paramilitary, the \nmilitary, the special police, you control it; you can stop it. You can \nsend three POWs home to us. You never should have taken them in the \nfirst place. They were on a peacekeeping mission. You can send three \nPOWs home to us. Let the good people who want nothing more than to live \nin their homes in Kosovo go home and stop the rape and the torture and \nthe mutilation of old people and sick people. Yes, you admit bad things \nare happening in Kosovo. You can stop them from happening.\n  I support NATO, and I support the administration. I believe the best \nway to show that support for the current policy is to table the \nresolution. If we are asked to do more, I will consider it. I stand on \nmy vote of March 23 when Congress approved that resolution authorizing \nthe President to conduct airstrikes against Milosevic. I believe the \nSenate should stand behind that vote and continue to support NATO's \neffort to end the nightmare in Kosovo.\n  Last point. I say to my friend, Joe Biden, and to my friend, John \nMcCain, Madam President, they are showing leadership in this \nresolution. They are putting forward their point of view. It is quite a \nlegitimate point of view. I think the other points of view being \nexpressed are legitimate as well. When the House voted, they sent a \nvery chaotic message to the world: Yes, we will keep sending the money; \nno, we won't bring home the troops; no, we don't like the bombing; no, \nwe don't want ground forces. It was extremely confusing.\n  The best signal we can send today is a signal that we support NATO. \nIf we table this resolution, that will be my interpretation, that we \nsupport NATO today, that we reaffirm our support that was given to NATO \nin a bipartisan way on March 23.\n  I thank you very much, Madam President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nArizona.\n  I am opposed to the pending resolution for constitutional policy \nreasons and for pragmatic reasons.\n  With respect to the constitutional issue, we have seen a significant \nerosion of congressional authority, as mandated in the Constitution, to \ndeclare war--the President having assumed the authority to declare war \nunder his powers as Commander in Chief. Korea was a war without a \ndeclaration by the Congress. Vietnam was a war without a declaration by \nthe Congress, except for the ill-advised Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. The \nmissile strikes against Iraq in December constitute acts of war without \nauthorization by Congress. The airstrikes against the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia constitute acts of war without congressional \nauthorization. There was a resolution authorizing airstrikes which \npassed the Senate 58-41, but under our bicameral form of Government, \nthe House of Representatives did not concur in authorizing that use of \nforce.\n  The broad sweeping authority contained within the pending resolution \nreally is, in effect, tantamount to a delegation of Congress' \nauthority.\n  The President has had a series of four meetings with Members of \nCongress which I believe have been very constructive and are very much \nto the President's credit. When he met with Members of Congress last \nWednesday, on April 28, he publicly acknowledged this. The President \nsaid that he would not order ground troops without prior authorization \nby the Congress of the United States. He wanted to reserve his \nconstitutional authority to do so without prior congressional approval, \nbut he said as a practical matter, he would get congressional \nauthorization as a good-faith matter because of the sequence of events \nwhich have transpired and which he anticipates will transpire before \nany such move.\n\n  If we are to authorize the President, in the language of this \nresolution, ``to use all necessary force and other means, in concert \nwith United States allies, to accomplish United States and North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization objectives in the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro),'' the Congress of the United States \nwould be taking itself out of the picture with respect to being a party \nto whatever action the executive branch, the President, our Armed \nForces might take.\n  I suggest, Madam President, that there is substantial collective \nwisdom in the House and in the Senate which ought to be consulted, \nwhich ought to be a party to the takeoff, as well as the landing, which \nought to be a party to advising what our rules should be, reserving, of \ncourse, the military function to the generals and to the admirals and \nto the executive branch. But the Congress has a very, very significant \nrole to play in deciding what course we ought to take. As a matter of \npolicy, it seems to me important that the Congress reserve its rights \nand not become involved in such a broad delegation of congressional \nauthority.\n  As a pragmatic matter, we have seen the ill-advised Gulf of Tonkin \nResolution, and I quote from that resolution in part:\n\n       . . .The United States is therefore prepared, as the \n     President determines, to take all necessary steps, including \n     the use of armed force, to assist any member. . . of the \n     Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty. . .\n\n  The language, ``to take all necessary steps including the use of \narmed force,'' is strikingly similar to the language of the present \nresolution to authorize the use of all necessary force. I suggest that \nthe Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was very, very ill-advised.\n  Madam President, I supported the resolution passed by the Senate 58-\n41 to authorize airstrikes, expressly reserving that there should be no \nground forces. I am prepared to consider whatever the President may \nrequest, providing that very, very important questions are answered.\n  I believe we need to know to what extent the airstrikes have degraded \nthe military forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We need to \nknow what the prospective resistance would be, what the plan of attack \nwould be, what resources would be necessary to implement the plan, what \nof those resources would come from the United States, what of those \nresources would come from our NATO allies, and what would be the cost \nto be borne by our NATO allies as well as the United States?\n  We are currently looking at a request from the President for some $6 \nbillion, and we are looking at an add-on from the House of \nRepresentatives which may bring the total bill to $12 billion, or to \n$13 billion. Before any such appropriation is authorized, it seems to \nme that we are going to have to take a very hard look at precisely what \nis involved and what our obligations are and what our NATO allies have \ncontributed.\n  Now that there is a surplus and there has been a public declaration \nbacked by consensus that the surplus ought to be used for Social \nSecurity, it has been noted that these appropriations are going to come \nout of the Social Security fund. That puts a political coloration on \nthe matter which is going to require a lot of analysis to be sure that \nwe are doing absolutely the right thing before we deplete funds which \nmight be directed toward Social Security.\n  There is another aspect in the consideration of this resolution, and \nthat is the high improbability, really impossibility, of an acceptance \nof this resolution by the House of Representatives, in light of their \nvotes last Wednesday, April 28.\n  The House of Representatives turned down a resolution on a tie vote, \n213-213, for the President to conduct air operations, so that the House \nis saying, by that tie vote, that they do not approve of what the \nPresident is doing at the present time. And in not approving even the \nlimited air operations, with the specific reservation prohibiting the \nuse of ground forces, what is there to support the belief that the \nHouse of\n\n[[Page S4533]]\n\nRepresentatives will be prepared to grant even broader authority to the \nPresident?\n  The vote by the House of Representatives on another resolution \nappears directly inconsistent with their refusal to authorize the \nPresident to continue the air operations. The House of Representatives \nrejected a resolution, 290-139, directing the President, under the War \nPowers Resolution, to withdraw troops from operations against the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. Now, there may be some ambiguity or \ndifference between the withdrawal of troops compared to a cessation of \nair operations, but they amount to about the same thing.\n  So here you have the House of Representatives saying, ``We will not \nauthorize the President to carry out the air operations,'' and at the \nsame time, ``We do not call for the withdrawal of troops,'' or, \nrealistically viewed, whatever it is that the United States is doing in \na military context at the present time.\n  I believe it is important to consider negotiations, as has been urged \nby some Members, although I would not suspend the bombing operations.\n  The return of the three U.S. soldiers by President Milosevic was, \nindeed, welcome news yesterday. I congratulate Reverend Jackson for his \ninitiatives and his courage in undertaking that daring mission, and in \nsucceeding at it. But I would not reward President Milosevic for doing \nsomething, in returning the three GIs, which he should have done weeks \nago. I do think that we need to stay the course on the authorization of \nthe resolution that the Senate passed on airstrikes. But I do also \nbelieve we ought to be cooperative with the efforts of Russia, and with \nany other efforts to have a negotiated settlement, providing we do not \ngive up the standing to prosecute President Milosevic as a war criminal \nif the evidence so bears out.\n  We know that as long ago as late 1992 then-Secretary of State \nEagleburger, in effect, declared Milosevic a war criminal. And I \nbelieve that it is very important that the War Crimes Tribunal proceed \nto gather evidence. I think you will have a very salutary, a very \ndeterrent effect if the evidence is present to proceed with an \nindictment against Milosevic.\n  A bipartisan group of Senators met with Justice Louise Arbour last \nFriday, and she made a very strong plea for the IFOR, for the allied \nforces, to take Karadzic into custody. And that would be an occasion to \ntake many other high ranking military and political figures into \ncustody: war criminals, for the violation of human rights in Bosnia. \nAnd that could have a very, very profound effect on Milosevic's \nimmediate subordinates.\n  So we ought to be working in a number of directions--at a negotiated \nsettlement, if it can be obtained, consistent with the NATO conditions, \nto pursue the issue of treating Milosevic and his subordinates as war \ncriminals, and to continue with our airstrikes.\n  But I do believe that at opposite ends of the poles, it is \nunsatisfactory, really counterproductive, for the House to reject the \ncurrent military operations and the airstrikes by the tie vote; and I \nthink it would be counterproductive at the other end of the spectrum to \nhave a broad sweeping authorization of authority for the President to \ntake whatever action he deems appropriate as a blank check.\n  And in taking that position, I acknowledge the leadership of the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, who speaks with \ngreat authority on military matters, and the leadership of his \nprincipal cosponsor, Senator Biden, the ranking member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. But for constitutional policy and \npragmatic reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against the pending \nresolution.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield 30 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President. I, too, thank my \ncolleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Biden, for having principle, for \nstating their principle very forcefully, even though I disagree with \nwhat they are trying to do with the resolution that is before us today.\n  I think every Member of this body has the responsibility to address \nthis issue, to say what we think, and to back that up with action. In \nfact, I have to say that I was stunned, after the House action last \nweek, that some Members came forward and said, ``Oh, this is \npartisan.''\n  Madam President, this is not partisan. There are Members from both \nsides of the aisle who have very differing views on this. I would never \nsay that someone who does not vote with me is partisan or is coming to \nthis debate with anything other than their own conscience.\n  So I am going to speak from my conscience and my heart. I am against \nthis resolution. I am not against it procedurally; I am against it on \nthe merits. I respect everyone who is on either side of this issue, and \nI think we need to have the debate. I think we need to take an action \nthat would turn us in a different direction from the course we are on \nin Kosovo today.\n  Madam President, I have to take a moment of personal privilege and \nsay that I was stunned to pick up my paper on Saturday and read that \none of my constituents, Larry Joyce, had died on Friday. Friday night, \nwhen I was speaking to a group, I was talking about Larry Joyce--not \nknowing that he had passed away--because Larry Joyce is one of my \nheroes. He has had an indelible impression on me.\n  He was watching this debate and this issue very closely, because \nLarry Joyce was a decorated Vietnam veteran who lost his son in \nSomalia. Sergeant Casey Joyce was one of the great Army Rangers who \nlost his life in his first mission as an Army Ranger. When Larry Joyce \ntold me his story, I invited him to come and testify before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. I have to say, he gave the most compelling \ntestimony that I have heard in all of my time on that wonderful \ncommittee.\n  Larry Joyce was a hero. He was a patriot. He was very concerned about \nthis Kosovo issue. I wish he were alive to see this issue all the way \nthrough, because he certainly had a lot to say that was important.\n  This resolution is wrong for a lot of reasons. It is the wrong time--\nthrough no fault of the authors of the resolution because they could \nnot have known, when they introduced this resolution in the Senate, \nthat we would have the release of our American prisoners over the \nweekend. Of course, all of us were so thrilled when on Saturday we \nheard that President Milosevic had agreed to release the prisoners, and \nthen on Sunday, when many of us were waking up, we heard the news that \nthey had already been released.\n\n  I was proud to meet with Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales in my home State of \nTexas on their way to Frankfurt yesterday, and there weren't two more \nrelieved people in the whole United States of America than they were.\n  This release does give us a narrow window of opportunity for a \ndiplomatic solution. I think it is wrong to pass a resolution on the \nfloor of the Senate saying escalate the intensity of this campaign. \nThat is the wrong message. Instead, I call on President Clinton to take \nbold action, open a door for discussion with President Milosevic, set a \ntimetable, require that there be immediate cessation of any hostilities \ntoward Kosovars of Albanian extraction, and ask Mr. Milosevic if he \nwill agree to come to the table and talk about a peace.\n  This is a window. If it fails, what have we lost? Set a timetable, 5 \ndays. Do you think we could lose 5 days in bombing to save maybe \nhundreds of lives, maybe thousands of lives, maybe years of conflict? I \nthink it is worth a try. I call on the President today to do just that, \ntake a bold step. This is the opportunity for President Clinton to see \nif President Milosevic is serious. If he is, talking does not hurt, and \nit just may help.\n  The resolution is wrong for other reasons. Those who offer this \nresolution believe it is necessary because Congress has a \nresponsibility to act. I don't think this resolution is an exercise of \nresponsibility. I think it is an abdication of responsibility. It tells \nthe President, in so many words, don't bother us anymore with this war. \nCongress doesn't want to know what your plan is. We don't want to know \nwhat it is going to cost. We don't want to know\n\n[[Page S4534]]\n\nfrom you what the exit strategy is. Congress doesn't want to authorize \nthe use of ground forces. In short, we are saying, President Clinton, \ngo fix it and don't bother us, send us the bill.\n  I reject that view of taking responsibility for Congress. I think we \ndo have a responsibility to say what we think. If we have learned one \nlesson from Vietnam, it should be that Congress must take the \nresponsibility that is given it by the Constitution and not let \nsomething go on and on and on, when we know we are going in the wrong \ndirection.\n  In 1964, the Senate passed what became known as the Gulf of Tonkin \nresolution. That resolution urged President Johnson to take all \nnecessary measures to prevent further aggression in Southeast Asia. The \ndebate on the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was much of the same debate we \nare hearing today--concern about whether our allies were dragging us \ninto a war that wasn't ours; concern about whether they would accept \nenough of their responsibility; concern about cost; concern about \nwhether we were actually declaring war, but being too timid to do it; \nand there was concern about escalation.\n  We know what happened. Over the next 10 years, every one of us can \ntell what happened. Congress abdicated its responsibility. They let the \nwar go on and on and on, and we lost 59,000 Americans because Congress \ndid not stand up and say, wait a minute, we are going in the wrong \ndirection, let's do something about it.\n  I am not going to abdicate my responsibility. If I were the only vote \nin this body, I would vote against this resolution on the merits right \nnow. That is not to say that I would not welcome the President coming \nto Congress and telling us what he wants, but he has not asked for more \nforce. He has not submitted a plan. He has not stated goals with which \nI could agree.\n  Why would we take an action that would give him more authority to use \nmore force at exactly the wrong time? The President had not submitted a \nplan when the Senate voted to authorize the air operation, and that is \nwhy I voted no. At the time, we were told the operation would deter \nPresident Milosevic from hurting the Kosovar Albanians. When the \nbombing began, we all know that he escalated the atrocities against \nthose poor people. That is not our fault. I would never blame us for \nthat. But it is our fault that we didn't have a contingency plan.\n\n  I would never compound that problem by giving the President more \nauthority to send our troops in on the ground and put them in harm's \nway with no contingency plan. He has not come to Congress; he has not \nasked for more authority. The last thing we ought to do is give a \nblanket authority when we do not know the plans. It would be an \nabdication of our responsibility to do that.\n  I think the administration has been all over the lot on the policy \nthat we say that we want to solve this problem. Do we want an \nindependent Kosovo? The administration says no. Do we want to drive Mr. \nMilosevic from power? The administration says no. Do we want to \nencourage European democracies who are very strong and stable right now \nto assume more responsibility for European security? The administration \nsays yes, but the crisis is demonstrating the opposite.\n  Do we want a strong NATO with a clear sense of purpose and the \nability to defend a united Europe? The administration says yes, but I \nthink this Balkan policy is going to tear the alliance apart. It goes \nfar beyond what 19 countries can agree to in a consensus.\n  We are learning that you cannot fight an offensive war by committee. \nWhat we want in Yugoslavia, according to the administration, is a \nmultiethnic, multiparty democracy. We seem to be prepared to impose it \non both sides, neither of whom are ready to accept our terms.\n  We have tried an experimental Balkan policy in Bosnia. It is not \nworkable. Thousands of American troops are there with no end in sight. \nThe head of the international observer group has fired elected \nofficials and canceled sessions of parliament because opposition \nparties oppose what we are doing in Kosovo. People vote in elections \nand then cannot stay and serve where they are elected.\n  I do not think that is an example of a democracy. I think it is a \ncollection of countries trying to force their will on the people of \nanother country.\n  I certainly do not think we should try to do this in Kosovo with \nBosnia as an example. Are we going to require the Kosovar Albanians to \nlive under Milosevic? Surely no one could seriously take that as a \ngoal, but that is the goal stated by the administration-- an autonomous \nregion within Serbia that is protected by a NATO force with no end in \nsight.\n\n  So, Madam President, I think it is time for us to look for a \nresponsible force that has a chance to succeed. With the glimmer of \nhope that we have with the release of our prisoners, I urge the \nPresident to seize the opportunity to seek a diplomatic solution, try \nto bring Mr. Milosevic to the table, bring in the other parties, and \nlook for a region-wide solution.\n  I think the United States should go back to its role in the region of \nbeing a friend to all and an enemy to none. As the world's greatest \nsuperpower, we do not have to take sides in ethnic conflicts if we are \ngoing to be the neutral party that can bring them together. We should \nbe able to bring the powers together to work out a solution that would \nhave a long-term chance to succeed, one that recognizes the open, \ngaping wounds of all the parties in the Balkans. It would require much \nmore energy than was put into Rambouillet. It would require President \nClinton to take a personal interest and an investment in the solution. \nAnd he can do that. The effort would be worth it. We should bring \nRussia back to the brink to forge an alliance with the West, not push \nthem further away from us. We should provide people in the region self-\ndetermination so they can create countries that have a chance for \nlongevity.\n  It would keep the United States from devoting incredible resources \nfor its open-ended commitment in the Balkans, because our ability to \nfight elsewhere in the world is being jeopardized by this operation. We \nare now talking about blockading Yugoslavia. That will take more ships \nthan we now have allocated to this mission. It will hamper our ability \nto operate in the Persian Gulf. We have already seen that it is \ndiverting military resources from as far as the Asian theater.\n  Madam President, as much time as we have put in on this Balkans \nissue, I think we need to come out with a solution that is not a \n``Band-Aid'' for Kosovo, but something that will settle down the \nBalkans for a longer term and give them a chance to live as neighbors, \nside by side, to have stable economies, to get their people back in \ntheir respective countries, to be able to live and have self-\ndetermination; and then, hopefully, they could become trading partners \nand friends.\n  Madam President, I don't think that any strategic planner in the \nworld ever thought, as the cold war ended, that we would propose a new \nstrategic concept for America that would include tens of thousands of \ntroops dedicated to the Balkans in perpetuity, but that is exactly what \nis happening. I have listened to the arguments that are being made. The \nbasic argument seems to be: I don't really like how we got here, but \nnow that we are here, we have to win. We are in it, so we must win it. \nI keep hearing that over and over again. That is like saying when you \nare going in the wrong direction, keep going and speed up.\n  I don't think the Senate ought to say that. I think we ought to be a \npartner with the President in trying to say, wait a minute, Mr. \nPresident, we don't agree with what you have done, so let's try to take \na different course. I am suggesting tonight that that course be that \nglimmer of hope that we can have a diplomatic solution, which would be \nmuch bigger than just a ``Band-Aid'' on Kosovo.\n  I have heard the argument that the credibility of NATO is at stake. \nNow, that is a good argument. I want the credibility of NATO to remain \nintact. But what kind of alliance, with a mistake staring them in the \nface, would keep going down the same road and say that, in order to \nremain credible, we have to go down the same road, at any cost in \nlives, at the cost of any treasure of any of our countries, and we are \ngoing to gut it out even though everyone who has any little bit of \nawareness of what has been going on is bound to say this isn't working \nvery well?\n  Is there any doubt in anyone's mind that, if NATO were under attack, \nwe\n\n[[Page S4535]]\n\ncould win a war? No, there is no doubt, because if one of our countries \nwas under siege, we would go all out and we would win. We might use \nnuclear weapons if we had to, but we would win if one of us had a \nsecurity threat. But the fact of the matter is, Madam President, we \ndon't have a security risk. We have a humanitarian tragedy. So we are \nnot in this full force. It is a ``gentlemen's war.'' We are doing \nstrategic bombing. We are trying to be careful not to kill civilians, \nthank Heaven. We aren't going to put in ground troops. The President \nhas said that.\n  This is not a war on which you can judge the credibility of NATO. If \nwe wanted to win, we would win. We have the force to win, make no \nmistake about it. Nobody in their right mind would doubt it. But the \nproblem here is the same as we had in Vietnam; we are not prepared to \nuse full force to win, because it isn't a security threat.\n  To keep NATO strong, I submit that we don't keep going forward on a \nmission that doesn't appear to be very positive. To keep NATO strong, \nwe should have a clear principle, a clear mission, and not an immediate \nreaction, but be slow to get into action. And when you go, by God, you \ngo to win. That is what was wrong with Vietnam, and it is what is wrong \ntoday in Kosovo. It is not the credibility of NATO that we don't win a \n``gentlemen's war.'' The credibility of NATO would be tested if we had \na real security threat to one of our countries, and we would go in and \nwe would win.\n  So I think the resolution today is meaningless, because we know we \nare not going to use full force. We are not going to use weapons of \nmass destruction, and we are not going to use ground troops. The \nPresident has said that. He hasn't even asked for it. And this \noperation should show us, and it should be a lesson for NATO, that if \nwe are not prepared to go for a win, we should not take the first step. \nThat is the lesson to keep the credibility of NATO.\n  If we are not prepared to go for a win and declare war on Serbia we \nshouldn't have started the bombing, and we shouldn't continue in this \ndirection. That is why the resolution is wrong.\n  I am not ready to declare war on Serbia. I think they have a despot \nas a leader. But I don't think the American people are ready to declare \nwar on a country that is not a security threat to the United States. I \ndon't think we should start bombing another country if we are not ready \nto declare war.\n  Madam President, I don't think it is right for Congress to say go \nfull force in the same direction you have been going. I think it is my \nresponsibility as a Senator to say: I think we are going in the wrong \ndirection, Mr. President. Let's take stock of the situation, and let's \ntry to do something that would be a positive turn.\n  I was reading in the New York Times this morning a column by William \nSafire about the price of trust. The central question is, Do we trust \nthe President to use all force necessary to establish the principle \nthat no nation can drive out an unwanted people? And the answer is no. \nThe distrust is palpable. Give him the tools and he will not finish the \njob.\n  Madam President, I don't want to give him the tools in that kind of \natmosphere. It would be an abdication of my responsibility as a Member \nof the Senate to do that. The only responsible action for the Senate is \nto ask the President to come to Congress if you want to escalate this \nconflict. Come to Congress, and tell us why and tell us what your plan \nis. Tell us what the cost is. Tell us how many troops you need, and for \nhow long. Tell us what the mission is. And what is victory?\n  How could we say that passing this resolution is an act of \nresponsibility? I don't doubt for one minute that everyone who votes \nfor this resolution is doing it because they believe it is right--\nbecause they believe in the Presidency. So many of the war heroes in \nthis Senate believe in the Presidency. I think that is why they are \nstanding so tall.\n  But, Madam President, I am a Member of the Senate. I believe in the \nPresidency. But I believe that when the President is doing something \nthat is wrong--that I should stand up and say so. That is what I was \nelected to do. That is what the people of Texas sent me here to do.\n  I hope that we can have an influence on the President. I hope he will \ntake bold action. I hope he will sit down tonight and decide that there \nis a glimmer of hope with the release of the American prisoners and it \nis worth a chance.\n  That is why I hope we will table this resolution--that we will take \nour responsibility seriously as Members of the Senate, and say: Mr. \nPresident, what we are doing isn't working, and I am not going to \nescalate it. I am not going to put our troops into harm's way, most \nassuredly, when you don't ask us to do it. And when you don't give us a \nplan, and when you don't give us a policy that we can decide if we \nsupport or not. The people who elected me to take the tough vote trust \nme to do what I think is right in my heart. I would never abdicate my \nconscience by giving a blank check to put our troops into harm's way in \nsupport of a policy that I haven't seen, and what I have seen I \ndisagree with. No way.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask that the Chair recognize the \nSenator from Washington for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, should the Congress, in the words of the \nMcCain resolution, authorize the President ``to use all necessary \nforce'' to accomplish U.S. objectives in Yugoslavia? That is the \nquestion upon which we will be voting shortly.\n  In order to answer that question, however, we must, it seems to me, \nfirst deal with two prerequisites and vital questions.\n  First, what are our American objectives in Yugoslavia? And are they \nso vital to our national interest as to warrant a full-scale war?\n  Second, do we have a sufficient degree of confidence in the quality \nof our Presidential leadership to give the President unlimited and \nunrequested authority to pursue those objectives?\n  In connection with that first question, our American objectives, we \nare now engaged in an experiment, a venture, that is an entirely new \nfunction for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--not defensive in \nnature, but reaching outside of its own borders to attempt to settle \none among many ethnic and religious conflicts around the world.\n  In my view, at the time at which we began this adventure, it was \nclearly not a vital interest to the United States of America. In \naddition to the absence of any vital national interest was the \nappalling lack of contingency plans on the part of the administration, \nas explained to Members of the Senate of both parties in the days \nleading up to the beginning of the bombing--no contingency plans as to \nwhat took place if the first two stages of bombing in a week or 10 days \nor 2 weeks was unsuccessful; no recognition of the high possibility or \nprobability of extensive Serb atrocities in Kosovo aimed at the very \npeople our actions were designed to protect.\n  In summary, Madam President, I believe that the administration's \nposition at the beginning of this conflict ranked somewhere between \nfrivolity and folly and, therefore, I was one of 41 Senators to vote \nagainst ratifying what we all knew the administration was going to do \nwhatever the vote in the Senate.\n  On the other hand, as critical as I am of both the inception of this \nconflict and of its conduct, it is very difficult, I think impossible, \nto avoid the conclusion that what was not a vital national interest in \nthe first place now involves a far greater national interest resulting \nfrom a flawed concept and a worse execution.\n  We now do implicate the very survival of the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization. And our actions have precipitated a refugee crisis \nunmatched in Europe since the end of World War II. Well over a million \nKosovars are homeless, many of them refugees outside of the boundaries \nof the Republic of Yugoslavia, all of them far worse off when they are \nnot dead than they were before our intervention began.\n  Having recognized this, however, what are the possible outcomes? All \nof them, it seems to me, are bad.\n  The first is that we quit and come home. And some advocate that. I no \nlonger honestly can do so as much as I opposed the beginning of this \nconflict.\n  The other and perhaps best possibility is that our air attacks may \nstill be successful, that Milosevic and the Serbs may still give up, in \nwhich case\n\n[[Page S4536]]\n\nwe get to occupy an absolutely devastated and destroyed Kosovo for \nperhaps a quarter of a century, and receive a bill to rebuild Kosovo, \nand maybe Serbia as well, some of which we may attempt with greater or \nlesser success to pass over on our allies, and will now have to support \nthe independence of that country. Its residents can no longer live with \nSerbia at all. That independence and that occupation, in my view, are \nthe only way we will persuade Kosovar Albanians to return to their \nhomes.\n\n  The next alternative, of course, is the Russian compromise --defeat, \ndisguised as a form of compromise. The Kosovars under those \ncircumstances, without an American occupation, with a Russian \noccupation, will almost certainly by the hundreds of thousands be \nrightly frightened to return to their homes. Such a compromise is \nlikely to end up in a partition, in which Serbia ends up with far more \nof Kosovo than it deserves, given its actions.\n  However, that is now a course of action advocated by the previous \nspeaker and by many others--defeat disguised as compromise.\n  Finally, we have the McCain resolution, a ground war led by this \nadministration, which has already shown itself incompetent to run even \nan air war, and a 19-member steering committee--a prescription for \ntotal disaster.\n  What about the second question, the inevitable question of the \nquality of our national leadership? By its own criteria, the \nadministration has been a total failure. It has not protected the \nKosovars; it has not prevented a spread of the war. Its leadership is \nall spin, no recognition of its own difficulties, no willingness to \nexplain to the people of the United States what it is all about or \nwhere we are going. We can have no confidence in either the preparation \nof this administration or the conduct of its operations.\n  We get to the ultimate question. We are asked by this resolution to \ngrant unlimited authority to wage war in Yugoslavia to an \nadministration unwilling to use that authority and incompetent to carry \nit out if it were willing.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Time magazine \ncolumn by Charles Krauthammer last week stating that position more \neloquently than I can.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Time magazine, May 3, 1999]\n\n                           No to a Ground War\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       What in God's name do we do now? There are three schools of \n     thought: (1) now that we're in it, we've got to win it--\n     meaning ground troops; (2) cut our losses before it's too \n     late; (3) keep on bombing until we have a better idea.\n       Option 3, air war on autopilot, is the current policy of \n     the Clinton Administration. It is a hope and a prayer. It is \n     not a policy. At some point the choice will come down to (1) \n     fight on the ground or (2) retreat under some Russian-\n     brokered deal.\n       What should it be? There is a powerful groundswell to win. \n     Even those who before the bombing thought Bismarck was right \n     when he said the Balkans were ``not worth the healthy bones \n     of a single Pomeranian grenadier'' are having second \n     thoughts. Many who, like Henry Kissenger, opposed the war, \n     have come to the view that now that we are committed, we must \n     win.\n       Their case is powerful. Whereas we had no compelling \n     national interest in Kosovo before March 24, we do now. Our \n     actions have created interests. Two in particular. First, a \n     moral obligation to the Kosovars, whom we said we were going \n     in to save and who are now shivering, starving, terrorized \n     and homeless. We owe them--as we did the Kurds, whom we \n     encouraged to rise up against Saddam after the Gulf War--at \n     least safety, if not victory.\n       Second, the war on Serbia has become a test of NATO \n     credibility. The Administration foolishly staked the \n     credibility--and perhaps the existence--of the most \n     successful defensive alliance in history on the outcome of a \n     civil war in a backwater of minimal strategic significance. \n     But now that we're there, it is minimal no more.\n       The case seems open and shut. The U.S. should go in and, in \n     the words of John McCain, use all necessary force to finish \n     the job.\n       Alas, the real question is not Should the U.S. (and its \n     allies) go in on the ground? The real question facing us \n     today is Do you really want this foreign policy team--Clinton \n     and Albright and Cohen and Berger--running a Balkan ground \n     war?\n       They launched an air war of half-measures, expecting \n     Milosevic to fold at the first sight of Bill Clinton coming \n     over the horizon on a Tomahawk. They had no contingency plan \n     when Milosevic didn't. They had no contingency plan--indeed, \n     they were shocked--when the man they called Hitler countered \n     with a savage campaign of ethnic cleansing. They responded \n     with the feeblest of aerial escalation, recapitulating the \n     disastrous gradualism of Vietnam.\n       By every one of their criteria--protecting the Kosovars, \n     preventing the crisis from spreading to neighboring \n     countries, keeping the conflict from internationalizing--this \n     campaign has been a disaster. Do we want to entrust a ground \n     war, a far more dangerous and risky enterprise, to a team \n     that has demonstrated a jaw-dropping inability to plan ahead, \n     to adapt to contingencies, to act forcefully?\n       Even if your answer is yes, consider this: the Clinton team \n     is so viscerally opposed to ground troops that Clinton ruled \n     them out from the very beginning, thus immeasurably \n     emboldening and strengthening Milosevic. Clinton was willing \n     to sacrifice the military advantages of leaving the ground-\n     war question ambiguous in order to rid himself--he thought--\n     of the issue. He is terrified of becoming Lyndon Johnson, \n     stuck in a ground war with no exit. He confessed as much to \n     Dan Rather: ``The thing that bothers me about introducing \n     ground troops . . . is the prospect of never being able to \n     get them out.''\n       It is one thing to urge a ground war on leaders simply \n     incompetent to carry it out. It is another to urge it on \n     leaders unwilling to carry it out. What kind of ground \n     campaign can we expect from an Administration that has been \n     pressured into mounting one?\n       And finally, consider Clinton's co-commanders. One of the \n     reasons the air war has been such an abject failure is that \n     every move must be approved by all 19 NATO members. \n     Luxembourg, say, has veto power over targets. France has \n     raised objections to the very minor step of blockading \n     Yugoslav ports. The committee of 19 had to approve the \n     deployment--the agonizingly slow deployment--of Apache \n     gunships. Imagine a ground war run by this hydra-headed body, \n     in which every rule of engagement, every change in strategy, \n     every new operation would have to go before and through the \n     committee of 19.\n       If we had a serious President (say, John McCain) and a \n     serious Secretary of State (say, Jeanne Kirkpatrick) and a \n     serious NATO commander (say, Colin Powell), it might make \n     sense to go in on the ground to win. But we don't. Which is \n     why we are where we are. Better a face-saving deal that \n     alleviates some of the suffering of the Albanians than a \n     charge up Kosovo hills, led by a reluctant, uncertain \n     Clinton.\n       A pessimist, says Israeli humorist Yaakov Kirschen, is a \n     person who thinks things have hit rock bottom. ``I am an \n     optimist,'' says Kirschen. ``I believe that things can get \n     much worse.''\n       And so they can. Especially in the Balkans.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. As a consequence, what might be an appropriate response \nto an administration that sought it, that expressed its goals \ncoherently enough to define what winning was, and competent to reach \nits goals, is totally inappropriate to grant to this administration--\nunasked, unwilling, and unable to carry on a war of this importance.\n  The inevitable vote on this resolution is to vote to table.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, for the information of my colleagues, \nSenator Chafee will be next for 10 minutes; Senator Inhofe for 30 \nminutes; Senator Robb for 20 minutes; Senator Leahy for 10 minutes; \nSenator Bunning for 10 minutes; Senator Domenici for 10 minutes; \nSenator Landrieu for 5 minutes; Senator Dorgan for 10 minutes; Senator \nBiden for 30 minutes; Senator Durbin for 10 minutes; Senator Warner for \n10 minutes; Senator Nickles for 20 minutes; Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts for 30 minutes; and Senator Dodd for 15 minutes.\n  I make one additional comment. This resolution does not call for \nground operations. This resolution calls for use of whatever force is \nnecessary to bring this war to a conclusion. Those who portray this as \na resolution that calls for ground operations simply mischaracterizes \nthe resolution, and I believe I am owed, along with Senator Biden, the \nintellectual honesty to at least portray this resolution for what it \nis, which is a resolution to use whatever force is necessary, which is \nexactly the same resolution as the Persian Gulf war.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the manager of the bill.\n  Madam President, I will support the motion to table, not because I am \nopposed to properly carrying out this military campaign but because I \nbelieve that setting this resolution aside today will give NATO a \nbetter chance to achieve our military objectives in Kosovo.\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\n  Since the early days of this military campaign, I have argued that \nthe President ought not have ruled out the use of ground troops as a \nmilitary option in NATO's campaign against Yugoslav forces in Kosovo. \nSending this signal gives President Milosevic some comfort, knowing \nthat his army and Serb para-military forces would not have to confront \na NATO ground campaign. That gives Milosevic a freer hand in carrying \nout his brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against ethnic Albanians.\n  Today, the Senate must decide whether to give the President authority \nto use ``all necessary force and other means'' to accomplish U.S. and \nNATO objectives in Yugoslavia. Passage would certainly permit the \nAdministration to send U.S. ground forces into Yugoslavia. I commend \nthe efforts of Senator McCain and the other sponsors of this \nresolution, who I know have only our national interests in mind in \nbringing this measure forward today.\n  My instinct is to support this resolution. However, I must oppose \nconsidering it at this time for two reasons.\n  First, it should be clear to anyone following this debate that a \nmajority of Senators needed to pass this resolution simply does not \nexist today. An acrimonious debate, followed by a vote against granting \nthe President enhanced authority to conduct this military campaign, \nwould weaken significantly NATO's hand in carrying out its mission. \nSuch a vote would give Slobodan Milosevic and his band of marauders in \nKosovo aid and comfort in fighting an alliance led by a divided U.S. \ngovernment. So, in the interests of taking on Milosevic with as unified \na front as possible, I think a vote today to table this resolution is \nprudent.\n  Second, it is not entirely clear to me whether the timing for passage \nof this resolution is appropriate. Although many are frustrated at the \nprogress of the six-week air campaign, I think it deserves a chance to \nsucceed. No one ever said that this military campaign would be quick \nand tidy--as wars rearely are--and it is wrong to demand an immeidate \nresult.\n  However, if, in the coming days and weeks, the President and our NATO \nallies decide that ground forces are, in fact, needed to carry out our \ncampaign against Yugoslav forces, I believe that consideration of this \nresolution would be appropriate and I would vote for it.\n  Madam President, while my instinct is to support this resolution \ntoday, I believe it is premature. Thus I shall vote to table the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 30 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nInhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Arizona particularly for the way \nhe has conducted himself in this debate in spite of the fact that there \nare many who do not agree with him and the resolution.\n  Let me first share some ideas that perhaps have not been discussed. I \nhave done a lot of crossing off as I have listened today, taking off \nitems I was going to discuss, and I have shortened my remarks and \nprobably won't use all of my time.\n  First of all, months ago I went to Kosovo when I saw the handwriting \non the wall, when I felt that ultimately this President was going to \nsend ground troops into Kosovo. In spite of the fact he continuously \nsaid he was not going to, I felt very strongly that he was. I went over \nto find out as much as I could before all of the bombing started, what \nit was really like in Kosovo. Truly, Milosevic is just as bad a person \nas everybody says he is. I do not question that. But one of the things \nI came back with is a knowledge of a little bit of the history of the \narea and that some of the people over there are bad, too.\n  For example, you are talking about Kosovo, which is very small. It is \nabout 75 miles in diameter, surrounded by mountains and for 600 years \nhas been an area that has strived unsuccessfully for autonomy. There \nhave been times when the Albanians have been the bad guys and the Serbs \nhave been the good guys, and vice versa. It was about 12 years ago we \nwere all so concerned because the KLA was doing all the raping and \nlooting and burning, and not the Serbs.\n  Also, I noticed only two dead people in the road going across Kosovo. \nI turned them over. They ended up being Serbs. They were killed by the \nKLA. They were executed at point-blank range.\n  Rounding a corner about 10 minutes later, I saw someone--I found \nmyself in the sights of a rifle-propelled grenade, an RPG-7, a very \nlethal weapon. After they put it down, we walked over, and it was the \nKLA, it wasn't the Serbs.\n  I went on and we saw on the map a place called the ``no-go zone.'' I \nasked what it was. They said that is where you do not go. They do not \ncare whether you are a United States Senator or whether you are a Serb \nor an Albanian; if you go in there, you are going to be shot. It was \ncontrolled by the KLA.\n  I guess what I am saying, Madam President, is there are bad guys on \nboth sides.\n  I would like to just mention one thing about the China scandal, \nbecause I see a connection here. I hate to say this, but a couple of \nmonths ago on this floor I told the history of what had happened in the \nChina scandal and the fact that back in the 1980s the technology known \nas the WA-8 technology was stolen and nobody knew about it until about \n1995. The administration--the President and the administration found \nout about it and they withheld that from Congress for quite a number of \nyears--not months but years. So in Senator Warner's committee we \nstarted having some hearings to find out what the truth was.\n\n  Sometimes I remember that Winston Churchill said:\n\n       Truth is incontrovertible. Panic may rescind it, ignorance \n     may deride it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.\n\n  Ultimately you get to that truth. That is what we are trying to get. \nAnd Notra Trulock, who was in charge of the intelligence for the \nDepartment of Energy--he said it became very serious a year ago--said \nwe are going to have to tell Congress about this. So he wanted to come. \nHe had to go to his superior, who was the Acting Director of the \nDepartment of Energy, Betsy Moler. And she said: No, you can't do that. \nYou can't do that because it might be detrimental to the President's \nChina policy.\n  Here we are talking about the theft of the most significant nuclear \ndevice in our arsenal, the WA-8 warhead. To give you an idea what it \nis, Madam President, this is something that has 10 times the explosive \npower of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. It is a fraction of \nthe size. The Chinese actually had missiles that were aimed at us at \nthat time, at the time the President was running around the country, \n133 times, saying: For the first time in the nuclear age there is not \none missile aimed at American children--when in fact we had some 28 \ncities that were being targeted at that time. He signed the waiver to \nallow the Chinese to have a guidance technology to make those missiles \nmore accurate, and he had knowledge of the fact they had, now, the \nwarhead, the WA-8 warhead, that could be fitted on one of these. As a \nmatter of fact, more than one could be fitted on one of their multiple-\nstage rockets.\n  I say that there is a connection. There is always talk about the \nPresident, every time he gets in trouble, something big happens, like \nsending cruise missiles into Sudan or Afghanistan or Iraq. In this \ncase, we started a war. But I will say this--I do not want to dwell on \nthis because that is not the subject at hand today--I see a connection. \nI believe there is a connection. I think we may very well have a ``Wag \nThe Dog'' situation here. I think everyone knows what I am talking \nabout. They do not say it, but they know what I am talking about.\n  But I did ask, in the committee meeting, since we had two \ndiametrically opposed testimonies coming from Mr. Trulock and Ms. \nMoler, if they would submit to a lie detector test. Mr. Trulock \nimmediately said he would; Ms. Moler vacillated. And then, in response \nto a letter, I found he is willing and she said she is not. So I think \nI know who is telling the truth. Nonetheless, we are going to have to \naddress that in a little bit different way.\n  We have learned since then, by the way, in the last 6 years, \nvirtually everything in our nuclear arsenal is now in the hands of the \nChinese.\n  What I would like to do is cover this in four areas that have not \nbeen discussed by previous speakers. I think\n\n[[Page S4538]]\n\nthey are significant. First of all, some of the things this President \nhas said that led us to where we are today. The President does have an \ninsatiable propensity to say things that are not true, and he does it \nwith such conviction that people start nodding and agreeing with him. I \nam not going into the details on that; everybody knows about that.\n\n  But one of the things that I think had the greatest impact on the \nAmerican people in supporting the President to send our assets in there \nand get involved in a war of a sovereign nation, in a civil war--the \nfirst time we have done that, certainly the first time in 50 years that \nNATO has done that--was when he started talking about the history of \nWorld War I and World War II. He gave a very persuasive story of how \nWorld War I and World War II started. The only trouble is, he was not \ntelling the truth. I am not a historian and neither is the President, \nbut I will tell you who is: Henry Kissinger. He said he got quite upset \nwith the thing. I am quoting now. He said:\n\n       The Second World War did not start in the Balkans, much \n     less as a result of its ethnic conflicts.\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       World War I started in the Balkans not as a result of \n     ethnic conflicts but for precisely the opposite reason: \n     because outside powers intervened in a local conflict.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Russia backed Serbia and France backed Russia . . ..\n\n  And then Germany jumped in on Austria's side. So we had the same \nsituation as is happening today. We had the great powers dividing up \nand getting on both sides of this, a civil war. It was a civil war, \njust like it is today. If that started World War I, certainly that \ncould start World War III.\n  So what he said to the American people just simply was not true, \nMadam President. I think we need to talk about that.\n  The Senator from Washington just a few minutes ago talked about the \narticle by Charles Krauthammer. I think that was very significant, when \nhe talked about the Russians. It is already submitted for the Record so \nI will not resubmit it, but I will read a few things out of it. He \nsaid:\n\n       Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov turned his U.S.-bound plane \n     around in mid-transit to protest the bombing.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Russia kicked NATO's representatives out of Moscow. It sent \n     a spy ship into the Adriatic to shadow the U.S. fleet. It \n     threatened to send military supplies to Belgrade. It \n     boycotted NATO's 50th-year summit in Washington.\n\n  I don't know what we could have done that could have precipitated \nmore of a problem between us and Russia than has already been done by \nthis President in getting involved in war.\n  The last paragraph reads:\n\n       Most important, Primakov will have proved to the world--and \n     to pro-Western Russians--that an anti-American foreign policy \n     puts Russia back on the stage and gives it diplomatic clout, \n     while the pro-American policy followed since the Gulf War \n     yielded Russia nothing but a ticket to oblivion.\n       We will have vindicated Primakov's vision of Russia as \n     leader of the opposition, friend and broker of rogue regimes \n     [like] Serbia and Iraq [and] balancer of American power. This \n     might even get him elected president next year when Yeltsin's \n     term expires.\n       Clinton will finally have his legacy.\n\n  I would like to make one comment also to clarify the Record. I know \nSenator McCain said this does not authorize ground troops. But it does \nauthorize whatever force necessary, and some of us could interpret it \nthat way. But in my opinion, the President has always known that there \nwere going to have to be ground troops. I know he said he is opposed to \nground troops, but he wasn't telling the truth. I offer as evidence of \nthat what, long before we sent bombers in there, General Wesley Clark \nsaid.\n\n       We never thought air power alone could stop the \n     paramilitary tragedy. . . everyone understood it.\n\n  When he said that, he was with the President of the United States.\n  We had Secretary Bill Cohen, a man I have a great deal of respect for \nand served with here in this body, in the Senate, but I asked him the \nsame question about this, and he elaborated a little bit on it, but he \nsaid we understood that Milosevic:\n\n       . . . could take action very quickly and that an air \n     campaign could do little, if anything, to stop him.\n\n  So when people talk about this resolution doing that, I think this is \nwhat the President had in mind all the time anyway.\n  The second thing I wanted to talk about is the cost of this thing. A \nlot of people have not realized, they do not stop and think about, the \ncost in terms of both money and our capability of defending America. I \ndo not think there is anyone who is not going to stand up here and \nagree with me in this Senate that the President, through his veto \npower, has decimated the military budget so we right now, today, are at \none-half the force strength that we were in 1991, back during the \nPersian Gulf days. That is very significant. I think people need to \nhear this and understand it: One-half the force strength. I am talking \nabout one-half the Army divisions, one-half the tactical air wings, \none-half the ships, from 600 down to 300.\n  We are one-half the force strength that we were because of this \nPresident. Add to that the deployments. We have had more deployments in \nthe last 6 years than the previous 20 years to areas where we do not \nhave any national security interests. We need to look at that. For Joe \nLockhart, the Press Secretary of the President, to stand up last week \nand say that Inhofe is wrong, we are as strong today as we were in \n1991, that is just an outrageous lie, and it is quantified in force \nstrength. Anyone who is working on the committees understands this.\n  We have the deployments, we have the problems, and we are paying the \nprice. Yet, we do not have the national security interests. I was so \nproud of Colin Powell this weekend to come out and admit that America \ndoes not have national strategic interests in Kosovo, the same as Henry \nKissinger said. I have quoted both of them extensively. Yet, here we \nare making the commitment.\n  I came back from my last trip to Kosovo just to hear Tony Blair stand \nup and make his very eloquent statement: We want to escalate the war, \nescalate the airstrikes. Here is a guy standing up who does have \nnational security interests. He is over there; we are halfway around \nthe world. We do not have strategic interests there, but he does. He \nstood up and said we need to escalate the airstrikes when, at the time \nhe said this, we had 365 airplanes over there and they had 20. That is \neasy for him to say. I say he is a better negotiator than we are.\n  I was very much concerned with what I saw over there. I see several \nmembers of the committee here. I have to say that sometimes the NATO \ninterests do not necessarily coincide with our interests. I wonder \nsometimes what has happened to sovereignty in the United States of \nAmerica, why we have to take on all these other obligations at the \nexpense of our ability to defend ourselves.\n\n  Can we defend ourselves? Again, General Hawley was very brave when \nhe, this weekend, said--keep in mind he is the air combat commander, \nthe top guy, a four-star general. It takes a lot of courage for one of \nthese generals to stand up against the Commander in Chief, President \nClinton.\n  He said that 5 weeks of bombing in Yugoslavia has left U.S. munitions \nstocks critically short, not just of air-launched cruise missiles, as \npreviously reported, but also of another precision weapon, the joint \ndirect attack munition--that is JDAM--dropped, used by these beautiful \nB-2s that are performing very well. Now we are short of them.\n  He went on to say we would be hard pressed to handle a second war in \nthe Middle East or Korea. Let's stop and think about that a little bit. \nOur national military strategy has always been to be able to defend \nAmerica on two regional fronts. I do not think there is anyone in here \nwho believes we can simultaneously defend America on two regional \nfronts.\n  What General Hawley is saying on the commitments we have made to \nBosnia and Kosovo and with the deployments we have made there is we \nwould have a very difficult time. And he questions whether we could \ndefend America if something happened in either North Korea or in Iraq. \nThat is very serious.\n  I went back to the 21st TACOM, and I know people are tired of hearing \nme talk about that, but any time we do a ground operation anywhere in \nthat theater, it has to be logistically supported\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\nand run and operated by the 21st TACOM in Germany, down the road from \nRamstein Air Force Base.\n  A year or so ago, I was over there. They said just with what we are \ndoing in Bosnia, we are at 100 percent capacity; we cannot do anymore. \nAnd now they are doing more.\n  As I watched the deployments take place and they were cranking these \ntroops through--5,000 were there a few days ago --as they were taken \nthrough, I said: What are you going to do if there is any contingency \nlike in Iraq?\n  They said: We would be 100 percent dependent on Guard and Reserve.\n  We know the President's intentions are to activate the Guard and \nReserve. He has already called up units. He has notified units.\n  Anyway, we do not have the capacity. I went over, Madam President, to \nTirana, where our troops are, in a C-17. I found some things out there \nthat were really kind of scary. The C-17 I went in was carrying two \nMLRSs, that is the mobile launch capability, and one humvee, and all \nthe rest filled up with troops. We were at gross weight. We could not \nhold another pound in that C-17.\n  We have now done 300 sorties with C-17s. That is the beautiful high-\nlift vehicle that is going to replace a lot of the others of which we \ndon't have enough and need more. Nonetheless, we are tying those things \nup. Four hundred of them are going in and out, taking things into \nAlbania.\n  Then we have our scenarios as to what the cost is going to be. I will \nonly say this. I came back convinced that the paper that was written by \nthe Heritage Foundation was true, because from the officers over there, \nI learned three scenarios, which are: The most conservative scenario, \ngo in and take over Kosovo, as if you can do that and nothing else is \ngoing to happen; second, take over Belgrade; third, take \nover Yugoslavia.\n\n  The first scenario would take 30,000 American troops; the second \nscenario, 100,000 American troops; the third scenario, 250,000 American \ntroops. While they do not like to think in terms of casualties, \ncasualties under the most conservative scenario would be somewhere \nbetween 500 and 2,000 American casualties; the Belgrade option would be \nsomewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 casualties; and the Yugoslavia total \neffort would be somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 American \ncasualties. That is very, very serious.\n  Before I quit, I have two other things I want to share. I have heard \nmany Senators stand on this floor and talk about the horrible \natrocities that are going on, and they are. Anytime anyone is killed, \nanytime there are refugees, anytime there is any degree of ethnic \ncleansing, it is a tragedy.\n  For the junior Senator from California to stand up and say, ``the \nmost God-awful ethnic cleansing since Hitler,'' just is not true. I am \nsure she believes it is true or she would not say it.\n  We keep hearing these horrible stories. We heard the President walk \nout into the Rose Garden last week and talk about what Brian Atwood, \nthe AID Administrator, told him about the groups of men that were lined \nup and doused with gasoline and lighted on fire. I was with Brian \nAtwood over there a few days before that. Apparently, this allegedly \nhappened before that time. He did not tell me about it.\n  I don't know what is true and is not true. I will say this. I know \ndespite what you hear to the contrary--and this is most significant--\nthe atrocities that have been committed on the Kosovar Albanians are \nminor when compared to other places.\n  I am involved in mission work. I go to west Africa with some \nregularity. I was in west Africa less than a month ago. This does not \nhave anything to do with being a Senator. It is doing the Lord's work \nin some of these places. I am talking about Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, \nAngola, Nigeria, Sierra Leone. For every one person who has been \nkilled, ethnically cleansed, killed in the Kosovar Albanians, for every \none, there have been 80 killed in just the two countries of Angola and \nSierra Leone.\n  Are they as brutal? Yes. They went into Sierra Leone and took whole \ntribes of people, lined up the children and cut their hands off. Entire \ntribes, the most brutal killing. For every one killed in Kosovo, 80 \nwere killed there. Why aren't we concerned about that? We have now come \nto the conclusion that it is humanitarian reasons that are motivating \nus. What is wrong with the 80-to-1 ratio in west Africa?\n  What about Rwanda? For every one that has been killed in Kosovo, \nthere have been 300 killed in the one country of Rwanda. You can go \nthroughout Africa and see much greater atrocities.\n  I don't know why people sit back and act like there is no problem \nanywhere in the world except there. I have to come to the same \nconclusion that some of the others have come to. There was an article \nwritten in the Minneapolis-St. Paul newspaper that I will submit for \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks that is very specific as to \nwhy it might be we are not concerned about this many Africans when just \na handful are killed in Kosovo.\n  You have to also ask why are so many killed in Kosovo. We know it is \na tragic thing. I have come to the conclusion that it is because of the \nbombing. I know that George Tenet, who is Director of Central \nIntelligence for the United States, said long before the bombing \nstarted, and this is from the Washington Post of March 31:\n\n       For weeks before NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia, \n     CIA Director Tenet had been forecasting Serb-led Yugo forces \n     might respond by accelerating the ethnic cleansing.\n\n  I asked the Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, before our committee \nif, in fact, that was true. He said:\n\n       With respect to General Tenet testifying that bombing \n     could, in fact, accelerate Milosevic's plans, we also knew \n     that.\n\n  So we did know that. So I am wondering how many of the Kosovar \nAlbanians are dead today who would be alive if we had not gone in there \nand bombed.\n  I have to say also that when I was in Tirana with witnesses, with \nnewspapers, with the media from America--who did not repeat this, by \nthe way--I interviewed everyone I could in that refugee camp outside of \nTirana. They were doing all right. They were well fed. They were taken \ncare of. I think they were as well taken care of as you would expect \nrefugees to be. There was not one who said they had any problems until \nthe bombing began.\n  Then I was interviewed by a Tirana Albanian TV station, and they \nsaid, ``When are you and the United States going to come out and take \ncare of all these refugees?'' I said, ``Why us?'' They said, ``Because \nif it weren't for you, they wouldn't be here.'' That is the way they \nare thinking there.\n  I am running out of time. I want to say one thing about the troops.\n  One of the reasons I went over to be there when the troops arrived is \nbecause I saw a New York Times article on April 13 that said, ``We're \ngoing into Albania, the middle of nowhere, with no infrastructure, \nnaked and exposed.'' And this was an official who gave this quote. So I \nwent over to see if, in fact, that was what I would find. And you know \nwhat? That is exactly what I found.\n  I went over with the troops. As we unloaded, we went down, and the \ntroops were over there building the tent cities. And, bless their \nhearts, they are doing a great job. Their spirits are high. They are \nready to do whatever their commanding officer tells them to do, which \nis what they said they would do when they joined the military. They are \nknee deep in mud, and they are exposed.\n\n  I will tell you a little bit about Albania that not many people know \nabout Albania. First of all, it is the poorest country in Europe. \nSecondly, it is one of the three most dangerous countries anywhere in \nthe world. Thirdly, back during the Hoxha regime, they actually \ndeclared it as an atheist nation. So it is the only declared atheist \nnation out there. And fourth, the pyramid scheme that took place in the \nmiddle 1990s was one that actually took over, from the military, all of \ntheir weaponry. I am talking about RPG-7s; that is the rifle-propelled \ngrenade, a very lethal weapon; the AK-47s--we know what that is--the \nSA-7s--that is the shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles; it can \nknock down our helicopters over there, and every other kind of thing--\nmortars, other kinds of equipment--and yet our troops are over there \nstanding in the mud without any infrastructure, without any protection, \nno troop protection. I am very, very concerned about that. If I ever \nsaw a place more ripe for a gradual escalation in mission creep, like \nVietnam, this is it.\n  Some people say, ``Where do you go from here?'' That always bothers \nme,\n\n[[Page S4540]]\n\nwhen people say, ``What are you going to do now?'' If it weren't for \nus, we would not be where we are today. ``This is something where we \nwere pushed into it. We had no control over it.'' We have a President \nwho decided he was going to declare war, and joined NATO in declaring \nwar, on a sovereign nation.\n  So there is where we are. But people say, ``If you try something \nelse, our reputation is on the line.'' How is our reputation on the \nline, if we have tucked our tail between our legs and run from Saddam \nHussein in Iraq? Do we have any weapons inspectors there in Iraq \nanymore? No, we do not. He kicked us out and laughed at us. In the \nMiddle East we are the laughingstock, and our foreign policy. So we \ncannot do worse than we did before.\n  I really believe there is no way out, that the only way to keep our \nPresident from sending American ground troops in--then it becomes \nirreversible. Then we are in for the long haul, when that happens. The \nonly way to stop it is, No. 1, today--or tomorrow morning, whenever \nthis comes up for a vote--to join the House with the votes that they \nvoted last week and not give the permission to use any type of force \nthat is necessary; and, secondly, inform the American people.\n  Let's face it, this administration is poll driven. This \nadministration does what the polls say most people are going to find \nacceptable. I will repeat and quote General Hawley one more time: ``I \nwould argue we cannot continue to accumulate contingencies,'' he said. \n``At some point you have to figure out how to get out of something.''\n  You see, it is easy to get into something. We learned that in Bosnia, \nwhen the President promised it would be 12 months, and then here it is \nseveral years later and we are still in there. So this is what we are \nfacing at this time.\n  So, anyway, I just think we are going to have to reject the McCain \nresolution. I anticipate we will do that. I think we need to inform the \nAmerican people what the real threat is, inform the American people as \nto what our ability to defend America is, where our vital national \nsecurity interests are, what it really is. If we do that, I think we \nare going to have the American people behind us.\n  I think also we have to keep in mind that if we end up saying, ``All \nright, those of you in Europe who have national security interests at \nstake, if you want to go ahead and take care of those national security \ninterests, you fight the battle,'' we will go back and we will regroup \nand we will start rebuilding our military so we can defend America on \ntwo regional fronts, and, ``We will protect you against Iraq and \nagainst North Korea.'' I think that is probably the greatest thing we \ncould do for our NATO allies.\n\n  Whatever the indication, we need to be out of there. This isn't our \nwar, and whatever it takes to get out we should do.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I understand the distinguished chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, is to be recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I thank my distinguished friend and great \nAmerican, Senator McCain.\n  Madam President, before commenting on the substance of the resolution \nbefore us today, I think I ought to make it clear that I take exception \nto the circumstances that would have been dictated by the War Powers \nAct had the Foreign Relations Committee not acted voluntarily this past \nFriday morning to take an action. In my judgment, the War Powers Act is \nill considered and fundamentally unconstitutional, as such \ndistinguished Senators of years gone by have declared it to be--along \nwith near unanimity of sitting conservative Senators today.\n  In any case, Madam President, including the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer at the moment, this past Friday, April 30, the Foreign \nRelations Committee met formally and officially reported S.J. Res. 20 \nwithout recommendation in order to avoid setting a precedent in support \nof the War Powers Act. Let me repeat, had we not met and had we not \nreported the type of legislation that we did report, we would have set \na precedent in support of the War Powers Act. And I would resign from \nthe Senate before I would have done that voluntarily. The committee \nreported S.J. Res. 20 without recommendation by a vote of 14-4.\n  While I do support the underlying sentiment of the resolution offered \nby my friend, John McCain, to win the war against Serbia, I do not--and \nI cannot--support S.J. Res. 20.\n  In times of armed conflict between the United States and a hostile \npower, it is the duty of the President of the United States, in his \nrole as Commander in Chief, to provide leadership in seeking to achieve \nour political and military objectives.\n  The Senate cannot and must not force the President to take measures \nthat he is unwilling or unprepared to take. So I am not prepared to \nsign off prematurely on measures and methods on which I do not yet have \ndetails.\n  Approval of this resolution would mistakenly--even dangerously \nperhaps--authorize the President to use force in a manner far exceeding \nanything that he has thus far publicly or privately indicated to the \nCongress.\n  Now, approval of this resolution would also provide the President \nwith prior congressional approval--prior congressional approval--for \nany and all action he may want to subsequently undertake in prosecuting \nthe war--and that is what it is--against Serbia. And that would have \nthe effect of preventing Congress from exercising its responsibilities \nin authorizing, or limiting, options as circumstances may change.\n  Now let me be clear: I detest the unspeakably cruel acts committed by \nthe Milosevic forces, and I certainly pray for that evil man's early \nand speedy defeat in this war. But that, however, is not what this \nresolution is about, despite what are, without doubt, the good \nintentions by the author.\n  I worry that a negative vote by the Senate on S.J. Res. 20 will \nprovide comfort to Mr. Milosevic, and lead him to assume falsely that \nthe United States is not resolute in its determination to prevail in \nthis conflict. Yet I am more concerned about what may be unintended \neffects of this resolution.\n  This resolution would simply give the President a blank check. It \nwould provide the President with prior Congressional approval for \nanything and everything the President may decide to undertake in \nprosecuting the war against Serbia.\n  S.J. Res. 20 puts the cart before the horse. Giving the President \ncarte blanche to do whatever he wants in Kosovo without first coming to \nCongress to explain his mission and ask for authorization, is not a \nsolution for the President's failure to follow the Constitution.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during today's \ndebate no motions be in order and at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, the majority \nleader be recognized to make a motion to table S.J. Res. 20.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just one moment to explain what has \ntranspired. We have a number of Senators who wish to be heard on this \nissue. I view this as a procedural vote by moving to table it. We have \nthis issue before us at this time because of the War Powers Act. There \nwas a lot of feeling that we should have postponed this debate and vote \nuntil a later time, but under our rules we couldn't get that done. That \nis why Senator Daschle and I felt at this time that a procedural motion \nto table was appropriate and that that vote should occur at 5:30.\n  Senator Daschle is on the way back, but I understand he has agreed to \nthis request. You cannot cut Senators off who are asking to speak on a \nmatter of this magnitude. We have worked out an arrangement. We have \ngone into the night. There are probably an hour or two more of speeches \nleft, and that way we will have a vote in the morning. Even if Senators \nhad to come back for a 9:30 vote, they would have to be here tonight \nanyway. So I apologize for any inconvenience that may be caused by this \ndelay of the vote for Senators who did come back for the 5:30 vote, but \nit seems it is the fair thing to do at this time.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is true, Senator Daschle does agree with this. I thank \nthe leader for this accommodation. There are a number of people who do \nwish to speak. I think it is wise not to cut them off. I thank you and \nthe Democratic leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. We have a \ndifferent view of the meaning of this vote, but I do appreciate his \nallowing numerous Senators who wish to speak on this issue to speak \nthis evening before the vote tomorrow.\n  I recognize Senator Robb for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to endorse emphatically granting to \nthe Commander in Chief the authority he needs to achieve our military \nobjectives and the objectives of our NATO alliance against the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia. Rather than considering limitations to the \nPresident's powers, as they are interpreted through the War Powers Act, \nwe ought to be singularly focused on aiding his ability to prosecute \nand end this war as quickly as possible. That is why I am an original \ncosponsor of this resolution permitting the use of all necessary force \nand other means to accomplish our goals in the Kosovo region of \nYugoslavia.\n  We are now weeks into an air campaign that may last months. Americans \nneed to prepare themselves now, psychologically at least, for war. War \nis not risk free. We have to accept the fact and the responsibility \nthat goes with it that we may well lose significant numbers of American \nlives, and we can't wait to see how it turns out before we risk taking \na stand for which we will be and should be held accountable.\n\n  The longer we exhibit a lack of resolve to see this through to \nconclusion, the longer it is going to last, the more it is going to \ncost, and the greater the risk that the U.S. and alliances' casualties \nwill mount. In effect, Mr. President, we are exacerbating everything we \npurport to worry about--time, money, and, most importantly, lives--and \nwe protract the suffering of those we are trying to save.\n  We cannot and should not tolerate defeat or compromise simply because \nwe lack the will and conviction to win. Doing so would injure the \ncredibility we fought so hard to rebuild in Operation Desert Storm. It \nis simply inconceivable to me that we would allow the confidence \nrestored in American military power in Iraq to be frittered away in the \nBalkans. Given the importance of this military campaign, I was stunned \nby last week's House vote on support for current operations, and remain \ndeeply concerned that individual feelings about our Commander in Chief \nseem to be influencing votes that have consequences that are so much \nmore important than any Commander in Chief.\n  At the same time, I am deeply concerned about our unwillingness to \naccept responsibility for our position of world leadership. I regret \nthat fewer and fewer of our citizens are willing to take necessary \nrisks. There are beliefs and principles that our founders were willing \nto die for, and we cannot shrink from the challenge that we face today.\n  This resolution simply gives the Commander in Chief the options \nnecessary to implement our military objectives, and it is consistent \nwith my belief that winning the conflict is of paramount importance.\n  I commend Senators McCain and Biden for their efforts today and urge \nsupport for the resolution and opposition to the tabling motion.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nKentucky. Excuse me. I am sorry. I apologize to the Senator from \nKentucky. The Senator from Vermont is next. I apologize to the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has been doing a \ngood job of running the traffic here today. I commend the Senator from \nArizona for helping make the arrangements, and the Senator from \nDelaware for putting this vote off until tomorrow. I think there are a \nnumber of Senators who do wish to speak on both sides of this issue and \nshould have a chance to speak. The Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom Delaware and other sponsors of this amendment, the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, and others are right in saying, give us a chance \nto speak before voting.\n  Mr. President, I intend to vote against tabling this resolution. I \nwant other Senators to be very clear why I will not join the \ndistinguished majority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader \nin their motion to table and why, like what I might normally do in a \ncase like this, I will vote against such a leadership motion.\n  The United States, as the leader of NATO, is engaged in a costly and \ndangerous war in Kosovo that has immense importance for the people of \nKosovo, for NATO, and for humanity. Horrendous war crimes are being \nperpetrated by President Milosevic's forces, and I believe that NATO \nhas no alternative but to try to stop them.\n  We could debate how and why we got into this. We could debate, \nobviously, whether we are pursuing the best strategy to achieve our \ngoals. We could debate the rationale for the $6 billion in supplemental \nfunds the President has asked for to continue the war and care for the \n1.5 million refugees and displaced people who are struggling to \nsurvive, many in a life-and-death struggle, but so far we have not had \nthat debate.\n  Now, I support the supplemental funding. In fact, I believe the \nrequest for humanitarian assistance is too little. I believe we are not \nfacing up to the reality that these refugees are not going to go back \nthis year, and we are going to come very quickly to the fall months in \nthat part of the world and into the winter. I know the weather; it is \nnot unlike the weather in my own State of Vermont. They are going to be \nthere--hundreds of thousands, if not well over a million refugees--\nthroughout next winter. We are not looking at what those costs are \ngoing to be. I also will oppose this motion to table because I believe \nit is time for the Senate to debate our policy in Kosovo and take a \nstand on it one way or the other.\n  I want to be clear that by voting against tabling, I am not voting on \nthe merits of this resolution. I am voting only to have a debate. The \nPresident has not sought such broad, open-ended authorization in the \nresolution. But even if he had, it is possible that the resolution may \nbe too broadly worded. That is the sort of thing we would find in a \ndebate, and I believe that the proponents of the resolution have done a \nservice to the Senate by bringing it before us for a debate. If we \nthink it should be different, then we can amend it and vote on it.\n  As my distinguished friend from West Virginia, the senior Senator, \nhas noted, this resolution, if approved, would prematurely write the \nCongress out of any future debate on Kosovo. He raises a good issue, \nbut one that should be debated. For example, the resolution would \nauthorize the President to deploy ground troops even though he has not \nexpressed an intention to do so, nor provided an assessment of what the \ncosts and benefits of such a deployment would be.\n  But we need to debate this resolution. We saw what happened last week \nin the House--a partisan, muddled exercise that sent conflicting \nmessages and solved nothing. For too long, we have seen a policy in \nKosovo that is guided more by polls than by a policy with clearly \ndefined, achievable goals and a credible strategy for achieving them.\n  The Senate can be the conscience of the Nation, and I believe, after \nmy years here, the Senate should be the conscience of the Nation, and \nsometimes it is--but only when we rise to the occasion and debate an \nissue, as difficult as it may be. Issues of war and going to war and \ncommitting our men and women to war is as difficult an issue as we \ncould ever debate here. It is an issue of the utmost gravity. It cries \nout for a thorough debate, and we should not shrink from it. We need \nthe Senate to speak with substance, not sound bites, and we need the \nadministration to do the same. The world's attention is on Kosovo. Many \nAmerican lives are at stake, and so are billions of dollars of \ntaxpayers' money.\n\n  So let us debate the resolution. The war is in its second month, and \nthere is\n\n[[Page S4542]]\n\nno end in sight. I must say again that I disagree with our leadership \nin saying that we should table this motion. I don't believe that. I \ndon't believe the Senator from Arizona wishes this resolution to be \ntabled either. Let us debate. We will either vote for or against it. We \nwill either vote to amend it or not. But 100 Senators will stand up and \nvote one way or another on this issue. Frankly, I think the American \npeople would like to see that because they would like that kind of \nguidance.\n  Mr. President, I will not shrink from that responsibility. I will \nvote tomorrow against tabling this resolution. The resolution will \nprobably be tabled. I hope that it will not be and that the Senate will \nstop all hearings, all other matters, and stay here and debate this \nresolution. We could do it. We have the people here to do it. We have \nthe expertise here. I think we can come out with a very clear statement \nof American policy--perhaps a clearer one than we have heard to date.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona for his \nusual courtesy. I see my distinguished colleague from Kentucky on the \nfloor awaiting recognition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont and \napologize for almost putting him out of order. The Senator from \nKentucky wishes to speak for 10 minutes. I yield to him for that \npurpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senate Joint \nResolution 20 for a number of reasons, and in favor of tabling.\n  First of all, we have no national security interest to intervene in \nthis civil war. I have not heard one compelling reason from President \nClinton, the Pentagon, the Secretary of State, my colleagues, or anyone \nelse as to why America needs to send her troops halfway around the \nglobe and into the middle of another nation's civil war.\n  I am dismayed to see on television every night the images of refugees \nfleeing their destroyed homes and villages, and everybody should be \ndisheartened by this horrific tragedy. But if there should be any \nimmediate intervention into this civil war, let it come directly from \nthose European neighbors where this tragedy is occurring. This is \nhappening in Europe's backyard, and it has been happening there for \ncentury upon century.\n  We need to force Europe to deal with this and let them take the lead. \nAre we going to intervene wherever we see these images and similar ones \non our television every night? If so, then America will be everywhere \nat all times and our military will be spread throughout the corners of \nthe world, into different regional, civil, ethnic, and tribal \nconflicts, and our military will be stretched to the point of breaking.\n  Second, by using whatever force necessary by the United States in \nthis region, we will be pulling our troops and weapons out of regions \nwhere we truly have an interest.\n  Are we ready to stop the no-fly zone around Iraq and send our troops \ninto a ground war in Kosovo? This could entice Saddam Hussein to invade \nother Middle Eastern countries, much like he did Kuwait. Are we ready \nto dive into a war in Kosovo by pulling our military forces out and \naway from our presence on the border of North Korea?\n  Iraq and North Korea are the two most dangerous hot spots in the \nworld. Can we justify scaling back our efforts in those two regions to \nplay referee in a civil war in Kosovo?\n  Are we prepared to let Saddam Hussein out of the cage and pull away \nfrom North Korea, which has a nuclear missile capability? These two \nareas hold our national security interests. I don't believe Kosovo is \neven close by comparison.\n  Third, because of Kosovo, our military readiness is suffering. The \nClinton administration believes our military is ready for a variety of \nmissions. Yet, President Clinton has required more of our soldiers with \nless money and support.\n  In the past 10 years, the national defense budget has been cut by \napproximately $120 billion. The U.S. military force structure has been \nreduced by more than 30 percent. The Department of Defense operations \nand maintenance accounts have been reduced by 40 percent.\n  The Department of Defense procurement funding has declined by more \nthan 50 percent. Operational commitments for the U.S. military have \nincreased fourfold.\n  The Army has reduced its ranks by over 630,000 soldiers and \ncivilians, closed over 700 installations at home and overseas, and cut \n10 divisions from its force structure.\n  The Army has reduced its presence in Europe from 215,000 to 65,000 \npersonnel.\n  The Army has averaged 14 major deployments every four years, \nincreased significantly from the cold war trend of one deployment every \nfour years.\n  The Air Force has been downsized by nearly 40 percent, while at the \nsame time experiencing a fourfold increase in operational commitments.\n  And I could go on and on as to how we are decreasing the power and \nforce of our military while asking them to do more and more.\n  And just last week the President called up 33,000 reservists to \nanswer his call to Kosovo.\n  Why? It is most likely because recruitment is at the lowest it has \never been and because our soldiers are leaving the Armed Forces in \ndroves.\n  Here are a couple quotes I found that are very timely to this debate \nand even more disturbing.\n\n       The high level of operations over the past several years is \n     beginning to wear on both our people and our systems and is \n     stressing our readiness.\n\n  That was what Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, General Ralph Eberhart \nsaid in the Air Force Times.\n  Here's another quote. This is from General Gordon Sullivan, former \nArmy Chief of Staff.\n\n       With our national budget now allocating only 3 percent of \n     the gross domestic product to defense, I see our future \n     national security in peril.\n\n  And finally a quote from the chief sponsor of this Senate joint \nresolution who is also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  He said in 1998 in the July issue of Defense Daily, that he currently \nsees, and I quote, ``very serious echoes of the 1970s when we had a \nhollow army.''\n  He said, ``I think that we have failed to modernize the force.''\n  And he adds, ``We're losing qualified men and women. We've having to \nlower our recruiting standards.''\n  Mr. President, with this information, how can we vote and pass a \nresolution knowing that our military is not ready to carry out a \nmission which authorizes President Clinton to use all force necessary \nto accomplish United States and NATO objectives in the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia?\n  And how can we expect our military to fully enter into this war \nwithout being told what their mission is, how long they will be \ndeployed there, and what their exit strategy is.\n  The military does not know, the American people do not know, the \nCongress does not know, and I doubt President Clinton knows what those \nanswers are that many of my colleagues in Congress have been asking for \nmonths.\n  Will there be more troops deployed if our goals and mission are not \nmet?\n  What are the rules of engagement?\n  How will this mission be paid for and will valuable dollars be pulled \nfrom military readiness accounts to pay for this deployment?\n  What, if any, is our exit strategy?\n  We need to reject this resolution for the sake of our military and \nfor the sake of the stature of the United States in the world.\n  We have no national security interests to throw our soldiers into a \nwar in Kosovo.\n  And we have had no answers from this administration who would dare \nthrow our country into a war as to why this is a national security \ninterest to the United States.\n  If rejecting this resolution undermines NATO, then so be it and let \nit undermine NATO.\n  This administration has already warped NATO by turning it into an \noffensive force instead of its original nature of being a defensive \nforce against Soviet threats.\n  Let us not throw our sons and daughters into war to preserve an \ninternational organization.\n  Please let us reject this resolution, and if necessary table it \ntomorrow.\n  Thank you. I thank the President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I grant myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am grateful to those of my colleagues \nwho\n\n[[Page S4543]]\n\nhave come to the floor this afternoon to speak on our war with Serbia, \nand even those who have spoken in opposition to the pending resolution.\n  The role of the United States in the Balkans is obviously a matter of \nlife and death, and surely deserves serious discussion in the Senate of \nthe United States. So I thank those Senators who have recognized the \nimportance of having this debate.\n  I want to respond briefly to a few of the points made in opposition \nto the resolution. First, the resolution gives too broad a grant of \nauthority to the President.\n  As I observed earlier, the Presidency already has its authority. The \nConstitution gives Congress the sole right to declare war. It does not \ngive us the right to declare peace unless we are asked to ratify a \npeace treaty, or if we refuse to appropriate money for the conduct of \nthe war. That is the only peacemaking authority that we possess.\n  If this Senate does nothing, and it seems at the moment to be the \nSenate's preferred course of action, the President has the power to \ncommit all armies to the conflict in Yugoslavia tomorrow, if he should \nsuddenly decide to seek victory there. Unless we cut off the money, \nnothing but his own lack of resolve can stop him from doing whatever is \nnecessary to win the war.\n  I offered the resolution not because I felt the President needed the \nauthority but to encourage him to fight this war in a manner most \nlikely to achieve our goals in Kosovo.\n  So, please, Mr. President, let us hear no more criticism that the \nsponsors have given too much power to the President. The Constitution \nwisely gave him that power long before any of us arrived on the scene. \nIf the opponents want to prevent the President from exercising the full \npower of his office, and fighting this war as if the stakes are as high \nas he claims they are, then they should not vote for the supplemental \nappropriations bill that will soon be on the floor. Any Senator who \nsupports the troops but opposes this war as unjust, unnecessary, \nunwise, and not in our interest should also vote against the \nsupplemental bill.\n  Mr. President, you can't support the troops and permit them to be \nsent into a conflict that doesn't justify their sacrifice. Trust me. \nThe troops would rather be spared that kind of support.\n  If you believe this war is worth fighting, or if you believe that, \nonce begun, America's vital interests and most treasured values are \nimperiled in this war, then vote to encourage the President to do the \nright thing by our service men and women. Vote to implore him to fight \nto win this war as soon as possible so that what losses we do incur \nwill not be in vain. Have no fear that our troops won't appreciate it. \nThey will do their duty, and they will expect us to do ours. They will \nwin this war for us, the alliance we led, the people of Kosovo and for \nthe values of the distinguished America for all of our history. They \nwill win this war if only their elected leaders allow them to.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senator from New Mexico be recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, let me thank the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona and those who have joined him in this cause.\n  While I disagree, it certainly should not be taken as any diminution \nof the great respect I have for John McCain and a number of Senators \nwho are here on the floor to support this issue.\n  But, Mr. President, I believe what we should do is to prepare a \nletter to the President of the United States. I think we should say to \nthe President something like this: ``Mr. President, you are the \nCommander in Chief. Mr. President, we are engaged in a limited military \nundertaking joined by our NATO allies in the Kosovo-Yugoslavia \narea. You, Mr. President, have decided that we should do this; you have \ndecided the limitation and the scope of our involvement.''\n\n  When the appropriations bill comes along we will make sure our \nmilitary men and women get everything they need to protect themselves \nadequately and in the most safe manner possible, so we are going to \nsupport them with all the money they need.\n  Mr. President, we anxiously await further requests from you. If, as a \nmatter of fact, you believe we should proceed beyond the current \nlimited involvement to a broader involvement. If you desire to have our \nmilitary men and women on the ground trying to take part in operations \nin Kosovo and Yugoslavia so that what you, Mr. President, say the goal \nis might be accomplished, you request that of the Senate. We should \nsign this letter and say that we await the President's request, and it \nwill be dealt with immediately.\n  Frankly, the reason I start my comments that way is I don't believe \nwe should say to a President of the United States and his military \ncommanders, who apparently agree with him, how to conduct his military \noperations. They don't want to even plan for a land war--the President \nhas said that many times. He has said, If you gave me authority I \nwouldn't use it. He has made up his mind that this is the kind of war \nhe wants to conduct.\n  We are not privy as Senators to what relationship exists between the \nNATO countries and the United States of America regarding what is going \non over there. What will change some people's minds about their unity \nof people is if America acts unilaterally or in some way inconsistent \nwith their understandings and agreement. That is not for the Congress; \nwe don't know about those relationships. We don't know about the \nnegotiations taking place now to try to bring this to a conclusion. God \nwilling, it will be brought to a conclusion sooner rather than later.\n  Why should we take unilateral action when he does not ask Congress \nfor it. Regardless of what the Senate may tell him, he alone has the \nauthority to conduct this war.\n  My friend from Arizona almost makes my case by saying whether we do \nthis or not, he has the authority. I think that is what I heard him \nsay--whether we do this or not he has the authority. What are we up to?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Same thing we were up to in the Persian Gulf resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He is not asking for it. That is the big difference \nwith the Persian Gulf resolution. President Bush asked us in writing \nand stated what it was about.\n  My other observation--in fact, if the President of the United States \nand our military commander serving our Nation want to go beyond what we \nare doing now, I would think he would at least tell us what it means. \nIf they sought from us what President Bush sought, to go into a land \nwar for some reason over there--and it may be necessary--then he should \nrequest our approval.\n  As a matter of fact, I wonder from time to time why the President \nisn't asking for it. The point is, if we asked for it, he would specify \nhis objectives. He wouldn't just send something up here and say he \nwants to have our men and women go in and do this. We would have some \nbriefings and we would understand what the end game is. We might even \nunderstand the risks involved in his plans. Even in expeditiously \ntreating a request, we would get some answers we don't have today. I \nthink we should expect those answers.\n  I don't believe we should involve ourselves in a military venture \ninto the great unknown of that area because we want to in some way tell \nthe President of the United States and the generals and Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, we want to give you more authority than you \nthink you need; we want to tell you we are giving you more authority \nthan you think you need.\n  We are not offering them any authority that they don't have already \nunder the commander and chief powers of the Constitution.\n  I want to make it absolutely clear that I don't agree with my friend, \nJohn McCain, that in order to support the men and women engaged over \nthere in a military event that the President has ordered, that we \nshould not vote for money to protect them and give them what they need \nunless we are for this resolution. Those just don't follow. As a matter \nof fact, I want to assure those who are wondering, this is one Senator \nwho will give them as much money as I can justify, to make sure our \nmilitary is better prepared when we come out of this skirmish than we \nwere when we went in. I do that without any concern that I have not \nvoted to give the President authority to do more because they\n\n[[Page S4544]]\n\nare already there; I believe I am neglectful in my duty if I did not \ngive them emergency money.\n  First of all, it wouldn't bring them home because they could go on \nfor a long time under the President's Commander in Chief authority. By \nnot doing a supplemental, we wouldn't be getting them out of there. We \nwouldn't be ending it precipitously.\n  From my standpoint, the Members of the Senate who don't vote for this \nresolution ought to join in a letter to the President and tell him \nunequivocally, Mr. President, we understand you are the Commander in \nChief, we understand you put us there. Some of us didn't agree but they \nare there and now here is a letter from us saying if you need more \nauthority from us to engage in a ground war, would you send us a \nrequest and brief us adequately on why you need it and we will vote \nquickly and decide what are our concerted feelings about that event.\n  I think that is a far better way to do it. I will have a letter, in \ncase any Senators would like to join me in sending that kind of letter \nto the President. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 3, 1999.\n       Dear President Clinton: As a representative of our \n     country's citizens and strong supporter of our military men \n     and women, I feel obliged to convey my position with you \n     regarding the U.S. involvement in hostilities in Kosovo. As \n     you well know, several legislative packages already exist \n     which would propose to preempt, further define, or curtail \n     your authority and responsibilities as President. I believe \n     that these options are neither prudent at this particular \n     time, nor do they necessarily conform with desired consensus \n     in an effort that involves the active engagement of our \n     military in a hostile situation.\n       I fully acknowledge you as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. \n     forces. I recognize that this Office gives you broad \n     authorities and grave responsibilities in decisions of \n     national security and foreign policy. As Commander-in-Chief \n     you have chosen to take the lead in this air war. As before, \n     I continue to look to you and your military advisors to \n     determine what objectives our military seeks and determine \n     what means may be necessary to attain such objectives. As you \n     well know, these are decisions that directly impact the daily \n     lives of citizens throughout this country and will have long-\n     term implications for the security and prosperity of the \n     American people.\n       If you should decide that this operation requires means \n     beyond the current air campaign, I respectfully ask that you \n     send us your request.\n       Upon receiving any such request, I offer you my commitment \n     to bring the matter before the Senate for deliberation and a \n     decision as expeditiously as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n\n     ________________________________________\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the Senator \nfor yielding me the time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am intrigued at the prospect of exercising our \nconstitutional responsibility through a letter to the President.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. To my colleague from Utah, Mr. Hatch, I yield 1 or 2 \nminutes for some observations.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, today I stand in support of this resolution offered by \nthe Senator from Arizona. I think we all must acknowledge his \nexperience in military issues. And, few of us in the Senate can speak \nwith the authority that his personal experience in war has given him.\n  I do not believe that we should be debating this today because of the \nWar Powers Act, which I have always believed to be unconstitutional. \nBut, Mr. President, if the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, it is \nunconstitutional under President Clinton as much as it was under \nPresident Nixon. I, for one, will not reverse my legal assessment of \nthe act just because of the current officeholder in the White House.\n  I confess that I do not have a great deal of confidence in the \nforeign policy of the Clinton Administration, Mr. President. I have \nbeen outspoken about this President's failures, particularly in dealing \nwith this ongoing crisis in the Balkans.\n  But, I do not think we should shape analysis, shade history, or \nignore facts to serve our profound discomfort with this \nAdministration's foreign policy.\n  For example, I would not join some members of the other body when \nthey argue that Operation Allied Force caused the genocidal campaign \nnow being perpetrated by Milosevic's troops and thugs in Kosovo. That \nis a deplorable abandonment of analytic thinking, an egregious failure \nto recognize cause and effect.\n  We know, Mr. President, that the Serbs were planning this program of \nethnic uprooting, of civilian massacres and worse. We know that the \nSerbs were preparing this for nearly a year. We know that, for many \nyears, the official Serbian regime practiced a form of apartheid toward \nthe Kosovar Albanians. And we know that genocide and ethnic cleansing \nare what Slobodan Milosevic does. It's on his resume.\n  This is Milosevic's fourth war. This is not a manipulation of \nreality. In 1991, Milosevic's Yugoslav military attacked Slovenia and \nCroatia. In 1992, he began a war in Bosnia that led to the deaths of \nover 250,000 people, most of whom were civilians.\n  And, let us not forget Vukovar, Mr. President, the Croatian city \nbesieged and demolished by Serb forces, who, upon the fall of the city, \nentered and massacred residents, including patients trapped in \nhospitals.\n  Let us not forget Srebrenica, Mr. President, when Milosevic's \ngeneral, Ratko Mladic, captured the Muslim town, marched 7,000 men and \nboys into open fields outside of town and massacred them in open \ngraves. This is what Milosevic does.\n  His reward for these wars was to be a negotiating partner at Dayton, \nOhio. He survived because the Clinton administration operates under \nnaive notions of peace and a feckless obeisance to polls. When it \nleads, it follows chimeras of the Vietnam protester generation; most of \nthe time it follows.\n  For the Clinton Administration, Mr. President, the pursuit of peace \nis the pursuit of a childish notion: The notion that peace is the \nabsence of conflict. Such a simplistic view of peace explains why they \nhave committed so many mistakes in the Balkans. The absence of \nconflict, Richard Nixon once wrote, exists only in two places: in the \ngrave and at the typewriter. The point is not the absence of conflict, \nbut the management of conflict so that it does not erupt into violence.\n  And, Mr. President, to continue to negotiate with Slobodan Milosevic, \nas we did until last month, and as I suspect the Administration would \ndo if it could, is a guarantee of greater, future violence. The \nevidence is plenty and irrefutable, in my opinion, that the \nultranationalist regime Milosevic must have war to survive. That is \nwhy, Mr. President, we are seeing the brutal effects of Milosevic's \nfourth war today.\n  Many are very uncomfortable in giving this President the kind of \nsupport stated in this resolution. Columnist William Safire in Monday's \nNew York Times called it ``The Price of Distrust,'' and stated that \n``Clinton has so few followers in Congress because he is himself the \nworld's leading follower.''\n  Recall how candidate Clinton advocated bombing Slobodan Milosevic in \n1992 as part of the ``lift and strike'' strategy (lift the embargo on \nthe Bosnians and strike the Serbs) to aid the Bosnians, who were \ndesperately holding off Milosevic's forces. I promoted ``lift and \nstrike'' in 1992. But when candidate Clinton became President Clinton, \nhe lost his desire to attack Milosevic and adopted a policy of leading \nthe Europeans, whose mismanagement of the conflict ultimately required \nAmerican leadership in 1995.\n\n  I have a vivid and bitter memory of a dramatic discussion I had with \nthen Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Siladzic in the summer of 1995, when \nhe had come to the U.S. to plead for us to lift our arms embargo \nagainst his forces besieged by the well-armed Serbs. He met with me \nmoments after pleading, unsuccessfully, with Vice President Gore. \nPresident Clinton had refused to meet with him. When I asked the Prime \nMinister what was the Vice President's reasoning, I was told that the \nAdministration believed that lifting the arms embargo would cause the \nSerbs to attack the eastern enclaves of Zepa, Gorazde and Srebrenica.\n  This is, of course, what the Serbs did anyway, weeks later. Over \n8,000 unarmed men and boys were herded out of town and massacred. In \nretrospect, I do not know what is more astounding: The Administration's \ncompletely fallacious logic then, or the fact that, with the graves of \nSrebrenica as a glaring lesson, they were unprepared for Milosevic's \ncampaign of genocide unleashed in the last month.\n\n[[Page S4545]]\n\n  In spite of these criticisms, I believe there are essential American \nnational interests at stake in the Balkans. Europe has always been \nimportant to the United States, both politically and economically. We \ncannot stand by and watch while this region is continually disrupted. \nWe cannot accept instability in a region that is a geopolitical \ncrossroads and an economic thoroughfare benefitting U.S. security and \ntrade.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution. Its \npurpose is to indicate a congressional stand on a war that is going \ninto its second month. Countries in the region are being destabilized. \nAlbanian and Croatian borders have been crossed by Serbian military \nforces, and the slaughter going on in Kosovo has seen nothing like it \nin Europe since the Holocaust.\n  In the wake of these events, I believe the United States must lead. \nIf we wish our own interests to be secure, we cannot afford to ignore \ninstability in other key regions. We cannot look the other way and \nimagine that such conflict will not have an impact on us.\n  And, we cannot abdicate our role in NATO, perhaps the most successful \nmilitary alliance of the post-war era. If NATO, comprised of \ndemocratic, freedom-loving nations of Europe, fails, we face untold \npolitical and military tests in the future.\n  Yes, Mr. President, there have been egregious mistakes conducted in \nthe prosecution of this war. No mistake has been greater than the \nrepeated assertion that we would not even plan for the possibility of \nground forces.\n  This is not political leadership, Mr. President, it is leadership \nparalysis. It will lead, I fear, to a defeat for NATO, to a diminution \nof the symbolic power of the U.S. military, and an increase in the \ninsecurity this country will face in the very near future.\n  Other NATO leaders such as British Prime Minister Tony Blair--who, \nnever once in his political career has been referred to as a ``hawk''--\nhave at least the sensibility to recommend planning for the possibility \nof ground forces.\n  The most critical error made by this Administration has been to \nreiterate our refusal to consider ground forces. This self-limiting \nrhetoric--which the public doesn't even believe--has compromised our \nmilitary campaign so far.\n  By declaring to Milosevic what we will not do, we have prolonged the \nair campaign, and thereby increased the risks to the pilots and their \nsupport. We have undermined out political goals, which, one must \npresume, can only be achieved by meeting our military goals. In short, \nwe have given Milosevic the incentive to ``wait NATO out.''\n  And this is what leads us to this debate today, Mr. President. I \nbelieve that NATO, as the alliance led by this country for half a \ncentury, embodies both the symbolic and real military strength of this \ncountry. If it is to engage in war, as it is now, it should not limit \nits planning so that we increase the chance of failure. That is what is \nhappening right now.\n  Some fear that we give this President a blank check with this \nresolution. We should also consider that such reticence by the Senate \nposition can be interpreted as a lack of resolve by Milosevic and his \ngang of killers.\n  It could also be read by this President as an excuse to conclude this \nwar in a way that does not meet even the scant NATO objectives \narticulated so far.\n  One thing we have witnessed over the past decade in the Balkans, Mr. \nPresident, is that the longer we wait, the lousier the options. Fear of \nincrementalism can become incrementalism. We have seen this in years of \nignoring the situation each time until it escalates and then meeting \nthat escalation with stop-gap measures.\n  Had we used airpower to degrade or destroy Milosevic's regime in the \nearly part of this decade, we would most likely have seen the rise of a \nSerbian alternative to his regime. By allowing him to stay in power, he \nhas eviscerated the legitimate democratic opposition in Serbia, and he \nhas coalesced his power by bringing in the worst of the \nultranationalists. So today, at the end of a decade of genocidal wars \nled by Milosevic, we appear feckless in the face of yet another war.\n\n  Mr. President, let me predict now that if Milosevic's military is not \ndestroyed--whether by air, by land, or by sea--this will not be the \nlast war. Ask the leaders of Albania and Macedonia if they feel secure \nhaving a strong Serb military led by Milosevic camped on their borders. \nAsk the Hungarian leadership.\n  Let me be clear about this: This is not an instruction to the \nPresident to send in ground forces. I do not believe we should \nmicromanage wars. To the extent that air power can get the job done, I \nwould be very happy not to send American troops into this theater.\n  But, this resolution indicates that we accept no self-limiting \nconditions on our military options. The leader of the United States has \nhamstrung the most modern, effective military operation in history. \nBut, this resolution puts him on notice: If he fails to achieve the \nobjectives, he will not turn to the supporters of this resolution and \ndeclare we were responsible for the failure.\n  Some insist that this is primarily a ``civil war,'' and that there is \nthe matter of Serbian sovereignty to respect. I would make three brief \nremarks regarding this view.\n  One, the rapid depopulation of hundreds of thousands of people and \ntheir forced movement across borders is an aggressive act, with \ndestabilizing consequences for the region. If, for example, the Chinese \nwere to unleash a million refugees across the Pacific to our shores, we \nwould consider that an aggressive act.\n  Second, international law is by no means clear in protecting the \nright of a brutal regime to slaughter its citizens.\n  And, third, Mr. President, while we can debate the level of national \ninterest in Kosovo, I do not believe that we, in this body, Republican \nor Democrat, advocate for the sovereign rights of genocidal dictators.\n  Mr. President, I greatly fear the consequences of failing in our war \nagainst Milosevic. Yes, it is complicated, as are most matters of \nforeign policy. Yes, we do not have excellent options, although rarely \nin our history have we had them.\n  But we cannot deny the reality of an aggressive dictator waging war \nafter war in Europe, in a Europe this country has recognized is in our \nnational interest, a Europe over which we fought two hot wars and one \nCold War.\n  The result of our victory in that Cold War was the liberation of \neastern Europe. One dictator remaining in southeastern Europe has \ninflamed the region, and if he continues undefeated, others will rise \nin Europe and elsewhere. Among them will be some who believe they are \ndestined to challenge America.\n  Some of these dictators have already shown themselves, such as Saddam \nHussein. And, he's taking notes. Seeing the survival of Slobodan \nMilosevic, he and others will challenge us again and again. I predict, \nMr. President, that with the survival of Slobodan Milosevic, the \nsecurity of this country will be increasingly challenged.\n  Mr. President, the point of this resolution is to indicate that the \nSenate of the United States will support whatever it takes to achieve \nthe NATO objectives. If NATO fails--and there is no objective reason \nthat it should--it will be because of a failure of political will.\n  The supporters of this resolution, every one of them, indicate today \nthat we have the political will. I expect that we will have the \nopportunity in the near future when members who support tabling the \nresolution will be able to revisit the debate and demonstrate their \nresolve as well.\n  Discomfort and disappointment with the Administration's conduct of \nthis war is not an excuse for us to hedge our political will, Mr. \nPresident. That is why I will support the McCain resolution. At the end \nof the day, history does not wait for a heroic administration.\n  As I stand to address this debate, I recall the Boland amendment \ndebates in the 1980s, and the constant interference with the \nPresident's right to resolve foreign policy issues. I argued that this \nviolated the Constitution at that time, and I tend to disagree today \nwith some Republicans who are reluctant to support the President simply \nbecause the tables have turned.\n  I support the McCain resolution. I think it is the right thing. All \nwe do is give the President the authorization to use all necessary \nforce to support our objectives. It seems to me that is a pretty \nreasonable thing for which to ask.\n  Three years ago we met with Milosevic in Belgrade. This is a man\n\n[[Page S4546]]\n\nwho has put himself in power and kept himself in power through ethnic \nconflict. If NATO and this President don't do what is right here, this \nman will continue that ethnic conflict and it will lead to more wars.\n  In 1992, I recommended a lift-and-strike strategy--lift the embargo \nand strike Milosevic's army that was committing genocidal war. Had we \ndone that then, we wouldn't be in this problem today.\n  The President has done what is right in going after this regime and \nin stopping them from further genocidal conduct and letting them know \nthat enough is enough. But I fear the President has begun something \nthat he is unsure of completing. His goals remain vague and, worse, he \nhas limited the means he declares he will employ.\n  I commend those who have supported this particular resolution, and I \nthank my dear friend from Connecticut for allowing me this time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \n``The Price of Distrust,'' by William Safire.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                       ``The Price of Distrust''\n\n                          (By William Safire)\n\n       Washington.--Congress is not only ambivalent about buying \n     into ``Clinton's War,'' it is also of two minds about being \n     ambivalent.\n       That is because the war to make Kosovo safe for Kosovars is \n     a war without an entrance strategy. By its unwillingness to \n     enter Serbian territory to stop the killing at the start, \n     NATO conceded defeat. The bombing is simply intended to \n     coerce the Serbian leader to give up at the negotiating table \n     all he has won on the killing field. He won't.\n       He will make a deal. By urging that Russia be the broker, \n     Clinton knows he can do no better than compromise with \n     criminality. That means we are not fighting to win but are \n     merely punishing to settle.\n       Small wonder that no majority has formed in Congress to \n     adopt the McCain-Biden resolution giving the President \n     authority to use ``all necessary force'' to achieve a clear \n     victory. Few want to go out on a limb for Clinton knowing \n     that he is preparing to saw that limb off behind them.\n       Clinton has so few followers in Congress because he is \n     himself the world's leading follower. He steers not by the \n     compass but by the telltale, driven by polls that dictate \n     both how far he can go and how little he can get away with.\n       The real debate, then, is not intervention vs. isolation, \n     not sanctity of borders vs. self-determination of nations, \n     not Munich vs. Vietnam, not NATO credibility vs. America the \n     globocop. The central question is: Do we trust this President \n     to use all force necessary to establish the principle that no \n     nation can drive out an unwanted people?\n       The answer is no. The distrust is palpable. Give him the \n     tools and he will not finish the job.\n       Proof that such distrust is well founded is in the erosion \n     of NATO's key goal: muscular protection of refugees trusting \n     enough to return to Kosovo.\n       At first, that was to be done by ``a NATO force,'' rather \n     than U.N. peacekeepers. The fallback was to ``a NATO-led \n     force,'' including Russians. Now the formulation is ``ready \n     to lead,'' if anybody asks, or ``a force with NATO at its \n     core,'' which means Serb-favoring Russians, Ukrainians and \n     Argentinians, with Hungarians and Czechs to give the illusion \n     of ``a NATO core.''\n       If you were an ethnic-Albanian woman whose husband had been \n     massacred, sister raped, children scattered and house burned \n     down on orders from Belgrade--would you go back home under \n     such featherweight protection?\n       Only a fool would trust an observer group so rotten to its \n     ``core.'' And yet that is the concession NATO has made even \n     before formal negotiations begin.\n       What can we expect next? After a few more weeks of feckless \n     bombing while Milosevic completes his dirty work in Kosovo, \n     Viktor Chernomyrdin or Jimmy Carter or somebody will \n     intercede to arrange a cease-fire. Film will be shot of \n     Serbian tanks (only 30 were hit in a month of really smart \n     bombing) rolling back from Kosovo as bombardment halts and \n     the embargo is lifted.\n       Sergei Rogov, the Moscow Arbatovnik, laid out the Russian \n     deal in yesterday's Washington Post: (1) autonomy for Kosovo \n     but no independence or partition; (2) Milosevic troops out \n     but Serbian ``border guards'' to remain in Kosovo, and (3) \n     peace ``enforcers'' under not NATO but U.N. and Helsinki Pact \n     bureaucrats. As a grand concession, NATO would be allowed to \n     care for refugees in Albania and Macedonia.\n       That, of course, would be a triumph for mass murderers \n     everywhere, and Clinton will insist on face-savers: war-\n     crimes trials for sergeants and below, a Brit and a Frenchman \n     in command of a NATO platoon of Pomeranian grenadiers, no \n     wearing of blue helmets and absolutely no reparations to \n     Serbia to rebuild bridges in the first year.\n       Perhaps Britain's Tony Blair will prod Clinton to do \n     better, and all Serbian troops and paramilitary thugs will be \n     invited out of Kosovo. But the returning K.L.A. will find \n     mass graves and will likely lash out at Serbs; after an \n     indecent interval Belgrade will assert sovereignty with \n     troops in police uniforms.\n       And what will happen to the principle of no reward for \n     internal aggression? It will be left for resolution to our \n     next President, who, in another test, will have the strength \n     of the people's trust.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to begin by commending our colleague \nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain, our colleague from Delaware, Senator \nBiden, and others who are responsible for drafting this resolution of \nwhich I am a cosponsor.\n  As the Senator from Utah has indicated, this resolution gives our \nPresident the means to respond to this crisis, utilizing whatever force \nmay be necessary in concert with our allies. Obviously the best \nresolution to the crisis in Kosovo would be a political and diplomatic \nagreement which does not put any more lives in harm's way. \nUnfortunately, such a resolution depends on Slobodan Milosevic halting \nhis campaign of genocide and agreeing to the reasonable conditions set \nforth by the United States and our allies. So far, however, he has \nindicated that force is the only language he understands.\n  Clearly, this is not a unilateral effort on behalf of the United \nStates. There are 18 other nations that make up the NATO strategic \nalliance. As a result, it is essential that we act in concert with \nthem.\n  The resolution before us is fair, balanced, and deserves the support \nof our colleagues.\n  As my colleague from Arizona said earlier, it is unfortunate that we \nare placed under the pressure of casting a yea or nay vote or a tabling \nmotion, if one is made, after such a short period of debate. Ideally, \nwe might have waited a few more days for consideration of this \nresolution. It was not the desire of the distinguished Senator from \nArizona nor the distinguished Senator from Delaware to force this vote. \nIt is one that is being forced upon us by a procedural requirement \nunder the law.\n  Never the less, the resolution before us is both sound and important. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Before I proceed to the matter before us today, let me just take a \nmoment to join my colleagues in expressing how pleased I am that \nServicemen Ramirez, Gonzales and Stone have finally been freed from \ntheir prison cells and have now been reunited with their families. \nReverend Jackson, who led the delegation and secured their release, \ncertainly deserves our commendation.\n  While we rejoice at the freedom of three brave Americans, however, we \nmust also keep in mind that on the very same day they were released, \nsome 7,000 Kosovars were forced to flee for their lives and seek refuge \nin neighboring countries. Today, they have joined the ranks of more \nthan one million Kosovar Albanians who have watched their homes \ndisappear behind clouds of acrid smoke, who now know the pain of \nmissing or murdered family members, or who know the personal pain of \ntorture or rape.\n  These atrocities are not isolated incidents. Rather, they represent a \ncalculated and methodical effort to commit genocide, designed and \nexecuted by Slobodan Milosevic and his soldiers and policemen. Mr. \nMilosevic has left his bloody hand print on more than just Kosovo. \nSeveral years ago, we saw his willingness to use murder, torture and \nrape as tools of a ethnic-cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Months \nbefore NATO dropped the first bomb on Yugoslavia he had already forced \n400,000 Kosovars from their homes in spite of the Herculean efforts by \nthe United States and our allies to find a diplomatic or political \nresolution.\n  Thus, the notion that NATO forces have contributed or caused the \nKosovars to be displaced or put in harm's way is entirely without \nmerit. This tragedy has resulted from the actions of one individual and \nthose of his supporters who have allowed this policy to go forward.\n  The messages we send, both by the words we utter and by the votes we \ncast, often travel far beyond the walls of this chamber. Rarely, \nhowever, do they travel as far or as widely as will the messages we \nsend during this debate.\n  Firstly, our service men and women are listening at their posts \naround the\n\n[[Page S4547]]\n\nworld. They want to know where they stand when it comes to the Senate. \nThey ought to know, in performance of their duties, they have the \nbacking and the support of their elected representatives. It ought to \nbe abundantly clear that we stand shoulder to shoulder with them when \nthey fight under the American flag. It was not their decision to be \nengaged in combat. Yet, the jobs they do are monumentally important. We \nmust not take any action here in the Senate which will send the signal \nthat they have anything but the highest level of support we can muster.\n  The innocent men, women and children of Kosovo are also listening \ntonight. More than 665,000 are in refugee camps in Macedonia or Albania \nliving under tremendously difficult conditions. While they are safe, \nthey desperately want to be able to return to what is left of their \nhomes and villages and begin the difficult process of rebuilding. \nHundreds of thousands of others are hiding in the hills of Kosovo \nwithout adequate food or shelter, praying that Serb forces will not \nfind them. They too are listening to the message we send here today, \nwondering when they will be able to come out of the hills without a \nfear of death or torture.\n  They are also listening in Belgrade tonight. President Milosevic is \nlistening for a crack in the United States' resolve to oppose his reign \nof terror in Kosovo. I hope there is no debate in this Chamber that his \nactions should be ignored. Similarly, I hope that the Senate will not \nstand silent instead of expressing our sense of outrage over what this \nman has done to so many innocent people simply because of their \nethnicity. We must never stand silent in the face of Mr. Milosevic's \ngenocide.\n\n  All across Europe, our NATO allies are listening. It has not been \neasy for the 19 member nations to come together in a common purpose. I \nhope that, as our allies watch these proceedings tonight and tomorrow, \nthey understand how highly we regard this alliance. I have heard some \nof our colleagues say it does not make any difference to them whether \nor not NATO is damaged as a result of our votes or action. I cannot \ndisagree more vigorously. It would be a grave mistake to damage this \nimportant alliance. Yet, we could do just damage by the votes we cast \nand statements we make over the next several hours.\n  Finally, the governments and citizens of the front-line states are \nlistening. It is critically important that we demonstrate our support \nto Albania, which has borne the greatest burden, and Macedonia, which \ndespite its complicated political situation, has taken in large numbers \nof refugees. The province of Montenegro also deserves commendation for, \ndespite is status as a province of Yugoslavia, it has refused to \nsubjugate its police forces to Yugoslav control and has taken in tens \nof thousands of Kosovar refugees. Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, Croatia, \nHungary and Bosnia also deserve international commendation. With the \nexception of Hungary, none of those is a NATO ally, yet they are \nstanding with us. Yet, in contrast to their steadfast support, in a \nlittle more than 12 hours, the United States Senate may decide that \nthis crisis is not worthy of our vote to give the President and NATO \nthe backing they need to deal with this issue.\n  I want to point out to my colleagues, that the world--from a newly \norphaned child in a Macedonian refugee camp to our allies to Slobodan \nMilosevic--does listen to the messages we send. Mr. President, 60 years \nago next week a ship called the ``St. Louis'' sailed from Hamburg, \nGermany. Aboard were 937 passengers with one-way tickets. Nine-hundred \nsix of the passengers were Jewish refugees who, having lived through \nKristallnacht six months earlier, already feared for their lives. \nHolding what they believed to be valid entry permits for Cuba, they \nleft their homes and lives behind, hoping to find safety on the far \nside of the Atlantic Ocean. When they arrived in Havana two weeks \nlater, however, only 28 were permitted, to go ashore. After lying at \nanchor for a full week under the oppressive sun, the St. Louis left \nHavanna and tried to enter American waters, but they were told that \nthey were not welcome in this country, that we could not take 900 more \npeople into the United States.\n  That ship and its passengers returned to Europe more than a month \nafter it left. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum just a few \nblocks from here has traced the lives of the St. Louis' passengers. The \nfates of the more than one third of the St. Louis' passengers who later \nperished in the Holocaust should stand as a stark warning to us here \ntoday.\n  There are no ships at sea tonight, but I make the case that there is \nindeed a ``St. Louis.'' It is called Albania; it is called Montenegro; \nit is called Macedonia. And there are many more thousands inside Kosovo \nwho are now watching and listening to what we, the leader of the free \nworld, the leader of the effort to try to bring some order to the chaos \nwhich has been visited in the Balkans, are saying.\n  To all of the different parties listening to our debate tonight and \nto our votes tomorrow, we must send the same message and we must send \nthat message with a clear and convincing voice. We should support the \nMcCain resolution in order to demonstrate that we will give NATO the \nbacking and support it needs politically, diplomatically, and, yes, if \nneed be, militarily, to respond to this situation. If we fail to \nrespond, we may well place not only Kosovo but the rest of Europe in \nharm's way\n\n  The lessons of history are before us. We have been told by George \nSantayana that ``Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to \nrepeat it.''\n  I hope that in the next 12 hours or so, before we vote on this \nmatter, our colleagues think long and hard about this resolution. I \nhope we will find the strength to overlook the personalities. Whether \nor not we like this President or voted for him or agree with him on \nevery issue, there is an organization called NATO which we will place \nin jeopardy if we fail to act properly and prudently. There are \npeople's lives who are in jeopardy at this very hour as we debate this \nissue on the floor of the Senate. And there is the future precedent \nbeing set by how we act here.\n  If we do not approve this resolution, history will judge us. Let the \nwords of the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Elie Wiesel be a warning to us \nhere tonight: ``Rejected by mankind, the condemned to not go so far as \nto reject it in turn. Their faith remains unshaken, and one may well \nwonder why. They do not despair. The proof: they persist in surviving \nnot only to survive, but to testify. The victims elect to become \nwitnesses.''\n  So, Mr. President, I urge the support and adoption of the McCain-\nBiden resolution. I believe it is the right thing to do. History will \njudge us properly and well if we support this important resolution. Our \nfuture, our children and generations to come, both here in America and \naround the world, will applaud the action of a Congress that has not \nlost sight of the lessons of history.\n  Mr. President, I see the arrival of the majority leader and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for yielding. Mr. \nPresident, I do have a unanimous consent request to propound \nmomentarily. This is on the financial services modernization bill.\n  While I am waiting, I commend Senator Daschle for his leadership, \nhelping to get us to a position where we could move to that legislation \ntomorrow; and Senator Gramm and Senator Sarbanes have been working \ntogether. I think this is a good agreement, a fair one, and allows us \nto get to a substitute that could be offered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/03/senate-section/article/S4547-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4547-S4548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 900\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry, be recognized for 15 minutes, followed by \nSenator Biden for 30 minutes, and the Record will show the incredible \ngenerosity of the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, having allowed \ntwo--not one, but two--Senators to precede him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Kerry be recognized for \nup to 30 minutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair, and I particularly thank Senator Biden \nfor his courtesy. I appreciate this enormously. I also thank Senator \nDurbin, who is not here, but will be here shortly, for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I join with the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, Senator Biden and others in support of this \nresolution. I understand the sensitivities of a great many of our \ncolleagues and the administration to where we find ourselves. But I \nthink that a fair analysis of what the Senate has before it and what \nthe country has before it really mandates that the Senate be prepared \nto back up its own steps, the steps that we took when we supported the \nbombing itself.\n  I heard a number of my colleagues in the course of the debate over \nthis afternoon, most recently the Senator from New Mexico, say, ``Well, \nwe need to recognize that the President made a decision and the \nPresident, having made a decision, we now need to know from the \nPresident what the strategy is; we need to know from the President what \nthe exit strategy is; we need to know from the President what is called \nfor.''\n  Frankly, I say to my colleagues, there is not a small measure of \ncontradiction in those statements today. There may even be some \nmeasure, I think, of confusion about the road that we have traveled.\n  The fact is that the President made it clear to us at the outset what \nour goal was. The goal has always been the capacity of the Kosovars to \nlive in peace within Kosovo. The goal has been a return to the status \nquo before Mr. Milosevic withdrew autonomy which had been enjoyed by \nthe ethnic Albanians in Kosovo for years, in the wake of his sudden \ndiscovery that playing the nationalist card, in fact, was a road to \npower, as it was also the road to some four wars and to an \nextraordinary amount of killing in Bosnia, in Slovenia, Herzegovina and \nCroatia.\n  Now, Mr. President, we find ourselves in the situation where the \nSenator from Arizona and some of us are suggesting that the course that \nwe chose in the beginning is, in fact, a correct course, and the course \nthat we ought to follow. The truth is that it was not just the \nPresident of the United States who made a decision. So did the Senate \nof the United States. A majority of the Senators in this body voted to \napprove the bombing, and having approved the bombing and having decided \nto send American forces into harm's way, they embraced the goals that \nwere then stated.\n  One component of those goals did change, obviously, dramatically. The \neffort initially was to prevent the ethnic cleansing from taking place \nand to hope we could sufficiently degrade the military machine to \nprevent that from happening. That, obviously, did not occur, and the \nethnic cleansing continued. We now find ourselves with more than half \nthe population dislocated outside of Kosovo, a significant portion \ndisplaced within Kosovo, and as to how many that may be is imprecise.\n  It seems to me that this is not a time for the Senate to engage in \ncovering its own posterior, not a time for the Senate to engage in a \nwholesale set of contradictions. It is rather the time for the Senate \nto declare, as unequivocally as it declared 40 days ago, that we are \nprepared to move forward with the bombing, that the same goals and the \nsame objectives are viable today.\n  It is interesting. I know that some have hearkened back to the Tonkin \nGulf resolution and have hearkened back to some of the lessons of the \nVietnam war. There is no small irony, however, in the fact that we are \nbeyond, in a way, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. There was a time for \npeople to question why we were bombing, what the motives were of \nbombing, what we hoped to achieve through the bombing and whether or \nnot it was appropriate to start bombing and then suddenly stop, short \nof achieving those objectives. That, I think, would have been \nappropriate.\n  Having decided that you were going to bomb, I think most people \naccepted the notion that the reason for bombing was legitimate enough, \nthat the reason for putting American forces in harm's way was \nlegitimate enough, that the goals that we were trying to achieve were \nlegitimate enough, and that if you were prepared to take the risks of \nputting those people in harm's way, you were also accepting the \nresponsibility for achieving the goal that was set out.\n  Back in the 1960s, when the Gulf of Tonkin resolution came to the \nfloor, there were two Senators who stood up and, as a matter of \nconscience, said: I disagree with this, and voted against. One was \nWayne Morse; the other was Ernest Gruening. It took a long time for \nhistory to prove those lone Senators correct. It may well be that those \nSenators who voted against the resolution supporting air strikes \nagainst Yugoslavia and who might choose to vote against those things \nnecessary to achieve the goals may be proven correct by history. I do \nnot know. At least that opposition is consistent, and at least that \nopposition is devoid of the disingenuity that we seem to see in those \nwho voted to start bombing, those who have been saying for a year and a \nhalf or 2 years or more, you have to stop Mr. Milosevic, those who were \ncrying for the United States to take a stand only a year ago, and then \nonce the President does take a stand--the only stand that most people \nin the world thought he could take--all of a sudden they begin to \nvanish and run for the sidelines and take cover. I find that rather \nextraordinary, not to mention that it is, in fact, a contradiction of \nenormous proportions.\n\n  I understand how some in this Chamber have reservations about \nbombing. I understand full well about how some, given the history of \nthe Balkans, may have inherent reservations about the United States, \nthrough NATO, even being involved there. Some of those people reflected \nthose deep-rooted beliefs and fears in their original vote.\n  But the majority of the Senate voted by a greater margin than the \nmajority who sent this Nation to war in Desert Storm--a greater \nmajority. After Desert Storm, all those who had voted against it came \ntogether to suggest that the stated goals of the United States were \nsuch that we ought to\n\n[[Page S4549]]\n\nguarantee the outcome. And we were committed to do what was necessary \nin order to achieve that, and we would support any efforts in order to \nachieve that.\n  Mr. President, I think one of the great lessons of the Vietnam \nperiod--and I think Senator Hagel feels it very strongly, Senator \nMcCain feels it very strongly, Senator Robb, myself, and others--is \nthat if you are going to commit American forces, you make the decisions \nat the outset about what you are trying to achieve, and you make \ndecisions at the outset that if you are going to send those soldiers--\nairmen, seamen, all of them--into battle, you do so with the \nunderstanding that you are committed to achieving the goals that you \nhave set out.\n  I think it would be astonishing, in the face of the reality that the \ngoals are achievable here, that this is so distinctly different from a \nVietnam or even a Desert Storm in some ways--that we should ourselves \nprovide these ingredients of doubt and reservation that seem to back \noff the original commitment that we made.\n  I have heard many people questioning, not only today, some of the \nrationale for why we are there or how the war is proceeding. But some \nseek a reservation in the notion that the President has not asked for \nthis authorization of force or the Joint Chiefs of Staff have not asked \nfor it. But those same people are always quick to come to the floor and \nassert the powers and prerogatives of the U.S. Congress in the conduct \nof foreign policy.\n  They are often the first to come to the floor to suggest some \nalternative policy to the President. They have often come to the floor \nwith amendments to change Presidential policy in foreign policy, to \namend it, to strengthen it. I think there is an irony that all of a \nsudden they are suggesting so much power to the President, so much \nprerogative away from the Congress, when they have spent an awful long \ntime here asserting the very opposite.\n  In addition to that, I have heard colleagues deeply disturbed--as \nanybody should be appropriately--about collateral damage and what \nhappens in the bombing. I do not think there is an American, in good \nconscience, who does not feel pangs or deep reservations about any \nerrant missile or errant bomb and what the effects are. But there is no \nmoral equivalency whatsoever between those errant impacts and what we \nare trying to achieve and what Mr. Milosevic has been achieving. There \nis simply no moral equivalency.\n  Let us not get confused between collateral damage and the murder, \nrape, organized rape, pillage, plunder, decimation of ethnicity, \nrobbing of identities, the wholesale destruction of villages, the \nkilling of teachers and parents in front of their children, the \nremarkable--remarkable--dismemberment of the people that Mr. Milosevic \nis engaged in and not for the first time. Having seen the record of \nwhat he did in Bosnia, to allow that kind of moral equivocation to \nenter into our thinking in this is, to me, to miss the point \naltogether.\n  The fact is that Senator Dodd from Connecticut pointed out, and \nothers have pointed out, that what we do here can have a profound, \nlong-lasting, deep impact on our capacity to negotiate, to pressure, \nand to speak about and stand for morality and for a standard of \nbehavior that is different from the kind of killing and marauding that \nhas governed so much of this century.\n\n  Now, some will say, ``Well, the Balkans are different.'' Some will \nsay, ``Well, we can't always affect the outcome of these things.'' The \nfact is, we can affect this outcome. We can affect this result. We do \nhave the power and the ability to be able to do this.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues come to the floor and say this is \ngoing to affect our capacity to fight some other war somewhere. What \nwar? Where? What are they talking about? I mean, are we planning \nsuddenly some other war of which we are not aware?\n  This is staring us in the face. It is here. It is now. We are at war. \nThe question we must ask ourselves is whether or not we are prepared to \nwin or whether we are going to put obstacle after obstacle in front of \nourselves to deprive ourselves of the capacity to achieve the goals \nthat are achievable.\n  I hear some refer to Vietnam a lot, but other kinds of conflicts as \nwell. I suggest that this is not a Vietnam--unless we make it a \nVietnam, unless it is our own lack of resolve and pursuit.\n  Some have said, well, if it is a mistake in the first place, you do \nnot want to go down the road pursuing a mistake. I support that notion. \nI recall coming back from Vietnam and saying, ``it is pretty hard to \nask somebody to be the person to die for a mistake or especially the \nlast person to die for it.''\n  I am sensitive to that. But the original question is, Is this a \nmistake? When 58 of us voted on the floor of the Senate to send people \ninto harm's way in order to achieve our stated goals, we were making a \njudgment about whether or not we thought it was a mistake to intervene. \nAnd now that we have decided to intervene, let us at least have the \ncourage to persevere.\n  Why did we intervene? Well, I believe that the imperatives of \nintervention outweigh the alternatives so far that it is hard to really \nmeasure the counterarguments. Any one of us in the Senate can hear this \nwell of the Senate ringing out with the voices of those who would have \ncome to the floor if the images of CNN night after night had been of \nMilosevic running unstopped over the people of Kosovo, unstopped, and \nno effort whatsoever to try to prevent him. I could hear people coming \nto the floor and saying, ``Where is a President with the courage of \nRonald Reagan or George Bush who's willing to draw the line as they \ndid?'' You can hear those speeches now. They would have been spoken.\n  President George Bush, in fact, had the same policy that President \nClinton has. George Bush, before he left office, said we would draw the \nline in Kosovo and told Mr. Milosevic, in no uncertain terms, ``Don't \nmonkey around with this one.'' And because he had the credibility of \nwhat he had done in Kuwait, you can bet that that made a difference.\n  That is why we are here on the floor with this resolution, to give \nour effort the kind of credibility that it deserves, to back up our \nsoldiers who are running those risks on a daily basis, with the \nunderstanding that there is a rationale for our having asked them to do \nwhat they are doing. I do not, by any sense of the imagination, believe \nthat we have exhausted the air campaign in this.\n  It astonishes me, in some ways, that so many people are so \nquestioning of an air campaign that--knock on wood--has not yet cost us \nthe life of one of those pilots. I am astonished, as a former \nserviceperson, at the quality and care with which this has been \nprosecuted. We lose more people every week in the military of this \ncountry in normal training exercises and operations. The fact that this \nhas been carried on now for 40 days, melding Dutch, British, Germans, \nAmericans, French, Greeks, 19 different countries together, melding all \nof these airplanes and those multiple sorties, and bringing that \ntogether, is really a remarkable accomplishment.\n  At the same time, day by day by day, albeit some Members of the \nYugoslav Army may feel better and think, gee, we have been given a \npurpose in life, the fact is that on a daily basis their capacity to \nwage the war is being stripped away. Who in their right mind would \nchoose Mr. Milosevic's hand to play in this versus the hand of NATO?\n  The question before the Senate and this country is, Will we have the \ncapacity to stay and play out the hand that we have?\n  This is not Vietnam. This is not a country that stretches from the \nequivalent of New England all the way down to the tip of Florida with a \nLaos and a Cambodia on its borders, with a superpower, the former \nSoviet Union, and China sitting in the background supplying, pushing \ndown the Ho Chi Minh Trail, ready to come in when we threaten to use \nwhatever force may be available to us. This is not the United States \nessentially acting alone.\n  Taken together, Serbia and Montenegro are slightly smaller than \nKentucky and are essentially surrounded by friendly people. Kosovo is \napproximately the size of Los Angeles county. Unlike North Vietnam and \nSouth Vietnam at the time, unlike that country, where we became \ninvolved on the side of one of the combatants, where we chose to carry \non years of colonial effort that had been misconstrued by the \npopulation and outright opposed and reviled for years, unlike the \ninadvisability of having been embroiled, we\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\nhave been very careful here to suggest we are not for independence for \nKosovo, we are not for the KLA ravaging their countryside any more than \nwe are for Mr. Milosevic and the Serbs doing so.\n  We are fighting for the standards of internationally accepted, \nuniversally accepted behavior that country after country has signed on \nto through United Nations conventions and other instruments of \ninternational law and through their own standards of behavior.\n  I can't think of anything more right than taking a position against \nthis kind of thuggery and this kind of effrontery to those standards as \nwe leave the end of this century.\n  Some people say to me, ``well, Senator, we are going to have some \npeople there for a long time.'' My answer is, So what? If that is what \nit takes in order to try to begin to establish a principle that is more \nlong lasting, so be it.\n  What is the difference between 4,000 troops who have been asked to be \npart of a peaceful effort to change the standards of behavior in Kosovo \nas part of southern Europe--what is the difference between that and the \n500,000 troops we had at a high point in Europe after World War II? \nDon't forget the way in which most Americans were skeptical of Harry \nTruman and the Marshall plan. How on Earth could the United States of \nAmerica, having fought the Germans, turn around and put money back into \ntheir country? How on Earth could we try to bring the Germans into \nNATO?\n  Well, where are we today? A united Germany, the Berlin Wall gone, \nBerlin about to be the united capital of Germany, and the result, \nGermans participating with us in standing up against the very kinds of \nthings that stained the history of this century and of their country \nduring World War II. Is there a more beautiful circle in terms of \nunderstanding what is at stake? I do not think so.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that an investment of some 5,000, \n6,000, 7,000 troops in southern Europe to guarantee that Greece, \nMacedonia, Montenegro, and Albania can remain stable and not be dragged \ninto this, that is worthwhile.\n  Some would say, Senator, we heard that old domino argument before; \nthat is the one they gave us in Vietnam.\n  Once again, the facts on the ground are proving the reality. Can \nanyone here tell me with a straight face that Montenegro, without our \ncurrent efforts and involvement, could possibly withstand the strains \nof what is happening? Can anybody tell me that if the entire population \nof Kosovo were driven out into Albania, you wouldn't somehow see \nMacedonia, Greece, Albania dragged into this? Ultimately, there isn't a \nperson in the Senate who doesn't understand that we would have been \ndragged into it, too. There was an inevitability that NATO would be \ncalled on to take a stand.\n\n  How astonishing it is that people find some kind of moral equivalency \nhere between some of the difficulties of waging a fairly carefully \nprosecuted--not fairly, a very carefully prosecuted war, and what we \nare trying to achieve. How astonishing that people are so concerned \nabout finding that equivalency measured against what Mr. Milosevic has \ndone.\n  I believe if we will stand our ground and be steady and show the \nresolve that we need to show as a great country and the leader of the \nfree world, that we have the ability, through this air campaign, to \nachieve ultimately the diplomatic outcome that we would like to \nachieve.\n  But we have also learned through all of history--Henry Kissinger and \nRichard Nixon will tell you this, in dealing with the North Vietnamese \nin the Christmas bombing, and I hated it back then, but I have come to \nunderstand that there are, in fact, sometimes some things that do speak \nand make a difference to certain people. Like it or not, as I have been \ndeeply involved in that part of the world in the last years, I have \nlearned that that did help make a difference to people's decisions to \ntry to come to some kind of resolution.\n  The fact is that we are now backing up diplomacy with force. I have \nheard some people call for a stay in that force, that somehow it would \nbe diplomatically nice if we were to turn around and have a bombing \npause.\n  My response to that is very simple: Do not let the politicians \ndecide, after sending the military personnel in to risk their lives, \nwhen you are going to have a bombing pause, without adequately passing \nit by the military to ensure that you are not going to put your people \nat greater risk if you don't achieve your goals at the back side of it.\n  I can't go into all the reasons for that, but people understand that \nthere are a great many repercussions to a bombing halt which could have \ngreater jeopardy to our pilots and greater jeopardy to the use of \nwhatever force we need to use down the road. I am perfectly committed \nto having that happen at the right moment, but I want that to be driven \nby the military needs of achieving our goals and not simply the \npolitical imperatives at the time.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me say that I hear colleagues say: Well, \nwe want to know what the end game is; we want to know what the strategy \nis. We have even heard mention of the Boland amendment and other \nthings. Are we in this to win?\n  There are only three or so choices in this, Mr. President. That is \nabout it. Anybody ought to be able to figure them out. Stop the bombing \nand fail to achieve your goals. And if you stop the bombing; NATO would \nbe irreparably damaged, if not simply finished. Mr. Milosevic can \ndeclare victory, do what he wants, and you will have no force in there. \nThat is one choice.\n  Another choice is that you continue to prosecute the air war as you \npress the diplomatic effort, with a guarantee that you are going to \npress that until you get that effort.\n  The third is--and it is the best end game, best exit strategy of \nall--you win. That is the exit strategy. You achieve the simple stated \ngoal of returning the Kosovars into Kosovo, allowing them to live in a \nprotected structure where people won't be killing them, and at the same \ntime have a force that has the capacity to prevent the UCK/KLA from \nalso engaging in killing. It is called peace. I think that is an end \ngame worth fighting for.\n  If the impact of the air war is substantial enough to force Mr. \nMilosevic to yield and accept NATO's terms for ending the war, then we \nwill have won. However, if bombing alone is not enough, then winning \nwill require that we have the determination and resolve to do whatever \nis necessary on the ground to achieve these objectives--to win.\n\n  I think when you measure the history of Europe and the importance of \nsouthern Europe, and the success of the integration process in Europe, \nyou cannot question the need to achieve our stated goals in Kosovo. \nNATO has played an important role in the integration process--just talk \nto the officials in Spain or in other parts of Europe about the impact \nof NATO as an organizing principal, as a means of having brought \ncountries together around democracy. They will tell you unequivocally \nof the degree to which the process of meeting, of coming together, of \nhaving mutual responsibilities, of needing to work together have had a \nprofound impact on the capacity of Europe to develop so that they now \nhave a common market and are working on the last efforts of \nintegration, with more power in Brussels and more capacity as a \nEuropean entity to speak to the world and to stand for these \nprinciples.\n  Are we going to deny that to southeastern Europe? Are we going to \nignore the lesson that we would sent to Baghdad or Pyongyang or Tripoli \nor to other parts of the world if we fail to do what is necessary to \nwin in Kosovo? I hope the answer of the Senate would be unequivocally \nno. The lessons of history are such that they taught us that this is \nthe right thing to be doing for the right reasons. They are, I think, \nefforts that are worthy of our commitment in order to see it through to \nthe end.\n  I am confident that if the Senate and the country were to speak with \na single voice on this, in a short period of time we would see this \nresolved and, most likely, Mr. President, without recourse to ground \ntroops or to prolonged war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have been authorized, since nobody else \nis on the floor, to go down the list here. I believe I am to be yielded \n30 minutes\n\n[[Page S4551]]\n\nat this point. I ask that I be able to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there are few issues that this body debates \nwhich are of consequence equal to what we are debating today. We are \nliterally talking about the life and death of thousands of people, \nincluding possibly American personnel, American soldiers.\n  I have been here for 27 years, and on those occasions when I have \nbeen put in the position of having to vote on matters that relate to \nwhether or not someone will live or die, I have tried my level best to \nbe as intellectually honest and rigorous with myself as I possibly can. \nI have listened to the debate on the floor today with great interest \nand with some disappointment. It comes as no surprise to my colleagues \nthat have served with me in the last 10 years or so, or even those in \nthe last year or so, how strongly I feel about the Balkans. I am given \nblame, or credit, depending on the place from which you come, for \ngetting us as involved in Bosnia as we are. I came back in the early \nnineties from a long, several-hour meeting late in the night in the \noffice of Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Yugoslavia, and I came \naway convinced that this was a man with an agenda that was anathema to \nour interests and was literally genocidal.\n\n  I wrote a report years ago, referred to as ``lift and strike,'' \nwhereby I urged us to change our policy. And so I don't want to attempt \nto hide in any way the intensity of my feelings about what the \nappropriate action for the United States, NATO, and the world is \nrelative to Mr. Milosevic. But when I recently got back from Macedonia \nlate at night on a Sunday, I got home. After flying, I guess, for 12 or \nso hours--whatever the timeframe was--I did what most people do after a \nlong trip. I took a shower and brushed my teeth and tried as quietly as \nI could to climb into bed and not disturb my wife, who was asleep.\n  After I got settled, thinking I had accomplished not awakening her, \nshe leaned over and said, ``Welcome home.'' Then she asked me a \nquestion, which I suspect the American people are asking. You are going \nto ask every one of us. My constituents are going to ask me. It was \nabsolutely sincere. She said, in the dark of the night--and I could not \neven see her face--``Joe, are you sure you're correct?''\n  That sort of cut right to the quick of things. I had been so \noutspoken on this issue, and that took me aback for a moment. I \nanswered her with complete honesty and candor. I said, ``I don't know. \nI am not positive. I can't guarantee it, but I feel so strongly that \nI'm right, that I'm going to continue to pursue pushing us in the \ndirection of doing what I think is right.''\n  If my wife is asking me if I'm sure I'm right, and she is privy to my \nthoughts, concerns, and serious contemplations about whether or not I \nshould be a party to causing some Americans to die, then I wonder what \nthe majority of the American people must think. They must be moved by, \nor find appealing, the arguments of some of my colleagues today on the \nfloor: It is not our fight. We should not be there. We are doing it the \nwrong way. The President of the United States is not worthy of our \ntrust as Commander in Chief. We should bring the boys home. We have no \nvital interests.\n  You know, I sit in a seat now that men such as Vandenberg sat in. I \nam a senior Senator. There is only one person on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee that has been there as long as I have been there. When I was \nthe age of these pages--this is the truth--I used to wonder, when I was \nin high school and college, as we studied about Hitler and Germany, why \nnobody did anything in 1934 or 1935 or 1937 or 1938 when the price \nwould have been incredibly lower. You look back now and just think what \nwould have happened had the world united and gone in and taken Hitler \nout. Just think how different it would have been.\n  By the way, I note parenthetically that I am not equating Milosevic \nto Hitler in terms of his capacity, ability, or his danger. As the \nSenator from Massachusetts pointed out, he does not represent a country \nof 50 million people, an industrial giant. He does not have the \nmilitary power of a country as great as Germany. He does not present \nthe same threat.\n\n  But it is analogous in the following way: In a closed meeting of the \nForeign Relations Committee, with senior Members of the Senate in \nattendance from the Committee on Appropriations and, I believe, Armed \nServices, I was making a case several months ago about why we had to be \ninvolved.\n  One of my colleagues, for whom I have an overwhelming amount of \nrespect, a veteran who put his life on the line for this country, a \nvery promilitary guy, looked at me and asked the following question, \nwhich answered for me that question I could never answer as a young \nman, Why did we not act? After listening to my case as to why we should \nbe involved with NATO, he said, ``But, Joe, can you guarantee me no \nAmerican will be killed?'' It was as if somebody took one of those \nlittle hammers that the doctors use to test your reflexes, those little \nrubber hammers, and went bing, and hit me right in the head. The light \nwent on, and all of a sudden I realized why the Vandenbergs of the \nworld didn't do anything.\n  It is difficult to explain to the American people how you would risk \neven one American life, or more than that, how you would be able to say \nI can assure you that Americans will die for something that hasn't \nhappened yet. How do you do that? I am sure somebody said, in 1935: If \nwe go in after Hitler, it is going to cost 100 or 1,000 or 2,000 \nAmerican lives to get the job done.\n  I am sure Senators like the Presiding Officer and me sat there and \nsaid, ``How am I going to go home and explain that to my folks? How can \nI go home and explain we are going to lose several thousand American \nlives to take out a guy they do not know anything about, who is no \nimmediate threat to them now, and all he is doing is beating up Jews \nand gypsies?'' Hard sell. That is where we are now. We have a guy who \nis doing more than beating up Jews and gypsies. We have a guy who, if \nyou turn on your television, is loading thousands of people into \nrailroad cars in the heart of Europe. He has corralled them like \ncattle, putting them in railroad cars. I looked at it, and I thought to \nmyself: This is almost like a video game, or something. Is this real? \nThis is 1999. They are loading people on railroad cars because of their \nethnicity and religion.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, said he was recently in the \ncamps in Macedonia. So was I in the same camps. We came away with two \ndifferent impressions. We agreed they were happy to be there. We agreed \nthey were getting fed well. But do you know what struck me? As a \nSenator, I have been in refugee camps all over the world. It was the \nfollowing. I was standing there talking to people. And there was \nthousands of people in line--like a long movie line. They were about \nsix or eight wide, snaked all through this camp. I was standing there \nanswering questions for people, and asking questions of refugees. All \nof a sudden it struck me. I was standing next to a guy who had on a \nsport coat that must have cost $750. Another guy--I looked down at his \nshoes. They had been to be $300 Italian-made leather shoes. In between \nthem was an old lady in a babushka with her teeth missing. All of a \nsudden it came to me. This is the enormity of the cleansing. It had \nnothing to do with their economic station. It had nothing to do with \nthe specific territory they lived in. It had to do with their religion \nand their ethnicity.\n\n  It is as if someone marched into an office building in downtown \nWashington and took out the $400,000 lawyers along with the cleaning \nlady because they were both Moslem.\n  People say ``no vital interest.'' Let me ask my colleagues who are \nlistening and the staff of my colleagues who are monitoring this \ndebate. Ask yourself the following question: Can anyone say that they \nwill be leaving their children and grandchildren a more secure future \nif NATO and the United States do nothing to stop the ethnic cleansing \nin the heart of Europe? Forget for a moment whether or not I and others \nare right, that if we do not act, it will result in an open war and the \nsplit between Greece and Turkey, a division within Europe that is \nreminiscent of 1910 and 1915, although the Hapsburg, Ottoman, German, \nand Russian Empires were still in existence. Forget\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\nthat. Assume we are wrong about that. Tell me, anybody explain to me, \nhow my child and granddaughters are going to be more secure if, in \nfact, you have a million people displaced, you have thousands of \npeople--at least now documented hundreds of people --brought out in the \nbackyards of their homes and knelt down and had their heads blown off.\n  There are 11 million ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. There are \nthousands, tens of thousands of Hungarians living in Romania. There are \nhundreds of thousands of Turks living in Bulgaria. Tell me how this \nworks. Someone explain to me. And then, even if they can explain that, \nexplain to me how the United States of America can be prevent itself \nfrom being dragged into a war in Europe.\n  Look, I am not saying to you all that if we don't act right now, \nwithin the next 5 years our future is doomed. But tell me what Europe \nlooks like in 20 years. Tell me how it is possible that the United \nStates can conduct its foreign policy anywhere in the world without a \nstable and secure Europe, not because we are ``Europhile'' and we only \nthink Europe is important or more important than Asia. But tell me how \nwith our economic, political, cultural, and military ties there can be \na Europe divided and our interests not be affected. I find it \nabsolutely astounding that anyone in this Chamber could say we have no \nvital interest.\n  I also find this moral relativism very fascinating. It kind of goes \nlike this. If there is an injustice anywhere in the world and we can't \ndeal with every injustice, then we should deal with no injustice. If in \nRwanda African tribes are killing one another and the carnage is \ngreater there, or in Cambodia where 2 million people were killed--and \nthe list goes on--if we didn't get involved there, how did we get \ninvolved now?\n  Well, I point out two little facts:\n  One, we have the means in Europe that do not exist in those other \nparts of the world; two, we have the ability with the means available \nto us if we are willing to execute an outcome that we desire; and, \nthree, if Europe begins to disintegrate, we are in trouble, because we \nare a European power.\n  I said that I would try my best to be as honest with myself as I \ncould because, by the way, I tell you we are political. I am not \nsuggesting those who oppose our involvement in Kosovo do it for this \nreason. But I can tell you that it is a lot easier for me in my State \nto be for noninvolvement. That is a sacred place to be, Mr. President. \nThat is the easier place to be. I didn't look for this fight. This is \nnot why I came to the Senate at age 30 saying I want to be for pushing \nus to go to war. That is why I examine these arguments the best I can, \nbecause if there is a better way that doesn't include war, I am for it.\n\n  I listened to all the arguments today. The only one, with all due \nrespect, that I think made sense was Pete Domenici's. He is in \nopposition to the McCain-Biden resolution. What he said, from my \nperspective at least, adds up, and it makes sense. He said, ``Hey, \nlook. The President didn't ask for this authority. Why are you forcing \nit on him? He doesn't want it yet. So don't give it to him.'' And we \nshould send him a letter that says, ``If you want it, Mr. President, \nask us and we will act on it quickly.''\n  When the Senator from Arizona and I introduced this resolution, that \nwas basically our intention. We didn't--at least I didn't--contemplate \nthat the Parliamentarian would rule correctly--I am not challenging the \nruling--that the War Powers Act was implicated and that we must vote on \nthis resolution. That was not what we anticipated. We anticipated, when \nwe introduced this, for it to be here on the floor ready and able to be \nbrought up when it was needed, because we--at least I--concluded that \nwe should give the air campaign a full opportunity to succeed--I \nhaven't given up on that yet--but that Milosevic and the rest of the \nworld should know we were prepared to do whatever it took to win.\n  Here we are, voting on it because of the procedural rules not of the \nSenate, but of the statute, and thereby by the Senate rule.\n  I understand Senator Domenici's argument. By the way, I believe, \nnotwithstanding all the speeches today, if the President of the United \nStates asks for ground troops with NATO, that this body will vote for \nit; that there are over 51 votes for it. When the rubber meets the road \nand Members have to vote yes or no, I predict we will see a lot of \nopinions change.\n  Now, I heard today time and again the Gulf of Tonkin analogy. With \nall due respect, it is not at all analogous. In the Gulf of Tonkin \nresolution, the U.S. Congress said to the President, and I am \nparaphrasing, Mr. President, use whatever means at your disposal. It \ndidn't say what the McCain-Biden resolution says; it didn't say use \nwhatever means is at your disposal--assuming 18 other nations sign on \nwith you. You do not, if McCain-Biden passes, Mr. President, have the \nauthority to use force unilaterally. It is in conjunction with NATO; \nnot alone, in conjunction with NATO.\n  At the time of Vietnam and the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, we were \nessentially alone in the world in concluding that force need be used. \nWith regard to Kosovo, we are in the majority. The entire civilized \nworld, including the Russians, acknowledge that Milosevic is engaged in \nbehavior that violates every notion of civilized conduct. They disagree \non the means we should use to deal with that.\n  I was in Macedonia. I went into a tent city about which my friend \nfrom Oklahoma talked. He is right, these are courageous young men and \nwomen. I sat in a tent that housed about 20 military folks. I walked in \nand said, They make the analogy back home about Vietnam; what do you \nguys think of that? There were two women, as well. What do you think of \nthat? A sergeant looked at me, he was 23, 24 years old, and he said the \nfollowing:\n\n       Senator, when you were 23 years old, if they had sent you \n     here, would you have any doubt about the morality of what you \n     were undertaking?\n\n  The answer is no. It is not analogous to Vietnam. I was a student \nduring Vietnam. We were told there was a monolithic communism that was \ngoing to roll out of Moscow and Beijing, roll down through Southeast \nAsia. Our history professors would say, Wait a minute, the Chinese and \nthe Russians aren't getting along together. And, wait, the Chinese and \nthe Vietnamese have been fighting each other for 300 years. So explain \nto me how this domino is going to fall.\n  Did anybody notice fleets of Russians in Cam Ranh Bay? Not because of \nus, the Chinese weren't going to let them be there. This monolithic \ncommunism didn't exist.\n  I don't want to relitigate Vietnam but it is not analogous, not only \nfor the reasons my friend from Massachusetts stated--the size of the \nterritory, the population, the availability of the arms materiel, the \nallies. Sure, China and Russia cooperated because it suited their \ninterest to keep the Vietnamese fighting us but not because of the \nrationale we were given.\n  I respectfully suggest there is nothing analogous. The Tonkin Gulf \nresolution is not analogous because it is not giving the President \nauthority on his own in the McCain-Biden resolution as Tonkin Gulf did. \nIt is a different continent, it is a different population, it is a \ndifferent rationale. There is no doubt on the part of anyone about the \nmorality of the undertaking.\n  That old joke, and I am paraphrasing, Can 18 European countries that \ndon't have a lot in common be wrong, all at once? Can they all be \nwrong?\n  Listening to this debate, one would think the President of the United \nStates just woke up one morning and said: ``You know, I need a war. I \nwould like to have a war. I would like to test our new smart bombs. I \nwould like to figure out if they work better than they did in Desert \nStorm. We put a lot of money and time into it, and I have just the guy \nto look to. Eighteen other nations said what this guy is doing is \nbad.''\n  Some of my colleagues will say they have been fighting for thousands \nof years; all those people are the same. There are a lot of bad guys on \nall sides, but I don't see the Moslems loading up Serbs on cars and \nsending them off. I don't see this happening anywhere else in Europe.\n  There is one remaining dictator in the region. His name is Slobodan \nMilosevic. He is a bad guy. He is a smart bad guy. He is doing very bad \nthings. The idea that the United States of America, when all of Europe \nhas stood up and said this must stop, will\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\nwalk away, I think is absolutely bizarre.\n  Does anybody here truly believe we could stand aside, let this \nhappen, and it not affect our vital interests in the year 2010 and 2012 \nand 2020 when my granddaughters and their husbands will be sent off?\n  It seems to me we are making a gigantic mistake here to try to hide \nbehind a lot of arguments. I raise this question with my friend. We use \nthat phrase all the time--``my friend.'' This guy really is my friend. \nWe have been friends for 27 years. We were back in the Cloakroom \ntalking. I said, what the heck is going on here? I think we both came \nto a similar conclusion, at least in part. On both sides of the aisle \npeople are using code words because they don't want to be isolationist. \nThis is about isolationism or internationalism. That is what this is \nabout.\n\n  A lot of Republicans don't trust this President. I am not suggesting \nthey trust him, but just sort of take that nickel when you do the cards \nat McDonald's for your kids and see whether you won a cup or something. \nScrape it off a little bit and right below is the real link--\nisolationism.\n  On my side are a lot of the old antiwar Members. By the way, \ndecorated veterans such as Senator McCain and Senator Kerry say we \nshould be doing this.\n  Look, folks, I don't know how to run an antiseptic foreign policy. I \ndon't know how you can be President of the United States and make every \ndecision you make based upon the following formula: If an American will \nlose their life, we can't get involved.\n  Look, if there is any man in this Chamber, or woman, who understands \nthe loss of life in war and the brutality of war, it is my colleague \nhere, Senator McCain. I am not being gratuitous here. He may be the \nnext President of the United States of America. Guys like him, and \nwomen like him, may have to say, ``I am going to have to do something \nthat is going to cost American lives.''\n  People who disagree with us, I say to my friend, act like we are \ncavalier about it. I don't understand it like my friend understands it, \nbut I think I understand loss of life a little bit. It is not about \nthat. It is about the recognition that this is a mean damn world out \nthere.\n  So I listen to my colleagues make the strangest arguments. I hear a \nDemocrat stand up and say: You know, we should not be involved in this \nat all. This is a terrible thing. I voted against the bombing. And, by \nthe way, we have to save the refugees. We are going to save the \nrefugees.\n  Where the heck are you going to save them?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Sure, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What does my friend from Delaware make of the argument \nthat this is not the right time, this is not the right time to vote on \nthis? So we are going to table this motion tomorrow and a whole bunch \nof our colleagues are going to say--including, by the way, my dear \nfriend from Virginia: Yes, this is a problem. It has only been going on \nfor 5 weeks now. Hundreds of thousands of people have been moved from \ntheir homes, thousands have been killed, massacres every day--but this \nis not the right time to vote on this particular issue. So we will vote \ntomorrow to table it and cut off debate and cut off discussion and \nabrogate the responsibilities that we have as Senators.\n\n  Frankly, does my friend think that maybe they know better?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to my friend from Arizona, and I spoke to this very \nbriefly in his absence, it is the only argument that has any substance, \nin my view. I disagree with it. I disagree with it for a lot of reasons \nI have spoken to. I am going to vote and urge my colleagues not vote to \ntable. We will do it the right way. But at least they have an argument \nthat the President has not asked for it. I think we should be telling \nthe President he has it.\n  We are not demanding, the Senator from Arizona and I, that he use \nground troops. We are saying to him: We want to make sure you \nunderstand that you have to win this and you can't come back to us and \nsay you didn't do it because you didn't have the means. At least that \nis why this Senator is pushing this.\n  The arguments I find totally disingenuous, though, are the ones that \ngo like this. I heard today: You know, I voted against the bombing, but \nI tell you what, I am going to vote to table this use of the available \nground troops to the President because I don't trust the President. But \nI tell you what, if this President were a leader, he would do whatever \nit took to stop this. But I am going to vote against giving him the \nauthority it would take to stop it because I don't trust this \nPresident.\n  How? I don't understand.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I sure will.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not want to interrupt this important \ncolloquy, but I believe I am up next.\n  Mr. BIDEN. You are, but I don't believe my time is up yet. If it is--\napparently my time is up.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would like to ask a question of you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe I was asking a question. I do \nnot believe the Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I did not mean to interrupt, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes for \nSenator Biden--excuse me--I grant Senator Biden 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The White House, the National Security Adviser, the \nSecretary of Defense and Secretary of State are now frantically \nlobbying against this resolution, who are saying vote to table. Has my \ncolleague ever heard of a time where the White House and the \nadministration lobbied actively against obtaining more authority?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Only on one occasion. The point the Senator is making I \nunderstand. But only on one occasion. Two other occasions I can think \nof where Presidents have asked not to have more authority--when they \nthought they were going to lose.\n  I have personally spoken to the President. I have spoken to the \nNational Security Adviser. The National Security Adviser would like to \nhave this authority. But what he does not want to have is a vote that \nsays he cannot have the authority. They are worried if there is a vote \nthat is a straight up-and-down vote and it loses, that it will mean, in \nconjunction with the House vote last week, that the Congress is on \nrecord against ground troops.\n\n  My argument to them is it does not mean that. It means they concluded \nthey were not prepared to do it now without the White House asking for \nit. But I believe there have been circumstances in the past where \nPresidents have affirmatively suggested they not ask for authority and \ntable something when they thought they did not have the votes.\n  My colleagues on this side have told them they do not have the votes, \nas have your colleagues. I think my colleagues on this side are wrong, \nand I think the colleagues on the other side are wrong about the votes. \nBecause I find an interesting thing, Senator. On very, very important \nmatters--and everyone knows how important this is--Congress likes to \navoid responsibility.\n  I will take us back very briefly to the Persian Gulf. On the Persian \nGulf we had great disagreement, and during that time I remember going \nto my caucus and saying: We must demand a vote. And my colleagues on my \nside, whose names I will not mention, but I give you my word to this, \nwho were against the action in the Persian Gulf, said: No, no, don't \nask for a vote, because they wanted to be in line. Because if it \nsucceeded, they wanted to be able to say, ``Great job, Mr. President,'' \nand if it failed, they wanted to be able to say, ``Not me.'' I think \nthat is at work here, I say to my friend from Arizona.\n  But the bottom line of it is that the Senator from Arizona, in my \nopinion, is dead right. I think the amendment is dead right on. I think \nwe do more to bring a successful conclusion to this war by giving that \nauthority whether or not it is used. I think we would make a tragic \nmistake being apologists for a policy that in fact makes no civilized \nsense, when we make moral equivalence about the people in the region, \nwhen we argue that a bombing pause would not affect anything, when we \nargue--my time is up. Ten seconds.\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\n  I compliment Reverend Jackson on bringing these folks home. But with \nall due respect, I can think of a lot of people with his standing who \ncould have gone and probably gotten the same result, if in fact they \nwere willing, and believed as he does, that we should stop the bombing.\n  I think it is a mistake. It is a little bit like saying: Give me \nthree people back and I will not do anything about the 300 you \nmassacred--which they did, by the way, just 4 days earlier.\n  I think it is a tragic mistake. I wish we would get our act together. \nI think the President is going to have to take the case to the Nation \nmore forcefully than he has. I hope we do not table the McCain-Biden \nresolution, but it appears we are going to do that. As you can tell, I \nhave spoken too long. But I think this is something in our vital \ninterest with the capacity to affect the outcome that would be \nbeneficial to all people, and the idea that it would be a failure if we \nhad to have forces there in order to maintain the peace, who were not \nbeing killed, and the genocide stopped--I would consider that victory, \nnot failure.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, with apologies and respect to my colleague \nfrom Virginia for going over time, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my friend. Before he leaves the floor, I think a \ncolloquy here--and I am very much interested in following the one you \nand Senator Biden had--might be helpful. This Senator intends to vote \nto table. I do so with a heavy conscience, because I have no better \nfriend, nor a man I respect more, than my good friend, the Senator from \nArizona. We sort of served in the Navy together. He had more rank than \nI did; at one point I had a little more authority than he did. And my \ngood friend from Delaware, you do recall who was your cosponsor. It was \nBiden-Warner. So I think that points out there are differences of \nconscience, clear conscience now and then, where we differ.\n  I want to ask both of you, on the condition you answer on your time, \non such time you have, a very simple question: What does this \nresolution give the President of the United States that the \nConstitution has not clearly reposed in this President and in every \nother President since the beginning of this great Republic?\n  I ask that question because to vote otherwise would possibly, if this \nwere to carry, in my judgment, send a hollow message not only to the \nUnited States but across the world. He has the authority under the \nConstitution to do precisely what you state in here.\n  I ask simply: What does this confer on the President that the \nConstitution has not already conferred?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be brief in my response.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have the understanding it is on their time, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute to respond to the \nquestion from Senator Warner.\n  This is exactly the same as the authority that was granted to the \nPresident in the case of Bosnia, in the case of the Persian Gulf war, \nin the case of going all the way back to Beirut, exactly the same \nthing: Telling the President of the United States that Congress does \nplay a role.\n  We ignore the War Powers Act. We all know that. This is not a war in \nthe classic sense, and we do not declare wars. This is a role for the \nCongress of the United States to play, endorsing the President's \nability to use whatever force is necessary in order to bring the \nconflict to a conclusion. It is no different than that of the Persian \nGulf war resolution, the Bosnia resolution, the Lebanon resolution, the \nGrenada resolution--there has been literally one in every conflict in \nwhich we have engaged.\n  Finally, may I say that it is also an effort, frankly, to get the \nPresident of the United States to do the right thing.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. May I have 1 minute to respond?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Delaware to \nrespond.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  I say to my friend from Virginia, I think it is constitutionally \nrequired. I am in the minority in that view. I do not think the \nPresident has the authority to commit ground troops without the consent \nof the Congress, but I think it is politically necessary. I think it is \npolitically necessary because it is of great value to any President to \nhave the Congress on the line with him as he prosecutes a war. I think \nit is constitutionally necessary and politically wise.\n  I realize that there are those who disagree with me, that the war \nclause--not the War Powers Act, the war clause--of the Constitution I \nbelieve requires the consent of the Congress for the use of this force \nnow, but it----\n  Mr. WARNER. By ``this force,'' the Senator means what?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am sorry. If he were to use ground forces. But I \nacknowledge there is a constitutional argument that says that if the \nCongress had voted and the House did not, but if they had voted, as we \nhad, for the use of air power, that he would not need that additional \nauthority.\n  I do think there is a constitutional requirement for the Congress to \nassent to this action. I understand I am in the minority. Beyond that, \nI think there is a political necessity that we be united.\n\n  My friend and I have talked about this privately before. We can all \ndisagree about the lessons from Vietnam, but I think we both agree that \none of the lessons out of Vietnam was that no matter how smart, no \nmatter how brilliant a foreign policy is, it cannot be sustained \nwithout the informed consent of the American people and their elected \nrepresentatives being signed on to it.\n  That is my primary motivation. The place my friend from Arizona and I \ndisagree is, I am not doing this to embolden the President to do the \nright thing. The reason I signed on to it is to make sure the Congress \ngoes on record saying that we will back whatever action the President \ntakes to meet the four goals that he has stated. There is legitimate \nconstitutional disagreement, but I fall down on the side that I think \nit is necessary.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will simply reply to my good friend, \nonly four times in the history of the United States of America has \nCongress used that phrase, ``declare war.'' World War II is the last; \nam I not correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. You are.\n  Mr. WARNER. How many times did we send out our troops? Are we \nsuggesting each time, whether it was Vietnam in particular or Korea, \nthat that wasn't the proper authority exercised by the President of the \nUnited States? You suggest that, I say to the Senator, when you say----\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, yes, I am. In the one case in Vietnam, it \nwas given through the Tonkin Gulf. In Korea, I don't think it is \nconstitutionally--by the way, I am not alone in this. I happen to \nteach--it does not make me an expert, but I happen to teach \nconstitutional law and separation of powers now in law school. I can \nassure you one thing: The vast majority of constitutional scholars \nagree with me.\n  The point being, you do not need to declare war. As Louis Henkin, who \nwrote the Restatement of International Law, pointed out, it does not \nrequire a declaration of war; it requires a consent of the Congress, \nwhich is equivalent to the authority required, just like what we did in \nthe Persian Gulf. When the Congress went on record granting the \nauthority to the President to use the force in the resolution, that is \nthe equivalent of a declaration of war. All constitutional scholars \nagree on that point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the resolution of the gulf in 1991 is one \nI remember, may I say with a lack of modesty.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think you drafted it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was the author of that resolution. I say to the Senator \nfrom Delaware and the Senator from Arizona, there is a clear \ndistinction in that case. There the President of the United States \nasked the Congress; am I not correct? Did he not ask the Congress?\n  Mr. BIDEN. He is correct, Mr. President. I am sounding too much like \na lawyer now. From a constitutional standpoint, whether they are asked \nor not is irrelevant. The only relevant constitutional point--and this \nis getting us off the point here, but the only relevant constitutional \npoint is whether or not the Congress granted authority, asked for or \nnot. That is the only relevant constitutional point.\n  With the Senator's permission, I would like to ask unanimous consent\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n\nto print in the Record a legal brief which I have written on this point \nrelative to the war powers clause and whether or not it is required and \non the issue of whether or not there is the equivalency of a \ndeclaration of war by the consent of the Congress for the action \nspecified.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may that request be granted in such a way \nthat it can appear after our colloquy and at the conclusion of my \nremarks?\n  Mr. BIDEN. With the permission of the Senator, I will put it in \ntomorrow so there is no question that it is not interrupting his \nremarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, while I have the Senator's attention, \nthough, he said--very interesting--I don't want to breach confidences, \nbut he and I have been present at three very important consultations \nwith the President of the United States.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. My recollection is, the first one was an hour and a half; \nthe second, almost 2; and the third, I think I was the last to leave \nafter 2 hours.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Long time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I know my colleague from Oklahoma, who will next speak, \nwas there throughout the 2 hours. I recall the Senator from Delaware \nwas engaged in a very interesting colloquy with the President about the \nissue of asking and not asking. Does the Senator remember that \ncolloquy?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I do.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thought he was quite accurate. My recollection is, did \nyou not solicit?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I did. Mr. President, again, I am sounding too much like a \nconstitutional lawyer here. I don't want to mix apples and oranges.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let's talk like a Senator. We are all \nSenators here.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If I may, the Senator makes a valid point. I will not tell \nyou what the President said, because that will be inappropriate. I will \ntell you what I said. I am allowed to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I remember it very well.\n  Mr. BIDEN. There was an issue, and all the Senate and House Members \nwere assembled, and they were about to vote on the floor of the House \nof Representatives on a resolution relating to whether or not the \nPresident would ask for consent to use ground troops. Let me be \nprecise.\n  A resolution was submitted characterized by the Speaker, as we sat \nthere, as one that would say the following, and eventually was voted \non. It said: Mr. President, before you introduce ground troops into \nKosovo, you must come to us under the Constitution and ask for our \npermission.\n  And the President--I can say this because he said it publicly. The \nPresident said, ``I didn't want to do something no President has \nacknowledged that he has to do in a debate with Congress.'' And I stood \nup, and I said, ``Mr. President, let me respectfully suggest you send \nthe following letter to the House,'' because I didn't want the vote to \nturn into the debacle it did. And I suggested the President say the \nfollowing: ``Notwithstanding the fact that I am not required to ask \npermission, I assure you that I will, in fact, ask the permission of \nthe Congress before I use ground troops, if I make that decision.''\n  That is exactly what I said. And then we got a letter from the \nPresident which said essentially that. My purpose was not relating to \nthe Constitution. My purpose was trying to keep the House from doing \nthe thing I found to be imprudent, because I was worried that if they \npassed the resolution, which in fact they have the authority to do--the \nCongress--it would send a message to Milosevic and others that we were \nunwilling to use ground troops if need be.\n  The President was saying, ``I don't want ground troops now.'' So I \nsaid, ``The way to settle this, Mr. President, you don't have to give \nup what you think you're''--you may remember--I said, ``Mr. President, \nI think you do need authority from the Congress if you're going to send \nground troops. But you don't have to give that up. You don't have to \ngive up that legal argument. Say, `Notwithstanding the fact I, the \nPresident, don't think I need that, I promise you I will not introduce \nground troops before I ask for your permission.' ''\n  That is not a constitutional commitment he is making. It is a \npersonal commitment he is making, as President.\n  And my purpose, I say to my friend from Virginia, was to keep the \nHouse from voting on that inappropriate resolution ahead of time, the \nvery inappropriate resolution that the Congress introduced and passed. \nThat is why.\n  Mr. WARNER. To move this along, I want to pick up on a few words. You \nsaid, ``Mr. President, the way to settle this is to send a letter.''\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is right.\n  Mr. WARNER. Here is the letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 28, 1999.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: I appreciate the opportunity to continue \n     to consult closely with the Congress regarding events in \n     Kosovo.\n       The unprecedented unity of the NATO Members is reflected in \n     our agreement at the recent summit to continue and intensify \n     the air campaign. Milosevic must not doubt the resolve of the \n     NATO alliance to prevail. I am confident we will do so \n     through use of air power.\n       However, were I to change my policy with regard to the \n     introduction of ground forces, I can assure you that I would \n     fully consult with the Congress. Indeed, without regard to \n     our differing constitutional views on the use of force, I \n     would ask for Congressional support before introducing U.S. \n     ground forces into Kosovo into a non-permissive environment. \n     Milosevic can have no doubt about the resolve of the United \n     States to address the security threat to the Balkans and the \n     humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. The refugees must be allowed \n     to go home to a safe and secure environment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Bill Clinton.  \n  Mr. WARNER. He sent the letter. Why is that, then, the way to settle \nthis as opposed----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have to call for the regular order here. The Senator \nfrom Virginia has 10 minutes, and the Senator from Oklahoma and others \nare waiting. So we have to proceed with the regular order.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, this is a time to do that, Senator. I think I am \nwithin my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona declines to yield \nfurther to the Senator from Delaware?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I decline to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am not seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will try and summarize.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator still has 11 minutes of the \noriginal 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. As a courtesy to the managers and the whip, I will not \nuse all that time, but I would like to just finish our colloquy. \nBecause I thought we were making a point, at least I felt very \nstrongly, the President gave the assurances. And you said the way to \nsettle this--and you wanted it for the House, the letter was sufficient \nfor the House--why wouldn't this letter continue to be sufficient for \nthe Senate? If it is sufficient for one body, it is sufficient for the \nother body. That is my point.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Would the Senator like me to answer? I will try to do it \nquickly.\n  Mr. WARNER. Put it on my time, Mr. President, so we do not interrupt \nthe distinguished manager from Arizona.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The House was trying to stop an action. The Senator from \nArizona and I are trying to start an action. We are not asking for the \nPresident's permission. We are trying to encourage the President to use \nall the persuasion available to him with our NATO allies to let him, \nthe President, know and our NATO allies know----\n  Mr. WARNER. You are encroaching beyond the minute or two.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is my answer. They are trying to stop; we are trying \nto start. It is a different issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply say, with great respect to both you and Senator \nMcCain, this does not grant the President of the United States one \nsingle bit of authority that he does not possess at this moment and \nthat every President of the United States has possessed from\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\nthe beginning of this great Republic. And, therefore, I fear that this \ncould be a hollow message. It could be misunderstood, not only in the \nUnited States, but in the other 18 nations that are allied with us; my \npoint being, the success thus far has been the ability--and, indeed, \nthis President has been active, as have other heads of state--in \nkeeping 19 nations solidly together to pursue this military action.\n  And my concern is, if the Senate were to take a resolution like this, \ndoes that not say to the other nations, the 18, ``Well, go to your \nlegislatures. And similarly, don't you have a responsibility comparable \nto what we have in the United States of America?''\n  And, Senator, I say this respectfully to my colleague form Delaware, \nthat other nations of that 18 group, their legislatures might well not \nact favorably on such a piece of legislation, and begin to start a \nfracturing of the solidarity of the NATO group.\n  That is my great concern, Mr. President. Therefore, I feel that it is \njust most unwise. And I shall vote against it. I really salute the \nSenator from Arizona, as well as my colleague from Delaware, because I \nbelieve their steadfast stance on this gave backbone to NATO to begin \nto at least dust off the plans to look at the introduction of ground \nforces, both under a permissive and nonpermissive situation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record remarks that I \nmade as chairman of the Armed Services Committee when the Secretary of \nDefense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs were before our committee, \nurging them to do just that.\n  That was weeks ago, before and during the course of the summit the \nSecretary General announced they would take that step.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Statement of Senator Warner--Kosovo Hearing--April 15, 1999\n\n       I start this morning by expressing my deepest regret for \n     the loss of innocent civilian lives--both Kosovar Albanian \n     and Serbian--in this conflict. I know our forces have done \n     their best to avoid such collatoral damage.\n       I welcome our witnesses this morning and note that this is \n     the first public hearing before the Congress on the situation \n     in Kosovo since NATO began its military operation on March \n     24. I thank you, Secretary Cohen and General Shelton, for \n     your willingness to testify on this crucial issue.\n       Since military operations began, the Armed Services \n     Committee has convened 5 closed briefings for Senators on \n     developments in Kosovo. I thank our witnesses for providing \n     officials to testify at those sessions. Today, the American \n     public will witness the first real public debate between \n     Administration officials and Members of Congress on this \n     issue. It is important that the American people have an \n     opportunity to see such an exchange of views. We have a duty \n     to keep our citizens well informed as our men and women in \n     uniform are in harms way.\n       As we meet this morning, the NATO air operation against the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia--Operation Allied Force--is \n     entering its fourth week. I was, and continue to be, a \n     supporter of air strikes against Milosevic's military \n     machine. We must see this air campaign through.\n       However, I have always believed that all options should \n     have been left on the table, including the planning necessary \n     to keep in place a ground option. By taking it off the table, \n     the wrong signal could have been sent to Milosevic.\n       In the meantime, I believe that positioning NATO ground \n     forces in key locations on Yugoslavia's Serbian border--as is \n     being done now on a small scale--could limit Milosevic's \n     freedom in the disposition of his ground forces and, together \n     with the air campaign, force him to prepare for a possible \n     ground attack by NATO forces. NATO should begin now to move \n     heavy equipment into the region, within striking distance of \n     Yugoslavia, both to threaten Milosevic and to lend protection \n     to countries such as Albania which are now threatened by \n     Milosevic's troops. The decision to use NATO forces to attack \n     Yugoslav troops on the ground in Kosovo could be made later--\n     but the deterrent effect of placing these forces in the \n     region would be, I believe, substantial.\n       Since last September when I traveled to Kosovo and \n     Macedonia, I have advocated the use of U.S. ground troops in \n     Kosovo as a stabilizing force to allow the various \n     humanitarian organizations to assist the Kosovar Albanians \n     who, at that time, had been forced into the hills by the \n     brutal actions of Milosevic. And I supported the use of U.S. \n     ground troops to implement the peace agreement which was \n     under consideration at Rambouillet.\n       There have been calls in Congress for a vote on legislation \n     authorizing the President to use ``all necessary means'' to \n     accomplish our objectives in Kosovo. The leadership of both \n     the Senate and the House have decided that such legislation \n     should not be considered this week. That gives all Members \n     the time to gather the necessary information on what it would \n     take to engage in a ground war against Yugoslavia. We need \n     the facts. What would be the basic parameters of such a \n     ground force--the size, type of forces and equipment \n     required, duration of the mission and exit strategy for such \n     an operation? A NATO assessment last summer estimated that it \n     might require 200,000 troops for NATO to fight its way into \n     Kosovo--and win. Is that estimate still valid, or has it \n     changed since the air strikes and Milosevic's intensive \n     military operations in Kosovo began? It is imperative for \n     Senators to have this information before we are called upon \n     to vote to authorize the use of ground troops against \n     Yugoslavia.\n       It is my hope that we will continue to gather that vital \n     information today, for the Senate, for the American people.\n       This hearing will also address future NATO strategy as we \n     approach the 50th anniversary Summit. In my view, the most \n     important issue to be discussed at that Summit is a revised \n     Strategic Concept for NATO--the document that spells out the \n     future Strategy and mission of the Alliance. I have recently \n     written to the President urging him NOT to adopt a final \n     version of a new Strategic Concept at the upcoming Summit in \n     Washington, given the uncertainty of events in Kosovo.\n       The United States and our NATO allies will have many \n     ``lessons learned'' to assess from the Kosovo operation--\n     lessons which will be a pivotal part of any future Strategic \n     Concept for NATO. If NATO is to continue to conduct such \n     ``out of area'' military operations in defense of ``common \n     interests'' in the future, we had better take the time to \n     carefully evaluate the Kosovo experience and incorporate the \n     ``lessons learned'' into any future strategy and doctrine for \n     the Alliance. NATO is simply too important for us to proceed \n     in haste on this key issue.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I am likewise concerned about consultation. The Senate \nand the House--the Congress--work very hard with this President, as \nthey have with other Presidents, to get consultation on these key \nquestions of our national security and foreign policy.\n  Were we to pass this, coupled with what I predict will be a strong \nvote for the emergency supplemental, indeed, the President's advisers \nmight say, ``We've got whatever we need now. Let's go about this. And \nwe need not have the consultation.''\n  We have had extensive consultation in the course of this very \ndifficult military action, and that consultation has enabled this \nSenator--sometimes there were 30 other Members of Congress up with the \nPresident working in consultation for not just 15 or 20 minutes or a \nhalf-hour but hours on end.\n  I commend the President for sitting there very patiently and entering \ninto a strong colloquy and exchange of views throughout that \nconsultation.\n  We might well lose consultation. We will send out a message that \ncould be misinterpreted. And, indeed, we could cast an affirmative \nresponsibility on other legislatures which could cause a fracture and a \nbreakdown of the 19 NATO nations standing together.\n  So, Mr. President, I commend my two colleagues. This has been a good \ndebate. It is going to go on for a while. We owe a great deal to both \nof you and others who wanted to have this debate. I think it has been a \ngood one. I am pleased to have been a part of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner for his always \ninsightful and well-thought-out debate and discussion. We appreciate \nhis outstanding work as chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague, Senator McCain, for \nrecognizing me, and I also compliment him for his leadership, although \nI oppose the resolution that is before us. I also wish to compliment \nSenator Warner for his comments. And I agree with his comments. I think \nwe have had some good debate. I think it is an important debate.\n  I have heard many things on both sides of the issues. I happen to \nconcur with a lot of the statements that some of the proponents have \nmade on this resolution. I just disagree with its conclusion. I think \nit is going to be interpreted, this resolution, as a blank check for \nthe President to do whatever is necessary to win in Kosovo, whatever \nthat means.\n  ``If you win, you are going to own Kosovo.'' Are you going to occupy \nKosovo? Maybe Kosovo is second prize;\n\n[[Page S4557]]\n\nfirst prize will be Serbia. And then we get to run Serbia. I do not \nthink we want to do that. I think it would be a mistake.\n  I stated on the floor, prior to the bombing resolution, that I \nthought it was a mistake. And I think it really kind of resulted as a \nfailure in diplomatic effort.\n  As a matter of fact, I think the diplomatic mission in this area has \nbeen a disaster. Unfortunately, it has resulted in a humanitarian \ndisaster.\n  Mr. President, could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chair.\n  I want to go through a little bit of the chronology to show, at least \nin my opinion, how we got into the bombing campaign, because what this \nresolution is kind of implying is, well, the bombing campaign is not \nworking. And we call it a campaign because the polls don't like the \nword ``war.''\n  It is interesting, I was with some of our colleagues, and we went to \nthe Kosovo region into the Balkans. We talked to our military planners. \nThey use the word ``war.'' But the politicians do not use the word \n``war.'' It doesn't poll very well. People don't like war. So this is \ncalled an air campaign. This is a mission.\n  I disagree with that terminology. How did we get into the air \ncampaign? How did we get into this air war?\n  I want to go through several statements, because, as I mentioned in \nmy opening comment, I think this has been a diplomatic disaster that \nhas led to a humanitarian disaster. It is not working, and some people \nare saying, let's double the ante again. Let's throw in troops now and \nthen maybe we can win.\n  I do not think that would be the result. I want to win, but I \nquestion, what is winning? Are we going to have a NATO presence, a U.S. \npresence in Kosovo forever? Are we going to go all the way into Serbia \nand occupy Belgrade and take Milosevic out and have him tried as a war \ncriminal? He is a criminal. He is a thug. I have met with him. He \ndoesn't tell the truth. He is responsible for a lot of serious \natrocities, and he should be punished. But something tells me this body \nis not going to say, let's mount up 250,000 or 300,000 troops so we can \ninvade Serbia and occupy Serbia and go door to door at the expense of \nthat. So I just mention that.\n  Let me go through a little chronology of how we got into the bombing \ncampaign as classified by the State Department. Just to put this in \ncontext, we started bombing on March 24. The Senate voted on March 23.\n  This is from the New York Times on February 19:\n\n       As the deadline neared for a settlement in the Kosovo peace \n     talks, the military and diplomatic pressure mounted today on \n     President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to choose between \n     tolerating NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo or suffering NATO \n     air strikes for refusing them.\n       Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said she had again \n     spelled out the choice in a telephone call to the Yugoslav \n     leader and that she would return Saturday to the talks, which \n     she visited last week.\n\n  That was on February 19th. February 20th:\n\n       President Clinton warned President Slobodan Milosevic of \n     Yugoslavia today not to ``stonewall'' a peace settlement in \n     Kosovo and threatened to bomb Serbia if Mr. Milosevic missed \n     the Saturday deadline for an end to the peace talks.\n\n  So we are threatening bombing. ``Mr. Clinton said the two NATO \nallies''--in this case, he is talking about President Chirac of \nFrance--stood ``united in our determination to use force if Serbia \nfails to meet its previous commitment to withdraw forces from Kosovo \nand if it fails to accept the peace agreement.''\n  I will talk about the peace agreement in a moment.\n  He also says, this is President Clinton, ``I don't think there is an \noption other than NATO airstrikes.'' This was in the New York Times, \nFebruary 20th.\n  Also February 20th, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says, at a \npress conference:\n\n       Let me stress that we expect nothing less than a complete \n     interim agreement, including Belgrade's acceptance of a \n     NATO-led force and a civilian mission building on OSCE's \n     Kosovo Verification Mission. Until the parties have \n     accepted all provisions of the agreement, preparations for \n     NATO military action will continue and if that agreement \n     is not confirmed by Tuesday, Secretary General Solana will \n     draw the appropriate conclusions.\n  I.e., the bombing will begin. It is also interesting that on February \n21 she says, according to the New York Times, ``If this fails because \nboth sides say `no,' there will be no bombing of Serbia.'' Mrs. \nAlbright said that on February 21, as Rambouillet talks were winding \ndown.\n  It is also interesting to note that 2 days after Rambouillet ended, \nthe European Union envoy to the talks, Mr. Petritsch, said, ``the \nYugoslav President decided he was not going to accept NATO troops--and \nmustered his own forces and propaganda to prepare for this military \nshowdown.''\n  It is also interesting to note in this same article, it says, In a \nmeeting with Italy's new Prime Minister in the Oval Office with the \nPresident on March 5, Mr. Clinton said Mr. Milosevic had ``accepted \nalmost everything,'' according to Italian officials, except for the \ninternational peacekeeping force. I added that comment. That wasn't in \nthe quote, but that is what he had not accepted.\n  This individual was skeptical. He asked the President, what was the \nplan if there was no deal and NATO airstrikes failed to subdue the \nSerbian leader. The result, he said, would be 300,000 to 400,000 \nrefugees passing into Albania and crossing the Adriatic into Italy.\n  ``What will happen then,'' Mr. D'Alema wanted to know, according to \nthe Italian officials. Mr. Clinton looked at Mr. Berger for guidance; \nthat is, Sandy Berger. ``NATO will keep bombing,'' Mr. Berger replied. \nAfter Rambouillet fell apart, a follow-up conference was called in \nParis 3 weeks later. While the world waited, Mr. Milosevic continued to \nbuild up his forces in and around Kosovo.\n\n       A defining moment came on March 18 at the International \n     Conference Center on the Avenue Kleber in Paris. To polite \n     applause, four ethnic Albanian delegates signed the peace \n     plan that would give their people broad autonomy for a three-\n     year interim period. The Serbs did not sign. That paved the \n     way to airstrikes.\n       Ms. Albright said that setting up a deal signed only by one \n     side was a crucial step forward. ``Signing Rambouillet was \n     crucial in getting Europeans two things,'' she said. \n     ``Getting them to agree to the use of force and getting the \n     Albanians on the side of this kind of a settlement.''\n\n  February 23, this is, again, Secretary Albright talking about \nRambouillet.\n\n       Rambouillet talks to a close. The Kosovo Albanians have \n     requested two weeks for consideration. Belgrade must be ready \n     to move by then as well, or prepare to face the consequences. \n     This period of reflection should not be taken by either side \n     as an excuse for military activities on the ground. We're \n     particularly concerned by recent movements of Serb forces and \n     harassment of members of the Kosovo Verification Mission. The \n     mission's security must be assured, and there should be no \n     doubt that NATO's January 30th decision permitting Secretary \n     Solana to authorize airstrikes remains in force. We also call \n     on the Kosovo Liberation Army to refrain from provocations.\n\n  So there is a 2- or 3-week period for the Kosovo representative to \nconsider this negotiation.\n  March 15, this is in the New York Times:\n\n       A massacre in the Kosovo village of Racak of more than 40 \n     ethnic Albanians by Serbian forces in January spurred the \n     current efforts of Ms. Albright to persuade NATO to authorize \n     air strikes against the Serbs if they reject a settlement.\n\n  So there was a massacre, according to this press report, of 40 people \nwho were killed in January. That led to this effort to use military \nforce in a bombing campaign.\n\n  March 18, again, this is Secretary Albright, State Department:\n\n       So the situation is as clear as it could be. The Albanians \n     have said yes to the accords and the Serbs are saying no. At \n     the same time, Belgrade's security forces are stepping up \n     their unjustified and aggressive actions in Kosovo and if \n     Belgrade doesn't reverse course, the Serbs alone will be \n     responsible for the consequences.\n\n  The war drums are rattling. This is March 19, a few days before the \nbombing commences. This is also in the New York Times.\n\n       With the Kosovo talks at a dead end, and the Yugoslav \n     leader more recalcitrant than ever, the Clinton \n     Administration was publicly pushing the threat of airstrikes \n     today, but officials said they have no option but diplomacy, \n     at least for another week.\n       Instead of responding to the threats, Mr. Milosevic has \n     moved in the opposite direction, building up his troops in \n     Kosovo to such an extent there are now deep concerns over \n     whether the 1,400 international monitors in Kosovo can leave \n     safely before his troops trap them by sealing their exit \n     route.\n\n\n[[Page S4558]]\n\n\n  Also in the same article it says, ``American military is warning that \nairstrikes may not be easy.''\n  March 22, a couple of days before the bombing campaign begins.\n\n       Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that Holbrooke \n     would warn Milosevic that the NATO allies are preparing \n     comprehensive missile and bombing strikes that could \n     devastate much of his military infrastructure. ``He will make \n     clear that Milosevic faces a stark choice: to halt aggression \n     against the Kosovar Albanians and accept an interim agreement \n     with a NATO-led implementation force, or bear the full \n     responsibility for NATO military action.''\n  This is just a couple days before, the night before bombing began, on \nMarch 23, on Larry King's program. Mr. King asked Secretary Albright:\n\n       Is there a timeframe here, Madam Secretary? Like you are \n     going to keep this up for 3, 4 days, let us know by Saturday? \n     Is there a plan?\n\n  Secretary Albright:\n\n       Well, again I am not going to reveal the operation time \n     line, this is a very well-thought-out military mission. I \n     think it would be a mistake. You wouldn't want me to give the \n     details here so that President Milosevic could hear \n     everything that is going on. But it is going to be a \n     sustained attack, and it is not going to go on for an overly \n     long time.\n\n  Then she continues and says: ``No, I mean what we have said. \nAmbassador Holbrooke said to him''--talking about Milosevic--``he had \nan opportunity to accept accords signed by the Kosovar Albanians in \nParis and have a peace agreement. He had an opportunity also to stop \nthe fighting. Ambassador Holbrooke told him that if he did not do that, \nthere would be very serious consequences. He has not accepted those two \nthreshold objectives and, therefore, he knows there are now serious \nconsequences.''\n\n  The next day the bombing began. I might mention that Secretary \nAlbright said, ``We are very well prepared. This is a well-thought-out \ncampaign.'' I just take issue with that.\n  I am not going to say I told you so, but on the debate we had on \nMarch 23, the day before the bombing campaign commenced, I made a \nspeech. On the floor of the Senate, I urged colleagues to vote no \nbecause I said I was afraid it would be a mistake. I said--and history \nhas proven--that bombing alone doesn't work. The President has said we \nare only going to bomb and not use ground troops. Then, I also said \nthat I was afraid it might make things worse. Instead of stopping \natrocities, it may turn a guerrilla war into an all-out war. I am \nafraid that is what has happened. I think we had a diplomatic failure \nand, as a result, now we have a humanitarian disaster, a catastrophe.\n  I was in Kosovo a week or so ago with some colleagues and I saw some \nof these refugee camps. There are 600,000-plus people who are now \noutside of Kosovo, driven away from their homes--in my opinion, because \nof a diplomatic disaster. We turned a guerrilla war into a real war. We \nstarted the bombing campaign, and I stated this on the floor of the \nSenate before the bombing started. I said:\n\n       Mr. Milosevic, instead of his response being to move back \n     into greater Serbia away from Kosovo, moving his forces out, \n     he may be more assertive and aggressive, and he may want to \n     strike out against the U.S. airplanes that are flying. He \n     might find that unsuccessful. He might have no success \n     against our pilots and our planes, but if he is not \n     successful against our planes, what can he be successful \n     against? Maybe the KLA, or maybe he would be more aggressive \n     in striking out where he can have results on the ground. So \n     by initiating the bombing instead of bringing stability, we \n     may bring instability. We may be igniting a tinderbox that \n     has been very, very explosive for a long time.\n\n  I am afraid that is what happened. The bombing campaign has made \nthings worse. I am afraid if we go in and say let's use all necessary \nforce, send in 300,000 troops, we may make things worse. I don't want \nto compound a past mistake that was a mistake, in my opinion, \ndiplomatically as well as a mistake now through the air campaign, and \ncertainly has turned into a humanitarian disaster. I don't want to \nfurther compound that.\n  Again, when I read the resolution it says to accomplish NATO \nobjectives--we are going to use all necessary force and other means to \naccomplish United States and North Atlantic treaty objectives with the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n  I have the Rambouillet agreement. I wonder how many colleagues have \nread this thing. I urge you to do it. It is 44 pages.\n  I am looking at some of the comments or statements made in this \nRambouillet accord. They said, ``We negotiated and Mr. Milosevic would \nnot sign this accord.'' I will read one paragraph. I brought this to \nthe President's attention last week, and Secretary Albright said: Mr. \nMilosevic would not even talk to us about an international peacekeeping \nforce. In one paragraph, we were insisting that if he didn't comply, we \nwere going to bomb him. On page 41, paragraph 8 of the appendix B, it \nsays this, talking about the NATO force--and some people say let's give \nNATO all necessary force. This is one of the things about which we said \nwe are going to bomb you if you don't sign:\n\n       NATO personnel shall enjoy, together with their vehicles, \n     vessels, aircraft, and equipment, free and unrestricted \n     passage and unimpeded access throughout the Federal Republic \n     of Yugoslavia, including associated airspace and territorial \n     waters. This shall include, but not be limited to, the right \n     of bivouac maneuver, billet, and utilization of any areas or \n     facilities as required for support, training, and operations.\n\n  Basically, it says NATO gets to occupy not only Kosovo but Serbia as \nwell. Isn't that interesting? I brought that to the President's \nattention. I don't know if he knew that was in there. I kind of doubt \nit. Secretary Albright almost acted taken aback. ``What are you doing \nreading the Rambouillet agreement?'' This is what we were saying he has \nto sign, or else ``we are going to bomb you.'' I think that is \ndiplomacy failure. It has led to a bombing campaign. We threatened that \nwe were going to bomb and now our credibility is at stake. I have heard \nthat time and time again.\n  I want NATO to be credible, but for crying out loud, when you are so \narrogant to say here is our wisdom, here is this accord, we determined \nthis is in your best interest and you must sign it or else we are going \nto bomb you--I stated in my speech on the bombing resolution that I \ndon't think you can bomb a country into submission or into signing an \nagreement. I doubted then that Mr. Milosevic, after the bombs were \ngoing to fall, was going to raise the white flag and say: Now I see the \nwisdom. That didn't happen in Bosnia. It got his attention in Bosnia. \nIn fact, the Croatian army was ethnically cleansing their own, and he \nwas losing the war. He decided to be more interested in a peace \nagreement.\n  I think Rambouillet was a diplomatic disaster and a failure and to \nsay, OK, well, we tried to bomb them into agreeing to this, but I don't \nthink that is going to work; maybe now we should use ground forces so \nthey can sign onto NATO objectives. I think it is a mistake. What \nshould we do? I don't want to just complain, but I think this is a \ndisaster. If you had seen the refugee camps, you would know it is a \ndisaster. There were several hundred thousand people. Senator McCain \npointed out that it is not just the several hundred thousand people who \nare outside of Kosovo and Albania and Macedonia, but the hundreds of \nthousands who are displaced inside of Kosovo. What should we do? I have \nheard several people in the administration say that he must withdraw \nforces and accept this international peacekeeping force, and if he \nstops all the aggression, then we will stop the bombing.\n  Mr. President, I think we need to have two or three things happen \nsimultaneously. He needs to get his aggressive forces out. We need to \nhave an international peacekeeping force to protect the returning \nrefugees allowed back in. And simultaneously with that, we need to stop \nthe bombing. We need to do all of them simultaneously.\n  The big difference I can see going on now is the negotiation of who \nshould compose the international peacekeeping force. I heard Secretary \nCohen say, and I have read time and time again, that it must be NATO-\nled or a NATO corps. They are talking about U.S. participation. I think \nour objective should not be so much just what is the composition of the \npeacekeepers; it should be to keep the Kosovars safe and sound and \nreturn them back to their homes. Those people are living in terrible \nconditions, living in tents. They have absolutely nothing to do. They \nare waiting hours to pick up food. They have to wait for a long time to \nuse the restroom facilities--latrines would be a more accurate \ndescription. It is not a pretty sight.\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\n  In the first place, I want to compliment many of the international \nrelief agencies that are doing a miraculous job. They have a very \ndifficult, if not impossible, job.\n  Mr. President, I think we need a very aggressive diplomatic effort. I \ndon't think this is a situation where one says, ``Well, let's just \ndouble up our military forces; well, if the bombing sorties''--and we \nare running so many thousands of these bombing sorties--``that is not \nworking; let's throw in another three or four hundred planes, double up \nthe bombing; let's get ready to have ground troop invasion into Kosovo, \ninto Serbia.'' I don't think that is the solution. I think we need a \ndiplomatic solution.\n  I believe I heard Strobe Talbott, Under Secretary of State, yesterday \nsay we are not negotiating. I almost fell off my chair when he said \nthat. Obviously, Jesse Jackson did some negotiation. I want this \nadministration to be negotiating. They need to be negotiating \naggressively to save lives, to minimize the human disaster, the \nhumanitarian disaster, the diplomatic disaster. Let's do everything we \ncan to allow the Kosovars to return safely as soon as possible--\nhopefully as soon as possible under the guise of an international \npeacekeeping force. And it can be with NATO participation. It can be \nU.N. led. It can be the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope. But let's make it happen, and make it happen soon.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this resolution \ntomorrow.\n  Again, my compliments to the sponsor of the resolution. I think this \ndebate is important. He was requesting the debate, and I think we have \nhad an excellent debate as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I \nappreciate his involvement, and deep involvement, in this issue. I \nrespect his views.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Arizona and ask if I may enlarge \nthat time to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I am joining today in this discussion and debate on \nwhat is a critically important issue not just for the current challenge \nfacing America in the Balkans but also, frankly, in terms of the \nhistory of Congress and this Nation.\n  I feel very strongly about that provision of the Constitution which \ngives to Congress, and Congress alone, the authority to declare war. It \nis, unfortunately, a power allotted to Congress which for the past 50 \nyears has been largely ignored.\n  One day after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Franklin \nRoosevelt hobbled to the podium of the House of Representatives and \ngave his memorable speech referring to a day which would ``live in \ninfamy.'' He then asked from a joint session of Congress for a \ndeclaration of war, first against Japan and then later against Germany \nand Italy.\n  That was literally the last time a President came before Congress and \nrecognized the authority of Congress to declare war. Every subsequent \nPresident--Democrat and Republican alike--found an excuse not to come \nbefore Congress and to wage wars of varying magnitude.\n  It is curious, when you look back after World War II, at the debate \non the formation of NATO and of the United Nations, how careful the \nMembers of Congress from both political parties were to preserve the \nauthority of Congress to declare war, to make certain that we would not \ndelegate that authority to any international institution or any treaty \norganization. Time and time again during the course of that debate we \nwere reminded that even as members of the United Nations, even as \nmembers of NATO, we were not ceding the power of Congress under the \nConstitution to declare war.\n  The steady decline of congressional involvement in the war-making \nprocess resulted, of course, in our participation in Korea, in Vietnam, \nin a dozen other military undertakings without the express approval of \nCongress.\n  Last year, I stood on the floor of this institution and asked my \ncolleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--to join me in reasserting \nthe principle that Congress, and Congress alone, has the authority to \ndeclare war and to engage in any offensive military action. Yes, the \nPresident is Commander in Chief and defends American personnel, \nAmerican territory, and does it without coming to Congress waiting for \na quorum and a debate and a final vote before he acts. No one would \never demand that a President restrain that authority to defend this \ncountry or its people. But in the case of an offensive military action, \none where we were not defending Americans, or our territory, or engaged \nin some peacekeeping permissive activity, I felt the Constitution was \nclear. I offered that amendment to the defense appropriations bill last \nyear.\n  For those who are keeping score at home, they might be interested to \nknow that 15 of the 100 Senators voted in favor of my resolution, and \n84 in opposition.\n  It will be interesting to take the debate on this resolution and the \nstatements made by so many of my colleagues and put them next to that \nvote and ask them if there has been a change of heart. I think to some \nextent there has been. I think it is unfortunate that we are \nconsidering this particular resolution and that we will have little \nchance to amend it.\n  I strongly agree with my colleagues who drafted the resolution that \nCongress must vote to authorize any escalation of this conflict to \ninclude ground troops. I filed an amendment that would prohibit the use \nof ground troops to invade Yugoslavia unless specifically authorized by \nCongress. The President said he doesn't intend to use ground troops. He \nhas promised in a letter to congressional leaders that he will ask for \na vote of Congress before introducing United States ground forces into \nKosovo in a nonpermissive environment.\n  I think the President must come to Congress before committing us to \nany ground war. I think it would better for us to vote on that \nspecifically. But I understand that a motion to table Senate Joint \nResolution 20 will be made and that it is not likely that I will be \nable to offer this amendment.\n  I did vote for Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 on March 23 that \nsupported airstrikes against Yugoslavia. It passed by a vote of 58 to \n41. I commend the President and this administration for giving the \nSenate at least an opportunity to vote before any action was taken. \nThat is a concession that has rarely been made by any President. Most \nPresidents moved forward as if the Constitution did not exist in terms \nof congressional authority.\n  I support the President and NATO's policy. I think we need to have \npatience and resolve to see the air campaign through. Many have \nquestioned the strategy of conducting an air campaign without \ncommitting ground troops.\n\n  This is an important debate. But I believe we had no choice but to \nstart the bombing campaign in an attempt to respond to ethnic \ncleansing, the genocide in Kosovo. We could not stand idly by and watch \nit happen.\n  I have listened to the speeches on the floor from some of my \ncolleagues who take exception to the premise that the United States \nshould even be involved in this conflict. I do not agree with that. \nFrankly, having been there, having seen literally thousands of people \nin a refugee camp in Brazda in Macedonia, it is clear to me what is \ngoing on. The policies of Milosevic in Yugoslavia are directed toward \ninnocent people.\n  Time and time again I asked these innocent Kosovars why they left \nKosovo--an open-ended question. Time and time again the response was \nexactly the same. In the middle of the night a knock on the door, \npeople in black ski masks, or otherwise concealed identity, gave them \nliterally minutes to leave: Pick up your babies, pick up your \ngrandparents and whatever you can hold, and leave, because we are going \nto burn down or blow up your home. If they were lucky, they got out. \nThey got out with a family intact. But many were not so fortunate. They \nwere victims of ethnic cleansing--not just displacement but murder. So \nmany times over and over we hear these stories of murder, of genocide \nagainst people, not because they have\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\ndone anything wrong but because they are of the wrong ethnic \npersuasion, the wrong culture, the wrong religious belief.\n  I am not sure what the word ``genocide'' means technically. But what \nI have seen is the closest I may come to it in my lifetime in that \nrefugee camp in Macedonia--victims of murder, rape, displacement, \ngenocide, suffering. These are the people forced out of Kosovo.\n  Some of my colleagues will come to the floor and say that is none of \nour business, we can't be the policeman to the world; the United States \nhas limited capability, limited responsibility. That is a point of view \nthat I would disagree with but I understand. We certainly cannot police \nthe world. But the fact is, we are part of a NATO alliance which is \nbeing tested in terms of its existence and its future. If NATO does not \ncome forward at this moment in time unified and determined to rid \nMilosevic of his killing fields in Kosovo, the NATO alliance is all but \nmoribund and dead and pointless.\n  For the 20th century, we have invested so much in American treasures, \nin American lives to preserve Europe: World War I, World War II, and \nthe cold war--thousands and thousands of Americans fighting and dying \nfor the stability and safety and security of Europe.\n  Now in the closing moments of this century are we to walk away from \nthis corner of the world which has been so important in our alliance in \nthe past? Are we to ignore the barbarism being practiced by Slobodan \nMilosevic? Are we to say that a man who has initiated four wars in 10 \nyears can now start another war if he cares to, find more innocent \nvictims for his policy of ethnic cleansing? Should we, as the United \nStates, step back as the lead nation in this important alliance and \ndeclare it is over? I hope not.\n  I think President Clinton is right. Fighting this war at this moment \nin time is critically important because it will validate the future of \nNATO. I hope for a generation, perhaps even a century of peace in a \nEurope that has been torn with warfare too many times.\n  The critical question in Senate Joint Resolution 20 is how far do we \ngo. I voted for airstrikes, I mentioned earlier. But this resolution \ngoes further. I read it in its entirety in the resolution clause:\n\n       That the President is authorized to use all necessary force \n     and other means in concert with United States allies to \n     accomplish United States and North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization objectives in the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro.\n\n  I cannot support that. As much as I support the current air war, as \nmuch as I support our efforts to stop ethnic cleansing by Slobodan \nMilosevic, I cannot support committing ground troops. I think that is a \nmistake.\n  I made a point during my recent visit to ask military experts how it \nwould be accomplished. How can we send troops in the field and \naccomplish this goal? Time and time again the answer came back: With \ngreat difficulty. We don't have the port facility that we can rely on. \nFrankly, we can't look at the nations surrounding Yugoslavia and find a \nready entry strategy. What we would have to do would be elaborate, \ncostly, expensive, time consuming, and dangerous.\n  That is why, though I support the air war, I don't support the \nconcept of sending ground troops. I don't believe it is necessary nor \npractical, and I don't think we should do it. This resolution is open \nended and gives the President authority for ground troops and beyond.\n  Just last week, the House of Representatives considered this issue. I \nam sorry to say, about an institution where I served for 14 years and \none which I hold in the highest regard, that it was not one of their \nfiner moments. It was an aimless, pointless, confusing debate. At a \ntime when the American people needed clarity and leadership from the \nCongress, they received neither. They voted not to expand the war; they \nvoted not to pull out; and then by a tie vote they failed to pass a \nresolution even supporting the current air war in place in Kosovo and \nin Yugoslavia.\n  I am not sure what message was sent. We spend a lot of time here on \nCapitol Hill talking about sending messages as if we are some sort of \ne-mail source or Western Union. But that was a very confused day for \nAmerica, and I am sure the confusion was felt around the world.\n  I hope our vote here does not lead to the same misunderstanding. I \nthink it is likely that this resolution, because it is so broad and \nopen ended, will be tabled. The decision made by that, I believe, that \nwe will continue the Senate approval of the air war, we will not give \nto this President something he has not asked for--the authority to \ncommit ground troops or whatever other power is in his hands.\n  How did we reach this point where we have to debate whether Congress \nwill exercise its constitutional authority? I think there are several \nreasons. By attrition we have given back to the executive branch the \nconduct not only of foreign policy but of the military as well, without \nany real reference for the language of the Constitution. We have said \nfundamentally, Mr. President, it is your decision to make.\n  I think it reflects many things. I think it reflects historical \nattrition. I think it also reflects a timidity on the part of Congress \nin terms of getting its hands dirty, involved in a military struggle \nthat might result in American casualties. That is a sad commentary \nbecause the American people count on us to come forward during the \ncourse of debate and with as much clarity as possible to explain the \nchoices and to make the call in terms of our military and foreign \npolicy.\n  I think, unfortunately, this resolution by Senators McCain, Biden, \nand others, does not express the feelings of Congress today. I think if \nthere were a resolution in the Senate as to whether or not we should \ncontinue this air war, as the President has proposed, it again will \npass as it did on March 23. This idea of expanding beyond goes too far.\n  I listened to the Senator from Virginia argue earlier that Congress \nhas a very limited, if any, role, when it comes to the declaration of \nwar. I disagree with him on that score. I believe there is an important \nelement here that must be remembered. The words of James Madison aptly \nsummarize the founders of this country and their thinking on this point \nwhen he said:\n  In no part of the constitution is more wisdom to be found, than in \nthe clause which confides the question of war or peace to the \nlegislature, and not to the executive department. . .[T]he trust and \nthe temptation would be too great for any one man. . ..Hence it has \ngrown into an axiom that the executive is the department of power most \ndistinguished by its propensity to war; hence it is the practice of all \nstates, in proportion as they are free, to disarm this propensity of \nits influence.\n\n  It is hard to imagine a clearer situation for acting on the Congress' \nwar power than the situation we face with Yugoslavia and Kosovo today.\n  I have offered a resolution which states that if the President seeks \nto expand this war beyond the current air war approved earlier by \nSenate resolution, it would require Senate approval. I think with that \ntype of resolution we would continue to assert our constitutional \nauthority to authorize military activity and to draw clear, bright \nlines as to the extent that the President can go.\n  I understand the Senator from Arizona, and I have heard him speak \nmany times on the floor and in the press about his belief that we \nshould give to this President all power necessary to complete the war. \nI appreciate his point of view, though I respectfully disagree with \nhim. I think that involvement in a ground war could be costly and, \nfrankly, not the result for which the American people are looking.\n  I hope during the course of this debate several things come through \nloudly and clearly. First, regardless of your point of view on this \nresolution, we support the men and women in uniform. Regardless of \nparty preference, we are here in support of their actions. I am proud \nof what I have seen and what I am sure will continue in their service \nto this country.\n  Second, we condemn the ethnic cleansing policy of Slobodan Milosevic. \nHe has picked on innocent victims time and time again, and this type of \ngenocide must come to an end.\n  Third, any expansion of this war beyond the current military \nundertaking must be with the consent of the American people through \ntheir elected Representatives in Congress. I hope, regardless of what \nthe vote may be on\n\n[[Page S4561]]\n\nthis resolution tomorrow, that that will be a principle which the \nPresident will continuing to abide by.\n  I believe NATO has a future. I certainly believe that America has a \nfuture in its leadership in the world. We are being tested in the \nBalkans. I want to pass that test so the 21st century is a century of \npeace.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \npending resolution authorizing the use of ``all necessary force and \nother means'' to address the crisis in Kosovo. I know our vote will be \na procedural one, and that the Senate may well vote to table the \nresolution.\n  I would therefore urge my colleagues to demonstrate their support for \nthe resolution by joining the distinguished senior Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain, and the Ranking Member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Biden, and others who have cosponsored \nthis legislation.\n  I am heartened by this bipartisan support for President Clinton's \nleadership of NATO efforts to stop the killing in Kosovo and allow \nethnic Albanians to return and rebuild their homes under the protection \nof a NATO-led peacekeeping force.\n  Mr. President, we are not debating whether our values and interests \nmerit the engagement of our armed forces.\n  President Bush first issued the so-called Christmas warning in 1992, \nthreatening the use of force if Yugoslav forces moved against Kosovo. \nPresident Clinton renewed that pledge soon after taking the oath of \noffice for the first time. Unlike our colleagues in the other body, the \nSenate clearly voted to authorize the President to conduct air \noperations and missile strikes against Yugoslavia.\n  Why did we do so? Why does the fate of ethnic Albanians in a province \nof what remains of Yugoslavia matter to the American people?\n  Because fundamental United States interests and values are at stake.\n  The first is the credibility of the United States as a moral leader \nin establishing rules of civilized behavior among countries, to take a \nstand against mass killings and mass rapes and mass expulsions of \ninnocent civilians wherever they occur.\n  The second is the promise of developed nations banding together to \nenforce these standards of conduct, as members of NATO are doing \nthrough joint military action against Belgrade.\n  At the fiftieth anniversary Summit, the leaders of nineteen \ndemocracies strengthened the Euro-Atlantic partnership so we can more \noften act--particularly in Europe--in concert with allies who generally \nshare our interests and values and who have the capability to undertake \nfully integrated military operations alongside U.S. armed forces.\n  Those nineteen heads of state and government were joined by the \nleaders of many other nations in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council \nexpressing solidarity to address the threat to European security from \nthe Milosevic regime in Belgrade.\n  Third is the credibility of United States threatening the use of \nforce when appropriate.\n  We have followed through on declarations made by President Bush and \nPresident Clinton. Now we must prevail. Otherwise, our leadership \naround the world will not be taken seriously, and we may find our \ninterests threatened more in the future.\n  Fourth, we must stop conflicts early, before a small but intense fire \nbecomes a widespread conflagration.\n  We must help neighboring states, particularly Albania and Macedonia \nand Montenegro, confront the challenge of helping hundreds of thousands \nof ethnic Albanians driven out of their native Kosovo. We have already \nseen the pressure which Belgrade has brought to bear by flooding these \ncountries with refugees.\n  One cannot fully predict what will happen if we do not prevail, \nstopping these crimes against humanity, this genocide in the Balkans, \nrather than permitting this abhorrent behavior to become an ordinary \nmeans of controlling events.\n  Finally, I would remind my colleagues, Mr. President, that Milosevic \nand his police and military forces are killing people and raping women \nand driving families from their homes based on their ethnicity--they \nare committing unacceptable acts. We have an obligation and a \nresponsibility to act to stop genocide.\n  We cannot stand by and allow these massacres to continue and claim to \nstand for what is right in this world?\n  Mr. President, the United States Senate has already decided that our \nnational interests and values justify the engagement of our armed \nforces. NATO air power has struck targets in Yugoslavia for more than a \nmonth now.\n  There are signs Belgrade's will to resist may be faltering. \nTherefore, we should not be showing weakness, because civilized values \nwill certainly be under assault.\n  We must have history reflect that such appalling behavior will \ntrigger sharp rebuff by democratic, life-respecting nations.\n  Milosevic cannot seriously question the military superiority of NATO. \nDespite some losses, we have managed to sustain a serious air campaign \nwith relative impunity. We have overwhelming force on our side.\n  Milosevic is instead pinning his hopes on NATO lacking the unity and \npolitical will to use the necessary force to prevail.\n  The time has come to disabuse him of these delusions. This resolution \nwill tell Milosevic that we are prepared to do whatever it takes to \nhalt and reverse his campaign of terror against the people of Kosovo.\n  Let me address some of the questions raised by my colleagues who may \nnot support the pending legislation: Does this Resolution mean the \nUnited States and our NATO allies will fight their way into Kosovo on \nthe ground? Should we not give air power more time to be effective? Why \nnot negotiate an end to the conflict?\n  The resolution would authorize the President ``to use all necessary \nforce and other means, in concert with United States allies. . . .'' \nThat would authorize use of resources if the President determines this \nis necessary. The President has asked us to be patient, to give air \npower time to achieve Belgrade's acceptance of NATO conditions.\n  While I am reluctant to wait while the killing and the rapes and the \nexpulsions continue, as a practical matter it will take some time--\nperhaps months--to plan and mount a ground campaign. NATO Secretary \nGeneral Solana has rightly decided to update plans for the use of \nground forces to liberate Kosovo and escort more than a million \ndisplaced Kosovars back to their homes.\n  By signaling our readiness to commit ground forces if necessary, we \ncan actually improve prospects for Belgrade's capitulation. In any \ncase, the United States should participate in an international force to \nmaintain stability and protect the civilian population of Kosovo, \nthough our European partners will appropriately take the lead in such \nan effort.\n  Negotiations are taking place. Former Russian Prime Minister Victor \nChernomyrdin, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, and others \nare trying to mediate a solution. This is all well and good, so long as \nthese mediators understand that we will not negotiate away the \nprinciples NATO has set out as conditions for an end to the bombing.\n  We all appreciate Reverend Jesse Jackson's courageous intervention to \nsecure the release of the three American soldiers captured on the \nYugoslav/Macedonian border. However, we cannot accept the ostensibly \nhumane act of their release as a license for Milosevic's forces to \ncontinue the mayhem, rape, and killing they are committing even as we \nspeak.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na description from the New York Times of a singular atrocity.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 3, 1999]\n\n              Survivor Tells of Massacre at Kosovo Village\n\n                          (By Anthony DePalma)\n\n       Kukes, Albania, May 2--It lasted no more than three \n     minutes, three minutes of savagery unleashed without even a \n     word. ``They just started shooting and I got hit in the \n     shoulder. the dead bodies behind me pushed me over the cliff \n     and into the stream. I was lucky because all of the dead \n     bodies fell on top of me.''\n       Isuf Zheniqi, who said he survived when 58 men died in a \n     massacre near Bela Crkva in southwestern Kosovo more than a \n     month ago, speaks out hesitantly, fearing Serbian\n\n[[Page S4562]]\n\n     forces might take revenge on members of his family still in \n     Kosovo.\n       But after crawling out from under the bodies of his \n     relatives, neighbors and friends, with a bullet from a \n     Serbian automatic rifle embedded in his right shoulder and \n     horrors filling his head, he has carried around the names of \n     almost all the men who died that day.\n       In crimped handwriting he puts them down on the pages of an \n     address book, name after name of old men, young boys, \n     teenagers and men, like himself, who were suspected by the \n     Serbs of belonging to the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is \n     fighting to make Kosovo independent from Serbia.\n       He remembers the names of all but one. But he knows there \n     were 58 because he helped bury them, each one with a written \n     name.\n       As refugees from Kosovo continue to flee across the border, \n     the accounts of atrocities committed by Serbian forces in \n     Kosovo multiply: a killing spree in the village of Velika \n     Krusa, the rampage of troops through the streets of \n     Djakovica, the slaughter of up to 100 men in the village of \n     Meja.\n       Accounts from different refugees are consistent enough to \n     lend a great deal of credibility to some. But eyewitness \n     accounts by survivors like Mr. Zheniqi are rare, either \n     because the killing was done efficiently enough to prevent \n     survivors, or because the sheer terror of minutes like those \n     on the embankment at Bela Crkva prevents survivors from \n     recounting their ordeals.\n       Mr. Zheniqi said that when he was brought across the border \n     by relatives he told human rights investigators what had \n     happened at Bela Crkva. But until now, he has not given \n     journalists a full account of his experience.\n       Human Rights Watch separately interviewed Mr. Zheniqi and \n     four other witnesses, who corroborated parts of his account.\n       Mr. Zheniqi was the only one who testified that he saw the \n     actual killing, Human Rights Watch officials said. Four women \n     who were separated from the men at Bela Crkva heard the \n     shots as they were walking to Zrze and later returned to \n     see the bodies.\n       And other refugees told Human Rights Watch that they were \n     among the group of 20 or so people who returned the day after \n     the killings to bury the bodies.\n       ``All the witnesses gave us highly credible and unusually \n     consistent accounts of what happened at Bela Crkva,'' said \n     Fred Abrahams of Human Rights Watch. ``They corroborated what \n     the eyewitness told us.''\n       The other witnesses appear to have left Kukes since they \n     were interviewed. It was impossible to confirm the killings \n     independently, beyond the refugee accounts, since reporters \n     and independent investigators have been unable to visit that \n     area of Kosovo since the bombing started.\n       Today Mr. Zheniqi lives in a Kukes pool hall, with his \n     daughter and her family. He cannot use his right arm because \n     of the bullet wound, and during the days he can often be seen \n     dozing in the sun outside the pool hall, trying to steal some \n     moments of the rest that eludes him every night because of \n     his terrible dreams.\n       ``My daughter tells me `Father, sleep, why don't you \n     sleep?' '' Mr. Zheniqi said. ``But I can't. All those dead \n     bodies on top of mine. When I meet someone from Kosovo and \n     they ask me what happened, I cry. I'm embarrassed, because \n     I'm 39 years old and I'm crying.''\n       The slightly built farmer, who worked for eight years in \n     Switzerland before returning to the fertile soil of \n     southwestern Kosovo, said that before the turmoil in Kosovo \n     began over a year ago, he had almost no contact with Serbs \n     living nearby.\n       But the area was a known stronghold of the Kosovo \n     Liberation Army, and the Serbs were advancing ruthlessly on \n     rebel positions, including the area of Bela Crkva. Mr. \n     Zheniqi said that he was not a member of the rebel force and \n     that none of those killed had any connection to the Kosovo \n     Liberation Army.\n       At 9:30 in the morning, Mr. Zheniqi said, 16 special \n     policemen appeared, shooting their automatic weapons in the \n     air. Two families had strayed from the group and Mr. Zheniqi \n     said the Serbs opened fire, killing every member of both \n     except for a 2-year-old boy who had been protected by his \n     mother.\n       ``She hid the baby in front of her and saved him,'' Zheniqi \n     said, His lips quivered and he could not talk. When he \n     continued, he said, ``I saw this with my own eyes, maybe 150 \n     feet from me.\n       The Serbs then shot their rifles in the air again and \n     shouted, in Albanian, ``Get up and come here.''\n       The villagers climbed up the banks of the stream with their \n     hands over their heads. When they reached the train trestle, \n     the men were separated from the women and children, and \n     ordered to strip down to their undershorts.\n       About 3:30 A.M. on March 25, on the First night of NATO \n     bombings in Yugoslavia, Serbian forces started their \n     operation, Mr. Zheniqi said. He said he saw about a dozen \n     Serbian tanks take positions in Bela Crkva. ``One was in \n     front of my house,'' he said. Anticipating violence, he took \n     his family and his brother's family--17 people in all--and \n     ran to the nearby mountains to hide.\n       When the streets again fell silent, they returned, thinking \n     the tanks has moved on. But they hadn't. Smoke soon rose from \n     the houses of Bela Crkva that were closest to the road from \n     Prizren to Rahovec. Mr. Zheniqi and his family fled again, \n     this time scrambling down the deep banks of a large nearby \n     stream. It was about 4:30 A.M.\n       ``The people from the whole village started to collect \n     there in the stream,'' he said. They went to a place he \n     called Ura e Bellase, where a train trestle crossed the \n     stream. About 800 villagers tried to hide beneath the bridge.\n       After daybreak, the villagers tried to move toward Zrze and \n     Rogovo, two nearby hamlets they thought would be safe. But \n     Serbian snipers followed their movements.\n       The police then went through their belongings, Mr. Zheniqi \n     said, taking anything of value. A local doctor trainee, Nesim \n     Popaj, tried to talk to the police in Serbian because his \n     nephew, Shendet Popaj, 17, had been thrown on the ground and \n     was under a policeman's boot.\n       ``The Serb looked at the doctor, said just two or three \n     words, and told him to move over a bit,'' Mr. Zheniqi said. \n     ``Then he shot him. We were shocked. The man was a captain \n     using an automatic rifle. He wore a green camouflage uniform, \n     and on his shoulders were stars. I don't know his name, but \n     he was tall and he had a scrunched-up mouth. I could \n     recognize his picture easily.''\n       The women and children were sent to Zrze. The men were \n     allowed to get dressed and then were forced to move over to \n     the high ground above the stream. Mr. Zheniqi was in the \n     first line, at the edge of the stream bank, with many men \n     behind him.\n       ``We tried to say something to the Serbs but they didn't \n     let us,'' Mr. Zheniqi said. ``If we tried they just said, \n     `Shut up.' We all cried. Sahid Popaj cried from the moment we \n     were forced to take off our clothes to the moment he died. He \n     just cried.''\n       The shooting started without a word from the policemen. \n     Several of them standing just behind the villagers opened \n     fire with automatic weapons. Being farthest away from the \n     gunmen provided Mr. Zheniqi with some cover, but he was \n     struck by a bullet in his right shoulder. The shooting lasted \n     about three minutes, he said. The weight of the men falling \n     behind him pushed him over into the stream.\n       He fell about six feet, landing in the water. ``At that \n     moment, I was just thinking of getting to one stone and from \n     there holding my head above the water. I stayed there like a \n     dead man for a total of maybe 20 minutes.''\n       The terror has not ended. The policemen lowered themselves \n     down the embankment.\n       ``I heard someone telling a guy in the stream: `He's \n     breathing, shoot him; he's breathing, shoot him,' '' Mr. \n     Zheniqi said. They found nine men who had hidden themselves \n     in the bushes, and killed them.\n       He waited another 15 minutes, and when all was quiet he \n     pull himself out from under the weight of his dead friends \n     and relatives. That was when he saw the extent of what had \n     happened in Bela Crkva. ``There in the stream, I saw terrible \n     things: men without eyes, men with half their heads blown \n     off.''\n       He staggered to Zrze, where he found some of his family and \n     told them about the killing. He said the men organized a \n     group to go back to the stream, but Mr. Zheniqi was not among \n     them. He said they found four other survivors, and piled them \n     into the wagon behind their tractor, dodging sniper fire. On \n     the way back, two of the survivors died.\n       The following day, about 20 villagers from Bela Crkva \n     returned to the stream to bury the dead. Already, they were \n     thinking of justice and the memory of those who had been \n     mowed down in three minutes.\n       ``We wrote the names of all the dead on separate pieces of \n     paper,'' Mr. Zheniqi said. Then we put the papers inside \n     plastic soda bottles. There was one name in each bottle. We \n     put the bottle inside the grave, not on top. And we buried \n     them, not far from the stream.''\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, our cause is just. Our objectives are \nreasonable. President Clinton has thus far insisted that Kosovo be \ngranted substantial autonomy within the borders of Yugoslavia.\n  We should be prepared to do whatever is necessary to prevail, to stop \nthe killing and the rapes and the expulsions, to reverse ethnic \ncleansing.\n  We must stand up for what is right. I hope my colleagues will agree \nand will join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I plan to vote against the motion to table the \nResolution. I believe the Senate has the right and the responsibility \nto clearly address this issue.\n  And I hope that this Senate, given the opportunity to vote on the \nResolution, will rise to the occasion and clearly authorize the \nPresident to do what it takes, together with our NATO allies, to \nprevail over the Milosevic regime, to stop the killing in Kosovo and \nhelp bring peace and stability to a troubled region of Europe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, on its face, this resolution is hard to \nchallenge. Of course, we want to do whatever it takes to win a conflict \nwe are engaged in. However, voting for this Resolution, while appealing \nto my instincts, would go against what I believe to be my obligation. \nThis Resolution is essentially a Declaration of War--a Declaration of \nWar that the President hasn't even requested. It would give to the \nPresident a blank check for an indefinite period of time, regardless of\n\n[[Page S4563]]\n\nany changes in circumstances. It does not even require that we act in \nconcert with our NATO allies.\n  Congress' Constitutional authority to declare war presupposes that \nthe President will support such action. In each of the five wars for \nwhich Congress has passed Declarations of War, none have come without a \nspecific presidential request. This resolution today, however, would \ngrant the President authority he has not sought, based on the War \nPowers Resolution he does not recognize, to fight a ground war he has \npromised he will not undertake.\n  If the Commander in Chief decides that we need ground troops in \nYugoslavia, then he should come to the Congress and request them. At \nthat time, the Congress would have the opportunity to ask certain \nquestions, such as:\n  what are our vital national interests here?\n  what are our military and political objectives?\n  do we propose to take Belgrade or parts or all of Kosovo?\n  how do we propose to get our troops into the battle area?\n  how many troops will it take?\n  how many casualties do we expect?\n  what will be the make up of the NATO ground forces?\n\n       e.g., how many U.S. troops?\n\n  how long will it take us to achieve our objectives?\n  how thinly spread will we be left in other places in the world where \nwe have military commitments?\n  what is the overall commitment level of our NATO allies, both with \nregard to such an operation and with regard to its aftermath?\n  When and if that time comes, I will ask these questions and others \nand listen carefully to the answers. I will give it careful \nconsideration and cast my vote depending upon the circumstances that \nexist at that time. If we pass this Resolution now, however, I fear \nthat these important questions will never be answered.\n  When Congress was first consulted with regard to the air campaign in \nYugoslavia, it was done almost as an afterthought, after the \nAdministration had already made its decision to begin bombing. Many of \nus felt at the time what we should all now know with certainty--that \nAdministration officials had not adequately considered all of the \nramifications of what they were doing. On the heels of that experience, \nshould Congress now, when the stakes have been raised much higher, \nauthorize and even pressure the Administration to fight a ground war \nthat they are clearly not prepared to fight? Does the Senate not want \nanswers to why and how a ground campaign would work--the kind of \nanswers that we should have demanded before the Senate voted to approve \nthe air campaign?\n  And with regard to the timing of this resolution, some now suggest \nthat more time should be devoted to debating this issue and I agree. \nHowever, this argument is being made a little late. It would have been \nmore helpful if we had had a more extended discussion of this issue at \na time when it might have had more relevance--before the final decision \nfor the bombing campaign was made. At that time, the President should \nhave explained to the Congress and the American people why going to war \nin the Balkans was in our national interest. We should have demanded \nit. However, he didn't and the Senate, after a debate under a 30 minute \ntime agreement, gave pro forma approval to a decision that had already \nbeen made.\n  And now in the middle of a bombing campaign that the President still \nsays will achieve our objectives, we are asked to cast another vote \nthat will have no effect. So be it. But I would hope that in the future \nwe would take up these matters earlier in the process and not let the \nPresident present them to us as a fait accompli. Perhaps then the two \nbranches of government could come together with some unity of purpose \nand we could all go to the American people with a clear message about \nour intent and about our interests. What we are witnessing now in the \ndisunity of the Congress and among the American people is the result of \nour failure to do that.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will be voting to table S.J. Res. 20, \nwhich would authorize the President to use all necessary force against \nYugoslavia.\n  On March 23, I voted along with 58 of my colleagues to authorize the \nuse of air strikes against Yugoslavia. I deplore the actions of \nSlobodan Milosevic, a dictator who has caused pain and suffering for \nall the peace-loving people of the region. The decision to launch \nairstrikes was made only after the Administration and NATO worked \ndiligently to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Kosovo. \nThere was, and continues to be, an international consensus that \nMilosevic's actions demand our continued use of air power. I continue \nto hope that air strikes will pave the way for an end to hostilities in \nthe region, a return of refugees to Kosovo, and an autonomy arrangement \nthat can be supported by all. The possibility of a diplomatic \nresolution to this conflict is very much alive.\n  Thus, the resolution before us today is premature. The President has \nnot indicated that he intends to expand the use of force here, he has \nnot indicated any immediate plans to use ground troops, nor has he \nasked us to fund such an expansion of the conflict in Kosovo. Thus, I \nmust vote to table this resolution.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today with deep concern over the \nClinton Administration's policy regarding Yugoslavia and Kosovo.\n  I have observed, over the past year, an Administration policy \ncharacterized by a lack of vision regarding events in the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia. In recent months, the American public has seen \nthe conflict in Kosovo explode onto the front pages of newspapers and \ndominate primetime television news. This conflict, however, is not new. \nIt stems from centuries of tension and a decade of deteriorating \nrelations between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo, made worse because of \nSlobodan Milosevic's rule over the country.\n  I do not want to downplay the seriousness of Milosevic's action in \nKosovo. Milosevic has treated the Kosovar Alabnians in a barbarous \nmanner. But, have NATO airstrikes solved this problem? No. And the sad \nfact is: United States policy has--if nothing else--unfortunately \nspeeded up Milosevic's campaign of terror in Kosovo.\n  And now, with our men and women risking their lives over the skies \nand on the ground in the Balkan region--we must take time to evaluate \npast policy and determine how best to move forward toward peace while \nmaking wise use of limited military resources.\n  Military intervention should be the method of last resort in any \nconflict. Once all efforts have been made to resolve a conflict \npeaceably--the only way to conduct military operations is with a clear \nvision of goals to be achieved--goals backed up by sound military \nadvice, common-sense wisdom with maximum objectivity based upon factual \nevidence.\n  I follow the Colin Powell doctrine on military operations--you should \nnot get into a military situation you don't know how to exit. In other \nwords, have plans on how you're going to get out of the situation. And, \nif you do initiate a military operation--you should go in at the \nbeginning with enough force to ensure victory.\n  A critical miscalculation in Clinton's Kosovo policy was the \npresident's outright statement that ground troops would not be \nintroduced into the region. It was an impassioned, emphatic statement. \nAnd it signaled to the world that--right out of the gate--the United \nStates was not serious about this mission. Not only were the military \ngoals vague, but the means to achieve those goals were laid out clearly \nfor Slobodan Milosevic to see. Milosevic knew he had time to further \nhis own twisted goals in Kosovo and has succeeded in wreaking havoc on \nthe region while dodging NATO missiles.\n  Therefore, we are in a situation where ``gradualism'' is being \npracticed. This was Clinton's only way of his misstatement regarding \nground troops. I say ``gradualism'' because the Administration has \nalready set the stage for troops to be on the ground--regardless of \nwhat Congress says about it. First, United States ground forces were \nsent to surrounding countries to aid in humanitarian efforts. They were \nfollowed up by support troops for air divisions--troops to support the \nApache helicopter division--troops to support artillery to support the \nApache helicopters. Soon, we will need troops on\n\n[[Page S4564]]\n\nthe ground to protect troops already on the ground. I think it's fair \nto say we are in a ground war even though we don't have United States \nmilitary forces on the ground within the geographical confines of \nKosovo.\n  Today we are debating a resolution to give President Clinton the \nauthority to use ``all necessary force'' to achieve Clinton \nAdministration goals in Kosovo. I understand this resolution \ninadvertently triggered the War Powers Act, which requires a vote. But, \nthe president not only hasn't asked for this broad-ranging authority, \nhe still maintains it isn't needed. Some of my colleagues wish to \naffirm the president's authority regarding our involvement in Kosovo. I \ncannot support such a resolution.\n  I cannot support a policy lacking common sense. I cannot--with a \nclear conscience--provide limitless authority to an Administration \nwhich has failed to demonstrate an understanding of the consequences of \nits policies. We must have a defined goal--and I'm talking more defined \nthan the United States diminishing Slobodan Milosevic's ``capacity to \nmaintain his grip and impose his control on Kosovo.''\n  What is our goal? To destroy all Yugoslav military forces and control \nthe entire Federal Republic of Yugoslavia? To occupy Belgrade? To expel \nMilosevic's forces from Kosovo?\n  This resolution will not move us closer to a clear goal--a clear \nstrategy.\n  I support our men and women who are risking their lives--even at this \nmoment--for the sake of NATO's reputation and Clinton's military \npolicy. I condemn Slobodan Milosevic's reprehensible actions in the \nKosovo region.\n  I seek clear military goals and concise, appropriate communication \nfrom our nation's commander-in-chief. Congress and the people of the \nUnited States are waiting.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 20 to \nauthorize the use of all necessary force in the NATO operation against \nYugoslavia. Taking such a step at this time is imprudent, particularly \nin light of the poor management of the ongoing air campaign against \nPresident Milosevic. Nothing in the operation to date indicates we have \ndefined strategic goals in Kosovo or summoned the political will to \nachieve those goals. Clearly, this is not the time to authorize the \nAdministration to escalate a strategically flawed and poorly managed \ncampaign in the Balkans.\n  A lack of foresight and planning has defined both the air war and the \nrefugee relief effort, allowing Milosevic to seize and keep the \ninitiative. The air war has been waged in a classic Vietnam-style \nfashion of escalation. Two principle elements of war, surprise and \noverwhelming force, have been sacrificed to the political whims of our \nEuropean allies. The first three weeks of bombing in Allied Force were \ncomparable to one day of bombing in the Gulf War. NATO has waited a \nfull month before targeting Yugoslavia's electrical and television \nnetworks. In the Gulf War, such assets were destroyed in the first two \ndays of the conflict.\n  Even as the President sends additional planes and personnel to \nenhance NATO's firepower, a lack of leadership continues to undermine \nour efforts to punish Milosevic. According to statements by NATO \nMilitary Committee Chairman, General Klaus Naumann, Apache helicopters \nwill not be sent into Kosovo, but fire into the province from Albania. \nNATO Commander General Wesley Clark is requesting additional planes, \nbut NATO is running out of basing areas in the Balkans. A lack of \npreparatory work to have these facilities ready has delayed 400 planes \nbeing deployed to the region. NATO has an oil embargo on Yugoslavia but \nwill not use force to stop shipments into the country.\n  The refugee crisis has been compounded by poor planning for the \nrelief effort. Before the air campaign began on March 24, the \nAdministration had enough food in the region to feed 500,000 people for \nfive months. Almost two-thirds of that amount was stationed in \nYugoslavia, however. For relief supplies such as tents and blankets, \nBelgrade was the only staging area for the U.S. Office of Foreign \nDisaster Assistance.\n  Clearly, the Administration's record to date on Kosovo is not a basis \nupon which to authorize the use of ``all necessary force.'' The \nAdministration misjudged the enemy and started this war with inadequate \nmeans. Now that we are engaged, we need to deploy overwhelming air \npower to accomplish our objectives. I want to see an aggressive air \ncampaign waged before we take the next step of deploying thousands of \nground troops to the Balkans.\n  We should be patient and allow an aggressive air campaign to take its \ntoll, but the air war must be combined with better political leadership \nif our objectives are to be achieved. An inability to explain why the \nUnited States is engaged in Kosovo has plagued this operation from the \nbeginning. Until the Administration has demonstrated the political \nleadership to define and achieve clear objectives in Kosovo, \nauthorizing the use of ground forces is ill-advised.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as a strong critic of the Administration's \npolicy in the Balkans, I am uncomfortable expressing my reservations \nnow that we are in a state of war. The U.S. forces conducting air \nstrikes against Serbia have my full support as they go into battle even \nthough I do not support what I believe to be an ill-defined mission.\n  Mr. President, I opposed the resolution authorizing the President to \nbomb Serbia, because I did not see how bombing Serbia would end the \natrocities being committed, bring about stability in the region, or \nlead to greater political autonomy for Kosovo. And I am going to oppose \nthis resolution as well. The Senate should not be moving to authorize \nthe President ``to use all necessary force''--when the President has \nnot asked us for that authority--and when the President has given every \nindication that he has no intention of moving in that direction. I know \nthat the authors of this resolution have the best intentions, but I do \nnot think that it is prudent to push the Commander-in-Chief towards \nputting U.S. troops on the ground. If the President believes that \nground troops are necessary, the President should come to the Congress, \nclearly explain his objectives and how the use of force can achieve \nthose specific goals. Then, and only then, should the President ask \nCongress for authorization to use ground troops. That is the way to \nproceed.\n  Mr. President, the only lasting solution to this conflict in the \nBalkans is a negotiated agreement where both sides agree to live with \nthe results. It is inevitable that Russia, and other traditional Serb \nallies, will play a role in this process. But given the record of the \nUN in Bosnia, the peacekeeping force would be more credible if it was \nunder a different organization's control. OSCE member nations who did \nnot participate in the NATO bombing campaign could provide a credible \nforce. The conflict between the Serbs and the Kosovars will not end \nwith a NATO defeat of the Serbs, just as it didn't end with the defeat \nof the Serbs by the Turks in Kosovo in 1389. The conflict will continue \nto flare unless a political solution is found to this intractable \nproblem, so I urge the Administration to actively engage in finding a \nnegotiated settlement to this conflict which will lead to a sustainable \npeace in the Balkan region.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for a deliberative democracy, going to war \nis an agonizing task. It is a slow, cumbersome, sometimes combative \nprocess itself. It is discomforting to all.\n  With regards to Kosovo, I understand the President's vision of what \nour world should be and what the United States' role in such a world \nshould be. I believe I also understand the foundations of his vision of \nthe role of the United States in a Europe fundamentally different than \nthe one into which NATO was born--where barbarians are not allowed to \nbutcher, and where long term stability on the continent must be \ndefended to maintain the standard of living we have fought so hard to \nachieve.\n  I also understand the intent of the authors and sponsors of this \nresolution. For our Nation to prevail in war, both the citizenry and \nthe Congress must be united behind the Commander in Chief during times \nof war. I commend my colleague from Arizona for his intent.\n  As Members of the Senate, we must make no mistake about the \nimportance of this vote, but we must also keep in mind the three \ncritical interpretations\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\nthis vote represents, regardless of the specific wording of the \nresolution:\n  First, this vote will be interpreted as a vote on whether we approve \nof the President's strategy so far--a strategy which seems to have \ninitially failed to achieve at least one of our primary goals: to stop \nethnic cleansing in Kosovo.\n  Second, this vote will be interpreted as a vote on what we believe \nthe role of the Congress should be in the future prosecution of this \nunfolding war.\n  Third, and most important, this vote will be interpreted as a \nstatement on whether we are willing to commit ground troops to invade \nYugoslavia, and whether we are willing to risk a considerable sum in \nblood and treasure to meet those goals.\n  On all three accounts, the vote on this resolution is premature. The \nwisdom or failure of the President's strategy cannot yet be fully \ndetermined. More important, at the current time in our military \ncampaign, with the decision of what means will be employed to achieve \nour ends still undetermined, it is premature for Congress to relinquish \nany future authority to say how this war will or will not be conducted.\n  While I said that I fully appreciate the importance of an \nunencumbered Commander in Chief, I also believe it is necessary for \nCongress to retain its limited but critical Constitutional role in \ndeclaring war. Such a vote, where that limited authority would be \nrelinquished now at a time prior to the President specifically seeking \nit from the Congress, is tantamount to approval of the deployment of \nground troops to invade Kosovo or other parts of Yugoslavia. That is a \nblessing I am not willing to give at this time--when the Commander in \nChief has not even sought that approval.\n  Because the resolution is premature, I will not support it now. If \nthe Commander in Chief believes this war must be expanded beyond the \nair campaign, he will have every opportunity to seek that authority. I \nwill listen thoroughly and fulfill my Constitutional duties at that \ntime.\n  For now, I will vote to table this resolution because such a vote \ndoes not tie the President's hands more that he has already. I \ncertainly will not give aid and comfort to our enemies by voting \nagainst the possibility of using ground troops. My vote allows the \nPresident full range of options but does underscore my insistence that \nhe more adequately address his rationale before the U.S. Congress and \nthe American people before committing ground troops to battle.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have been privileged to join with the \nSenator from Arizona, the Senator from Delaware and others, in \ncosponsoring this resolution. So I have listened with considerable \npersonal interest as one after another of our colleagues have expressed \ntheir points of view. I joined with Senator McCain and Senator Biden \nand the others in cosponsoring this resolution as a way to express my \npersonal support, and hopefully on a bipartisan basis--and the \ncosponsors of this resolution are a broad and bipartisan group--to give \nthe Senate an opportunity to express our support for the objectives \nthat NATO has adopted in entering the conflict in the Balkans and that \nthe United States and this administration have, of course, subscribed \nto. Let me read what those objectives are:\n\n       That the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, (Serbia and \n     Montenegro) . . . withdraw its military, paramilitary and \n     security forces from the province of Kosovo, [that the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] allow the return of ethnic \n     Albanian refugees to their homes, and [that Serbia] permit \n     the establishment of a NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo.\n\n  In light of all the blood that has been spilled, in light of the \nhorrific scenes that we have all not just heard about, not just heard \nrumored, not heard speculated about, but seen with our own eyes on \ntelevision, heard the eye-witness reports on television; of all the \nhorrors that we have been forced to witness again that have occurred in \nKosovo--when we think of all of those objectives of the NATO campaign, \nthe NATO effort, the NATO war in the Balkans, they are extremely \nreasonable and extremely just.\n  So I joined with my colleagues in offering this resolution as a way \nto restate clearly and simply what our objectives are here and to say \nthat we want to support the President of the United States. We want to \nsupport the President of the United States in the decision he has made \nto join with our allies in NATO to carry out this cause. We want to say \nby this resolution, so strongly do we believe in this cause, that we \nare prepared to give this President, as the resolution says, \nauthorization ``to use all necessary force and other means, in concert \nwith the United States allies, to accomplish United States and NATO \nobjectives,'' that I have just described.\n  To me, it is an opportunity, broad-based, simple, fair, direct, not \njust to stand together on a bipartisan basis in this Senate, but to \nstand together in support of the policy that this administration has \nadopted in support of our NATO allies and, in doing so, to send a \nmessage to the enemy, to Mr. Milosevic--who we are reliably informed \nbegan this invasion of Kosovo, this massacre, this massive expulsion, \nas others have said before me tonight and earlier today, based on the \nethnic history, identity and religion of the people being expelled--to \nsay to Mr. Milosevic, who, again, we are reliably informed, began his \nevil deeds in Kosovo with the hope and the belief that the NATO allies \nwould soon break their cohesiveness, would not hold in the face of this \nonslaught and his clever diplomatic moves, he was wrong.\n  The NATO allies were here just a week ago. They spoke with unity. \nThey strengthened their ranks. They came together. They agreed to \nintensify the effort against Milosevic and they have done so in the \nensuing week. Those of us who have brought this resolution before the \nSenate have done so with the hope that we might also make clear to \nMilosevic that the other belief he had, that he could divide the \nAmerican people and their Representatives here in Congress, was false. \nIt was in vain. It was folly.\n\n  That is the spirit in which this resolution was offered. I have \nlistened to my colleagues speak, and, as others who have spoken before \nme, it seems clear to me the motion to table this resolution will be \nagreed to tomorrow. I have heard three or four different reasons given \nfor that. I would say the majority of reasons are procedural, and I \nunderstand those. They are not substantive. They do not go to the heart \nof the policy that we, the sponsors of this resolution, have intended \nto convey. Some of my colleagues have said the resolution is not \nneeded; it is premature.\n  What NATO is doing now is carrying out the aerial bombardment of \nSerbia and military sites in Kosovo. The Senate has already authorized \nthat, to our great credit, on a bipartisan basis. Almost 60 percent of \nthe Senate voted almost a month ago, as the air campaign began, to \nauthorize and support, if you will, the President and NATO in that \neffort--that valiant effort, that effort that has been conducted by the \nmen and women in uniform for all the NATO countries and for ourselves. \nI am proud to cite the tremendous courage and skill with which our \nmilitary personnel have carried out that effort. The Senate \ndistinguished itself in support of that effort. Unfortunately, the \nHouse did not do so last week and sent a mixed signal. But I understand \nsome of my colleagues have said tonight the Senate has already spoken \non the military effort that is part of this battle against Milosevic, \nso we need not speak now in more width or depth.\n  What others have said--the second reason I can hear--is that the \nPresident is not asking for this authorization. In fact, since we \nintroduced this resolution, S.J. Res. 20, the President has indicated \nboth at meetings in the White House with a broad, bipartisan group of \nSenators, and publicly, if it came to a point, which he hopes and \nbelieves we will not reach--and of course we all hope we will not \nreach--when it became clear, tragically, that the Milosevic leadership \nin Serbia was remaining what I would describe as insanely intransigent \nin the face of a devastating air campaign against that country--which \nsome experts say, analysts say has already set back the Serbian economy \na decade, some say even more--if Milosevic remained intransigent, the \nPresident has said, and he was forced to reconsider the statement he \nhas made that he does not believe\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\nwe need to employ ground forces there, that he would come to Congress \nand ask for our consent. So I understand some of our colleagues have \nsaid, therefore, that this resolution is premature.\n  There are others, and I hope and believe, as I will say a little bit \nlater on, that they are in the minority here, who do not support this \neffort at all, who want to see us negotiate a settlement or, worse, \nnegotiate a settlement with a regime that has blood on its hands, that \nhas violated the values that we hold dear, the humanitarian values, as \nwe have all seen. We know what is happening. This is a regime in \nBelgrade that has carried out aggression, that has aimed at \ndestabilizing Europe; a regime that, over the last decade, successively \nhas invaded Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and now Kosovo.\n  This is a regime that, evidence leads us to conclude, by its policies \nhas brought about the death of hundreds of thousands of people. That is \nwhat this is about: Destabilization, aggression, ethnic cleansing and \ngenocide in Europe at the end of this century, challenging the premise \nthat brought about the creation of NATO 50 years ago, which was not \njust to defend against a Soviet invasion of Western Europe, but was to \nuphold the principles for which the then recently completed Second \nWorld War was fought, which were freedom, human dignity, democracy. \nSometimes, as I watch the slaughter continuing, the expulsions \ncontinuing in Kosovo, as I think of the history of Serbia and Milosevic \nfor these last 10 years, I just say to myself: Have we not learned the \nlessons of this century, of the last 60 years of this century?\n  Why did we fight the Second World War and the cold war if not to \nestablish the principle that it was in America's security interest and, \nof course, even more intensely and intimately in the security interest \nand the principal interest of our allies in Europe not to allow \ntyranny, brutality, communism to exist in Europe? It threatened the \nstability of that great region with which we have historic ties, with \nwhich we have extraordinary economic ties, which contains the heart of \nour alliance, the strength of the partners we would turn to, not just \nwhen in crisis in Europe, but when in crisis anywhere in the world, as \nwe did in the gulf war. Whom did we ask to stand by our fight, to fight \nby our side? Our allies in Europe, first and most significantly.\n  Will we allow this century to end having fought the Second World War, \nmade vivid in the Spielberg movie, ``Saving Private Ryan''--did those \nAmericans fight that extraordinary fight with that unbelievable \ncourage, lose their lives, so that a dictator, bent on the same kind of \naggression and ethnic genocide at the end of the century, would be \nallowed to work his evil will in Europe?\n  Did we spend billions of dollars and stand face to face with \nCommunist tyranny for the long years of the cold war, did President \nReagan lead us to the great final victories in the cold war, so less \nthan a decade later we would allow a Communist--what is Milosevic? He \nis an unreconstructed Communist dictator--that we would allow a \nCommunist dictator to work his will in the heart of Europe and in the \nbackyard of NATO, that we would stand by and do nothing? I hope not.\n  I take issue respectfully on the merits, as I see them, with those \nwho oppose this resolution because they do not think we should be \ninvolved. But I understand those who say, as my colleague from Illinois \nsaid a moment ago, that the Senate is not ready to make the statement \ncontained in this resolution.\n  As a cosponsor of this resolution, as one who worked with Senator \nMcCain, Senator Biden, and others to fashion this resolution, I have \nalready made the statement, I have already come to the conclusion, so I \nwill stand with all of my colleagues who have cosponsored this \nresolution and whom I heard speak up to now on this debate, who say \nthey will oppose the motion to table.\n  We are ready to vote, and we will vote tomorrow morning against the \ntabling of this resolution. We will vote against the tabling of the \nresolution with the confidence that if the President is wrong and the \nair campaign does not bring this war to an end, not on any weakened \nterms, but on the terms we clearly state in this resolution--the Serbs \nout, the Kosovars back in to live in peace, and an international \npeacekeeping force there--then we will return.\n  Those who have said that they are not prepared now to vote for this \nresolution, those who have said this is merely a procedural vote--and I \nunderstand that--those who are essentially voting to table not because \nthey are against, as I hear them speak, the substance of this \nresolution----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 3 additional minutes to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  I am confident if that day comes--and, of course, I hope it does not \ncome. But if we are not able to achieve the victory we must have here, \nthat NATO must have to remain credible, the United States must have to \nremain credible, that we must achieve so that all the bullies, the \nthugs and the dictators, wherever they may be--in Asia, the Middle East \nor anywhere else--will not see an opportunity to take advantage of us, \nif we return at that point to the Senate and ask for support for the \nnext necessary means to achieve our objectives, I am confident that on \nthat day a bipartisan majority in the Senate will not walk away from \nthe field of battle with the enemy having achieved the victory, will \nnot yield to the forces of ethnic cleansing and ethnic slaughter and \nethnic expulsion but will stand together, united across party lines, to \nsupport our soldiers in uniform, yes, indeed, our NATO allies, of \ncourse, to support the principles upon which this country was founded, \nwhich are at stake in Kosovo today, and to support the administration \nin the full conduct of this effort.\n\n  This is one of those defining moments. Tomorrow's vote is not the \ndefining moment. Tomorrow's vote is, if you will, an early round in the \ndebate in which a majority of Members are not prepared to vote for this \nresolution. If necessary, I am convinced on another day that they will, \nand I am convinced that that is very much in the national security \ninterest and in the national moral interest of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I continue to be pleased and proud of the \nSenator from Connecticut for his intellect, his insight, and his \ncourage. I thank him for his remarks tonight, but also his steadfast \nadherence to lessons of history. May I point out that he is joined in \nhis views by former Secretary of State Eagleburger, former National \nSecurity Adviser Brent Scowcroft, former Secretary of Defense \nWeinberger, former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and a broad \narray of other leaders who have led this country throughout the last \nthree decades. I am proud Senator Lieberman is one of those as well.\n  I yield 10 minutes to my dear and beloved friend from Georgia, \nSenator Cleland.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, my dear colleague and friend and fellow Vietnam veteran, for \npushing to make sure that this issue of war in Kosovo, war in \nYugoslavia, war in the Balkans receives the time and attention from \nthis great and august body that I think it truly deserves.\n  I am struck by the fact that in the earlier weeks of this year, all \nof my colleagues in the Senate gathered on a question of serious \nconstitutional gravity: impeachment of the President of the United \nStates. This is a serious matter equivalent to that, Mr. President, \nthat is, sending young Americans into harm's way. It is a \nconstitutional matter, one that I personally feel strongly about and \none on which I am personally conflicted.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Arizona, I served in Vietnam. I \ncannot help but think back, on the presentation of this resolution, to \nthe fact that some 35 years ago the Senate voted 88-2 in favor of the \nTonkin Gulf resolution which authorized the President to ``take all \nnecessary steps, including the use of armed forces,'' in Vietnam. The \nHouse approved that resolution unanimously, 416-0.\n  It is fascinating that my colleague, my friend, my mentor, Senator \nRussell, in those days chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and a \ngreat student of history, actually succeeded in attaching language \nwhich\n\n[[Page S4567]]\n\ngave Congress the right to terminate the authorization of the Tonkin \nGulf resolution at any time by concurrent resolution.\n  Senator Russell, in those days, certainly spoke against open-ended \nconflict where the Congress gave wide open authority to the President. \nHe tried to rein in the Executive and preserve the ability of the \nSenate, particularly, to exercise its constitutional authority and \nexercise its constitutional role.\n  But this vote on the Tonkin Gulf resolution served as an unchallenged \ncongressional authorization of war until 1970, by which time, of \ncourse, we were deeply involved in the conflict, but no closer, \nunfortunately, to our political objectives. The way out was long and \ndifficult.\n  The near unanimous votes in favor of war against North Vietnam in the \nmid-1960s reflected an apparent certainty of purpose and clarity of \nmessage to the President, our adversaries, the American people, and our \nservice men and women. However, future events, as they unraveled, were \nto show that this hasty congressional action, done for the best of \nintentions, to display national unity, eventually produced exactly the \nopposite result--national disunity. And we gave an uncertain reaction \nto the service men and women--and I was one of those servicemen--who \ncarried out the Government's policies and came back to a divided nation \nand a nation on its way out of war, not in it. But that process took 10 \nyears, Mr. President.\n  Growing out of our Vietnam experiences, the Senator from Arizona and \nI have taken the Kosovo issue very seriously. For us, it is not an \nissue--it is a war, a war in which young men and women's lives are at \nstake. And we come to very different conclusions about what should be \ndone in that war in terms of further military conflict. But we both \nbelieve the same thing in one sense, and that is, above all, the Senate \nmust speak, the Senate must debate, the Senate must stand up and be \ncounted in terms of the policy that we are to follow in the Balkans.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I urge that the motion to table this \nresolution be defeated. I shall be voting against the motion to table. \nWe cannot just table a war. We cannot just shunt aside the future lives \nof young men and women as they are risked at this hour.\n  It is fascinating how the resolution reads, the last sentence of \nwhich says that the President is authorized to ``use all necessary \nforce and other means in concert with United States allies to \naccomplish United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization \nobjectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.'' ``All necessary \nforce and other means.''\n  Mr. President, to me, that is an echo, a strange ominous echo of the \nlanguage in the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that passed this body \noverwhelmingly in the mid-1960s. This got us into deep trouble in \nSoutheast Asia. I see too many similarities between that experience \nthen and the war in the Balkans now. I see a similarity in an open-\nended conflict--one with no real military solution in sight, a conflict \nwith no real military strategy to win, and certainly a conflict in \nwhich we have no exit strategy from which to disengage ourselves from \nthe war in the Balkans.\n  Instead, I see a greater Americanized war. I see a doubling of the \nwarplanes--almost to 1,000 now--with the heavy majority of those \nairplanes being from the United States. I see 5,000 muddy boots on the \nground in Albania, all of them American forces, up cheek to jowl, right \nacross the line, with Serbian forces in tanks and dug into the \nmountains with armored personnel carriers and hand-held missiles, and a \ntremendous capability of ground fire. God forbid if we launch the \nApache helicopters into that forbidden zone.\n\n  I say to you, Mr. President, I support further debate. I will oppose \nthe tabling motion, but I will also oppose this resolution on its \nmerits.\n  I thank the President, and I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for the time to speak on this important matter.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his always very \nperceptive and enlightening debates.\n  I yield the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank my good friend from Arizona. \nAlways, he puts his finger on an issue--in this case, on an issue of \nwar and an issue of conscience. And this is an issue of both.\n  There is nobody who more eloquently or doggedly pursues both issues--\nwar and conscience--and the implications of both. And the experience \nthat he brings--as does our good friend from Georgia, and others--to \nthis body is absolutely indispensable in trying to work its way towards \nthe right conclusion in many of these issues. And I just, again, add my \ngratitude to what he adds to this body, to this Nation.\n  Mr. President, while I favor the thrust of the resolution before us, \nI do not favor its timing, and I will vote to table. I want to just \ntake a few moments this evening to explain this.\n  The stakes are tremendously high in Kosovo. We simply must not fail. \nWe cannot fail to succeed in Kosovo. NATO must not fail to succeed in \nKosovo.\n  Even before I visited the refugee camps a week or so ago, I felt \nstrongly about this. But meeting with the refugees, of course, \nreinforces my conclusion about the nature of Mr. Milosevic's ethnic \ncleansing.\n  This century of ours began with a genocide against Armenians; it is \nending with an ethnic cleansing against the Kosovars; and there was a \nholocaust in between.\n  If we want the next century to be freer of the slaughter that this \ncentury has seen in so many wars, we simply must support the united \naction of a united Europe to stop the success of Milosevic in his goals \nin Kosovo.\n  Of course, when you read about what the refugees have gone through, \nand you talk to refugees, it reinforces that determination--the stories \nof mass executions, mass rapes, the burning of 400 villages by forces \nthat presumably should be protecting those villages, since Milosevic \nclaims sovereignty in Kosovo. But instead of pursuing what sovereigns \nhistorically have done, which is to protect people they claim \nsovereignty over, this particular dictator is trying to destroy the \nvery people of Kosovo.\n  NATO made a statement last week which is of critical importance. It \nrestates a decision on the part of NATO to prevail. And the only way--\nthe best way, but perhaps the only way--that we are going to have a \ncentury next which is more peaceful in Europe and elsewhere than the \ncurrent century, is if NATO succeeds in its unified determination, as \nstated in Washington just about a week ago.\n  Two sentences kind of say it all. And those two sentences are these: \n``We will not allow Milosevic's campaign of terror to succeed. NATO is \ndetermined to prevail.''\n  This has rarely been true in Europe. I am not sure it has ever been \ntrue where we have 19 nations, including the United States and Canada, \nthat have come together to try to stop a genocide from succeeding in \ntheir backyard.\n  Europe has been divided before now--France, England on one side, \nsometimes Germany on another, countries divided into blocs against each \nother. But now what we have in Europe is the coming together of all of \nthe European nations, making one joint statement about what they will \nnot permit in their own land. ``We will not allow Milosevic's campaign \nof terror to succeed. NATO is determined to prevail.''\n  But that unity which is so critical to the success of the mission, I \nbelieve, will be negatively impacted if the Senate adopts this \nresolution that is before us, because this resolution would put this \nSenate and this Nation ahead of NATO. And we have to work in harmony \nwith NATO, in unity with NATO, in harness with 18 other democracies \nthat have taken a position. And that position is that we are going to \npursue, relentlessly, doggedly the success of the military mission and \nair campaign, the purpose of which is to significantly diminish \nMilosevic's military capability.\n  That is the current mission.\n  It is hoped the success of that mission will achieve the broader \npolicy objective of being able to return refugees, now over 1 million, \nto their homes in Kosovo. If that military mission and\n\n[[Page S4568]]\n\nits success in reducing Milosevic's capability to keep a stranglehold \non Kosovo does not achieve the broader mission of being able to return \nthese refugees, at that point we can consider changing the military \nmission. At that point we can consider the use of ground troops by \nNATO.\n  Is it prudent to plan for that? Yes, it is. In my judgment, it is \nprudent to plan for it. Would it be prudent, in fact, to carry it out \nonce the groundwork has been laid and Milosevic's military capability \nhas been significantly weakened? Yes, in my judgment it would be. Most \nimportant to the success of this mission, broad and narrow, is NATO's \nunity. It is my fear that the adoption of this resolution will put us \nin a significantly different position than the rest of NATO, in advance \nof a need to do so.\n  NATO is unified on an air campaign. It is not yet unified on a ground \ncampaign. The Apaches alone, after their employment begins, will take \n30 to 60 days before they have a significant impact on the ground. That \nis what General Clark, the commander, has told us. That may not be the \ncommon wisdom, common understanding, common media message, but that is \nthe truth, as General Clark believes it--that it will take 30 to 60 \ndays for the Apaches to have an effect after they begin to be employed. \nSo the debate over authorizing ground forces is a premature debate. I \nbelieve it will distract us from a current unified mission while we are \nin the middle of an air campaign.\n  It is for that reason that, with some reluctance, I am going to vote \nto table the resolution, the general direction of which I support, \nbecause it is so critically important that we be unified and united \nwith NATO allies, that we stay together in planning and in execution of \na mission which must succeed. We must not be distracted by a premature \ndebate about ground forces. Prudence and common sense would indicate \nthat we plan for such a contingency, but there is no need for us to \nauthorize it at this time. It seems to me, if anything, it will divide \nand distract, rather than protect that critical unity which is so \nessential to the success of this mission.\n\n  Again, I commend my good friend from Arizona and Senator Biden, \nSenator Lieberman, and the other cosponsors for their support of a very \nimportant position, which is that we now must win. That is the thrust \nof this resolution. Again, while I support that thrust, I will vote to \ntable for the reasons indicated.\n  I thank the Chair and, again, thank my good friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nMichigan. May I just point out, he made the point that it took a month \nor two to get the Apaches there. The reason I am urging that \npreparations be made in case we have to exercise the option is exactly \nthe reason he stated concerning the Apaches. It would take 6 to 8 weeks \nnow for us to assemble ground forces if we decide to use the option.\n  I am told by some military experts that we now have to worry about \nthe onset of bad weather in the fall, but I do appreciate the remarks \nof the Senator from Michigan, and I appreciate the results of his trip \nthat he made and the information that he brought back, which I think \nwas very helpful to the entire Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend. Again, I happen to \nconcur that the planning is prudent and should be underway. It is the \ncommitment to the utilization that I think might divide and distract. \nAgain, I thank him.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note the belated appearance of my dear \nfriend from Kansas. I yield him however much time he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, thank you very much for allowing me to \nspeak tonight. I recognize my distinguished colleague from Arizona for \nall he has done on this issue but, more than that, for what he has \ngiven to his country. He chairs the Commerce Committee, which I serve \non with him, but I have enormous respect for what he has already given \nto his Nation, the sacrifice where he put his life on the line in a \nprevious war. Actions speak louder than words, and he spoke with his \nactions many times. I am enormously proud to know and be associated \nwith him in this body.\n  Mr. President, the situation in Kosovo is clearly a very serious one \ndeserving of our deliberation and vigorous debate. To this point in \ntime, though, the administration, for my satisfaction, has certainly \nnot provided the Members of the full Senate body with the information \nneeded to make an informed decision on this matter. Therefore, I will \nvote to table the resolution.\n  One month ago, I wrote to the President asking that he respond to \ncertain fundamental questions regarding the objectives and the \nimplementation of the NATO mission in Kosovo. To date, I have not \nreceived a response to those questions.\n  What is the objective, I put forward? They have been responding and \ndefining some of that as we have gone along, but more specifically, how \ndo we define success? Is there a coherent and achievable plan of action \nin place? What price would we pay for this in terms of potential loss \nof lives? What about the monetary cost? Is escalation in the true \nnational interest of the United States? Those simple, basic questions \nthat I have put forward have not been answered.\n  Not until we understand the objective of NATO and how that objective \nwill be attained can we make an informed determination with respect to \nS.J. Res. 20. The administration must provide the answers to these \nquestions, with clarity, with satisfaction, and to the satisfaction of \nall Members of the Senate. Until that happens, I cannot give my support \nto the administration in this broad, open resolution.\n  At such time that it is shown how granting the President the \nauthority to use all necessary force and other means will bring us to a \nresolution more quickly, or at less expense or other means, then we \nwould be able to consider this proposal in some context.\n  I note, Mr. President, that I fully support our troops. I appreciate \nthe sacrifices that they are being asked to make to stop Milosevic and \nthe atrocities he has perpetrated against the people of Kosovo. It was \nseveral weeks ago that I was in Wichita at the McConnell Air Base \nmeeting with some of the troops and their families before they were \nshipping off. You could see in their eyes their willingness, their \ncommitment to see this action on through. They asked a number of the \nsame questions that I continue to ask of the President, that I continue \nnot to get satisfactory answers.\n  Until those are answered, I cannot give my support to this type of \nauthority. It is appreciation for these troops that makes it impossible \nfor me to support this resolution, until we understand the full plan. \nOnce we know it, then we can debate its merits and determine how best \nto support the President and our troops. Without that and in clarity of \nwhat that plan is, we are making a decision in a vacuum. The situation \nmerits more attention than that.\n  Again, I note, as I did at the outset, my enormous respect for my \ncolleague from Arizona who has put forward this resolution and his \nwisdom. His support of this makes me give much more pause to my \nstatement. But these questions have not been answered to my \nsatisfaction. While I respect that and I respect enormously the Senator \nfrom Arizona, I cannot in good conscience vote for this resolution at \nthis time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I say to my dear young friend, who I \nsee as one of the rising stars in this Senate--and I can say that with \nconfidence because I have watched very closely, as a member of the \nCommerce Committee, his involvement with a number of issues--I respect \nhis dissatisfaction with the failure to get an answer to certain \nfundamental questions that he and, frankly, the people of Kansas and of \nthis country have a right to get the answers to. I understand his \nposition on this issue, and I am in deep sympathy with it.\n  He makes a compelling case that we should be better informed before \nwe embark on a ground war or consider the likelihood of a ground war. I \nappreciate his views. The realities on the battlefield, I say to my \nfriend from Kansas, are that it requires a minimum of 6 to 8 weeks to \nget some forces assembled. So if we don't begin preparations--and I am \nnot saying we would\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\nhave to use them, but it is of the utmost importance that we do that; \notherwise, we will lose the opportunity.\n  A person that Senator Brownback and I respect enormously, Henry \nKissinger, the former Secretary of State, testified before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee last week. I quote him saying:\n\n       On the issue of ground forces, my view is as follows: I \n     have no way of judging what will ultimately be necessary. \n     That is a military decision. But first, it is a mistake to \n     preclude any category of forces and to turn the conflict into \n     an endurance contest.\n       Secondly, even if one believes that air power will \n     ultimately succeed, which it well may, we nevertheless should \n     make clear not only that we are planning to use ground \n     forces; we should assemble the ground forces that will be \n     needed. This will put a safety net under the bombing campaign \n     because under present circumstances, it is a question of \n     endurance. Thus, Milosevic and the Serbian leadership believe \n     that they can simply outlast us.\n       If they know that at the end--not even at the end, at some \n     stage in this process--we will insist on using ground forces, \n     I think it will shorten the air campaign.\n\n  That was the testimony last week of Dr. Kissinger before the Armed \nServices Committee. I know of no wiser man than Henry Kissinger, a \nperson who has a great appreciation for history and its challenges.\n  Because of our failure to even plan, much less prepare ground forces, \nas Dr. Kissinger, Larry Eagleburger, Brent Scowcroft, et cetera, seek \nus to do, this gives rise to articles such as were in the New York \nTimes this morning by William Safire. William Safire, who I think is \none of the most thoughtful and informed columnists in America, states:\n\n       Congress is not only ambivalent about buying into \n     ``Clinton's War,'' it is also of two minds about being \n     ambivalent.\n       That is because the war to make Kosovo safe for Kosovars is \n     a war without an entrance strategy. By its unwillingness to \n     enter Serbian territory to stop the killing at the start, \n     NATO conceded defeat. The bombing is simply intended to \n     coerce the Serbian leader to give up at the negotiating table \n     all he has won on the killing field. He won't.\n       He will make a deal. By urging that Russia be the broker, \n     Clinton knows he can do no better than compromise with \n     criminality. That means we are not fighting to win, but are \n     merely punishing to settle.\n       * * * Clinton has so few followers in Congress because he \n     is himself the world's leading follower. He steers not by the \n     compass but by the telltale, driven by polls that dictate \n     both how far he can go and how little he can get away with.\n       The real debate, then, is not intervention vs. isolation, \n     not sanctity of borders vs. self-determination of nations, \n     not Munich vs. Vietnam, not NATO credibility vs. America the \n     globocop. The central question is: Do we trust this President \n     to use all force necessary to establish the principle that no \n     nation can drive out an unwanted people?\n\n  It goes on, Mr. President, in this article to describe exactly the \ndeal that will be cut over time.\n\n       * * * Perhaps Britain's Tony Blair will prod Clinton to do \n     better, and all Serbian troops and paramilitary thugs will be \n     invited out of Kosovo. But the returning K.L.A will find mass \n     graves and will likely lash out at Serbs; after an indecent \n     interval, Belgrade will assert sovereignty with troops in \n     police uniforms.\n       And what will happen to the principle of no reward for \n     internal aggression? It will be left for resolution to our \n     next President, who, in another test, will have the strength \n     of the people's trust.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this entire article, \nalong with these other documents, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 3, 1999]\n\n                         The Price of Distrust\n\n                          (By William Safire)\n\n       Washington.--Congress is not only ambivalent about buying \n     into ``Clinton's War,'' it is also of two minds about being \n     ambivalent.\n\n       That is because the war to make Kosovo safe for Kosovars is \n     a war without an entrance strategy. By its unwillingness to \n     enter Serbian territory to stop the killing at the start, \n     NATO conceded defeat. The bombing is simply intended to \n     coerce the Serbian leader to give up at the negotiating table \n     all he has won on the killing field. He won't.\n       He will make a deal. By urging that Russia be the broker, \n     Clinton knows he can do no better than compromise with \n     criminality. That means we are not fighting to win but are \n     merely punishing to settle.\n       Small wonder that no majority has formed in Congress to \n     adopt the McCain-Biden resolution giving the President \n     authority to use ``all necessary force'' to achieve a clear \n     victory. Few want to go out on a limb for Clinton knowing \n     that he is preparing to saw that limb off behind them.\n       Clinton has so few followers in Congress because he is \n     himself the world's leading follower. He steers not by the \n     compass but by the telltale, driven by polls that dictate \n     both how far he can go and how little he can get away with.\n       The real debate, then, is not intervention vs. isolation, \n     not sanctity of borders vs. self-determination of nations, \n     not Munich vs. Vietnam, not NATO credibility vs. America the \n     globocop. The central question is: Do we trust this President \n     to use all force necessary to establish the principle that no \n     nation can drive out an unwanted people?\n       The answer is no. The distrust is palpable. Give him the \n     tools and he will not finish the job.\n       Proof that such distrust is well founded is in the erosion \n     of NATO's key goal: muscular protection of refugees trusting \n     enough to return to Kosovo.\n       At first, that was to be done by ``a NATO force,'' rather \n     than U.N. peacekeepers. The fallback was to ``a NATO-led \n     force,'' including Russians. Now the formulation is ``ready \n     to lead,'' if anybody asks, or ``a force with NATO at its \n     core,'' which means Serb-favoring Russians, Ukrainians and \n     Argentinians, with Hungarians and Czechs to give the illusion \n     of ``a NATO core.''\n       If you were an ethnic-Albanian woman whose husband had been \n     massacred, sister raped, children scattered and house burned \n     down on orders from Belgrade--would you go back home under \n     such featherweight protection?\n       Only a fool would trust an observer group so rotten to its \n     ``core.'' And yet that is the concession NATO has made even \n     before formal negotiations begin.\n       What can we expect next? After a few more weeks of feckless \n     bombing while Milosevic completes his dirty work in Kosovo, \n     Viktor Chernomyrdin or Jimmy Carter or somebody will \n     intercede to arrange a cease-fire. Film will be shot of \n     Serbian tanks (only 30 were hit in a month of really smart \n     bombing) rolling back from Kosovo as bombardment halts and \n     the embargo is lifted.\n       Sergei Rogov, the Moscow Arbatovnik, laid out the Russian \n     deal in yesterday's Washington Post: (1) autonomy for Kosovo \n     but no independence or partition; (2) Milosevic troops out \n     but Serbian ``border guards'' to remain in Kosovo, and (3) \n     peace ``enforcers'' under not NATO but U.N. and Helsinki Pact \n     bureaucrats. As a grand concession, NATO would be allowed to \n     care for refugees in Albania and Macedonia.\n       That, of course, would be a triumph for mass murderers \n     everywhere, and Clinton will insist on face-savers: war-\n     crimes trials for sergeants and below, a Brit and a Frenchman \n     in command of a NATO platoon of Pomeranian grenadiers, no \n     wearing of blue helmets and absolutely no reparations to \n     Serbia to rebuild bridges in the first year.\n       Perhaps Britain's Tony Blair will prod Clinton to do \n     better, and all Serbian troops and paramilitary thugs will be \n     invited out of Kosovo. But the returning K.L.A. will find \n     mass graves and will likely lash out at Serbs; after an \n     indecent interval Belgrade will assert sovereignty with \n     troops in police uniforms.\n       And what will happen to the principle of no reward for \n     internal aggression?\n       It will be left for resolution to our next President, who, \n     in another test, will have the strength of the people's \n     trust.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator McCain: If the 21st Century is to be a \n     peaceful and stable time, only the steadiness and power of \n     the United States will make it so. That steadiness and power \n     is now being tested; we must not fail. If ground forces are \n     essential to assuring our success, then we must use them.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence S. Eagleburger.\n                                  ____\n\n       I strongly support Senate Joint Resolution 20. Its passage \n     will be a strong message of our determination to Milosevic--\n     who may be doubting our resolve. It will also encourage the \n     President to do what is necessary to prevail.\n                                                  Brent Scowcroft.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, Mr. President, a person that I know the Senator \nfrom Kansas and I and the Senator from Illinois have enjoyed and \nappreciated over many years, Margaret Thatcher, who once counseled \nduring the Persian Gulf war for President Bush not to ``go wobbly''--I \nbelieve she said, ``Don't go wobbly now, George''--made a speech the \nother night for ``Project for the New American Century.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that her statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Margaret Thatcher: Last September I went to Vukovar, a city \n     destroyed and its inhabitants butchered by the soldiers of \n     Slobodan Milosevic. The place still smells of death, the \n     windows weep, and the ruins gape. Around Srebrenica, where \n     neither I nor many other Westerners have gone, the bodies of \n     thousands of slaughtered victims still lie in unmarked \n     graves. In Kosovo, we can only imagine what depravities of \n     human wickedness, what depths of human degradation, those \n     endless columns of refugees have fled. Mass rape, mass \n     graves, death camps, historic communities wiped out by ethnic\n\n[[Page S4570]]\n\n     cleansing--these are the monuments to Milosevic's triumphs.\n       They are also, let's remember and admit, the result of \n     eight long years of Western weakness. When will they ever \n     learn?\n       Appeasement has failed in the 90s, as it failed in the 30s. \n     Then, there were always politicians to argue that the madness \n     of Nazism could be contained and that a reckoning could \n     somehow be avoided. In our own day too there has never been a \n     lack of politicians and diplomats willing to collaborate with \n     Milosevic's Serbia. At each stage, both in the thirties and \n     in the nineties, the tyrant carefully laid his snares, and \n     naive negotiators obligingly fell into them.\n       For eight years I have called for Serbia to be stopped. \n     Even after the massacre of Srebrenica I was told that my \n     calls for military action were mere ``emotional nonsense,'' \n     words which, I think, only a man could have uttered.\n       But there were also good reasons for taking action early. \n     The West could have stopped Milosevic in Slovenia or Croatia \n     in 1991, or in Bosnia in 1992. But instead we deprived his \n     opponents of the means to arm themselves, thus allowing his \n     aggression to prosper.\n       Even in 1995, when at last a combination of airstrikes and \n     well-armed Croat and Muslin ground forces broke the power of \n     the Bosnian-Serb aggressors, we intervened to halt their \n     advance onto Banja Luka, and so avoid anything that might \n     threaten Milosevic. Even then, Western political leaders \n     believed that the butcher of Belgrade could be a force for \n     stability. So here we are now, fighting a war eight years too \n     late, on treacherous terrain, so far without much effective \n     local support, with imperfect intelligence, and with war aims \n     that some find unclear and unpersuasive.\n       But with all that said--and it must be said, so that the \n     lessons are well and truly learned--let there be no doubt: \n     this is a war that must be won.\n       I understand the unease that many feel about the way in \n     which this operation began. But those who agonize over \n     whether what is happening in Kosovo today is really of \n     sufficient importance to justify our military intervention, \n     gravely underestimate the consequences of doing nothing. \n     There is always method in Milosevic's madness. He is a master \n     at using human tides of refugees to destabilize his neighbors \n     and weaken his opponents. And that we simply cannot now \n     allow. The surrounding countries just can't absorb two \n     million Albanian refugees without provoking a new spiral of \n     violent disintegration, possibly involving NATO members.\n       But the over-riding justification for military action is \n     quite simply the nature of the enemy we face. We are not \n     dealing with some minor thug whose local brutalities may \n     offend our sensibilities from time to time. Milosevic's \n     regime and the genocidal ideology that sustains it represent \n     something altogether different--a truly monstrous evil; one \n     which cannot with safety be merely checked or contained; one \n     which must be totally defeated and be seen by the Serbs \n     themselves to be defeated.\n       When that has been done, we need to learn the lessons of \n     what has happened and of the warnings that were given but \n     ignored. But this is not the time. There has already been too \n     much media speculation about targets and tactics, and some \n     shameful and demoralizing commentary which can only help the \n     enemy. So I shall say nothing of detailed tactics here \n     tonight.\n       But two things more I must say.\n       First, about our fundamental aims. It would be both cruel \n     and stupid to expect the Albanian Kosovans now to return to \n     live under any form of Serbian rule. Kosovo must be given \n     independence, initially under international protection. And \n     there must be no partition, a plan that predictable siren \n     voices are already advancing. Partition would only serve to \n     reward violence and ethnic cleansing. It would be to concede \n     defeat. And I am unmoved by Serb pleas to retain their grasp \n     on most of Kosovo because it contains their holy places. \n     Coming from those who systematically leveled Catholic \n     churches and Muslim mosques wherever they went, such an \n     argument is cynical almost to the point of blasphemy.\n       Second, about the general conduct of the war. There are, in \n     the end, no humanitarian wars. War is serious and it is \n     deadly. In wars risk is inevitable and casualties, including \n     alas civilian casualties, are to be expected. Trying to fight \n     a war with one hand tied behind your back is the way to lose \n     it. We always regret the loss of the lives. But we should \n     have no doubt that it is not our troops or pilots, but the \n     men of evil, who bear the guilt.\n       The goal of war is victory. And the only victory worth \n     having now is one that prevents Serbia ever again having the \n     means to attack its neighbors and terrorize its non-Serb \n     inhabitants. That will require the destruction of Serbia's \n     political will, the destruction of its war machine and all \n     the infrastructure on which these depend. We must be prepared \n     to cope with all the changing demands of war--including, if \n     that is what is required, the deployment of ground troops. \n     And we must expect a long haul until the job is done.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Those are Margaret Thatcher's remarks. They were \ndelivered at the Institute for Free Enterprise on the 20th anniversary \nof her becoming Great Britain's Prime Minister.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues before voting tomorrow will read her \nremarks--Brent Scowcroft, Lawrence Eagleburger, and virtually every \nperson who has held a position of authority on national security \nmatters, both Republican and Democrat, for more than two decades.\n  Mr. President, the hour is late. I will move to the closing remarks \nin just a moment.\n  We have had a good debate today. I wish it had been longer. I think \nit should go on for several more days. But it won't.\n  Tomorrow we will have a tabling motion which may be one of the more \nbizarre scenarios that I have seen in my 13 years here in the Senate, \nwith an administration lobbying feverishly to defeat a resolution which \ngives it more authority. I have never seen that before in my years in \nthe Senate.\n  I believe we could have carried this resolution if the administration \nhad supported it. I can only conclude that the reason for it is that \nthe President of the United States is more interested in his own \nPresidency than the institution of the Presidency. Mr. President, that \nis indeed a shame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/03/senate-section/article/S4570-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, last week the Air Force General in charge \nof the Air Combat Command provided some valuable observations for the \nSenate to consider as we contemplate funding another protracted \nmilitary operation.\n  General Richard Hawley observed that the current build up in Europe \nhas weakened our ability to meet our other global commitments. General \nHawley added that the air operation in Kosovo would require a \nreconstitution period of up to five months.\n  The General will be retiring in June, and has spoken out on how this \nwar in Kosovo will weaken the readiness of the Air Force. I hope \nSenators will consider his concerns, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe General's remarks on military readiness reported in the April 30th \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 30, 1999]\n\n                 General Says U.S. Readiness Is Ailing\n\n                          (By Bradley Graham)\n\n       The general who oversees U.S. combat aircraft said \n     yesterday the Air Force has been sorely strained by the \n     Kosovo conflict and would be hard-pressed to handle a second \n     war in the Middle East or Korea.\n       Gen. Richard Hawley, who heads the Air Combat Command, told \n     reporters that five weeks of bombing Yugoslavia have left \n     U.S. munition stocks critically short, not just of air-\n     launched cruise missiles as previously reported, but also of \n     another precision weapon, the Joint Direct Attack Munition \n     (JDAM) dropped by B-2 bombers. So low is the inventory of the \n     new satellite-guided weapons, Hawley said, that as the \n     bombing campaign accelerates, the Air Force risks exhausting \n     its prewar supply of more than 900 JDAMs before the next \n     scheduled delivery in May.\n       ``It's going to be really touch-and-go as to whether we'll \n     go Winchester on JDAMs,'' the four-star general said, using a \n     pilot's term for running out of bullets.\n       On a day the Pentagon announced deployment of an additional \n     10 giant B-52 bombers to NATO's air battle, Hawley said the \n     continuing buildup of U.S. aircraft means more\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\n     air crew shortages in the United States. And because the Air \n     Force tends to send its most experienced crews, Hawley said, \n     the experience level of units left behind also is falling. \n     With NATO's latest request for another 300 U.S. aircraft--on \n     top of 600 already committed--Hawley said the readiness \n     rating of the remaining fleet will drop quickly and \n     significantly.\n       His grim assessment underscored questions about the U.S. \n     military's ability to manage a conflict such as the assault \n     on Yugoslavia after reducing and reshaping forces since the \n     Cold War. U.S. military strategy no longer calls for battling \n     another superpower, but it does require the Pentagon to be \n     prepared to fight two major regional wars at about the same \n     time.\n       As the number of U.S. planes involved in the conflict over \n     Kosovo approaches the level of a major regional war, the \n     operation is exposing weaknesses in the availability and \n     structure of Air Force as well as Army units, engendering \n     fresh doubts about the military's overall preparedness for \n     the world it now confronts. If another military crisis were \n     to erupt in the Middle East or Asia, Hawley said \n     reinforcements are still available, but he added: ``I'd be \n     hard-pressed to give them everything that they would probably \n     ask for. There would be some compromises made.''\n       The Army's ability to respond nimbly to foreign hot spots \n     also has been put in question by the month it has taken to \n     deploy two dozen AH-64A Apache helicopters to Albania. While \n     Army officials insist the helicopter taskforce moved faster \n     than any other country could have managed, the experience \n     appeared to highlight a gap between the Pentagon's talk about \n     becoming a more expeditionary force and the reality of \n     deploying soldiers.\n       Massing forces for a ground invasion of Yugoslavia, \n     officials said, would require two or three months. Because \n     U.S. military planners never figured on fighting a ground war \n     in Europe following the Soviet Union's demise, little Army \n     heavy equipment is prepositioned near the Balkans. Nor are \n     there Army units that would seem especially designed for the \n     job of getting to the Balkans quickly with enough firepower \n     and armor to attack dug-in Yugoslav forces over mountainous \n     terrain.\n       ``What we need is something between our light and heavy \n     forces, that can get somewhere fast but with more punch,'' a \n     senior Army official said.\n       Yugoslav forces have shown themselves more of a match for \n     U.S. and allied air power than NATO commanders had \n     anticipated. The Serb-led Yugoslav army has adopted a duck-\n     and-hide strategy, husbanding air defense radars and \n     squirreling away tanks, confounding NATO's attempts to \n     gain the freedom for low-level attacks to whittle down \n     field units. Yugoslav units also have shown considerable \n     resourcefulness, reconstituting damaged communication \n     links and finding alternative routes around destroyed \n     bridges, roads and rail links.\n       ``They've employed a rope-a-dope strategy,'' said Barry \n     Posen, a political science professor at the Massachusetts \n     Institute of Technology. ``Conserve assets, hang back, take \n     the punches and hope over time that NATO makes some kind of \n     mistake that can be exploited.''\n       Hawley disputed suggestions that the assault on Yugoslavia \n     has represented an air power failure, saying the full \n     potential of airstrikes has been constrained by political \n     limits on targeting.\n       ``In our Air Force doctrine, air power works best when it \n     is used decisively,'' the general said. ``Clearly, because of \n     the constraints, we haven't been able to see that at this \n     point.''\n       NATO's decision not to employ ground forces, he added, also \n     has served to undercut the air campaign. He noted that combat \n     planes such as the A-10 Warthog tank killer often rely on \n     forward ground controllers to call in strikes.\n       ``When you don't have that synergy, things take longer and \n     they're harder, and that's what you're seeing in this \n     conflict,'' the general said.\n       At the same time, Hawley, who is due to retire in June, \n     insisted the course of the battle so far has not prompted any \n     rethinking about U.S. military doctrine or tactics, nor has \n     it caused any second thoughts about plans for the costly \n     development of two new fighter jets, the F-22 and Joint \n     Strike Fighter. Despite the apparent success U.S. planes have \n     demonstrated in overcoming Yugoslavia's air defense network, \n     Hawley said the next generation of warplanes is necessary \n     because future adversaries would be equipped with more \n     advanced anti-aircraft missiles and combat aircraft than the \n     Yugoslavs.\n       If the air operation has highlighted any weaknesses in U.S. \n     combat strength, Hawley said, it has been in what he termed a \n     desperate shortage of aircraft for intelligence-gathering, \n     radar suppression and search-and-rescue missions. While \n     additional planes and unmanned aircraft to meet this \n     shortfall are on order or under development, Hawley said it \n     will take ``a long time'' to field them.\n       In the meantime, he argued, the United States must start \n     reducing overseas military commitments. He suggested some \n     foreign operations have been allowed to go on too long, \n     noting that the U.S. military presence in Korea has lasted \n     more than 50 years, and U.S. warplanes have remained \n     stationed in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, flying patrols over \n     Iraq, for more than eight years.\n       ``I would argue we cannot continue to accumulate \n     contingencies,'' he said.'' At some point you've got to \n     figure out how to get out of something.''\n       The Air Force blames a four-fold jump in overseas \n     operations this decade, coming after years of budget cuts and \n     troop reductions, for contributing to an erosion of military \n     morale, equipment and training. The Air Force has tried \n     various fixes in recent years to stanch an exodus of pilots \n     and other airmen in some critical specialties.\n       It has boosted bonuses, cut back on time-consuming training \n     exercises and tried to limit deployment periods. It also has \n     requested and received hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     extra funds for spare parts.\n       Additionally, it announced plans last August to reorganize \n     more than 2,000 warplanes and support aircraft into 10 \n     ``expeditionary'' groups that would rotate responsibility for \n     deployments to such longstanding trouble zones as Iraq and \n     Bosnia.\n       But Hawley's remarks suggested that the growing scale and \n     uncertain duration of the air operation against Yugoslavia \n     threaten to undo whatever progress the Air Force has made in \n     shoring up readiness. Whenever the airstrikes end, he said, \n     the Air Force will require ``a reconstitution period'' to put \n     many of its units back in order.\n       ``We are going to be in desperate need, in my command, of a \n     significant retrenchment in commitments for a significant \n     period of time,'' he said. ``I think we have a real problem \n     facing us three, four, five months down the road in the \n     readiness of the stateside units.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/03/senate-section/article/S4571-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4571-S4572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ON NATO INTERVENTION IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a month ago, April 7, as the war in \nYugoslavia began to assume its present form, President Clinton spoke to \nthe U.S. Institute for Peace. It was an important statement about the \nnature of conflict in the years to come. ``Clearly,'' he stated, ``our \nfirst challenge is to build a more peaceful world, one that will \napparently be dominated by ethnic and religious conflicts we once \nthought of primitive, but which Senator Moynihan, for example, has \nreferred to now as post-modern.'' I am scarcely alone in this; it has \nbecome, I believe, a widely held view. A recent article in The Wall \nStreet Journal began by asking: ``Does Kosovo represent the future or \nthe past.'' The distinguished Dean of the John F. Kennedy School had an \nemphatic answer.\n\n       . . . Joseph Nye, a Clinton Pentagon alumnus, forecasts a \n     brave new world dominated by ethnic conflicts. There are \n     thousands of ethnic groups that could plausibly argue they \n     deserve independence, he estimates, making it imperative for \n     the U.S. to decide where it should intervene. ``There's \n     potential for enormous violence,'' he says.\n\n  In this spirit, just yesterday, The Times spoke of ``The Logic of \nKosovo.''\n\n       With the cold war over, the country needs to devise a new \n     calculus for determining when its security is threatened and \n     the use of force is warranted. Kosovo is a test case. If the \n     United States and its NATO allies are prepared to let a \n     tyrant in the Balkans slaughter his countrymen and overrun \n     his neighbors with hundreds of thousands of refugees, other \n     combustible regions of Europe may face similar upheavals.\n\n  Almost a decade ago the eminent scientist E. O. Wilson offered a \nperspective from the field of sociobiology. Once ``the overwhelmingly \nsuppressive force of supranational ideology was lifted,'' ethnicity \nwould strike. ``It was the unintended experiment in the natural science \nmode: cancel one factor at a time, and see what happens.'' For ``coiled \nand ready ethnicity is to be expected from a consideration of \nbiological evolutionary theory.''\n  Throw in television and the like, and surely we are in a new \nsituation. Just as surely, it is time to think anew.\n  The first matter has to do with the number of such potential \nconflicts. Here it is perhaps the case that the United States bears a \nspecial responsibility. For it is we, in the person of President \nWoodrow Wilson, and the setting of the Versailles Peace Conference who \nbrought to world politics the term ``self-determination.'' It is not \nsufficiently known that Wilson's Secretary of State, Robert Lansing, of \nJefferson County, New York, had the greatest foreboding. Hence this \nentry in his diary written in Paris on December 30, 1918.\n\n                 ``Self-Determination'' and the Dangers\n\n\n                           December 30, 1918\n\n       The more I think about the President's declaration as to \n     the right of ``self-determination'', the more convinced I am \n     of the danger of putting such ideas into the minds of certain \n     races. It is bound to be the basis of impossible demands on \n     the Peace Congress, and create trouble in many lands . . . . \n     The phrase is simply loaded with dynamite. It will raise \n     hopes which can never be realized.\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\n      It will, I fear, cost thousands of lives. In the end it is \n     bound to be discredited, to be called the dream of an \n     idealist who failed to realize the danger until too late to \n     check those who attempt to put the principle into force. What \n     a calamity that the phrase was ever uttered! What misery it \n     will cause! Think of the feelings of the author when he \n     counts the dead who dies because he coined a phrase! A man, \n     who is a leader of public thought, should beware of \n     intemperate or undigested declarations. He is responsible for \n     the consequences.\n\n  There have to be limits, and it should be a task of American \nstatecraft to seek to define them. It is not that 185 members of the \nUnited Nations are enough. There is room for more. But surely there \nneeds to be a limit to the horrors we have witnessed in the Balkans in \nthis decade, and in Kosovo this past month. From the Caucuses to the \nPunjab, from Palestine to the Pyrenees, violence beckons. It is not \ndifficult to get started. At least one American diplomat holds a direct \nview of the origin of the present horror. I cannot speak for every \ndetail of his account, but some are well known, and his view is not, to \nmy knowledge, contested.\n\n       The current phase of the Kosovo crisis can be traced back \n     to 1996, when financial collapse in Albania (small investors \n     lost their meager life savings in a classic Ponzi scheme \n     condoned by the then government) led to political and social \n     chaos. President Berisha (a Geg from the misnamed Democratic \n     Party) was forced out amidst massive rioting in which the \n     army disappeared as its armories were emptied. Arms found \n     their way into the armed gangs and eventually to an incipient \n     Kosovo Albanian guerrilla movement that called itself the \n     Kosovo Liberation Army. The new government of Socialist Fatos \n     Nan (a Southerner, a Tosk, and a former Communist) was unable \n     to establish effective control over the north and Berisha \n     made a conspicuous point of not only supporting the KLA, but \n     actually turning his personal property in the north over to \n     the KLA as a training base. Supporting fellow Gegs apparently \n     makes for good politics among the northerners.\n       The KLA's strategy was very simple: Target Serbian \n     policemen and thus provoke the inevitable brutal Serb \n     retaliation against Kosovo Albanian civilians, all in the \n     hopes of bringing NATO into the conflict. They have succeeded \n     brilliantly in this goal, but have not proved to be much a \n     fighting force themselves.\n\n  These are not arguments new to the Senate. A year ago, April 30, \n1998, my eminent colleague John W. Warner and I offered cautionary \namendments concerning NATO expansion eastward. I went first with a \nproposal that new NATO members should first belong to the European \nUnion. I received, as I recall, 17 votes. My colleague then proposed to \npostpone any further enlargement of NATO for a period of at least three \nyears. That proposal, again if I recall, received 41 votes. We felt, on \nthe whole, somewhat lonely. Now, however, we learn that Defense \nSecretary William Perry and his top arms-control aide, Ashton Carter, \nas related by Thomas L. Friedman in The Times of March 16, 1999.\n\n       Mr. Perry and Mr. Carter reveal that when they were running \n     the Pentagon they argued to Mr. Clinton that NATO expansion \n     ``should be deferred until later in the decade.'' Mr. Perry \n     details how he insisted at a top-level meeting with the \n     President, on December 21, 1994, that ``early expansion was a \n     mistake,'' because it would provoke ``distrust'' in Russia \n     and undermine cooperation on arms control and other issues, \n     and because ``prematurely adding untried militaries'' at a \n     time when NATO itself was reassessing its role would not be \n     helpful.\n\n  The Secretary of Defense lost the argument; in Friedman's view \ndomestic politics overrode strategic concerns. But who won? The various \npronouncements that issued from the recent NATO summit come close to a \ntelephone directory of prospective new NATO members. Before we get \ncarried away, might we ask just how many of them have the kind of \ninternal ethnic tension so easily turned on? Which will be invaded by \nneighbors siding with the insurgents? Must NATO then go to war in the \nCaucuses?\n  The second matter of which I would speak is that of international \nlaw. The United States and its NATO allies have gone to war, put their \nmen and women in harm's way for the clearest of humanitarian purposes. \nThey have even so attacked a sovereign state in what would seem a clear \navoidance of the terms of the U.N. Charter, specifically Article 2(4). \nThe State Department has issued no statement as to the legality of our \nactions. An undated internal State Department document cites Security \nCouncil Resolution 1199 affirming that the situation in Kosovo \nconstitutes a threat to the peace in the region, and demanding that the \nparties cease hostilities and maintain peace in Kosovo. The Department \npaper concludes: ``FRY actions in Kosovo cannot be deemed an internal \nmatter, as the Council has condemned Serbian action in Kosovo as a \nthreat to regional peace and security.''\n  A valid point. But of course the point is weakened, at very least, by \nthe fact of our not having gone back to the Security Council to get \nauthorization to act as we have done. We have not done this, of course, \nbecause the Russians and/or the Chinese would block any such \nresolution. Even so, it remains the case that the present state of \ninternational law is in significant ways a limitation on our freedom to \npursue humanitarian purposes. Again, a matter that calls for attention, \nindeed, demands attention.\n  In sum, limits and law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/03/senate-section/article/S4572-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CLINTON HIGH SCHOOL'S ATTACHE SHOW CHOIR\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I want to honor the premiere high \nschool show choir in the Nation--Mississippi's own Clinton High \nSchool's Attache. Forty-two singers/dancers, sixteen instrumentalists, \nand seventeen crew members make up the outstanding group of young \nadults from a high school with an enrollment of 11 hundred.\n  For the past decade, the members of Attache have proven to be \ngoodwill ambassadors for their high school, their community, and the \ngreat State of Mississippi. They have traveled to competitions all \nacross America--Indiana, Illinois, Alabama, Florida, New York, and \nCalifornia. During this time, Attache has not only competed in, but won \nevery major show choir competition in the United States. They are the \nonly high school show choir to ever win the grand championship in each \nvenue of the Showstopper's International Invitational Competitions--an \naccomplishment of which Mississippians should truly be proud. While \ncompeting with other American high school students, they have \ndemonstrated to the nation Mississippi's culture and excellence in the \narts.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out that all of these accomplishments \nhave been made while balancing practice and performance schedules with \nacademics. These students serve as role models for the Nation. They \ndemonstrate the tremendous achievements which are possible through \ndedication and hard work.\n  Since 1992, David and Mary Fehr have led Attache. David serves as the \ngroup's director. He arranges all numbers, directs the vocals and \nserves as the pianist during the show choir's performances. Mary \ndesigns the sets and costumes for the performers and personally sews \nthe girls' outfits. This husband and wife team illustrates the value of \nteamwork. Discipline, self-reliance, and hard work are each of their \ncharges. They are the epitome of what a public school educator should \nbe. The Clinton Public Schools are blessed to have them on board.\n  This outstanding group of young adults and their dedicated leaders \nare shining examples of what positive energy can produce. It is \nrefreshing to know that there are still teenagers out there with \ndedication and determination. Being a part of this show choir requires \nlong hours and hard-work. Clinton and the whole state of Mississippi \nshould be truly proud of the accomplishments of Attache.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/03/senate-section/article/S4572-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4572-S4573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          JOHN HUME'S 30 OUTSTANDING YEARS IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The Europa Hotel was \n     the venue for what was described as a gala ``bash''.\n       The emphasis was on ``nostalgia and crack'' rather than the \n     often depressing stuff of Northern politics as colleagues and \n     friends of Mr. Hume gathered to reminisce on his career and \n     the SDLP's 29 year history.\n       Founder members of the party were present, including Mr. \n     Ivan Cooper, Fine Gael TD Mr. Austin Currie and Mr. Paddy \n     O'Hanlon.

Pursuant to section 204(b) of \nthe International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (50 U.S.C. \n1703(b), I hereby report to the Congress that, in order to implement \nthe measures called for by NATO, I have exercised my statutory \nauthority to take additional steps with respect to the continuing human \nrights and humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and the national emergency \ndescribed and declared in Executive Order 13088 of June 9, 1998.\n  Pursuant to this authority, I have issued a new Executive order that:\n  --expands the assets freeze previously imposed on the assets of the \n    Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \n    Montenegro), the Republic of Serbia, and the Republic of Montenegro \n    subject to U.S. jurisdiction, by removing the exemption in \n    Executive Order 13088 for financial transactions by United States \n    persons conducted exclusively through the domestic banking system \n    within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) \n    or using bank notes or barter;\n  --prohibits exports or reexports, directly or indirectly, from the \n    United States or by a United States person, wherever located, of \n    goods, software, technology, or services to the Federal Republic of \n    Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) or the Governments of the \n    Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), the \n    Republic of Serbia, or the Republic of Montenegro;\n  --prohibits imports, directly or indirectly, into the United States \n    of goods, software, technology, or services from the Federal \n    Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) or owned or \ncontrolled by the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n(Serbia and Montenegro), the Republic of Serbia, or the Republic of \nMontenegro;\n\n  --prohibits any transaction or dealing, including approving, \n    financing, or facilitating, by a United States person, wherever \n    located, related to trade with or to the Federal Republic of \n    Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) or the Governments of the \n    Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), the \n    Republic of Serbia, or the Republic of Montenegro.\n  The trade-related prohibitions apply to any goods (including \npetroleum and petroleum products), software, technology (including \ntechnical data), or services, except to the extent excluded by section \n203(b) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)).\n  The ban on new investment by United States persons in the territory \nof Serbia--imposed by Executive Order 13088--continues in effect.\n  The Executive order provides that the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, shall give special \nconsideration to the circumstances of the Government of the Republic of \nMontenegro. As with Executive Order 13088, an exemption from the new \nsanctions has been granted to Montenegro. In implementing this order, \nspecial consideration is also to be given to the humanitarian needs of \nrefugees from Kosovo and other civilians within the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).\n  In keeping with my Administration's new policy to exempt commercial \nsales of food and medicine from sanctions regimes, the Executive order \ndirects the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the \nSecretary of State, to authorize commercial sales of agricultural \ncommodities and products, medicine, and medical equipment for civilian \nend use in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). \nSuch sales are to be subject to appropriate safeguards to prevent \ndiversion to military, paramilitary, or political use by the \nGovernments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro), the Republic of Serbia, or the Republic of Montenegro), \nthe Republic of Serbia, or the Republic of Montenegro.\n                                                  William J.

and\n       Whereas, The Kansas Gulf War Veterans Health Study \n     indicates that most deployed veterans with Gulf War illness \n     continue to be employed, but 79% say their health affects \n     their ability to work; and\n       Whereas, The Kansas Gulf War Veterans Health Study \n     indicates that Kansas veterans who deployed to the Gulf War \n     are significantly less likely to receive disability \n     compensation from the United States Department of Veterans \n     Affairs than nondeployed veterans of the same era; and\n       Whereas, Kansas has thousands of deployable troops at \n     facilities such as Fort Riley, Fort Leavenworth, McConnell \n     Air Base, as well as reservists and members of our Kansas \n     National Guard; and\n       Whereas, The results of the Kansas Persian Gulf War \n     Veterans Health Initiative are very troubling, we must do all \n     we can to prevent a repeat of ``Gulf War illness'' in any \n     future conflict that affects our Kansas military men and \n     women: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Kansas, the Senate concurring therein, That we, the Kansas \n     Legislature, believe that Gulf War illness has had a severe \n     negative impact on the physical and emotional well-being of \n     Gulf War veterans who honorably served Kansas and the United \n     States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we memorialize the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to provide funding for Gulf War \n     illness research independent of that administered by the \n     United States Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs; \n     and to establish a process of independent review of federal \n     policies and programs associated with Gulf War illness \n     research, benefits, and health care; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the Governor of Kansas, the \n     Secretary of Health and Environment, the Kansas Commission \n     on Veterans Affairs, and other appropriate state agency \n     heads to take action to continue to investigate Gulf War \n     illness and promote programs to inform and assist Kansas \n     Gulf War veterans and family members suffering from Gulf \n     War illness; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge our Kansas Congressional Delegation \n     to coordinate acquisition of federal grants from the National \n     Institute of Health (N.I.H.) or other federal sources to seek \n     causes and cures for Gulf War illness; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge our Kansas Congressional Delegation \n     to build coalitions with other states to call on Congress and \n     the administration for action in investigating and finding \n     answers to Gulf War illness; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we encourage our Kansas Congressional \n     Delegation to meet with members of the Kansas Persian Gulf \n     War Veterans Initiative to coordinate efforts on the federal \n     level; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be directed to \n     provide an enrolled copy of this resolution to the President \n     of the United States, the Vice-President of the United \n     States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs, and to each member of the Kansas \n     Congressional delegation;

An amount of $4,595,769 constituting 19.7% of total \n     education expenditures in the City of Auburn;\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 25\n\n       Whereas, during World War II, the United States forcibly \n     removed and interned over 120,000 United States citizens and \n     legal permanent residents of Japanese ancestry from their \n     homes and relocated them to government internment camps; and\n       Whereas, in addition, the United States arranged the \n     deportation of over 2,264 men, women, and children of \n     Japanese ancestry from thirteen Latin American countries to \n     the United States to be interned and used in prisoner of war \n     exchanges with Japan; and\n       Whereas, in 1988, the United States Congress passed, and \n     President Reagan signed, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (the \n     Act), which acknowledged the fundamental injustice of that \n     evacuation, relocation, and internment, and to apologize on \n     behalf of the people of the United States for the wrongs done \n     to United States citizens and legal permanent residents of \n     Japanese ancestry; and\n       Whereas, that Act further sought to make restitution to \n     those individuals of Japanese ancestry who were interned by \n     authorizing a $20,000 redress payment to each citizen and \n     legal permanent resident of Japanese ancestry who was \n     deprived of liberty or property as a result of government \n     action; and\n       Whereas, the Act directed the United States Treasury to \n     distribute these payments, to which Congress appropriated \n     $1,650,000,000 between October 1990 and October 1993; and\n       Whereas, in a subsequent settlement of a class action suit, \n     the United States agreed to send a letter of apology and to \n     pay a $5,000 redress payment from the same fund to each \n     formerly interned Japanese Latin American; and\n       Whereas, to fulfill its educational purpose of informing \n     the public about the internment so as to prevent the \n     recurrence of similar events, the Act also created the Civil \n     Liberties Public Education Fund to make disbursements for \n     research and educational activities up to a total of \n     $50,000,000; and\n       Whereas, Congress specified in the Act that the principal \n     of $1,650,000,000 was to be invested in government \n     obligations and earn interest at an annual rate of at least \n     five per cent; and\n       Whereas, in 1998, a Japanese Peruvian former internee and \n     the National Coalition for Redress/Reparations filed a class \n     action suit alleging that the Treasury Department breached \n     its fiduciary duty by failing to invest the funds mandated by \n     Congress, and seeking to recover the lost interest which is \n     estimated to be between $50,000,000 and $200,000,000; and\n       Whereas, while the reparations fund has made payments to \n     approximately eighty-two thousand claimants, there will not \n     be sufficient money in the trust fund established by Congress \n     to pay all of the remaining claims by Japanese Americans and \n     Japanese Latin Americans or to meet the goal of $50,000,000 \n     in educational grants; and\n       Whereas, a United States Justice Department official has \n     apparently acknowledged that the funds were not invested as \n     originally mandated by Congress, and that the $1,650,000,000 \n     has all been spent, although claims are still pending; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature finds that while nothing can \n     replace the loss of civil liberties suffered by those who \n     were forced to evacuate their homes and relocate to \n     internment camps on the basis of their ancestry, a formal \n     apology and token redress payment to these individuals of \n     Japanese ancestry is the least that can be done to compensate \n     them for the loss of their rights; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twentieth Legislature of the \n     State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1999, That the United \n     States government is urged to restore redress funds to pay \n     all outstanding Japanese American and Japanese Latin American \n     redress claims and to fulfill the educational mandate of the \n     act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, Hawaii's \n     congressional delegation, and the Governor of Hawaii.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-79.

A bill to prevent children from having access to firearms; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                children's firearm access prevention act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nChafee, Senator Kennedy, Senator Schumer, Senator Lautenberg, Senator \nBoxer, and Senator Reed to introduce the Child Firearm Access \nPrevention Act of 1999.\n  Following the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, it is natural to ask \n``why'', but we also need to ask ``how?''\n  How do two teenagers enter their high school armed with a Tec 9, \nsemi-automatic assault rifle, two sawed off 12 gauge shotguns, a 9 \nmillimeter semi-automatic pistol, 30 explosive devices and kill 13 \ninnocent people?\n  There are those who say you can't pass laws to stop this behavior \nbecause those inclined to do it will simply ignore the law. I guess the \nmessage of this logic is if you can't solve the entire problem, you \nshouldn't even try.\n  I think that logic is wrong. We have to act and we have to act now. \nEveryday in America, 13 children die as a result of gun violence.\n  In the last two years our schools have been shattered by gun \nviolence.\n  October 1, 1997, Pearl, Mississippi: A sixteen year old boy killed \nhis mother then went to his high school and shot nine students, two \nfatally.\n  December 1, 1997, West Paducah, Kentucky: Three students were killed \nand five were wounded in a hallway at Heath High School by a 14 year \nold classmate.\n  March 24, 1998, Jonesboro, Arkansas: Four girls and a teacher were \nshot to death and 10 people were wounded during a false fire alarm at a \nmiddle school when two boys 11 and 13 opened fire from the woods.\n  April 24, 1998, Edinboro, Pennsylvania: A science teacher was shot to \ndeath in front of students at an eighth grade dance by a 14 year old \nstudent.\n  May 19, 1998, Fayetteville, Tennessee: Three days before his \ngraduation, an 18 year old honor student allegedly opened fire in a \nparking lot at a high school killing a classmate who was dating his ex-\ngirlfriend.\n  May 21, 1998, Springfield, Oregon: Two teen-agers were killed and \nmore than 20 people were hurt when a 15 year old boy allegedly opened \nfire at a high school. The boy's parents were killed at their home.\n  There is something we can do to protect our children. Seventeen \nstates have already recognized the problem and passed a child firearm \naccess prevention law, which is known as a CAP law. These laws say to \nthose who purchase and own guns, it is not enough for you to follow the \nlaw in purchasing them and to use the guns safely; you have another \nresponsibility. If you are going to own a firearm in your home, you \nhave to keep it safely and securely so that children do not have access \nto it.\n\n[[Page S4579]]\n\n  These laws are effective. Florida was the first State to pass a CAP \nlaw in 1989. The following year, unintentional shooting deaths of \nchildren dropped 50%. Moreover, a study published in the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association (JAMA) in October of 1997 found a 23% \ndecrease in unintentional firearm related deaths among children younger \nthan 15 in those States that had implemented CAP laws. According to the \nJAMA article, if all 50 states had CAP laws during the period of 1990-\n94, 216 children might have lived.\n  Should we consider these state laws as a national model? I think the \nobvious answer is yes. Unfortunately, the Littleton tragedy is no \nlonger unique.\n  Mr. President, what I propose today is Federal legislation that will \napply to every State, not just 17, but every State. And this is what it \nsays. If you want to own a handgun, a rifle or shotgun, and it is legal \nto do so, you can; but if you own it, you have a responsibility to make \ncertain that it is kept securely and safely.\n  What does the bill do? The bill imposes criminal penalties for gun \nowners who know or should know that a juvenile could gain access to the \ngun, and a juvenile does gain access & thereby causes death or injury \nor exhibits the gun in a public place. The gun owner is subject to a \nprison sentence of up to 1 year and/or fined $10,000 (a misdemeanor \npenalty). The bill also provides a felony provision for a reckless \nviolation.\n  The bill has 5 common sense exceptions. (1) The adult uses a trigger \nlock, secure storage box, or other secure storage technique; (2) The \njuvenile used the gun in a lawful act of self-defense; (3) The juvenile \ntakes the gun off the person of a law enforcement official; (4) The \nowner has no reasonable expectation that juveniles will be on the \npremises; and (5) The juvenile got the gun as a result of a burglary.\n  States which have passed CAP laws include: Florida, Connecticut, \nIowa, California, Nevada, New Jersey, Virginia, Wisconsin, Hawaii, \nMaryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, Delaware, Rhode Island, Texas, \nMassachusetts and Illinois. An examination of this list does not reveal \nthe most liberal states in America. The first State to pass this \nlegislation in 1989 was Florida and in 1995, Texas, certainly no \nbleeding heart state by any political definition, passed a CAP law.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in this bipartisan effort to \nprotect children from the dangers of gun violence.

A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2000 and \n2001 for certain maritime programs of the Department of Transportation, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n  maritime administration authorization act for fiscal years 2000 and \n                                  2001\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce \nlegislation on behalf of myself, Senator McCain, chairman of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, Senator Hollings, the ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee and Senator Inouye, Surface Transportation and \nMerchant Marine Subcommittee ranking member. This legislation \nauthorizes appropriations for fiscal year 2000 for the Maritime \nAdministration.\n  The introduction of this bill demonstrates our firm commitment to our \nnation's maritime industry and our willingness to work with the \nMaritime Administration to provide effective leadership on a wide range \nof maritime issues. The bill was developed along with Administration \nofficials and provides a base to build upon in coming weeks.\n  There are several aspects of this measure that will require \ninterested members of the Senate to work together to come to a \nconsensus. Therefore, this bill can be viewed as a starting point for \nreauthorizing the agency and making changes to U.S. maritime policy. I \nlook forward to working with members of the Committee and the \nadministration to find common ground for a final legislation.\n  The bill authorizes appropriations for the Maritime Administration \n[MarAd] for fiscal year 2000 and covers two appropriated accounts: (1) \noperations and training and (2) the shipbuilding loan guarantee program \nauthorized by Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936.\n  MarAd oversees the operations of U.S. Government-supported maritime \npromotion programs, such as the Maritime Security Program, the state \nmaritime academies and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. I am a strong \nsupporter of the state maritime academies, in particular, and want to \nensure that they are adequately funded.\n  Title XI shipbuilding loan guarantee program is important to ensuring \ncritical shipbuilding capacity in the United States. This legislation \nprovides $6 million in loan guarantee funds for Title XI in FY2000. \nHowever, this program has received substantially more in previous \nyears, and I look forward to working with the Administration to \ndetermine the appropriate level of funding.\n  This bill codifies the administrative process associated with Title \nXI. The measure provides the Secretary the authority to hold all bond \nproceeds generated under Title XI during the construction period in \nescrow. Currently, the Secretary must administratively establish a \nseparate construction fund with a private bond agent for a portion of \nthe bond proceeds not captured in escrow. This will eliminate the cost \nassociated with the establishment of the\n\n[[Page S4580]]\n\nseparate construction fund and better protect the government's \ninterest.\n\n  Futher, the measure provides the Secretary authority under Title XI \nto collect and hold cash collateral in the U.S. Treasury, under certain \ncircumstances associated with a guaranteed transaction. This will \nrelieve the obligors and the agency from spending the time and money \nassociated with negotiating depository agreements and legal opinions in \nTitle XI transactions.\n  Additionally, the bill amends Title IX to provide a waiver of the \nthree year period bulk and breakbulk vessels newly registered under the \nU.S. flag must wait in order to carry government-impelled cargo. The \nwaiver would be in effect for one year beginning on the date of \nenactment.\n  Finally, the bill would reauthorize the War Risk Insurance Program \nthrough June 30, 2005, change the requirement for an annual report to \nCongress by the Maritime Administration detailing its's activities to a \nbiennial report, and make clear the ownership status of the vessel \nnamed the Jeremiah O'Brien.\n  I look forward to working on this important legislation and hope my \ncolleagues will join me and the other sponsors in expeditiously moving \nthis authorization through the legislative process.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nHutchison, Chairman of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine \nSubcommittee in the introducing the Maritime Administration \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000.\n  The bill was developed along with administration officials and \nprovides a firm base to build on in coming weeks. While I do not fully \nagree with all aspects of this measure. I look forward to an open \ndebate in formulating final legislation.\n  The bill authorizes appropriations for the Maritime \nAdministration[MarAd] for fiscal year 2000 covering operations and \ntraining along with the loan guarantee program authorized by title XI \nof the Merchant Marine Act, 1936. MarAd's oversight of the operations \nof U.S. Government-suppored maritime promotion programs are as \nimportant toady as ever. With increasing pressure on our nation's \nmilitary resources, MarAd's administration of the Martime Security \nProgram provides an important link in insuring that our troops world \nwide receive essential supplies in a timely and efficient manor.\n  This bill will streamline several administrative processes associated \nwith the Title XI Loan Guarantee Program. The measure provides the \nSecretary of Transportation with additional authority to secure loan \nguaranteed by allowing collateral collected to be held in the U.S. \nTreasury. This will not only save time and money associated with \nnegotiating depository agreements but will provide greater security for \ntax payers funds appropriated for this program.\n  Further, the bill amends Title IX of the Merchant Marine At of 1936 \nto provide a waiver for eliminating the three year period bulk and \nbreakbulk vessels newly registered under the U.S. flag must wait in \norder to carry government-impelled cargo; reauthorize the War Risk \nInsurance Program through June 30, 2005; reduces the requirement for an \nannual report to Congress by the Maritime Administration detailing \nits's activities to be a biennial report; and makes clear the ownership \nstatus of the vessel names the Jeremian O'Brien.\n  I am pleased that the Subcommittee is taking this action today and \nwill join Senator Hutchison and the other sponsors in expeditiously \nmoving this authorization through the legislative proceeds.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (by request):\n  S. 940.

Thus, I reserve the right to support or \noppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter and the \nenclosed analysis of the draft legislation which accompanied it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 940\n\n     SECTION 1.

LIMITATION; SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n       (a) No voluntary separation incentive under this Act may be \n     paid based on the separation of an employee after September \n     30, 2004;\n       (b) This Act supplements and does not supersede other \n     authority of the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Analysis of Draft Bill\n\n       The first section provides a title for the bill, \n     ``Department Of Veterans Affairs Employment Reduction \n     Assistance Act of 1999.''\n       Section 2 provides definitions of ``Department'', \n     employee'', and ``Secretary.'' Among the provisions, an \n     employee who has received any previous voluntary separation \n     incentive from the Federal Government is excluded from any \n     incentives under this Act.\n       Section 3 requires the VA Secretary to submit to the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget a strategic \n     plan outlining the use of voluntary separation incentive \n     payments to Department employees, and a proposed \n     organizational chart for the Department once such incentive \n     payments have been completed. The Secretary must submit the \n     plan before obligating any resources for such incentive \n     payments.\n       The plan must include the proposed coverage for offers of \n     incentives to Department employees, specifying the positions \n     and functions to be reduced or eliminated, identified by \n     organizational unit, geographic location, occupational \n     category and grade level. Coverage may be on the basis of any \n     component of the Department of Veterans Affairs, any \n     occupation, levels of an occupation or type of position, any \n     geographic location, other non-personal factors, or any \n     appropriate combination of these factors. The plan must also \n     specify the manner in which the planned employment reductions \n     will improve efficiency or meet budget or staffing levels. \n     The plan must also include a proposed time period for payment \n     of separation incentives, and a description of how the \n     affected component of the Department will operate without the \n     eliminated functions and positions.\n       The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall \n     approve or disapprove each plan submitted, and may modify the \n     plan with respect to the time period of incentives, with \n     respect to the number and amounts of incentive payments, or \n     the coverage of incentive offers.\n       Section 4 authorizes the Secretary to pay a voluntary \n     separation incentive payment to an employee only to the \n     extent necessary to reduce or eliminate the positions and \n     functions identified by the strategic plan. It also requires \n     that an employee must separate from service with the \n     Department (whether by retirement or resignation) under the \n     Act in order to receive a voluntary separation incentive.\n       The voluntary separation incentive is to be paid in a lump \n     sum after the employee's separation. The incentive payment \n     would be for an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of \n     severance pay that the employee would be entitled to receive \n     under section 5595 of title 5, United States Code, if so \n     entitled, (without adjustment for any previous severance \n     pay), or an amount determined by the Secretary, not to \n     exceed $25,000. The incentive payment is not to be a basis \n     for the computation of any other type of Government \n     benefit, and is not be taken into account in determining \n     the amount of severance pay to which an employee may be \n     entitled based on any other separation. Appropriations for \n     employee basic pay are to be used to pay the incentive \n     payments.\n       Section 5 provides that any employee who receives a \n     voluntary separation incentive under this Act and then \n     accepts any employment with the Government within 5 years \n     after separating must, prior to the first day of such \n     employment, repay the entire amount of the incentive to the \n     agency that paid the incentive. If the subsequent employment \n     is with the Executive branch, including the United States \n     Postal Service, the Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management may waive the repayment at the request of\n\n[[Page S4582]]\n\n     the agency head if the individual possesses unique ability \n     and is the only qualified applicant available for the \n     position. For subsequent employment in the legislative \n     branch, the head of the entity or the appointing official may \n     waive repayment on the same criteria. If the subsequent \n     employment is in the judicial branch, the Director of the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts may waive \n     repayment on the same criteria. For the purpose of the \n     repayment provisions, but not the waiver provisions, \n     employment includes employment under a personal service \n     contract. For the purpose of the repayment and waiver \n     provisions, employment does not include without compensation \n     employment.\n       Section 6 requires additional agency contributions to the \n     Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund in amounts equal \n     to 15 percent of the final basic pay of each employee of the \n     Department who is covered by the Civil Service Retirement \n     System, or the Federal Employees' Retirement System, to whom \n     a voluntary separation incentive is paid under this Act. It \n     also defines ``final basic pay''.\n       Section 7 requires the reduction of full-time equivalent \n     employment (FTEE) in the Department of Veterans Affairs by \n     one FTEE for each separation of an employee who receives a \n     voluntary separation incentive under this Act. Also it \n     directs the Office of Management and Budget to take any \n     action necessary to ensure compliance. Reductions will be \n     calculated on a FTEE basis. For example, if the Department's \n     FTEE usage in FY 1998 was 1050 FTEEs, and 50 FTEE separate \n     during FY 1999 using voluntary separation incentive payments \n     provided under this Act, then the Department's staffing \n     levels at the end of FY 1999 shall not exceed 1000 FTEEs. The \n     President may waive the reduction in FTEE in the event of war \n     or emergency.\n       Section 8 amends section 8905a(d)(4) of title 5 to provide \n     that VA employees who are involuntarily separated in a \n     reduction in force or staffing adjustment, can continue \n     health benefits coverage for 18 months and be required to pay \n     only the employee's share of the premium. Section 8 also \n     extends the section 8905a sunset provisions for VA employees \n     for FY 1999 through FY2004.\n       Section 9 provides that the Director of OPM may prescribe \n     any regulations necessary to administer the provisions of the \n     Act.\n       Section 10 provides that no voluntary separation incentive \n     under the Act may be paid based on the separation of an \n     employee after September 30, 2004, and that the Act \n     supplements and does not supersede other authority of the \n     Secretary.\n       Section 11 provides that the Act is effective on the date \n     of enactment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Department of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA), I am submitting a draft bill ``To provide a \n     temporary authority for the use of voluntary separation \n     incentives by the Department of Veterans Affairs to reduce \n     employment levels, restructure staff, and for other \n     purposes.'' The Department requests that it be referred to \n     the appropriate committee for prompt consideration and \n     enactment.\n       In the next several years, VA will undergo significant \n     changes. VA believes that separation incentives can be an \n     appropriate tool for those VA components that are redesigning \n     their employment mix, when the use of incentives is properly \n     related to the specific changes that are needed. Separation \n     incentives can also be an invaluable tool for components that \n     are restructuring and reengineering, such as the Veterans \n     Health Administration (VHA) and the Veterans Benefits \n     Administration (VBA), as they move towards primary care and \n     new methods of delivering services to veterans. Other VA \n     components also are engaged in reengineering and \n     restructuring, and would benefit from this authority. Under \n     the draft bill, the use of the incentives would be related to \n     the specific changes that are needed for reshaping VA for the \n     future. Further, the draft bill would appropriately limit the \n     time period for the incentive offers over the next five \n     fiscal years, when VA will accomplish these changes.\n       This initiative is based on VA's previous experience with \n     voluntary separation incentives under the Federal Workforce \n     Restructuring Act of 1994, and the Treasury, Postal Service, \n     and General Government Appropriations Act of 1997. We believe \n     that VA used these previous authorities conservatively, \n     responsibly, and effectively. As an example, VHA required \n     that elements allowing a buyout must abolish the position of \n     the employee receiving the buyout. VA has implemented a total \n     of 9,392 buyouts under both statutes, which is significantly \n     fewer than the total number authorized. VA's previous use of \n     buyouts significantly assisted VA in restructuring its \n     workforce, and enabled it to achieve downsizing and \n     streamlining goals while minimizing adverse impact on \n     employees, through such actions as involuntary separations.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Office of Financial Management would like to offer \n     approximately 60 buyouts over the next five fiscal years to \n     support its plans to reduce and adjust the staffing mix in \n     its Franchise Fund and Supply Fund activities. Over this \n     period, these activities will undergo changes in program and \n     product lines, as well as new technologies. These changes \n     will require fewer employees and employees with different \n     skill sets the current employees. The Office of Financial \n     Management will target any incentive payments to specific \n     organizations, locations, occupations and grade levels.\n       Under the proposed bill, before obligating any resources \n     for any incentive payments, the VA Secretary must submit to \n     the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a \n     strategic plan outlining the use of such incentive payments. \n     The plan must specify the positions and functions to be \n     reduced or eliminated, identified by organizational unit, \n     geographic location, occupational category and grade level. \n     Coverage may be on the basis of any component of VA, any \n     occupation, levels of an occupation or type of position, any \n     geographic location, other non-personal factors, or any \n     appropriate combination of these factors. The plan must also \n     specify the manner in which the planned employment reductions \n     would improve efficiency or meet budget or staffing levels. \n     The plan must also include a proposed time period for payment \n     of separation incentives, and a description of how the \n     affected VA component would operate without the eliminated \n     functions and positions. The Director of the OMB would \n     approve or disapprove each plan submitted, and would have \n     authority to modify the time period for payment of \n     incentives, the number and amounts of incentive payments, or \n     coverage of incentive offers. We believe that these \n     provisions for plan approval would ensure that separation \n     incentives are appropriately targeted within VA in view of \n     the specific cuts that are needed, and are offered on a \n     timely basis. Although VA would reduce full-time equivalent \n     employment by one for each employee receiving an incentive \n     payment who separates, we believe that service to veterans \n     would improve as a result of the reengineering that is \n     happening simultaneously within the system.\n       The authority for separation incentives would be in effect \n     for the period starting with the enactment of this Act and \n     ending September 30, 2004. The amount of an employee's \n     incentive would be the lesser of the amount that the \n     employee's severance pay would be, or an amount determined by \n     the Secretary, not to exceed $25,000.\n       Any employee who receives an incentive and then accepts any \n     employment with the Government within 5 years after \n     separating must, prior to the first day of employment, repay \n     the entire amount of the incentive. The repayment requirement \n     could be waived only under very stringent circumstances of \n     agency need.\n       This proposal would provide a very useful tool to assist in \n     reorganizing VA and reengineering services quickly, \n     effectively, and humanely, to provide higher quality service \n     to more veterans. We also believe that it is a tool that \n     would allow significant cost savings. The buyout would be \n     funded within the base in the President's FY 1999 Budget. If \n     VA receives authority before June 30, 1999, it could \n     implement buyouts in VBA with modest costs of $4.7 million in \n     FY 1999 and estimated savings of $13.3 million annually in \n     subsequent years. It also could implement buyouts in the \n     Office of Financial Management with savings of $320,000 in FY \n     1999 and estimated savings of approximately $1 million \n     annually in subsequent years. VHA would implement buyouts at \n     the beginning of FY 2000, with expected discretionary savings \n     of $103 million in FY 2000 and estimated savings of $220.1 \n     million annually in subsequent years. VBA's savings for \n     buyouts authorized for FY 2000 would be $2.7 million, with \n     estimated savings of $15.5 million annually in subsequent \n     years. The Office of Financial Management savings for FY 2000 \n     would be $992,000, with estimated savings of approximately $1 \n     million annually in subsequent years. In addition, each \n     subsequent year's buyouts during the five-year period would \n     yield additional discretionary savings.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this draft bill from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                       Sheila Clarke McCready,\n\n                                        Principal Deputy Assistant\n                              Secretary for Congressional Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 944. A bill to amend Public Law 105-188 to provide for the mineral \nleasing of certain Indian lands in Oklahoma; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n          mineral leasing of certain indian lands in oklahoma\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, for too long, economic development in \nIndian country has been hindered by antiquated rules and regulations, \nmany dating back to before the turn of the century. Many American \nIndians continue to struggle, denied by bureaucracy the opportunity to \ntake steps to improve their position. I am proposing legislation today \nthat would reverse one of these situations.\n  Under current law, Indian lands owned by more than one person require \nthe consent of 100 percent of the owners before mineral development can \ngo\n\n[[Page S4583]]\n\nforward. Oftentimes, this fractionated property is owned by over one \nhundred people; it is difficult, if not impossible, to locate all the \nowners. Once found, developers must obtain their unanimous consent. As \nyou can imagine, this creates a significant and often insurmountable \nobstacle for leasing or other development. Last year, Congress lowered \nthis requirement for the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold \nIndian Reservation to a majority, which more closely resembles \nregulations for non-Indian land. By loosening the consent requirements, \nthese tribes have found the right balance between economic progress and \nprotection of landowners' rights.\n  I am proposing to extend last year's legislation to seven Oklahoma \ntribes: the Comanche, Kiowa, Apache, Fort Sill Apache, Delaware, and \nthe Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. Oil and gas are the cornerstone of \nOklahoma's economy, but these tribes have by and large been left out of \nthis industry because of the stringent consent statutes. Increased \naccess to their own land would greatly facilitate mineral development, \nbringing increased economic opportunity. These tribes and their members \nwill now be able to undertake oil and gas exploration which was \npreviously not possible. This will represent a significant advance \ntoward greater economic empowerment, breaking out of the constraints \nnow imposed on these tribes.\n  Common sense dictates that the first step of self-sufficiency is \nbeing allowed to use the resources you already own. This proposal will \nbe equitable and beneficial to all parties involved. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on this and other such legislation that \nwould help American Indians achieve greater economic independence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Feingold, \n        and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 945. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 consumer bankruptcy reform act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, joined by colleagues, Senator \nLeahy, Senator Kennedy, Senator Feingold and Senator Sarbanes, I am \nintroducing the bankruptcy reform bill that passed the Senate last year \nby a vote of 97-1.\n\n  A constant theme that has guided me throughout the consideration of \nbankruptcy legislation is balanced reform. You cannot have meaningful \nbankruptcy reform without addressing both sides of the problem--\nirresponsible debtors and irresponsible creditors.\n  Unfortunately, the bill we worked so hard to develop, was decimated \nin conference and the result was a one-sided bill designed to reward \nthe credit industry and penalize American consumers. I could not \nsupport it. I hope this year will be different.\n  The bankruptcy code is delicate balance. When you push one thing, \nalmost invariably something else will give. For that reason, it is \ncrucial for bankruptcy reform to be thoughtful and for the changes to \nbe targeted and not create more problems than they attempt to solve.\n  This year, Senator Grassley has introduced S.625, the bankruptcy \nreform bill of 1999. This bill has more similarities to last year's \nconference report than the bipartisan measure that passed the Senate \nlast year by an overwhelming margin.\n  The Durbin-Leahy bill is fairer. S.625 uses a means test adopted from \nIRS collection allowances. The test would require every debtor, \nregardless of income, who files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy to be \nscrutinized by the U.S. trustee to determine whether the filling is \nabusive. The bill creates a presumption that a case is abusive if a \ndebtor can pay the lesser of 25% of unsecured nonpriority claims or \n$15,000 over 5 years. The IRS means test was designed for use on a case \nby case basis, not as an automatic template.\n  In my home state, the average annual income for bankruptcy filers in \nthe Central District of Illinois for 1998 was $20,448, yet the average \namount of unsecured debt was $22,900. This figure shows that many \nfilers were hopelessly insolvent. They owed more money on debt that had \nno collateral than their total income for the entire year. These \ndebtors don't even come close to meeting the standards that would \nrequire them to convert their case to a chapter 13 case, but they will \nbe forced to go through additional scrutiny at extra costs to everyone \ninvolved.\n\n  In contrast, the Durbin-Leahy bill gives courts discretion to dismiss \nor convert a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case if the debtor can fund a Chapter \n13 repayment plan. One of the factors for the court to consider in \nmaking the decision is whether the debtor is capable of paying 30% of \nunsecured claims under a 3 year plan. This reform can address abuses \nwithout the complexity of certifying ability to pay in every case as \nrequired by S.625.\n  The Durbin-Leahy bill is cheaper because every case does not go \nthrough means testing. By requiring the trustee to submit reports on \nall filers the cost to trustees is dramatically increased with little \nreward.\n  The means test in S. 625 looks a lot like the means test in the House \nbill. We now know that the means test in the House bill would only \napply to far less than 10% of Chapter 7 filings. A study released by \nthe American Bankruptcy Institute found that by using the test from the \nHouse bill, 97% of sample Chapter 7 debtors had too little income to \nrepay even 20% of their unsecured debts over five years. As a result, \nonly 3% of the sample Chapter 7 filers had sufficient repayment \ncapacity to be barred from Chapter 7 under the rigid means test. This \nmeans 100% of the filers would have to go through a process that would \nonly apply to 3% of the cases.\n  Beyond the administrative costs, there is the unneeded stress on poor \nfamilies. According to the National Conference on Bankruptcy Judges, a \nreview of surveys of Chapter 7 cases from 46 judicial districts in 33 \nstates reveals that the median gross annual income for the 3151 cases \nin 1998 was $21,540, some $15,000 lower than the 1997 national median \nincome for all families in the United States. Yet, the median amount of \nunsecured nonpriority debt for these same debtors was $23,411. These \npeople are insolvent, and forcing them to go through unnecessary hoops \nfor little reward is unfair and ineffective.\n  The Durbin-Leahy bill is more balanced. The Durbin-Leahy bill \nincludes credit disclosures designed to help families understand their \ndebt and prevent them from incurring debt which makes them financially \nvulnerable. Many families file for bankruptcy after a health crisis or \nsome other catastrophic event that prevents them from paying their \ndebts. For example, the survey conducted by the bankruptcy judges shows \nthat on average over 25% of bankruptcy cases involve debtors with \nmedical debts over $1000. By requiring more complete information for \ndebtors, they can make better credit decisions and avoid bankruptcy \naltogether.\n  The Durbin-Leahy bill addresses abusive creditor practices. The \nDurbin-Leahy bill protects the elderly from predatory lending \npractices. Much of our discussion concerning reform of the nation's \nbankruptcy laws has focused upon perceived abuses of the bankruptcy \nsystem by consumer debtors. Far less discussion has occurred with \nregard to abuses by creditors that help usher the nation's consumers \ninto bankruptcy. I believe that abuses exist on both sides of the \ndebtor-creditor relationship and that bankruptcy reform is incomplete \nif it fails to address documented abuses among creditors.\n  Last year, I worked to protect elderly Americans by prohibiting a \nhigh-cost mortgage lender who extended credit in violation of the \nprovisions of the Truth-In-Lending Act from collecting its claim in \nbankruptcy. If the lender has failed to comply with the requirements of \nthe Truth-in-Lending Act for high-cost second mortgages, the lender \nwill have absolutely no claim against the bankruptcy estate. This \nprovision is not aimed at all lenders or at all second mortgages. \nIndeed, it is aimed only at the worst, most predatory, of these by and \nlarge worthy lenders. It is aimed only at practices that are already \nillegal and it does not deal with technical or immaterial violations of \nthe Truth in Lending Act.\n  Disallowing the claims of predatory lenders in bankruptcy cases will \nnot end these predatory practices altogether. Yet it is one step we can \ntake to curb creditor abuse in a situation where the lender bears \nprimary responsibility for the deterioration of a consumer's financial \nsituation.\n\n[[Page S4584]]\n\n  I encourage my Senate colleagues to join Senator Leahy and me in this \neffort. Bankruptcy reform must be balanced and must not create a nation \nof financial outlaws.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 945\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to transfer \nadministrative jurisdiction over land within the boundaries of the Home \nof Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site to the Archivist of the \nUnited States for the construction of a visitor center; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  fdr national historic site and presidential library visitor center \n                        construction legislation\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague and fellow New \nYorker, Senator Schumer, to introduce this bill to transfer \nadministrative jurisdiction of less than an acre of land at the Home of \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt National Historic Site from the National Park \nService to the National Archives and Records Administration. This \nlegislation would remove the last remaining obstacle to the \nconstruction of the National Archives' planned FDR Presidential Library \nVisitor Center and requires no Federal funds.\n  For the past several years, the National Archives has worked closely \nwith the National Park Service, the New York State Historic \nPreservation Office, the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, and \nthe General Services Administration, to determine the appropriate site \nfor a visitor center. In order to serve the greatest number of \nvisitors, the optimum location was found to be property currently \ncontrolled by the National Park Service. Since the National Archives \nwill administer the visitor center, administrative jurisdiction of the \nproperty must be transferred from the National Park Service, which the \nNational Park Service supports.\n  To date, $8,200,000 in Federal funds have been appropriated for this \nproject and the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute has \ncontributed an additional $3,400,000. Design work is scheduled to be \ncompleted in September of 1999, and construction could begin after \njurisdiction is transferred.\n  Last year, the House passed H.R. 4829 to accomplish this same goal. \nUnfortunately, time expired on the 106th Congress before we could take \nit up in the Senate. This year, Congressman John E. Sweeney has \nreintroduced the bill, now H.R. 1104, which has a strong chance of \npassing. We would be most fortunate, indeed, if the Senate would agree \nto our noncontroversial bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 946\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Roosevelt National Historic Site \n     and for the joint use of the visitor center facility by the \n     Secretary and the Archivist.\n       (2) Discontinuance of use by the archivist.--If the \n     Archivist determines to discontinue use of land transferred \n     under subsection (a), the Archivist shall retransfer \n     administrative jurisdiction over the land to the Secretary.\n       (d) Land Description.--The land referred to in subsection \n     (a) shall consist of not more\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\n     than 1 acre of land, as agreed to by the Secretary and the \n     Archivist and more particularly described in the agreement \n     under subsection (c)(1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n\n  S. 947. A bill to amend federal law regarding the tolling of the \nInterstate Highway System; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n                  interstate tolls relief act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to bring to your attention an \nissue of great national concern. We all remember the great debate that \nthis chamber had last year during reauthorization of the federal \nhighway bill, TEA-21. We all negotiated to get more funds for our \nstates because we know that more investment in our highways means \nbetter, safer, and more efficient transportation for those who rely on \nroads for making deliveries, going to work or school, or just doing the \ngrocery shopping. Transportation is the lynchpin for economic \ndevelopment, and those states that have good, efficient transportation \nsystems attract business development, ultimately raising standards of \nliving. However, I think that we may have gone too far in authorizing \nstates additional means to raise revenue for highway improvements. \nThese means to raise revenue are not productive and hurt our system of \ntransportation.\n\n  Specifically, I am concerned that states have too much flexibility to \nestablish tolls on our Interstate highway system. For many states, the \nlarge increases in TEA-21 funding have satisfied the need to invest in \ninfrastructure. Other states have found that they need to raise more \nmoney, and so they have raised their state fuel taxes or taken other \nactions to raise the needed revenue. These increases may be difficult \nto implement politically, because frankly most people don't support any \ntax increase. However, I believe that highway tolls are a non-\nproductive and overly intrusive means of raising revenue causing more \nharm to commerce than can be justified.\n  Congress, mistakenly in my opinion, increased the authority of states \nto put tolls on their Interstate highways in TEA-21. I am introducing \nthe Interstate Tolls Relief Act of 1999 to restrict Interstate toll \nauthority. The debate over highway tolls goes back to the genesis of \nour Republic, and contributed to our movement away from the Articles of \nConfederation to a more uniform system of governance under the U.S. \nConstitution. Toll roads were the bane of commerce, in the early years \nof the Republic, as each state would attempt to toll the interstate \ntraveling public to finance state public improvements. Ultimately, \nfrustration with delay and uneven costs helped contribute to the \nadoption of Commerce Clause powers to help facilitate interstate and \nforeign trade. Those same concerns hold true today, and I think that we \nin Congress must take a national perspective and promote interstate \ncommerce.\n  I think that if one were to ask the citizens of the United States \nabout tolls, they would ultimately conclude that Interstate tolls would \nreduce the efficiency of our Interstate highways, increase shipping \ncosts, and make interstate travel more expensive and less convenient. \nNot to mention the safety problems associated with erecting toll booths \nand operating them to collect revenues.\n  Now, I recognize that tolls under certain circumstances may be a good \nidea, and my bill does not prevent states from tolling non-Interstate \nhighways. My bill also does not affect tolls on highways where they are \nalready in use, and states will continue to be able to rely on existing \ntolls for revenues. Furthermore, my bill recognizes that when funds \nmust be found for a major Interstate bridge or tunnel project, states \nmay have no other option but to use tolls to finance the project. They \nmay continue to do so under my bill. I believe this is consistent with \nthe original intent of authority granted for Interstate tolls. What my \nbill does is to prevent the proliferation of Interstate tolls, and \nrestrict tolling authority for major bridges and tunnels.\n  Mr. President, this bill is essential if we are to continue to have \nan Interstate Highway System that is safe and facilitates the efficient \nmovement of Interstate commerce and personal travel. I urge the support \nof my colleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 947\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a \nresolution recognizing Jim Thorpe as the Athlete of the Century.\n  Born to an impoverished family on Sac-and-Fox Indian land, Jim Thorpe \novercame adverse circumstances to excel as an amateur and as a \nprofessional in three sports; track and field, football and baseball. \nThorpe, who was voted ``Athlete of the First Half of the Century'' by \nthe Associated Press almost fifty years ago, is the only American \nathlete ever to excel at this level in three major sports.\n  As a student at Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, Thorpe \nprooved his athletic ability early on. One anecdote recalls how the 5-\nfoot-9\\1/2\\ inch, 144-pound Thorpe almost single-handedly overcame the \nentire Lafayette track team at a meeting in Easton, Pennsylvania, \nwinning six events. Also while attending the Carlisle Indian School, \nJim Thorpe established his amateur football record playing halfback, \ndefender, punter, and place-kicker. In 1911, he was named an All \nAmerican.\n  In 1912, he represented the United States and the Sac-and-Fox Nation \nin the Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden. To this day, Thorpe is the \nonly athlete to win gold medals in the pentathlon and decathlon. After \nhis Olympic feats in Sweden, Thorpe retured to Carlisle's football team \nand was named an All-American again.\n  In 1913, Thorpe left amateur athletics and signed a $5,000 contract \nto play baseball with the New York Giants. As an outfielder with the \nGiants, and later with the Cincinnati Reds and Boston Braves, his best \nseason was his last one, when he batted .327 in 60 games for Boston.\n  In 1915, Thorpe agreed to play professional football for the Canton \nBulldogs. Thorpe went on to become a key part of this team as it was \nrecognized as the ``world champion'' in 1916, 1917, and 1919. Thorpe's \nprofessional football career later included stints with Cleveland, Rock \nIsland, the New York Giants, and the Chicago Cardinals. In 1920, Thorpe \nbecame the first president of the American Football Association, which \nwas later to become the National Football League. Today, he is \nrecognized as a founding father of professional football.\n  Recently, I had the privilege of attending a luncheon honoring Jim \nThorpe's daughter, Grace, at the Jim Thorpe Memorial Hall in the Carbon \nCounty, Pennsylvania, a town named for the great athlete. Grace Thorpe \nhas traveled around the country asking people to sign petitions \ndeclaring her father athlete of the century. She plans to send the \npetition to cable sports networks and national sportswriters. As Jim \nThorpe Area Sports Hall of Fame president, Jack Kmetz has noted, Thorpe \nunfortunately missed out on the modern-day media blitz that surrounds \npopular athletes today. Nonetheless, I promised Ms. Thorpe and the \npeople of Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania that I would introduce this \nresolution which I hope will raise awareness of this true legend's \nachievements and give him the recongnition he deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/03/senate-section/article/S4607-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 92--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT FUNDING \n     FOR PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH SHOULD BE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Reid, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Mack, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Helms) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pension:\n\n                               S. Res. 92\n\n       Whereas in 1999, prostate cancer is expected to kill more \n     than 37,000 men in the United States and be diagnosed in over \n     180,000 new cases;\n       Whereas prostate cancer is the most diagnosed nonskin \n     cancer in the United States;\n       Whereas African Americans have the highest incidence of \n     prostate cancer in the world;\n       Whereas considering the devastating impact of the disease \n     among men and their families, prostate cancer research \n     remains underfunded;\n       Whereas more resources devoted to clinical and \n     translational research at the National Institutes of Health \n     will be highly determinative of whether rapid advances can be \n     attained in treatment and ultimately a cure for prostate \n     cancer;\n       Whereas the Congressionally Directed Department of Defense \n     Prostate Cancer Research Program is making important strides \n     in innovative prostate cancer research, and this Program \n     presented to Congress in April of 1998 a full investment \n     strategy for prostate cancer research at the Department of \n     Defense; and\n       Whereas the Senate expressed itself unanimously in 1998 \n     that the Federal commitment to biomedical research should be \n     doubled over the next 5 years: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This resolution may be cited as the ``Prostate Cancer \n     Research Commitment Resolution of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) finding treatment breakthroughs and a cure for prostate \n     cancer should be made a national health priority;\n       (2) significant increases in prostate cancer research \n     funding, commensurate with the impact of the disease, should \n     be made available at the National Institutes of Health and to \n     the Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program; \n     and\n       (3) these agencies should prioritize prostate cancer \n     research that is directed toward innovative clinical and \n     translational research projects in order that treatment \n     breakthroughs can be more rapidly offered to patients.\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I submit today the Prostate Cancer \nResearch Commitment Resolution Act of 1999 along with several of my \ncolleagues, Senators Lautenberg, Reid, Jeffords, Schumer, Ashcroft, \nMack, Coverdell, and Helms.\n  Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed nonskin cancer in the United \nStates. More than 40 percent of all male cancers and 14 percent of all \nmale cancer-related deaths are due to complications from prostate \ncancer. In 1998, over 40,000 American men died from prostate cancer, \nand in 1999, it is expected that this deadly disease will strike \nanother 37,000 men in the United States.\n  I, along with my colleagues, am deeply committed to aiding our \nmedical community in their research efforts to find preventive measures \nto stem--and eventually eradicate--this disease.\n  Our resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that funding for \nprostate cancer research should be increased substantially, \ncommensurate with the impact of the disease. Funds should be made \navailable at the National Institutes of Health and at the Department of \nDefense Prostate Cancer Research Program. We are also encouraging these \nagencies to prioritize prostate cancer research that is directed toward \ninnovative research projects in order that treatment breakthroughs can \nbe more rapidly offered to patients.\n  Mr. President, this is an important step on behalf of men in the \nUnited States who have suffered from prostate cancer. Increasing funds \nfor research would assist the medical community in its efforts to \nidentify preventive measures men can take through prostate cancer \nscreening procedures.\n  I am pleased to offer this resolution today and I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/03/senate-section/article/S4607-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4607-S4608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n DEPLOYMENT OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES TO THE KOSOVO REGION IN \n                               YUGOSLAVIA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        DURBIN AMENDMENT NO. 300\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DURBIN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe preamble to the joint resolution (S.J.

Mr. President, I rise to honor the opening of \nthe Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage, Alaska.\n  The Heritage Center, the first of its kind in Alaska, is a twenty-six \nacre campus that offers a unique opportunity to learn and explore the \ntraditional ways of Alaska Native cultures. The Center will be a \n``gathering place'' where local residents and visitors to Alaska can \nmeet Native Tradition Bearers, artists and performers. While visiting, \nthey can learn about the Native traditional lifestyle by participating \nin workshops and guided tours of the five traditional village settings \nthat have been built around a lake on the campus.\n  In 1994, I was privileged to add the Stevens/Murkowski Alaska Native \nCulture and Arts Development Act as an amendment to the School-to-Work \nOpportunities Act. This amendment paved the way for authorizing federal \nfunding for the Alaska Native Heritage Center. Congressman Don Young \nwas instrumental in winning House approval for the measure. Over the \npast six years, Senator Stevens has been successful in securing \nmatching federal funds for the Center--I am proud to say the Center \nisn't just a federal project, but a statewide project funded by \nindividuals, private companies, Native Corporations and friends from \noutside the State who were united in a common dream.\n  Finally, I would like to commend the vision and relentless dedication \nof the Chairman of the Alaska Native Heritage Center, Mr. Roy Huhndorf. \nThe Heritage Center is a tribute to his leadership and determination to \nensure a vibrant and continuing celebration of Alaska Native traditions \nand cultures for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/03/senate-section/article/S4609-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

Clements for her years of work on behalf of historical \npreservation in Florida.\n  As we prepare for a new millennium, with its promise of inventions \nand technical advances beyond our comprehension, we are reminded of the \nimportance of preserving and understanding our past.\n  Toward that end, Dr. Clements has helped lead the historical \npreservation effort in Florida, particularly in preserving and \nintrepreting women's history.\n  Women helped build and lead Florida, and their roles have been \npreserved in myriad ways by Dr. Clements and her colleagues.\n  She has been a pioneer in producing audio biographies of prominent \nFlorida women. Dr. Clements is the founder of the Inaugural Gown \nCollection, housed at the Museum of Florida History, including textiles \ndating to 1901, nearly a century ago.\n  Meanwhile, she has collected more than 100 artifacts for the First \nFamilies exhibit at the Museum of Florida History. Strong public \ninterest prompted the museum to extend the exhibit by three months.\n  Florida has many ways of recognizing the contributions of outstanding \nwomen, one of which is through the Florida Women's Hall of Fame. Dr. \nClements is the audiobiographer of women inducted into this elite \ngroup, and is a member of the Florida Women's Hall of Fame selection \ncommittee.\n  Mr. President, we live in a fast-paced world, and can expect mobility \nand the pace of the flow of information to increase in the next \ncentury. As we embrace the future, we salute those who preserve the \npast and help us to understand our heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/03/senate-section/article/S4609-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4609-S4610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL CHARTER SCHOOLS DAY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise this morning to recognize \nthe contribution of charter schools to the education of our nation's \nchildren. Today, on Charter Schools Day, we celebrate the hard labor \nand accomplishments of charter school teachers, parents, and students.\n  In 1993, Michigan became the ninth state to grant citizens the \nfreedom to establish charter schools. Many public school educators had \nfound that the complex labyrinth of federal and state regulations \nprevented them from providing their students the best education \npossible. The Michigan State Legislature passed charter school \nlegislation to provide regulatory relief for educators, ensure school \naccountability, and encourage educators to innovate. The following \nyear, Congress established the public Charter Schools program which \nauthorized $15 million for the Department of Education to support the \ndevelopment, initial implementation, and evaluation of charter schools. \nDuring the 105th Congress, I voted for the Charter School Expansion Act \nof 1998 which increased federal charter school funding to $100 million.\n  Mr. President, charter schools are integral to our nation's education \nsystem because they empower citizens to develop schools which meet the \nneeds of their local communities. One fine example of charter school \ninnovation may be found in Michigan's Saginaw County. Four year ago, \nthe Saginaw County Intermediate School District opened their \nTransitional Academy. This school was designed to educate juvenile \noffenders and provide them with an individualized education that would \nallow them to return to their regular schools and graduate with their \nclassmates. Today, I am pleased to report that the Saginaw County \nTransitional Academy has not only graduated a majority of their \nstudents, but that these students have remained crime free.\n  Charter schools are also successful because they empower parents to \nsend their children to the public school of their choice. Last year, \nMichigan parents sent 30,000 children to charter schools, an increase \nfrom 21,000 in 1997. Throughout the nation, charter school \norganizations report that most, if not all, schools have large waiting \nlists.\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\nThese lists symbolize the healthy competition that charter schools have \ncreated within the public school system.\n  However, a charter school's primary mission is to educate its \nstudents. Standardized testing has revealed that a charter school \neducation has a dramatic impact on its students. All public schools in \nMichigan, including charter schools, administer the Michigan Education \nAssessment Program test. Between 1997 and 1998, Michigan charter \nschools exam results kept pace or surpassed those of traditional public \nschools. In fact, half of all charter schools in 1998 doubled or \ntripled the number of students receiving satisfactory scores in one or \nmore subjects. These results indicate that charter schools are truly \nimproving education.\n  In closing, I wish to honor charter school students, who work day \nafter day to develop their skills and gifts. These students are the \nfuture of our nation and contribute to the vibrant life found \nthroughout the countryside and cities of America. I applaud them for \ntheir efforts and congratulate them on this important day, Charter \nSchools Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/03/senate-section/article/S4610-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 4, 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.
