Mr. President, the reason I want to talk today is I think \nit is important for the minority to have its voice heard around here. \nThe first of May is approaching, and we are again being called on to \nvote on the so-called marriage penalty bill. The majority will argue \nthat if you support the marriage penalty, you must vote for cloture. \nThat certainly is transparently false. Here is why.\n  This procedural vote has nothing to do with limiting the marriage \npenalty, which the Democrats support certainly just as strongly as the \nRepublicans. In fact, the vote is another attempt by Republicans to \nshield their deeply flawed tax bill from scrutiny by the Senate and by \nthe public. In effect, we are being gagged.\n  Republicans don't want to debate this bill because they don't want \nanyone to know what is really in it. In truth, it is marriage penalty \nrelief in\n\n[[Page S2950]]\n\nname only. Sixty percent of the measure on which we are going to vote \ntoday is for matters that have nothing to do with the marriage penalty. \nSixty percent of the $248 billion proposal goes to people who do not \nface a marriage penalty.\n  The majority likes to talk about relevance. I know a little bit about \nrelevance, as I think most people do. Sixty percent of this bill is \nirrelevant to the marriage penalty.\n  The majority is seeking to cut off debate on this bill before it is \neven begun. Invoking cloture would also block Democratic amendments \nthat propose better ways to eliminate the marriage penalty and to \naddress other urgent priorities such as prescription drug benefits for \nseniors.\n  Democratic amendments say, yes, let's fix the marriage penalty for \npeople who actually pay it. In fact, one of the amendments proposed by \nSenators Moynihan and Baucus, the lead Democrats in the Finance \nCommittee, says: There are 65 marriage penalty provisions in the Tax \nCode with one sentence; let's eliminate all of them. That is one of the \nthings we are being prevented from bringing forward.\n  We want to move forward and start legislating the way this Senate has \ndebated for over 200 years. We have agreed to say, OK, we are not going \nto go along with what the Senate has done for 200 years. We will play \nthe game of the majority in an effort to allow our voices to be heard \njust a little bit.\n  Even though the Standing Rules of the Senate don't require it, we \nhave bent over backwards to keep our list of amendments short. We have \n10 amendments, and we have agreed to limit debate on those amendments \nto 1 hour each.\n  These are amendments by Senators Moynihan and Baucus on the tax \nproposal. Senator Bayh, one of the most thoughtful Senators we have \never had in the Senate, has talked about another alternative.\n  We have amendments offered by Senator Schumer from New York dealing \nwith the college tuition tax credit. We have one amendment by Senator \nDorgan who represents the farm community. He wants to do something \nabout CRP in the tax bill. These are amendments that should take \nseveral hours if they were debated properly. We are willing to take a \nhalf an hour and have the majority have a half an hour. That seems \nfair, but we have been prevented from doing that.\n\n  We could finish this bill in 1 day. The question is, Why will \nRepublicans not stop casting blame and get on with the marriage tax \npenalty vote? Sadly, the answer is somewhere blowing in the wind. \nRepublicans know Democrats have better proposals. Republicans also know \nthat given a choice, the American people prefer the minority's \napproach. The American people say give us marriage tax penalty relief \nand a few other things such as prescription drug benefits for senior \ncitizens, who simply are desperate for some relief. The average senior \ncitizen gets 18 drug prescriptions filled a year with no benefit at all \nfrom Medicare, and we need to get that benefit to them. That is what we \nare trying to do.\n  The majority, once again, is afraid, despite having the majority. \nThey have a 10-Member majority in the Senate and they are afraid to \ncast votes on our amendments. That goes to other issues, too, not only \nmarriage tax penalty. The majority never tire of using procedural \nmaneuvers to block or delay on the issues the American people care \nabout most.\n  The majority today is out of step with the American people on issue \nafter issue, so this majority spends most of its energy plotting ways \nto disguise its own extreme agenda, scurrying to avoid responsibility \nfor its continuing failure to take up the problems the voters sent us \nto address. That is why the majority constantly resorts to procedural \ndevices such as cloture, or another favorite, the conference committee \n``deep freeze,'' like they have done on the conference report on \nbankruptcy. We have been prevented from going forward with the Export \nAdministration Act, which the high-tech community is very desirous of \nmoving forward. Why? Because certain members of the majority think we \nare still in the cold war and we cannot go forward with bringing high-\ntech industry into the modern world. That also takes into consideration \nour inability to go forward on the Juvenile Justice Act, which deals \nwith gun safety for children, Patients' Bill of Rights, and a number of \nother things.\n  The majority leader said on February 3:\n\n       We're out of town 2 months and our approval rating went up \n     11 points. I think I've got this thing figured out.\n\n  He is right. Whenever the majority, the Republicans who control \nCongress, are out of the public eye they seem to be better off. It is \nwhen the public sees how out of step they are that they get into \ntrouble. That is what is going on. No one should be deceived. We are \nready to go to work right now. We are simply waiting for the majority \nto stop their foot-dragging and blame games, stop hiding their faulty \nlegislation behind procedural votes and get serious.\n  When the majority works up the courage to have a real debate on these \nissues, to stand up and be counted on their ideas versus our ideas, we \nhope they will let us know. Until then, Republicans can file cloture as \noften as they like. It is a cynical and not very clever blame game. The \nDemocrats are sick and tired of playing it, but we will continue to \nfight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S2950-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, next week we begin the debate on the \nEducation Opportunities Act. I had the opportunity yesterday to come to \nthe Senate floor and talk about one aspect of that bill. That had to do \nwith the whole issue of supporting our teachers, attracting the best \nteachers to education. Today I would like to talk about a second \ncomponent of that bill having to do with safer schools. Good teachers, \nsafe schools: It is really getting back to basics.\n  We have a drug crisis in this country. Drugs are readily available \nand, tragically, children are using them. In fact, more children today \nare using and experimenting with drugs than 10 years ago--many, many \nmore. Let's look at the facts.\n  According to the 1999 Monitoring the Future study, since 1992, \noverall drug use among 10th graders has increased 55 percent. Marijuana \nand hashish use among 10th graders has increased 91 percent. Heroin use \namong 10th graders has increased 92 percent. That is just since 1992. \nAnd cocaine use among 10th graders has increased 133 percent.\n  With an abundant supply, drug traffickers are looking to increase \ntheir sales by targeting younger and younger children, creating a whole \nnew generation of addicts. Drug dealers are now targeting children not \nonly in our urban areas but in every community in our land.\n  The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia \nUniversity issued a disturbing report earlier this year. It had to do \nwith the rapidly rising rate of drug use among youth in the rural areas \nof our country. The figures are astounding. If anyone thinks it cannot \nhappen in your community--``it can't happen in my community''--take a \nlook at these figures.\n\n  Their study found that eighth graders in rural America are 34 percent\n\n[[Page S2951]]\n\nmore likely to smoke marijuana than those in urban areas; 50 percent \nmore likely to use powder cocaine; and 83 percent more likely to use \ncrack cocaine.\n  These statistics represent an assault on our children, on our \nfamilies, and on the future of our country. Let me point out what is \nhappening on the streets of Cincinnati in my home State. In 1990, there \nwere 19 heroin-related arrests in Cincinnati, OH. Last year there were \n464 arrests. Law enforcement officers in Cincinnati understand the \nreason for this surge. Colombia produces low-cost, high-purity heroin, \nmaking it more and more the drug of choice. And because of our \nGovernment's inadequate emphasis on drug interdiction and eradication \nefforts, that Colombian heroin is making its way across our borders, \ninto our country, and into Cincinnati, OH, and Cleveland, OH, and \nDetroit and Los Angeles.\n  Sure, this is just one urban area we are talking about, Cincinnati, \nbut if there is a heroin problem in Cincinnati, there is a heroin \nproblem in New York and LA and every metropolitan area across our great \ncountry.\n  I believe what is happening in Cincinnati and across all parts of \nAmerica is a result of a national drug control approach that has not \nemphasized the importance of a balanced attack against drug use. To be \neffective, our drug control strategy needs to be a coordinated effort \nthat directs and balances resources and support among three areas of \nattack: domestic law enforcement, international drug interdiction, and \ndemand reduction.\n  When we talk about demand reduction, we are talking about several \nthings. Demand reduction needs to consist of drug prevention, drug \ntreatment, and drug education. We need to involve all levels of \ngovernment in this three-pronged attack--the Federal, State, and \nlocal--as well as nonprofit private organizations, charitable groups, \ncommunity groups.\n  What all this means is that to effectively stop our kids from getting \nand using illicit drugs we must balance the allocation of resources \ntowards efforts to stop those who produce drugs, those who transport \nillegal drugs, and those who deal drugs on our streets, and, yes, even \nin our schools.\n  Because the threat of violence and drug abuse in our schools is all \ntoo real, we must get to our kids before the drug dealers do. We can do \nthis. We can give America's kids a fighting chance through coordinated \nefforts between our schools and our communities. Next week, when the \nSenate begins debating the education reform legislation that I \nreferenced a moment ago, we will have a great opportunity to enhance a \nvery important program designed to educate our kids and our communities \nabout the dangers of drug use.\n  This bill includes a section that I helped write to make much needed \nimprovements, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program. \nThis program, which was originally part of Ronald Reagan's 1986 Drug-\nFree Schools and Communities Act, is intended to assist every single \nschool district in the country to develop an antidrug program in their \nrespective schools. While well intentioned, this program has been far \nfrom perfect.\n  I had the opportunity a few years ago when I served in the House of \nRepresentatives to be on the National Commission for Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools. We looked at how this program had worked. We found many \nproblems connected with it. The bill we have written and will be on the \nfloor next week I believe will go a long way to solving the problems \nthat the national commission pointed out in 1990 and that we have seen \nsince then. These problems need to be corrected, and I believe this \nbill will go a long way to do that.\n  Since the inception of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities \nProgram in 1986, we have pumped $6 billion into this program, despite \nthe fact the program has lacked accountability, giving us no real \nmechanism to determine its effectiveness. Instead, we have seen some of \nour tax dollars pay for questionable drug use ``prevention'' and \n``education'' activities, such as puppet shows, tickets to Disneyland, \ndunking booths, and magic shows. No matter how well intentioned, these \nare not effective antidrug education tools. Because there has been \nlittle effort to ensure program accountability through research-based \nmeasures, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program has not been as \neffective as it could have been, or as it should be.\n  It is critical the Senate pass education reform legislation that \nincludes improvements to the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities \nProgram, improvements that will empower America's families and \nAmerica's teachers with the information, with the training, with the \nresources they need to help our children resist the temptation of \ndrugs. That is why our section in this bill would, first and most \nimportantly, increase accountability measures to ensure that assistance \nis targeted to effective research-based programs. That means programs \nthat actually work and have been tested and measured and we know work. \nMy language will make sure schools and communities assess local \nproblems accurately, apply research-based solutions, measure outcomes \nwith reliable tools, and evaluate program effectiveness.\n  Second, my language would improve the effectiveness of the Safe and \nDrug-Free Schools Program by requiring schools to directly work with \nparents, with local law enforcement agencies, local government \nagencies, local faith-based organizations, and other community groups \nto develop and implement antidrug and antiviolence strategies.\n  As we all know, drug abuse and violence among young people is a \ncommunity problem, it is a local problem, and it requires a local \ncommunity-based solution. That is why the entire community needs to be \ninvolved in the creation and execution of programs to fight youth drug \nabuse and violence. Our bill requires the schools to reach out to the \nlocal community, to work with other people who are fighting drugs, to \nhave a true community-based approach.\n  Speaking of fighting youth drug abuse and violence, no one is \nfighting harder than the first lady of the State of Ohio, Hope Taft. \nHope has been very instrumental in the creation of this section of our \nbill. I publicly thank her for her great work. She was really \ninstrumental in creating a voice for community-based antidrug \norganizations. Hope Taft's efforts have raised awareness of the dangers \nof youth drug abuse and violence in our schools.\n\n  Also, I am pleased several community groups have indicated their \nsupport for our provision in title IV of the bill we will be debating \nnext week. I will name a few: The American Counseling Association, the \nAmerican School Health Association, the Community Antidrug Coalition of \nAmerica, the National Network for Safe and Drug Free Schools and \nCommunities, and Ohio Parents for Drug Free Youth. These are just a few \nof the organizations that have helped us craft this bill.\n  Third and finally, our language in title IV would give States greater \nflexibility on targeting assistance to the schools particularly in \nneed. Each State has unique drug prevention challenges, and this bill \nprovides the States with flexibility to target funds to all of their \nschools but focus on those schools with the greatest drug violence \nproblems. This flexibility is very significant and very important.\n  Contrast the administration's proposal with our proposal: They want \neach State to cut by half the number of school districts that benefit \nfrom the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Communities Act. Let me make it \nclear; under the administration's proposal which they sent up to \nCapitol Hill, half the school districts in the country would lose their \nfunding. I think that is a mistake. Reinvesting in an improved Safe and \nDrug-Free Schools and Communities Program is a critical part of \nrestoring effectiveness and purpose to our national drug policy.\n  Ultimately, if we do not restore effectiveness, more and more \nchildren will use drugs, leading to greater levels of violence, \ncriminal activity, and delinquency. Unless we take action now, unless \nwe take the necessary steps to reverse these disturbing trends, unless \nwe restore balance to our drug control policy, we will be sacrificing \ntoday's youth and our country's future, and that is just plain wrong.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I yield the remainder of my \ntime to my colleague, Senator Gorton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \nthe remainder of the leader's time.\n\n[[Page S2952]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, next week when the Senate takes up the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, it will be dealing with the \nmost important single issue, with the most vital single goal with which \nit will deal during the course of this session of Congress. That debate \nwill be about our children, about their education, and about their \nfuture.\n  There is unanimous recognition in this body that a good education, an \neducation for the 21st century, will help our children and our \ngrandchildren have an economically independent future, to understand \nthe history of their tradition and their culture, and will open to all \nof their lives an opportunity for lifetime learning and personal \nenrichment.\n  At the same time, as citizens, we recognize that the future of our \ndemocracy depends upon an educated citizenry and that we will need more \nand better educated people in an ever more complicated future.\n  This year alone, I have had an opportunity, both in person and \nthrough video conferencing, to visit dozens of schools in individual \nschool districts in my own State, an experience I know many of my \ncolleagues have shared. More than a year ago, we developed a system of \nrecognizing on almost a weekly basis an outstanding educator or an \noutstanding program someplace in the State of Washington, to both \nrecognize and reward the innovation, the new thinking we all approve \nbut sometimes find difficult to discover.\n  Educators in my State--teachers, principals, superintendents, school \nboard members--and thoughtful and involved parents are proud of their \nsuccesses, but that pride is mixed with frustration, a frustration from \nthe limitations placed on their ability to do what they think best for \nschoolchildren under their care because of the massive rules and \nregulations emanating from Washington, DC. Massive, I say, out of all \nproportion to the amount of money that comes to facilitate that \neducation from sources in the District of Columbia.\n  With all the good will in the world, we now, for 35 years, have \nattempted to reduce the gap between underprivileged and normally \nprivileged children through title I. The Federal Government has spent \nmore than $100 billion to reach that goal. But, bluntly, the goal has \nnot only not been reached, it has not even been approached.\n  We find in the country as a whole that two out of every three African \nAmerican and Hispanic fourth graders can barely read. We find that 70 \npercent of children in high-poverty schools score below the most basic \nreading level. We find that fourth graders in high-poverty schools \nremain two or three grade levels behind their peers in low-poverty \nschools.\n  For these kids, and for the future of our country, we can do better. \nWe must do better. How can we possibly argue that maintaining the \npresent system, or by adding to its complexity by increasing the number \nof rules and regulations coming from Washington, DC, we can help these \ndisadvantaged students in the light of this history, or help any of our \nother students, for that matter?\n  The status quo in the future will mean what the status quo in the \npast has meant. I am convinced--I hope all of us are convinced--that no \nchild should be left behind.\n  For the last 3 years, I have worked on, spoken for, and proposed to \nthis body, new and better approaches that are now a part of the bill we \nwill be dealing with next week called Straight A's, to allow innovation \nin States and in local communities in school districts across the \nUnited States, and to serve those children who are left behind by the \npresent system.\n  Straight A's would change the present pattern--unfortunately, in the \nform in which this bill appears before us in only 15 States; but in 15 \nvery fortunate States--by giving them far more flexibility to use the \nmoney that comes from the Federal Government in the best interests of \ntheir children, without the blizzard of forms and paperwork that \nplagues our schools at the present time but with one overwhelmingly \nimportant underlined requirement: that the academic achievement of our \nchildren demonstrably improve on the basis of objective tests imposed \nby each of the States that take advantage of Straight A's.\n  Under Straight A's, States and local communities could target more \ndollars to high-poverty areas if they believe that is an effective use \nof the money. In a very real sense, they would be encouraged to do so \nor to change the system for the better because, for the first time, \nStates and local school districts would be rewarded--tangibly \nrewarded--by receiving an increased appropriation if, and as, they \nreduce the gap between disadvantaged students and other students in \ntheir systems.\n  Right now there is no such incentive, simply hundreds of different \ncategorical aid programs, many of them highly duplicative in nature, \ncreating all kinds of bureaucracies that have succeeded in either \ngetting dollars through to the classroom or in the far more important \ngoal of raising student achievement.\n  Yesterday, at a news conference, the State superintendent of schools \nin Georgia said 50 percent of the money that her schools received from \nthe Federal Government went to administrative costs--50 percent--a \nterrible indictment of the present system. That money should be found \nin our schools educating our children, not creating more paperwork and \nmore forms.\n  The most dynamic forces in our schools today, in our education system \ntoday, are found in our States and in our local communities, not here \nin Washington, DC. Parents want a better education, and, Lord knows, \nthose men and women who dedicate their entire lives to teaching our \nchildren--teachers and principals and superintendents--wish for exactly \nthe same thing.\n  I am convinced that we can enable them, we can empower them, to \nprovide a far more effective education system for all of our children \nthan we are doing at the present time.\n  The way that we will provide that power, the way we will enable them, \nwill be to trust them to make the right decisions, but in an expression \nborrowed from the cold war: Trust but verify. And we will verify. The \nonly valid method of verification: A set of tests under which their \nactual objective achievement will be measured and reported here to \nWashington, DC, and to this Congress.\n  This should not be--and I hope will not be--a partisan issue. I am \nconvinced that working together we can significantly improve our system \nof public education in the United States and significantly increase the \nparticipation--the constructive participation--that this body, the \nCongress, and the President, make to that. I hope next week will be the \nadvent of debate that will have exactly those results.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, every young person in our country should \nhave the opportunity to grow and learn in an environment that is free \nof drugs and violence. This is the type of environment Safe and Drug \nFree Schools promotes.\n  With the recent results of the annual Monitoring the Future study, it \nis obvious that we need to continue to provide our young people with \neffective programs, such as Safe and Drug Free Schools, to assure \npositive learning environments. This year Monitoring the Future \nreported that nearly 55 percent of our high school seniors have used an \nillicit drug in the past month. In addition, the study found that \nnearly 50 percent of high school seniors have used marijuana in 1999 \nand this percentage has remained unchanged in 1998, as well as 1997. \nSadly, the study also found that the percentage of 10th graders who \nreported use of marijuana increased from 39.6 percent in 1998 to nearly \n41 percent in 1999. With these discouraging drug use and abuse trends, \nit is clear that we need to use every resource available for anti-drug \nefforts.\n  Safe and Drug Free Schools provides our state and local education \nagencies with the funding necessary to implement effective, research-\nbased programs that prevent and reduce violence and substance abuse in \nour schools. Studies show a high correlation between drug use and \navailability and school violence. We need to create a drug-free \nenvironment to promote a safe environment.\n  In fact, many states have reported decreases in incidents of violence \nand drug use because of Safe and Drug Free Schools funds. It is \nimperative that we continue to provide our communities with the \nresources necessary to protect our children from violence and drugs.\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\nWith our leadership and support, it is certain that these disturbing \ntrends of drug use and increasing school violence will be reduced. I am \ncommitted to providing our young people with a positive learning \nenvironment free of drugs and safe from harm.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee spoke on the floor of the Senate on the \nsubject of arms control. He is a distinguished Member of the Senate, \nsomeone for whom I have high regard, but someone with whom I have \nstrong disagreement on this subject. I will speak this morning about \nthe presentation he made yesterday and its relationship to a range of \nother issues we face.\n  The front page of the Washington Post this morning has a headline: \n``Helms Vows to Obstruct Arms Pacts, Any New Clinton Accord With Russia \nRuled Out.'' It is a story about the presentation made yesterday by the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in which he stated that any \narms control agreement negotiated by this administration is going to be \ndead on arrival in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. With all due \nrespect to the Washington Post, that is not news. The Foreign Relations \nCommittee has been a morgue for arms control for a long time. In fact, \nthis Congress has been a morgue for arms control. Everything dealing \nwith arms control has been dead on arrival in this Congress and in that \ncommittee for several years.\n  The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference is now being \nheld in New York. At that conference the world is looking to this \ncountry for leadership in stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons \nand stopping the spread the missiles, submarines, and bombers with \nwhich those nuclear weapons are delivered. Regrettably, this country \nhas abandoned its leadership on the arms control issue.\n  I will include in the Record several editorials: one is the April 26 \nedition of the Chicago Tribune entitled ``Russia Takes Arms Control \nLead.'' It discusses the Russian Duma's approval of Start II and the \napproval of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban treaty by the Russians. \nAnother is from the April 26 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel entitled, \n``Will the United States Lead or Follow on the Issue of Arms Control.'' \nAnother is from the April 27 Dallas Morning News with the title ``Arms \nControl, the Senate Needs to Stop Playing with Nuclear Fire.'' And the \nlast is this morning's column in the Washington Post by Mary McGrory \nentitled ``Nuclear Family Values.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent these four editorials be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the statement made yesterday by the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee was a statement that says, \nwe don't know what you might negotiate. It has not yet been negotiated; \na proposal does not yet exist. But whatever it is and whatever it might \nbe, we intend to kill it. It will be dead in my committee.\n  That is not what this country ought to be doing with the subject of \narms control. As we meet in the Senate discussing a range of things, \nand especially discussing, more recently, the case of Elian Gonzalez, \nwhich seems to have co-opted so much attention in this country, other \ncountries around the world aspire to acquire nuclear weapons. The \nspread of nuclear weapons is a very serious matter. Will more and more \ncountries have access to nuclear bombs and the means by which to \ndeliver those nuclear weapons, or will this country provide leadership \nin stopping the spread of nuclear weapons?\n  Arms control agreements have worked. Those in this Congress who have \nstopped arms control agreements and who have said any future agreements \nwill be dead in our committee or in this Congress are wrong. It is the \nwrong policy for this country. Our country should instead be saying we \nembrace thoughtful, reasonable, arms control agreements that make this \na safer world.\n  This picture shows some of what the Senate and the Congress have done \nin the past on arms control agreements and why they work. This is a \npicture of a missile silo. This used to hold an SS-19, a Soviet and \nthen Russian missile. The missile in this silo had several warheads \naimed at the United States of America. The threat from those warheads \ndoesn't exist anymore. The missile is gone. The silo was filled in. The \nground is plowed over and there are now sunflowers on top. Is that \nprogress? You bet your life it is progress.\n\n  But it is not just missile silos. Here is the dismantling of a \nRussian Delta class ballistic missile submarine. This used to be a \nsubmarine that would find its way stealthily through the waters with \nmissiles and nuclear warheads aimed at American cities and targets. It \nis no longer a submarine. Here is a piece of copper wire that is ground \nup that used to be on that Russian submarine. Did we sink that \nsubmarine in hostile action? No. Through the Nunn-Lugar threat \nreduction program, the Pentagon actually dismantled that Russian \nsubmarine.\n  More than that, we are sawing the wings off Russian bombers. Here is \na picture of the Nunn-Lugar program cutting the wings off TU-95 heavy \nbombers. Why is the Pentagon cutting the wings off those bombers? \nBecause we have had arms control agreements with Russia that have \ncalled for the reduction of bombers, missiles, nuclear warheads. Six \nthousand Russian nuclear warheads have been eliminated--6,000. That is \nthe explosive equivalent of 175,000 nuclear bombs like those dropped on \nHiroshima. Let me repeat that. Arms control agreements with Russia have \neliminated the threat from nuclear weapons with destructive power \nequivalent to 175,000 bombs the size of the nuclear bomb dropped on \nHiroshima.\n  We have people in the Congress who say: We don't like arms control. \nWe want to build new things. We want to build new missiles. We want to \nbuild new missile defense systems. We want to build and we want to \nspend money building. What they do is light the fuse of a new arms \nrace.\n  Without some new effort in arms control to reduce the threat of \nnuclear weapons, we will see a new arms race--expensive, dangerous, and \none that will hold the world hostage for some time to come. Our job \nought to be to find ways to reduce the nuclear threat, not expand it; \nto find ways to create arms control agreements that work.\n  Again, I have deep respect for all of my colleagues, even those with \nwhom I have serious disagreements. I certainly have serious \ndisagreements in this circumstance. But I don't understand an \nannouncement that says, whatever the President might negotiate in arms \ncontrol, even though it is not yet negotiated, even though we don't \nknow the specifics, whatever it might be with respect to arms control, \nwe pledge to you that it is dead. That is not leadership. That is \ndestructive to good public policy. If we can negotiate with the \nRussians and others sensible, thoughtful arms control agreements that \nadvance this country's interests, enhance world safety and security, \nthen we ought to be willing to embrace it, not shun it.\n  I regret very much the announcement that there will be no hearings on \nany negotiations on arms control. We are quick to hold hearings on the \nElian Gonzalez case. We have people doing cartwheels around the Chamber \nsaying: Let's hold hearings; let's investigate. We can hold hearings on \nthe Elian Gonzalez case, but somehow there will be no movement, no \nhearings, no discussion on the issue of arms control if, God forbid, we \nshould be able to achieve some sort of breakthrough in an arms control \nagreement with the Russians or others.\n  In conclusion, it is our responsibility, it falls on our shoulders in \nthe United\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\nStates to be a world leader on these issues. It is our responsibility \nto lead. We are the remaining nuclear and economic superpower in the \nworld. It is our responsibility to lead, not towards another arms race \nbut towards more arms control and towards stopping the spread of \nnuclear weapons.\n  Let's not have more countries joining the nuclear club. Let's not \nhave more proliferation of the technology of missiles and submarines \nand nuclear weapons spread around the world. To those who say we are \nthreatened by North Korea being able to send a missile with a warhead \nto threaten the Aleutian Islands, I say this: Almost anyone who thinks \nthrough this understands there are a myriad of threats our country \nfaces. The least likely is a threat by an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile from a rogue nation. It is far more likely that a truck bomb, \nfar more likely that a suitcase bomb, far more likely that a deadly \nbiological or chemical agent would be used to threaten or hold hostage \nthis country. It is far more likely that a cruise missile would be \nused. It is, in my judgment, the least likely option that a rogue \nnation would have access to and acquire an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile and use that as a threat against this country.\n  Having said that, I think we will now have a struggle between those \nwho desperately want to build a national missile defense system at any \ncost in taxpayers' money, at any cost in arms control, at any cost, as \ncontrasted with those of us who believe it is still our responsibility \nto make this a safer world by understanding that arms control has \nworked and has reduced the number of nuclear weapons. But we are not \nnearly finished. We must move to START III, we must preserve the ABM \nTreaty, and we must have new, aggressive, bold and energetic leadership \nin the U.S. to say it is our job to stop the spread of nuclear weapons \nto make this a safer world.\n  That burden falls upon this country and, regrettably, this Congress \nhas not been willing to assume that responsibility. It is, in fact, all \ntoo often marching in exactly the opposite direction. We need to put it \nback on track and say it is our job, and we willingly and gladly accept \nthat responsibility to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, to negotiate \ngood arms control agreements that don't threaten our security, but \nenhance it by reducing the threat of nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Apr. 26, 2000]\n\n                     Russia Takes Arms Control Lead\n\n       In just one week's time, Russia has broken a legislative \n     logjam that had stymied for years any action on reducing its \n     formidable nuclear arsenal and forestalling the further \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n       With passage of START II and the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty, the Russian Duma has handed president-elect Vladimir \n     Putin major victories and created, for the United States, \n     something of a dilemma.\n       Russia can claim to be a leader in arms control and point \n     its finger reproachfully at the U.S. Russia can say America \n     is now the laggard. Russia can say America is seeking to \n     destabilize the bedrock agreement of mutual deterrence during \n     the Cold War--the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.\n       The U.S. is seeking changes in that treaty to permit it to \n     develop a missile defense intended to protect the nation \n     against attacks from rogue nations such as North Korea and \n     Iraq. The technology is unproven and the cost estimates \n     already skyrocketing, but there is support in both parties \n     for a missile defense of some kind.\n       This is an unwelcome change in global public relations. \n     Until last October, the U.S. could rightly argue it was doing \n     all it could to lead the movement to control the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world, and that \n     Russia was the obstinate player. The U.S. Senate in 1996 \n     ratified the START II treaty--calling for the nuclear \n     arsenals of the U.S. and Russia to be cut roughly in half. \n     The test ban treaty had not been ratified by the U.S.--but it \n     hadn't been ratified by Russia either.\n       Last October, though, the U.S. Senate rejected the test ban \n     treaty. Now Russia has agreed to it. That puts Russia in the \n     company of Britain and France--also among the five early \n     nuclear powers--which have signed and ratified the CTBT. And \n     it lumps the U.S. with the only other early nuclear power \n     that has not--China.\n       Though it might argue as such, this is not exactly a case \n     of Russia acting out of nobility. Russia has significant \n     economic as well as strategic reasons for moving on these \n     long-stalled arms treaties. It cannot afford to maintain its \n     existing nuclear arsenal, and any reduction in warheads helps \n     free up scarce resources for other military needs.\n       As well, the CTBT vote places no immediate demands on \n     Russia. Though the treaty has been signed by more than 150 \n     nations and ratified by 52, its ban on test explosions would \n     take effect only after each of the 44 nations deemed to have \n     some nuclear capability ratifies it.\n       Regardless of motives, Russia has taken the lead and put \n     the U.S. on the defensive--and that's not a comfortable \n     position for this nation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Apr. 26, 2000]\n\n                       Will U.S. Lead, or Follow?\n\n       During the Cold War, the United States was the world \n     champion of nuclear arms control, and the Soviet Union was \n     the unwilling partner that had to be dragged along. In the \n     post-Cold War era, the tables have not been exactly turned; \n     but the furniture has been rearranged, putting the U.S. in \n     the unbecoming role of Dr. No.\n       Last week, the lower house of parliament in Russia approved \n     the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. As its name suggests, the \n     treaty bans the testing of nuclear weapons and thereby \n     constrains their development. Just the week before, the \n     Russian parliament approved another major accord: the second \n     Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which nearly halves the \n     nuclear arsenals of both the U.S. and Russia.\n       Putting themselves firmly on record in support of the arms-\n     control process, the Russian lawmakers conditioned their \n     approval of these treaties on continued U.S. adherence to the \n     Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, which prohibits \n     national anti-missile defense systems.\n       Compare these impressive and unambiguous Kremlin decisions \n     with the dismal U.S. record in recent years. The Senate beat \n     the Russians to the punch on START II, ratifying that treaty \n     in 1996. Since then, U.S. leadership on arms control has all \n     but died.\n       In October, the Senate refused to ratify the test ban \n     treaty, partly because the Clinton administration never \n     bothered to campaign for it. Meantime, the administration--\n     pushed by Repubicans--is considering whether to deploy a \n     limited missile shield that would violate the ABM treaty.\n       The White House is trying to persuade the Russians to amend \n     that treaty to allow for a missile defense, but the Russians \n     are having none of it. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the \n     presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has said the \n     U.S. should withdraw from the treaty if the Russians refuse \n     to revise it.\n       Thus, the U.S. threatens to dismantle an arms control \n     structure that has taken years to build, while Russia \n     bolsters it. This role reversal would be justified were arms \n     treaties obsolete. But they aren't. If nuclear war has been \n     averted over the last half-century, it is partly because of \n     these agreements.\n       It's time for the U.S. to make a U-turn. The administration \n     should start lobbying Congress and the country in behalf of \n     the test ban so that it can be ratified by the Senate next \n     year. And, rather than weaken or withdraw from the ABM \n     treaty, the U.S. should see that it is strengthened.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Dallas Morning News, Apr. 27, 2000]\n\n                              Arms Control\n\n\n             senate needs to stop playing with nuclear fire\n\n       Good news! Russia's parliament ratified the START II \n     nuclear arms-reduction treaty this month. The U.S. Senate \n     ratified it in 1996.\n       Therefore, the treaty, which would reduce the deployed \n     warheads in each country's arsenal to no more than 3,500 from \n     6,000, may at last take effect, right?\n       Wrong.\n       The treaty won't take effect until the U.S. Senate ratifies \n     protocols to the treaty that the countries signed in 1997. \n     The protocols extend the arms-reduction deadline to 2007 from \n     2003 and formally designate Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and \n     Ukraine as successors to the 1972 U.S.-Soviet anti-ballistic \n     missile treaty.\n       One would think that the Senate would leap at the chance to \n     ratify the protocols for the sake of achieving verifiable \n     reductions in Russia's nuclear arsenal. But the body isn't \n     interested. Its Republican majority adamantly wants to build \n     a defense against missile attacks by rogue states, which is \n     illegal under the U.S.-Soviet anti-ballistic treaty.\n       No problem. President Clinton is trying to negotiate \n     amendments to the anti-ballistic missile treaty that would \n     permit the United States to build a limited national missile \n     defense. It's a worthwhile project. Once he convinces the \n     Russians to agree, the Senate will ratify the amendments and \n     the protocols so that START II could be implemented, right?\n       Wrong again.\n       The Republicans want a granddaddy missile defense. They \n     want, in effect, ``Star Wars.'' Twenty-five of them, \n     including Texas' Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison and \n     Majority Leader Trent Lott, wrote Mr. Clinton on April 18 \n     that his proposed limited defense was too limited.\n       It takes only 34 senators to defeat a treaty. So even if \n     Mr. Clinton succeeds in amending the anti-ballistic missile \n     treaty, the Senate would probably defeat it and the \n     protocols, which means no START II. If the United States \n     should proceed to build an ample missile defense more to the \n     Republicans' liking, Russia might carry out its threat to \n     abrogate the entire range of bilateral arms-reduction \n     treaties with the United States, which would spell the end of \n     arms control as we know it.\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n\n       The United States is beginning to look as if it isn't \n     interested in arms control. The Senate last year rejected a \n     good treaty that would have permanently banned nuclear tests. \n     The lower house of Russia's parliament approved the same \n     treaty on April 21. Now, the Senate is holding START II \n     hostage to amendments to an anti-ballistic missile treaty \n     that it probably would not ratify.\n       Meanwhile, U.S. negotiators keep telling their Russian \n     counterparts that the limited missile defense would defend \n     against rogue states, while hawkish senators hold out for a \n     full-blown system whose principle object would be to defend \n     against Russia.\n       To its credit, the administration is talking with Russia \n     about a START III treaty, which would reduce the number of \n     deployed warheads to no more than 2,500. But those talks are \n     hampered by the stalemates over START II and missile \n     defenses.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 27, 2000]\n\n                         Nuclear Family Values\n\n                           (By Mary McGrory)\n\n       The fate of mankind vs. the fate of one 6-year-old Cuban \n     boy? It is not a contest in the U.S. Senate. Elian wins going \n     away.\n       Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin, can't get anyone's \n     attention on Capitol Hill, even though his first moves in \n     office could have beneficial effects on the whole world and \n     are at least as noteworthy as Janet Reno's pre-dawn raid on \n     Elian Gonzalez's Miami home.\n       Putin passed two treaties through the Russian parliament \n     with wide majorities, indicating at a minimum that he had a \n     grip on the legislature and some idea of a new image for \n     Russia: START II reduces the number of nuclear weapons, and \n     the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the Senate rejected \n     last year, bans all tests.\n       But is anyone hailing a new day in arms control? Is anyone \n     rejoicing? No. Putin has done very well. But his name is not \n     Gonzalez.\n       On the Senate floor, Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee, who is just as much a dictator \n     as Castro, from whom many Republicans want to save Elian, \n     announced that there would be no hearings on this wicked \n     nonsense from Putin. But there will be emergency hearings on \n     Elian, beginning next week.\n       When Putin on April 15 put it to Bill Clinton that he could \n     have a choice between fewer nuclear weapons and a national \n     missile defense system, the reaction of Republican senators \n     was outrage. Led by their majority leader, Trent Lott, they \n     dashed off a letter to the president, warning him that it was \n     all a plot to foil a version of Ronald Reagan's Star Wars.\n       The national missile defense system doesn't work and it \n     costs $60 billion going in. But hang the tests and hang the \n     expense, the Republicans want to start pouring concrete. Not \n     that they are talking about it, mind you. They are busing \n     planning to air for the country all the recriminations and \n     second-guessing since a petrified Elian was hauled out of a \n     closet by a helmeted, goggled creature with bared teeth and \n     an automatic weapon.\n       The Republicans love that picture almost as much as they \n     love Star Wars, and they are not going to let it go. They \n     quizzed Attorney General Reno for almost two hours Tuesday \n     morning. In the afternoon, Leader Lott, fairly vibrating with \n     anticipation, explained that the public had a right to know \n     just what state the peace negotiations had been at the time \n     of the dawn raid. Janet Reno's answers had not been \n     satisfactory.\n       All day in the halls, Senate Elian-celebrities were giving \n     interviews. There was Republican Sen. Connie Mack of Florida, \n     who had been stood up by Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, \n     Lazaro's operatic daughter Marisleysis, and Donato Dalrymple, \n     one of Elian's rescuers. There was Florida's other senator, \n     Bob Graham (D), who also had a grievance. He kept telling \n     anyone who would listen that the president of the United \n     States, sitting in the Oval Office, had given his personal \n     word that no snatch would be undertaken at night. You can \n     almost hear Bill Clinton triumphantly responding, ``It was 5 \n     o'clock in the morning.''\n       Perhaps the most put out was Republican Sen. Robert C. \n     Smith of New Hampshire, who had taken Lazaro's troupe to the \n     Capitol when they landed after their dramatic dash in hot \n     pursuit of their little boarder. They have been turned away \n     at the gate of Andrews Air Force Base, twice. ``Wait until \n     defense appropriations time,'' growled veteran Republican \n     lobbyist Tom Korologos.\n       Republicans have been warned by their pollsters that the \n     public, by a wide margin, has thought all along that Elian \n     should be sent home to his father. The public hated the \n     picture of the child at gunpoint but they loved pictures \n     taken at Andrews--pictures that showed a beaming Elian \n     leaning on his father's shoulder and playing with his baby \n     stepbrother.\n       What legislation would come out of hearings is hard to \n     imagine. There's little hope of wisdom, either. Maybe \n     Marisleysis Gonzalez should be asked about her enviable \n     health plan. She's been in and out of the hospital eight \n     times in the past month, suffering from the vapors visited on \n     a surrogate mom. And somebody might want to inquire of the \n     attorney general if she had considered dispensing with the \n     helmet and the goggles that made the Immigration and \n     Naturalization gunman such a sinister figure. Wasn't a \n     machine gun sufficiently intimidating? Did she make it clear \n     to the crew that the child is not a drug lord? While all this \n     melodrama was swirling around, the Senate in its chamber was \n     tampering again with the Constitution--an amendment for \n     victims' rights. The Constitution should not be messed with. \n     Another document better left alone is the Anti-Ballistic \n     Missile Treaty.\n       We need that handsome woman who threw the blanket over \n     Elian on Saturday morning and rushed him off the scene. She \n     should do the same for the Senate until it gets a grip on its \n     priorities.\n                                  ____\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the last several days, we have been \ndebating a victims' rights amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and that \nis an interesting and thoughtful debate. But I think we can do \nsomething else, which is try to prevent victims in the first place. We \ncan do that by passing the juvenile justice bill, which contains \nsensible controls on handguns in this society.\n  A few days ago we saw another incident involving a handgun at the \nNational Zoo, a place we have recognized for decades as a source of \nsolace and education and recreation in the Nation's Capital. But, in a \nmoment, it was turned into a place of violence and terror because a \nyoung man, apparently with a handgun, shot several young people.\n  The tragedy in this country is that each year 30,000 Americans die by \ngunfire. Every day, 12 children are killed by gunfire. We can stop that \nand we must stop that.\n  The most recent incident is another indication that we have to act \nnot someday but immediately. These seven children have been harmed and \ntheir families have been forever changed. This is a tragedy that they \nwill live with, but it is a tragedy that we don't have to live with as \na nation indefinitely.\n  We took several appropriate and responsible steps after the Columbine \nshooting last year in which we passed legislation that would close the \ngun show loophole, require safety locks on handguns to prevent their \nuse by children, and other measures. Yet these measures languish today \nin a conference committee that has met only once since last year, which \nis not seriously attempting to address the critical issues of violence \nin this country.\n  Each day we wait, another incident takes place. Again, last year on \nthe floor of the Senate as we debated the juvenile justice bill, if any \nof us had stood up and said a 6-year-old child would walk into first \ngrade in America and shoot another 6 year old, some would have said it \nwas hysterical demagoging.\n  That happened. If anybody said that on a Sunday or a weekday \nafternoon at the National Zoo random gunfire would break out and seven \nchildren would be shot down, we would be accused of hysterical \ndemagoguery. It happened.\n  We can prevent this, and we should, by acting promptly to pass the \njuvenile justice bill with those provisions included. Many in the \nCongress call for stricter enforcement of handgun laws. I agree with \nthat. We should enforce the laws. But the reality is that we have to \nprevent these incidents rather than, after the fact, arresting people.\n  It is against the law in the District of Columbia to possess a \nhandgun, as it was possessed, apparently, by this young man. But the \nDistrict of Columbia is not an island. It is a metropolitan area \nbetween other States that have much less strict gun control laws. \nVirginia, for example, is a State which is a shell-issue State. That \nmeans that practically any person who is not a felon can carry a \nconcealed weapon with a license and without showing a special need to \ndo so.\n\n  Private sales of handguns, including gun show sales, are common \nthroughout Virginia, and there you can in fact buy a weapon without a \nbackground check if you are buying from an unlicensed gun dealer. There \nis no waiting period in Virginia to buy a handgun. Now there is a law \nthat prevents the purchase of more than one handgun a month, and that \nis good because it prevents trafficking in firearms. But it\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\nonly takes one gun to do the kind of damage we saw a few days ago at \nthe National Zoo.\n  We all agree that enforcement is important. We look forward to and \napplaud the local authorities who apprehended the young suspect. He \nwill be tried and the law will be imposed and enforced. But, once \nagain, prevention perhaps could have prevented this violence or other \nviolence throughout the United States.\n  On this 1-year anniversary of Columbine, we should be doing something \nmore than simply sitting and waiting for that conference report. We \nshould be demanding, as we have in the past on this floor, that \nconferees meet, vote, and send us back this measure, including all \nthose strict gun control provisions. This Senate went on record by a \nvote of 53-47 to take that very position. I hope that vote will \nenergize and activate the conferees and that they will move immediately \nto send this provision to the President for signature.\n  Within that bill, there are resources for the types of prevention and \nenforcement that we need with respect to juveniles. Twenty-five percent \nof the $250 million distributed annually on the juvenile accountability \nblock grant program would be dedicated to prevention to the gun lobby. \nIn addition, the conference report would include, I hope, child safety \nlocks, an amendment to firmly close the gun show loophole, a ban on the \nimportation of high-capacity ammunition clips, and a ban on the sale of \nsemiautomatic weapons. It is time now to prevent, if we can, the \nviolence that we have witnessed and, sadly, the violence that happens \nevery day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

One of the issues pending is a Tax Code issue called the \nmarriage tax penalty. What it boils down to is that a number of people \nin this country, when they go to get married, their combined incomes on \na joint return puts them in a higher tax bracket, so they are, in fact, \npenalized by the Tax Code because of their decision to get married.\n  The debate on the floor of the Senate now is whether we will change \nthe Tax Code to eliminate that penalty. It makes common sense, really. \nWe want to encourage people to get married. The idea that we would \npenalize them under the Tax Code for getting married makes no sense at \nall. There is common agreement on that. Democrats and Republicans \nbelieve we should eliminate that penalty. The difference, of course, \ncomes down to how you do it and what the bill says as part of the tax \nrelief.\n  I have to say, parenthetically, that I don't know too many young \ncouples who, when they are making plans to get engaged and to get \nmarried, say, well, before we finalize this and buy a wedding ring, we \nbetter stop off at the accountant's office to figure out the tax \nconsequences. I am sure some do that, but my wife and I sure didn't, \nand most people don't do that.\n  Notwithstanding that observation, it is right for us to consider \nchanging the Tax Code to eliminate this penalty. Interestingly enough, \nthough, there are almost an equal number of couples who get married and \nget a tax bonus because their combined income lowers their joint tax \nrate to the point where they pay a lower tax rate married than they did \nas single, individual filers. So, in a way, there is a marriage tax \npenalty under the Tax Code that I described, but there is also a \nmarriage bonus. So what we have said on the Democratic side is let's \ndeal with the penalty and make sure nobody pays a price under the Tax \nCode for the decision to get married.\n  When you make these Tax Code decisions, they cost money, because it \nmeans fewer dollars are flowing from taxpayers and from the economy \ninto the Treasury. Whenever you are going to propose a bill such as \nthis to eliminate a Tax Code penalty to reduce a tax obligation, you \nhave to come up with some money to pay for it and offset the loss of \nrevenue to the Federal Government.\n  We are in a position to discuss that possibility because, frankly, we \nare enjoying the most prosperous economy in the history of the United \nStates of America. We have seen the longest period of economic \nexpansion ever. It has been I think close to 109 months--for over 9 \nyears--that we have seen a continued expansion of the economy without a \nrecession, which means more people are going to work and buying homes \nor cars; businesses are getting started; inflation is in check; people \nare making more money.\n  If you happen to have a retirement plan, if you take away the last \nfew weeks, which have been a little rocky, you know that over the last \nseveral years you have done pretty well. There has been a growth in \nvalue in the stock market. When President Clinton was sworn in as \nPresident, the Dow Jones average was around 3,000. Now it is in the \n10,000 category.\n  A tripling in the value of this stock market means half the American \nfamilies who own mutual funds or other investments have generally seen \ntheir pensions and savings growing over this period of time. This is a \nvery good thing. But because of that strengthening economy, we have \nalso seen people making more money and paying more in taxes. \nConsidering the fact that folks are doing better, most of them have \nsaid: Keep it coming. We are willing to pay our fair share of taxes as \nlong as we are getting more in income and we see our retirement plans \ngrowing.\n  This increase in tax receipts because of a prosperous economy has \ngenerated a surplus. Where the Senate just a few years ago was \nembroiled in a controversy about the deficit we faced year in and year \nout, we are now talking about how to spend the surplus. The marriage \ntax penalty bill takes a part of this surplus and says, let's cure this \nproblem in the Tax Code. I don't think that is unreasonable. But I \nthought we ought to step back for a second and say what our long-term \ngoals are.\n  The long-term goal enunciated by President Clinton--which I support \nand the Democratic side supports--is that we should take this surplus \nand invest it wisely, do things with it that make sense in the long \nterm.\n  One thing that makes sense is to eliminate the national debt. The \ndeficit each year piles up into an account called the national debt. \nThe national debt is our mortgage as a nation. We have to raise taxes \nevery year to pay interest on our Nation's mortgage--the national debt. \nIn fact, we have to raise $1 billion in taxes every single day from \nfamilies, businesses, and individuals just to pay interest on old debt.\n  Those of us on the Democratic side think our surplus should first be \ndedicated to reducing this national debt so that the mortgage left to \nour children and grandchildren is smaller. We will leave them a great \nnation. Of course, we are proud of the role we played in helping that \nto happen. But we shouldn't leave them a great debt for the things we \nenjoyed during our lifetime.\n  We believe, on the Democratic side, that the fiscally sound thing to \ndo is to reduce the national debt. I am afraid our friends on the \nRepublican side of the aisle would rather spend this money on tax cuts \nthat go way beyond the marriage tax penalty--the problem I discussed \nearlier.\n\n  The leader in tax cuts is the Republican candidate for President, \nGovernor Bush. He has proposed a tax cut package larger even than the \nRepublican package that is being brought to the floor.\n  We had a vote just a couple of weeks ago on an amendment I offered. \nBy a vote of 99-0, the Senate rejected the\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\nGeorge Bush tax cut. They said it wasn't wise policy. I think that was \na wise vote. We basically said, let's take care to spend this surplus \nwisely so that if the economy has a downturn, or we are asked in later \nyears to account for our actions, we can explain, yes, we put the money \ninto reducing the national debt, strengthening Social Security, \nstrengthening Medicare for years to come, and making wise investments \nin our future--and targeted tax cuts.\n  One of the wisest investments and the first stop on most people's \nagenda would be education--figure out a way to strengthen education so \nyoung people across America in the 21st century have a better chance \nfor a good job and a better chance to compete.\n  How else could we make a wise investment? Do something about health \ncare in this country. Expand the coverage of health insurance so that \nmore and more Americans have that protection and peace of mind. Deal \nwith the whole issue of prescription drug benefits for the elderly and \ndisabled. We think, on the Democratic side, that is a wise investment \nof the surplus as well.\n  Then targeted tax cuts: Make sure you target them where they are \nneeded and don't go overboard.\n  The marriage penalty I discussed: We agree on the Democratic side to \neliminate it, but let's not go overboard in eliminating it and reduce \nthe possibility of bringing down the national debt and strengthening \nSocial Security and Medicare. Therein lies the heart of the debate on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  For several weeks now, the Republican leadership has come to us and \nsaid: We want to bring our marriage tax penalty bill up for \nconsideration. This marriage tax penalty bill they have proposed goes \nway beyond what is necessary to cure the penalty. In fact, when you \ntake a close look at the provisions, you find, unfortunately, a large \npart of the money that is being spent there is not really going to help \nthe people who are penalized by the decision to get married.\n  Only 15 percent of the benefits under the Republican proposal, for \nexample, go to low- and middle-income married couples with incomes \nbelow $50,000 a year; 15 percent to couples making less than $50,000 a \nyear. Yet these couples represent 45 percent of all married couples. \nThey are not getting the tax benefit.\n  Take a look at the winners. Fewer than a third of married couples \nhave incomes exceeding $75,000. Under the Republican bill, one-third of \nthose couples who are getting married and earning over $75,000 a year \nreceive two-thirds of this bill's tax benefit.\n  There is no fairness here.\n  If we are trying to encourage marriage at all levels of income, why \nwould we hype the benefits on the wealthiest people in America and \nbasically ignore those in lower-income categories struggling to buy a \nhome and start a family? That is exactly what the Republican bill does. \nMany of us don't believe that is fair.\n\n  In addition, only 40 percent of the tax relief under the Senate \nRepublican plan would go towards the marriage tax penalty. That is less \nthan half of it. Sixty percent of it provides tax breaks for people who \nare not suffering the marriage tax penalty. Those of us on the \nDemocratic side think that is not a wise investment. Instead, we should \ntarget the tax cuts to people who need them.\n  Let me give you two examples of what we think we can do with targeted \ntax cuts that families across America really need. For example, do you \nhave a child attending college? Do you know how much it costs? Most \nfamilies do. They start worrying about college education expenses as \nsoon as the baby is born. They start putting away a little in a savings \naccount thinking: how in the heck will their son or daughter ever get \nto a college unless they think ahead and plan ahead.\n  One of the things the Democrats want to do, sponsored by Senator \nSchumer of New York, is to give a deduction for college education \nexpenses up to $10,000. What does it mean? If you spent $10,000 on your \nson's or daughter's college education, the targeted tax cut on the \nDemocratic side would give you $2,800--over a fourth of it--in a tax \ndeduction. I wish it could be more, but it is a helping hand. I think \nmost families would say: I like this; this is a sensible thing. It \nreduces the burden of debt many young people would face coming out of \ncollege. It helps families who are trying to help their sons and \ndaughters go through college.\n  Let me tell you something else we would do. We would create a tax \ncredit for people who are paying for long-term care.\n  If you have an elderly parent or a disabled person in your household, \nyou know that the cost of long-term care could be very expensive--to \nbring in visiting nurses, to provide for some sort of convalescent \ncare, or long-term nursing home care. The President has proposed a \ntargeted tax cut for families to give them a helping hand to pay for \nthat elderly parent, or elderly relative, or someone disabled in your \nhousehold. That is the Democratic proposal.\n\n  The Republicans, in contrast, think that 60 percent of the tax cuts \nshould go to people in higher income categories instead of targeting \nthem to family needs that I have just described, like college education \nexpenses and long-term care. That is what the debate boils down to, in \nsubstance. The procedural part of the debate is as dry as dust, but it \nis important because we will decide on a vote in just about an hour and \na half as to whether or not we are going to close down the debate on \nthe Republican marriage tax penalty bill or leave it open so we can \nallow for amendments to be offered.\n  The Republicans oppose the suggestion that we Democrats could offer \nour targeted tax cuts on the floor of the Senate. They want to give us \na take-it-or-leave-it vote: Either take our tax break, our marriage tax \npenalty break, or vote against it. We think this should be done in \ntruly a deliberative process, where we come to the floor and debate the \nmerits of our different positions. This Senate is supposed to be the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world. For 200 years, it has enjoyed \nthis reputation.\n  Yesterday, one of my colleagues, one of the most respected Members of \nthe Senate, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, came to the floor, \nand in his fashion gave us another history lesson about the Senate and \nhow it came to be. If you have not heard a Senator Byrd speech on the \nhistory of the Senate, you have missed a good time. This man has \ndedicated a lifetime to reminding us that this is a historic \ninstitution. It is not just another creature of politics. He reminds \nus, time and again, our responsibility is to come to this floor and \ndebate the great ideas in America. Yet the Republican majority would \nclose us down, stop us from this debate, stop us from bringing these \namendments to the floor.\n  I say to those following the course of my remarks, this Senate is not \noverworked. Take a look at the floor. With the exception of the fine \nSenator from Kentucky, who is presiding, I am the only one on the \nfloor. Over the course of this week, few Members have come to the \nfloor. We have not worked late at night or early in the morning \ndebating issues that American families care about. We have kind of been \nin neutral for a long period of time.\n  When I go home to my home State of Illinois, the people I talk to and \nthe families I meet with ask some very basic and important questions: \nWhat have you done lately to improve the quality of life for families \nacross America? The unfortunate answer is: Very little, if anything. \nThis Senate and the House of Representatives cannot seem to get into \ngear.\n  When I ran for the Senate, it was for the opportunity to represent 12 \nmillion people in Illinois but also to come to this floor and engage in \na real debate. I want the Republicans to come forward with their best \narguments on the issues of the day. I want the Democrats to do the \nsame. Then let's vote--that is what it is all about--and be held \naccountable by the people who sent us here as to whether or not we have \nvoted the right way. That is the democratic process.\n  But that is not the way it works in the Senate today. What we have \nhere is an effort by the Republican majority to stop the debate, to \nclose it down, to give you one take-it-or-leave-it vote each week and \nthen go home. We come in and punch our time cards, check off the box \nthat says I now qualify for another day on my pension, and a lot of \npeople head home. That is not why I ran for the Senate, and I do not \nthink that is why this body was created by our Founding Fathers.\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\n  Let us consider some of the things we could address. Senator Evan \nBayh, my new Democratic colleague from Indiana, an extraordinarily \ntalented man who served as Governor of that State, has come forward \nwith a very responsible suggestion on the marriage tax penalty. Senator \nBayh has said: Let us help those who are penalized and let us save the \nresulting money from the Republican bill to reduce our national debt, \nto preserve and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, to provide the \ntargeted tax cuts. That is one of the amendments we want to offer. Take \nit or leave it, up or down, limited debate. Our leader, Senator \nDaschle, came to the floor and said this is not a filibuster. We will \nagree to a limitation, 1 hour on a side on this important issue, and \nthen let's vote on it.\n  But, no: Rejected. The Republican leadership said we do not want to \ndebate Senator Bayh's amendment. We do not want to debate Senator \nBayh's substitute. We want to give you one vote, up or down, take it or \nleave it. I don't think it is fair. I don't think it is fair to the \nSenator from Indiana, nor is it fair to this body. Certainly we have \nthe time on our hands to spend 2 hours debating that important issue.\n  Senator Robb of Virginia wants to offer an amendment to this which \naddresses an issue that is probably one of the most important issues \nthat faces us in this election year. It is a question of whether we \nwill create a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. Senator Robb of \nVirginia wants a chance to offer that amendment and to debate it, a \nlimited debate, 1 hour on each side, and take a vote as to whether or \nnot we will change Medicare to provide a prescription drug benefit.\n  I invite all the Senators who are trying to stop this debate to take \na moment and go home, pick any constituency in your State, and ask them \nabout a prescription drug benefit. I found in Illinois that there are \nseniors across my State, disabled people across my State, and their \nfamilies, who understand the critical need for a prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  In the 1960s, when President Lyndon Johnson and Congress created the \nMedicare program, they provided health insurance for the elderly and \ndisabled that had never been there before. It has worked beautifully. \nFor 40 years, Medicare has provided quality health care for seniors and \nthe disabled. The net result of it is seniors live longer. There is no \nbetter test of the success of Medicare than the fact that seniors can \nlive longer and can be more independent in their lives.\n  My mother always used to say, for so many years, ``I just don't want \nto be a burden.'' How many parents say that to their kids? Medicare \nhelped my mom not be a burden to our family. She was able to have her \nown health insurance protection because of Medicare.\n  But there was a problem with Medicare and we know it now. Medicare \nhas no prescription drug benefit. So many seniors in my State tell \nstories of going to the doctor, feeling bad. The doctor says: I think \nthere is a prescription that can help you. The doctor hands the senior \ncitizen the prescription. The senior citizen puts it in his or her \npocket and says little, goes off to the pharmacy and says: How much \nwill it cost? Many of these seniors, on fixed incomes, find they cannot \nafford to buy the medicines they need to stay healthy. They have to \nmake choices between the food they need to survive and the medicine \nwhich the doctors have prescribed and recommended.\n  That should change. We have the power to change it. That is what \nCongress is all about. The President supports this change to create a \nprescription drug benefit so seniors across America will have some \nprotection when it comes to buying prescription drugs.\n  About a third of the seniors in our country already have some \nprotection. I think of the UAW retirees in Illinois and other union \nfamilies that have great retirement plans. They may spend $15 a month, \nas example, maximum, to get total drug coverage under their retirement \nplan. Those are the lucky people, one-third of the seniors.\n  Another third go out and try to buy supplemental health insurance \nthat has prescription drug benefits. Some of it is good, some of it is \njust plain awful. They pay a very high premium for it. These are the \npeople in the middle who have a little bit of coverage.\n  But a third of the seniors have no protection whatsoever. What they \npay for in prescription drugs comes right out of their pockets, right \nfrom their fixed income.\n  Senator Robb wants to offer an amendment this week on the floor of \nthe Senate for us to vote on a prescription drug benefit. Should the \nSenate not go on record on this issue? If you oppose it, vote against \nit. I support it and I want to vote for it. I want to be able to go \nback home to say to seniors: We have changed the Medicare program for \nthe better. We want to keep you healthy and keep you strong. We want \nyou to be able to pay for the drugs that your doctor recommends for \nyour good health.\n  That is one of the amendments the Republicans do not want us to vote \non. Why? They say they favor prescription drug benefits. Senator Robb \ngives them a chance to support one approach. I think it is within their \npower to offer their alternative to it. But they do not want to bring \nthat into the debate. They want to close down this debate so we do not \ngo after them. I think, frankly, that is a serious shortcoming.\n  When you take a look at the prices of prescription drugs that are \nused by seniors, you will find these prices are spiraling out of \ncontrol. In 1999, a recent analysis by Families USA found that prices \nof prescription drugs most commonly used by seniors increased at almost \ntwice the rate of inflation. The report looked at the 50 prescription \ndrugs most commonly used by the elderly and found that their prices had \ngone up more than twice the rate of inflation.\n  On average, the prices of these drugs increased by 3.9 percent \nbetween January 1999 and January 2000; 2.2 percent was the general \ninflationary increase. That is the average for the 50 drugs. Some of \nthem went up much more quickly. Their prices are out of control, beyond \nthe means of seniors who could not afford to pay for them. Moreover, \nthese increases are part of a trend, according to Families USA. Over \nthe past 6 years, the prices of prescription drugs most commonly used \nby seniors also increased by twice the rate of inflation.\n  I have met with pharmacists in Illinois who tell me the prices of \ndrugs used to go up once a year. Now they go up once a month. They \nunderstand seniors cannot keep up with it.\n  When we talk about a prescription drug benefit, it is not only to \nprovide protection under Medicare to pay for prescription drugs, it is \nalso to address the issue of pricing.\n  When I talk about the issue of price control in my State of Illinois, \na lot of people tense up: Wait a minute, the Government is going to get \ninvolved in price control? I am not sure I like that idea.\n  There is a natural skepticism, but I ask them to bear with me for a \nminute while I explain pricing mechanisms for drugs.\n  Right now in the United States of America, the drug companies that \nmake these prescription drugs bargain with insurance companies. The \ninsurance companies come to them and say: If you want the doctors in \nour insurance plan to prescribe these drugs, then you have to agree to \npricing controls so that your prices do not go up out of hand. That is \nbeing done today. That bargaining is taking place.\n  The Veterans Administration has said to the same drug companies: If \nyou want us to use your drugs in veterans' hospitals across America, \nagree to price controls so we can afford to pay for them, and the drug \ncompanies agree.\n  The Indian Health Service and the Public Health Service are the same.\n  We find the only group in America that does not have this bargaining \npower to say to drug companies, ``We want to have reasonable pricing,'' \nturns out to be the elderly and disabled people covered by Medicare. \nPeople on fixed incomes in tough situations lack the same bargaining \npower.\n  On the Democratic side, we are saying give to all Americans this \nbargaining power.\n  Let me tell my colleagues who else has bargaining power. If one \nhappens to live in a border State such as Montana or North Dakota, once \na month a lot of senior centers rent a bus. What do they do with that \nbus? They load it up with seniors and the prescriptions from their \ndoctors and drive over the border\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\ninto Canada. Why? Because the exact same prescription drug sold in the \nUnited States, made by the same company, is sold in Canada for half the \ncost as in the United States. Why? Why are the prices lower? Because \nthe Canadian Government is bargaining with the same American drug \ncompanies. They tell them: You cannot sell your drugs in the Canadian \nhealth care system unless you keep the prices under control. And the \ndrug companies said: So be it, that is what we will do. Mexico is the \nsame. Europe is the same.\n  If one looks at all these groups around the world, they come to \nrealize that only Medicare recipients in America are paying the very \nhighest prices for drugs. Everybody else gets a bargain.\n  Do my colleagues know who else gets a bargain when it comes to drugs? \nYour dog and your cat. Exactly the same drug sold for human usage is \nsold at a fraction of the cost to veterinarians--10 percent of the \ncost. I am a lot more concerned about a grandmother than I am about a \ngreat dane.\n  I would like to see us have a pricing policy that gives seniors a \nbreak instead of looking to overseas leaders and people in other \ncountries who come up with a way to keep the prices of drugs under \ncontrol.\n  What I have described in the last few minutes is a contour of a \ndebate that should take place on the floor of the Senate. Those \nSenators who disagree with me ought to have a chance to stand up and \nexplain their position. Senator Robb of Virginia, who believes, as I \ndo, that we need a prescription drug benefit, should be allowed to make \nhis position known. We ought to debate it and vote on it. The \nRepublican majority says no. When it comes to changes in the Tax Code, \ntake it or leave it; marriage tax penalty or else.\n\n  The final point I will make, as I see my colleagues come to the floor \nto join me in speaking--Senator Akaka from Hawaii will be speaking this \nmorning--is the fact that the amendment by Senator Schumer of New York \ngoes to the issue of expenses of college education. As I said earlier, \nthe President is right. I believe we should give families trying to put \nkids through college a helping hand.\n  Senator Schumer, who occupies the desk to my left, wants to offer \nthat amendment. He wants the Senate to go on record for or against the \nproposition that we ought to be giving a tax deduction for college \neducation expenses. Quite honestly, that is a good idea for America to \nprepare the next generation to compete in the global economy so that \nworking families have a chance to send their kids to the best schools, \nget the best education, and realize the American dream.\n  Is this worth a debate on the floor of the Senate? Is this worth a \nfew minutes of our time? As I look across this empty Chamber, I ask: \nWhat is it Senators could be doing that is more important than \nconsidering the college education expenses of our family members? It is \nworth the time, and it is worth the debate. I believe the Republican \nmajority is wrong when they say we cannot and should not debate these \namendments because we are too darn busy. I do not buy it. We are not \ntoo busy to focus on the problems about which American families really \ncare.\n  I hope this cloture vote at noon is a vote that repudiates the \nRepublican position and opens up this debate so we can deal with \nprescription drugs, so we can deal with reducing the national debt and \nstrengthening Social Security and Medicare, and so we can provide a \ndeduction for college education expenses. I hope we will have that \nopportunity this afternoon and for the remainder of the week. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I am sure we welcome everyone for ``Take \nYour Daughter to Work Day'' here in Washington.\n  I will take a few minutes to talk about the marriage penalty tax bill \nthat is before us. Speaking of daughters, this provision of the tax \ncode makes it difficult for young families who have daughters to be \ntreated fairly.\n  Before addressing the specifics of the bill before us, I must say \nthat I am a little disappointed in the lack of cooperation this year on \nthe floor. Each time we address an issue with a solution that is \ngenerally acceptable to most people, we find ourselves faced with all \nkinds of amendments, many of which have nothing to do with the subject \nwe are seeking to address, designed entirely to create political wedge \nissues rather than solutions. I suppose that is customary, perhaps, in \na Presidential election year, but it is too bad. It is too bad that \neach time we begin to talk about an issue that should be addressed by \nthis Congress, and indeed is generally agreed to by most Members of the \nSenate, we find it being used to bring up issues that are not relevant, \nnot a part of what is being discussed, but simply are used to delay, \nused as leverage, used to make an issue. I hope we can get by this \nresistance.\n  One of the items we will be addressing early next week is an \neducation bill, a broad education bill, elementary and secondary \neducation, one that most everyone in the country wants to see moved \nforward. Education is probably one of the principals issue with which \nall of us are concerned. Yet I predict that we will find next week all \nkinds of irrelevant amendments will be added to seek to confuse and \ndelay the passage of legislation.\n  I hope that is not the case. I hope it is not the case with what I \nthink is a very important issue, the marriage penalty. All of us are \nconcerned about our tax system, concerned about how complex the tax \ncode is. Certainly right after April 15, we are all very aware of how \nexcessively complicated this system has become, designed to affect \nbehavior as much as it is to collect revenue.\n  One of the things we ought to consider, as we seek to simplify taxes, \nis fairness. That is the situation we face today with regard to the \nmarriage penalty. The Federal Government penalizes couples simply for \nbeing married. Two people earning this amount of money jointly, \nunmarried, become married and pay more taxes on the\n\n[[Page S2960]]\n\nsame amount of income. That is not fair. That is what we ought to be \ndealing with, the fairness issue.\n  Last year, 43 percent of married taxpayers, 22 million couples, paid \nan average of $1,500 more in taxes than they would have paid had they \nnot been a married couple. In my State of Wyoming, 45,000 couples were \naffected by this tax situation, a high percentage of our population. \nMarriage penalty relief is middle-class tax relief. We always hear it \nis for the rich. This isn't for the rich. This is for middle-class \npeople who become married, as we urge people to do and then, indeed, \nthey are assessed a penalty. Middle-income families are the hardest \nhit.\n  What does marriage penalty relief mean to families? Fifteen hundred \ndollars for families would mean a semester of community college, 4 \nmonths of car payments, clothes for the kids, a family vacation, a home \ncomputer, several months of health insurance premiums, or contributions \nto an IRA or a savings program, which we encourage people to do.\n  This country finds itself, thankfully, with more than adequate \nfunding for Federal programs, even after we have ensured that Social \nSecurity is not used for operating funds. This prosperity is due in \npart to the Republican Congress' ability to control spending. Now, for \nthe first time in over 40 years, we have an opportunity to begin to pay \ndown the Federal debt, while also providing tax relief, because of the \nexcess money coming into Washington.\n\n  You, the people of this country, must decide if this is the \nappropriate course to take. Do you want to spend more money? Do you \nwant to have more Government involvement, more Government regulation, \nor should we give this money back to the taxpayers who have paid it in? \nIt is your money after all. This bill is an opportunity to do that. If \nyour intention is to control the size of the Federal Government, tax \nrelief is a very good idea. If you keep the money, I guarantee it will \nbe spent on expanding the size of Government.\n  An editorial that ran a while ago in the Wyoming Tribune-Eagle called \non Congress to do something about the marriage penalty. I will a small \nportion from it:\n\n       While the tax system is unfair, Congress's lack of action \n     is even more unjust. Members know there is a problem but \n     refuse to act. That is shameful.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire editorial be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THOMAS. I could not agree more with that sentiment. It sums it up \nvery well. This vote will clearly highlight those who want to do \nsomething about the marriage penalty, who want to do something about \ntax simplification, tax fairness, and those who do not. We will see \nthose who want to use this legislation simply to introduce extraneous \nissues, knowing that those issues will not be resolved, but, rather, \ncan be used as issues in the political campaign.\n  Marriage should be a sacred event, not a taxable one. We have a bill \nthat will do something about that penalty. I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport the cloture motion so we can move forward and implement this \nmuch needed tax relief.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                            Marriage penalty\n\n\n               Will Congress finally correct this wrong?\n\n       In 1996, 21 million American families paid an average of \n     nearly $1,400 in marriage tax penalties. Congress would be \n     remiss if it allows this assault on married couples' \n     pocketbooks to continue.\n       There are many members of Congress who say the country's \n     complicated and progressive tax structure is the primary \n     cause of the marriage penalty. Since marriage combines two \n     tax units into one, a couple's combined income means their \n     joint liability is higher that the sum of what their \n     individual tax bills would be if they filed as single.\n       While the tax system is unfair, Congress' lack of action is \n     even more unjust. Members know there is a problem, but refuse \n     to act. That is shameful.\n       And in this case, their talk is not cheap.\n       Throughout America's history, policymakers have attempted \n     to discourage certain behaviors by taxing them. So-called \n     ``sin taxes'' are levied on everything from cigarettes to \n     gasoline.\n       While people of good conscience may disagree on the \n     morality and efficacy of using the tax code to discourage \n     various behaviors, virtually no one disputes taxes are a \n     disincentive. It is odd, then, that the federal income tax \n     code effectively taxes marriage--and thereby discourages it.\n       That's a shame. Some couples choose cohabitation over \n     marriage because of this tax penalty; others postpone \n     marriage until later tax years. Some have even divorced \n     because of the penalty, and others speed up their divorces to \n     save money. These practices denigrate marriage and normalize \n     non-marital relationships.\n       The marriage penalty continues to be one of the most \n     discriminatory taxes. And while $1,400 a year may not sound \n     like a lot to some, over the years it can add up. A couple \n     married for 50 years would end up paying $70,000 in \n     additional taxes.\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates the average \n     annual penalty of $1,400 could cover a few mortgage payments, \n     a down payment on a car, a needed vacation or it could be \n     invested or put into a savings and earn dividends and \n     interest.\n       Because of the way the tax code is structured, only \n     eliminating the current system will end the marriage penalty. \n     However, a stopgap method is needed.\n       The most promising option is House Resolution 6. Under this \n     proposal, the standard deduction and bracket breakpoints for \n     married couples filing jointly would be made twice what they \n     are for single filers. This proposal should be relatively \n     simple to implement and would help toward the elimination of \n     the marriage penalty.\n       Equality under the law is fundamental to America. By \n     treating married couples inequitably, Congress is allowing \n     the tax code to make a mockery of this ideal.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Texas, \nMrs. Hutchison, has reserved 30 minutes. I ask unanimous consent to use \na portion of that time to speak on the issue of the marriage tax \npenalty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address a number of issues \nthat have been raised recently on the marriage tax penalty elimination \nbill. We will be voting at noon on a cloture motion. We have the \nopportunity at noon to vote on whether or not to proceed to this issue. \nWe have the opportunity then, as well, to consider any relevant \namendments.\n  That needs to be made perfectly clear. Amendments are in order after \nthe cloture motion. The only issue is whether or not they pertain to or \nare germane to marriage tax penalty relief. All of those will be open \nand debatable. If there is a Democratic alternative they think is \nbetter on the marriage tax penalty, that is relevant, we can deal with \nthat. We will debate it. We can vote on it, if we can finally get to \ncloture on this issue.\n  We need to be very clear that there is no blockage on amendments \nrelevant to the marriage tax penalty. All relevant ones will be and can \nbe considered after the cloture vote so we can move forward with this \nissue. What would not be relevant is nongermane issues, issues outside \nof the point of the marriage tax penalty.\n  There have been raised on the floor this morning several inaccuracies \nI wish to clear up. There is a statement going around that somehow 60 \npercent of the tax relief in this bill doesn't deal with the marriage \ntax penalty. I disagree with that. One hundred percent of the relief \nproposed in this bill goes to married couples. I don't know who they \nare claiming the 60 percent goes to, but 100 percent of this relief \ngoes to married couples. I will make it very clear: It isn't 60 percent \nof this going to businesses or 60 percent of it going to farmers or 60 \npercent of it going to some other category; 100 percent goes to married \ncouples. That is indisputable. I want to talk about the nature of the \nbill so people can get that fresh in their minds. We talked about it 2 \nweeks ago, but some time has passed. I will talk about what our bill \ndoes.\n\n  Our bill eliminates the marriage tax penalty in the standard \ndeduction. Here are the nuts and bolts. The standard deduction this \nyear for a single taxpayer is $4,400. However, for a married couple \nfiling jointly, the standard deduction is $7,350. It should be $8,800, \nif it is fair. What we are doing is making it fair. Let's make it \n$8,800.\n  Second, our bill widens the 15-percent tax bracket. Under current \nlaw, the 15-percent bracket for a single taxpayer ends at an income \nthreshold of $26,250. But for married couples, the bracket is not \ndouble; it ends at $43,850. It should end, if it were fair, at $52,500. \nThat is what our bill does. It moves it for the double filing couple to \n$52,500. That is\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\nfair. That is something that should be in the Tax Code and should be \nallowed.\n  Third, our bill applies that same principle of doubling that income \nbracket on the 15-percent bracket, and we provide that into the 28-\npercent bracket as well.\n  Fourth, our bill increases the phaseout range for the earned-income \ntax credit; that is, on the EITC, there is a marriage tax penalty \nthere. With the earned-income tax credit, you don't double the benefits \nfor a married couple. Clearly, we should. Low-income families with \nchildren can incur a significant penalty, and they do, because of the \ncurrent limits on the EITC. If both spouses work, phaseout of the EITC \non the basis of combined income can lead to the loss of some or all of \nthe EITC benefits to which they would be entitled as singles. Our bill \nworks to begin fixing this problem. The Senate Finance Committee \nproposal that comes out would do that.\n  Finally, our bill would permanently extend the provision that allows \nthe personal nonrefundable credits to offset both the regular tax and \nthe minimum tax. It is important that American families receive the \nfull benefit of the tax cuts they were promised. This important change \nwill allow America's families to maintain the $500 per child tax \ncredit, HOPE scholarship, adoption credit, and many others.\n  So those are the nuts and bolts of the bill. That is where the tax is \noccurring. That is where we would alleviate the marriage tax penalty. \nThat is it. That is what the bill is about. So the notion that it \ndoesn't go to married couples is erroneous. It benefits a lot of \npeople. Currently, the marriage tax penalty is on about 25 million \nAmerican married couples. I have shown this chart previously. In \nKansas, we have over 259,000 couples paying a marriage tax penalty. On \naverage, as the Senator from Wyoming noted, it is about $1,400 per \ncouple.\n  We have, I think, a lot of unfairness in the Tax Code. Typically, we \ntry to benefit things that we think are helpful in the Tax Code and tax \nthings that we think are harmful. If that is the typical analysis, then \nin this situation we must believe that marriage is harmful because we \nare taxing it. But the record is far different on that. Marriage is a \ngood thing. It is a central value-creating institution for the American \nfamily. Anybody for family values ought to be for marriage. It is \naround that central unit that the family builds the values it shares \nwith the children, and then later with the grandchildren and great \ngrandchildren; that emanates from that central unit. This is a very \ngood thing, a very positive thing.\n\n  The institution of marriage has been under attack in recent years. \nThe number of people getting married has gone down substantially. A \nUniversity of Rutgers study points this out. I want to quote it so that \npeople have that information:\n\n       According to a recent study, marriage is in a state of \n     decline from 1960 to 1996. The annual number of marriages per \n     thousand adult women declined by almost 43 percent.\n\n  I guess our policy is getting through. By taxing something we \napparently want less of, we are succeeding. That is, in my estimation, \nbad public policy. If you look at the situation around which children \ndo the best overall, it is in that stable environment, with two parents \nin a long-lasting relationship of marriage. That is where children do \nbest. That is not to say that a number of single parents don't struggle \nheroically to raise good children. They do. But, overall, the \nstatistics are that they do best in a two-parent household.\n  As a matter of fact, the statistics are that in a single-parent \nhousehold--and many struggle greatly to raise good children, and they \ndo a good job, but the overall statistics are very troubling in single-\nparent households where children are twice as likely to be involved in \na crime, twice as likely to drop out of school, twice as likely to be \nabused, and twice as likely to abuse alcohol or drugs.\n  This is just not a good situation. That is not to say that many \nsingle parents don't struggle heroically to do a good job. Still, we as \npublic policymakers should not tax marriage so that we have less of it. \nWe should be providing relief to married couples.\n  I want to address this issue some have raised of a marriage bonus \nbuilt into this package. I think you could justify, on public policy \ngrounds, actually doing that, but I don't think it is here. I think you \ncan justify that as well. Our bill provides marriage tax penalty relief \nto working American families by doubling the lowest two tax brackets \nand standard deductions, and also in the EITC bracket. Our bill also \ntreats all married couples the same, whether both spouses work outside \nthe home or just one. That seems to be fair as well.\n  The Democrat alternative does not treat all married couples the same. \nIn fact, by giving preferences only to dual-earner families through \nchoice of filing, that creates a homemaker penalty. For a spouse that \ndecides to stay home and do the hard work of taking care of children, \nparents, or others, they create a penalty in that situation. The other \nalternative--the Democrats' alternative--would make families with one \nearner and one who stays at home to take care of children or elderly \nparents pay higher taxes than families with the same household income \nas two-earner families. Why should we discriminate against one-earner \nfamilies? Why would we want a Tax Code that penalizes families because \none of the spouses chooses the hard work of the household over the role \nof the breadwinner? Believe me, it is hard work. I don't think it is a \nsituation that we would want to enshrine within our Tax Code because, \nagain, what we do by taxing it is penalizing them and saying we want \nless of it.\n  Do we want to send the message across the country that we want less \nparents involved in raising their children? Clearly, the signal we are \ngetting across America reflects that we want more parents involved and \nmore parental involvement with children. We need more time involved \nwith the family, not less. So we don't want to enshrine in the Tax Code \na situation where we are actually saying we don't want more parents \ninvolved and having more time with their children. We should be sending \nthe opposite signal across this Nation. The alternative the Democrats \nhave put forth says we don't think we should have as much parental \ninvolvement. I think that is a bad way to go.\n  This is a simple bill. We are trying to address what the President \nsays he wants. He wants to deal with the marriage tax penalty. We are \ntrying to address that. We are trying to send him a bill that deals \nwith the marriage tax penalty. Let's take all relevant amendments on \nthe marriage tax penalty. We will take those, come what may, and get \nthis voted out and get it on over to the President. The House has \npassed it. We are here and we are ready to vote on it. We will have the \ncloture motion vote at noon. I urge my colleagues, let's get on to this \nissue and go ahead and present it.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Texas had 30 minutes reserved for \nthis issue. I don't know if the Senator from Oklahoma wants to speak on \nthat time. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma on the time \nof the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Texas \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes in total, and this would \nleave the Senator from Texas 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will speak in morning business for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are several here on the floor who \nwould like to speak to the cloture motion. We don't have a lot of time. \nI would like to inquire of the assistant majority leader if he would \nagree to extending the time for the vote, say, another half hour at \nleast.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas is agreeable to \nyielding 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will modify my request and take 5 \nminutes of the time of the Senator from Texas. I have no objection. The \nmajority leader and the minority leader will probably come out to make \nthe decision on extending the time for the vote. Some people have \nluncheon conflicts, and so on. I have no objection to it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I make that request, if the leaders will come out on the \nfloor to make an adjustment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object at this point.\n\n[[Page S2962]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Montana that I \nhave no objection, as soon as we run it by the two leaders. If they \nwant to postpone the vote for 30 minutes, fine.\n  For the information of our colleagues, we have a vote scheduled at 12 \no'clock. I think some people are trying to go to luncheons and \ndifferent things. For scheduling purposes, it may be postponed until \n12:30. That is perfectly fine with this Senator.\n  I want to make my comments on the marriage tax penalty.\n  I compliment my colleagues from Texas and Kansas for their leadership \nin trying to eliminate the so-called marriage tax penalty. We have a \nchance to do that. We have to get to the amendment. Some people do not \nwant to get to the amendment. If we get to the amendment, we can have \nrelevant amendments.\n  I understand some people have different ideas of different ways of \neliminating the marriage tax penalty. Fine. Let's consider them and \nvote on them.\n  I think the way the Finance Committee--I happen to be a member of the \nFinance Committee--reported it out is the preferred way to do it.\n  Very simply put, we have a tax bracket right now that is very \ncomplicated. But we have different brackets. We have a zero bracket, a \n15-percent bracket, a 28-percent bracket, a 31-percent bracket, and a \n39.6-percent bracket. Thanks to President Clinton and Vice President \nGore, the rates have gone up.\n  People shouldn't be penalized because one spouse works or two spouses \nwork. They shouldn't be penalized under the system because they are \nmarried.\n  Right now you can have one spouse working, say making $40,000 and in \nthe 28-percent bracket. Another spouse is making $20,000 and presumably \nwould be in the 15-percent bracket, but right now under current law \nthat $20,000 by one spouse is taxed at the 28-percent tax bracket. It \ncosts them about $1,400. That is unfair. We eliminate that in our \nproposal.\n\n  We double the 15-percent tax bracket. Individuals making up to \n$26,000 pay 15 percent in tax. We double that. We say if it is 15 \npercent in taxes at $26,000, let's double that for couples and make \nthat $52,000. That will save them about $1,100. We double the \nexemption. The exemption right now is $4,400. We say double that. That \nshould be $8,800. We double it. That saves a couple hundred dollars.\n  That is where we get the marriage tax penalty figure of about $1,400 \nfor a couple, if their income combined is $52,000. Let's do that.\n  I have heard President Clinton say he wants to get rid of it. But his \nproposal doesn't get rid of it. It may be good rhetorically. It may be \ngood on the campaign stump. But there is no substance.\n  The President does not eliminate the marriage tax penalty. As a \nmatter of fact, the President doesn't cut taxes. He doesn't want tax \ncuts. I respect that.\n  He has a tax increase for this year. President Clinton's budget \nproposal increases taxes by a net of $9 billion in the year 2001. Over \n5 years, the President has a proposal for a net tax cut of a measly $5 \nbillion. Keep in mind that the Federal Government is going to be taking \nin about $10 trillion over that same 5 years. But he would only allow \nfor such a small percentage that it won't even show up.\n  We are trying to give tax cuts to taxpayers who are married and \npenalized under the system. We do that basically by doubling the 15-\npercent bracket and eventually doubling the 28-percent bracket. One \nworking spouse that makes a lot less is not thrown into a higher \nbracket.\n  We also don't penalize the stay-at-home spouse. We basically double \nthe individual brackets. We do that right away so we don't discriminate \nagainst somebody if they make a sacrifice and say they want to stay \nhome with the kids. If this is a tax bracket for individuals, we say \ndouble it for couples.\n  It is the fairest system you can come up with, and it is tax relief \nfor American couples. It is significantly greater than that proposed by \nthe President.\n  But I hope this Congress will pass it in a bipartisan fashion as we \ndid by eliminating the Social Security earnings penalty. We passed that \nearlier by an overwhelming margin. The President signed it. Some of us \nhad been pushing that for years.\n  Some of us for years have been pushing to eliminate the marriage tax \npenalty. We have a chance to do that. We need to have our colleagues \nvote in favor of the cloture motion at 12 noon or at 12:30 in order to \nmake that happen. I urge my colleagues to do it.\n  If colleagues have alternative ways of dealing with the marriage tax \npenalty they wish to have considered, I think we are happy to vote on \nthose.\n  I thank my colleague from Kansas for yielding me time, and I thank my \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, for her leadership.\n  I hope today within the hour we will make giant strides and \nultimately pass it before we leave this Congress. I hope in the next \nday or two we pass a bill that would eliminate the earnings marriage \ntax penalty on married couples.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding me 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time remains for the Senator \nfrom Texas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes remain on the time of the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will use 5 minutes of that and \nreserve 5 minutes of that time for the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I want to note a couple of things as we wrap this \ndebate up, have a chance to vote on the marriage tax penalty in \nAmerica, send that bill to conference, and ultimately to the President.\n  There is a fundamental principle that I talked about previously which \nexists and has worked repeatedly in this country. If you tax something, \nyou will get less of it. If you subsidize it, you will get more of it. \nWe have been taxing marriage, and we are getting less of it.\n  The Rutgers study that I cited shows a 43-percent decline in marriage \nin the period between 1960 and 1996. At the same time, fewer adults are \ngetting married. Far more young Americans are cohabitating. During that \nsame period of time, cohabitation went up 1,000 percent. We subsidize \nthat side of it. We tax getting married.\n  When marriage as an institution breaks down, the children suffer.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kansas yield? I \nwant to make a statement that will take no more than 10 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield from my leader time 10 minutes to \nthe distinguished Senator from Montana and 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair makes that note.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  When the institution of marriage breaks down and we tax it, we cause \nit to break down further. The children do suffer.\n  A number of single parents struggle heroically and do a good job of \nraising their children. But the best institution to raise those \nchildren in and to build family values that we have all talked about is \nthe institution of marriage. That is the best place; the values emanate \nfrom that.\n  The past few decades have seen a huge decrease in that institution, \nas the study I have just cited from Rutgers points out. We are taxing \nmarriage across the country. So we are getting what we are paying for--\nfewer marriages. That is happening. We are taxing over 259,000 of them \nin the State of Kansas. That is not good for the children.\n  The past few decades have seen the problems befall our children \nbecause of that overall situation, the well-being of children in \nvirtually all areas of life--physiologically, psychologically, health-\nwise, sociologically, academic achievement, and the likelihood of \nsuffering physically.\n  They are better off in that stable, two-parent family--not to say \nthat a number of single parents don't do a very good job. They do. \nOverall, statistically, they are still better off in that two-parent, \nstable family.\n\n[[Page S2963]]\n\n  As a couple, Gary and Karla Gipson, wrote to me and stated:\n\n       If they are really interested in putting children first, \n     then why do we in this country penalize the institution of \n     marriage where kids do best? When parents are truly committed \n     to each other through their marriage vows, their children's \n     outcomes are enhanced.\n\n  That is supported by studies. It is supported by, frankly, common \nsense. The marriage tax penalty to an extent is a penalty that our \nchildren have to bear. It is a penalty on children. That is \nunacceptable. Newlyweds face enough challenge without paying punitive \ndamages in the form of the marriage tax. The last thing the Federal \nGovernment should do is penalize the institution that is the foundation \nof a civil society.\n\n  I am hopeful, as this bill is considered on the floor, we will be \nable to have a reasoned debate and we will be able to work across the \naisle in a bipartisan fashion to achieve marriage penalty relief for \nmillions of Americans who are adversely affected by this provision of \nour Tax Code. We can have that debate on the issue.\n  There is more to do. The marriage penalty is embedded many places, \nand we could continue, and should continue, to work on that. But, \noverall, if we are truly interested in the health of our children, if \nwe are truly interested in trying to instill and support family values \nacross this country, if we truly do support that, I do not know how you \nget around the situation of saying, by taxing marriage, we are going to \nget less of it, and that is a bad thing for our children.\n  Let's look at this for what it does to the children. Let's provide \nthat support and help to that married couple. Let's provide the support \nand help, whether it is a two-wage-earner or a single-earner family \nwhere one chooses to do the hard work of taking care of the children or \nan aging parent or a relative. Why would we penalize that situation?\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion \nand let's get on to this bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of the 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there have been a lot of statements on the \nfloor, a lot of words. A lot is accurate and a lot is inaccurate. I \nwould like to set things straight on what it is we are voting and on \nwhat it is we are not voting.\n  It has been said here that 100 percent of the benefit in the majority \nbill goes to married couples. That is true. But this is not a marriage \nrelief bill we are talking about today. Marriage has its own rewards. \nWe are not talking about a marriage relief bill. We are talking about a \nmarriage tax penalty relief bill.\n  The proposition offered by the minority Members, all Democrats on the \nFinance Committee, which is the amendment we hope can be offered to \nsolve the marriage tax penalty, is a marriage tax penalty relief bill. \nIt is not a marriage relief bill. It is a marriage tax penalty relief \nbill.\n  What I am saying is 60 percent of the benefit in the majority bill \ngoes to people who have no penalty; 100 percent of the provisions in \nthe Democratic bill go to those who are in a penalty position.\n  Let's remember, a little over half of Americans are in a marriage \nbonus situation; that is, as a consequence of marriage, they pay less \ntaxes than they would pay if they filed singly; whereas a little less \nthan half of Americans are in a penalty position; that is, they pay \nmore taxes as a consequence of being married compared to what they \nwould pay if they were married filing singly. So we are addressing the \nmarriage tax penalty by focusing our benefits on the marriage tax \npenalty, not on marriage relief, which is what the majority is talking \nabout--marriage relief.\n  They must think marriage is a bad thing. They want to give relief to \nmarried couples. We are giving relief to married couples who suffered a \ntax penalty. Marriage has its own rewards. I am surprised, frankly, the \nmajority would think that, by implication, they have to give their \nbenefits for the sake of marriage.\n\n  The proposal the Democrats are offering totally addresses marriage. \nIt also totally addresses the marriage tax penalties. There are 65 \nprovisions in the code today which cause a marriage tax penalty \nsituation--65. The Democratic provision addresses all of them, all 65, \nso there will be no penalty consequence under the Democratic bill \nbecause of marriage. How many of the 65 penalties in the code do you \nthink the majority bill addresses: 5? 10? 15? 20? 65? No. Three, only \n3, only 3 out of the 65.\n  One of them is Social Security differentiation. That is the penalty a \ncouple suffers as a consequence of the Social Security tax provisions \naffected by marriage. There are 61 others. There is a huge difference.\n  On the one hand, you have the majority that does not want to address \nthe other 62 provisions of the code which cause a marriage tax penalty, \nwhereas our bill addresses all of them. How does it address all of \nthem? By saying to the taxpayers who are married: You have a choice. \nYour choice is this: You file singly or you file jointly. It is your \nchoice. Whichever results in the lowest taxes, that is what you pay.\n  So it has the benefit not only of addressing all the 65 provisions of \nthe code--theirs addresses only 3 provisions of the code--but the \nDemocratic provision, the minority provision, also has the benefit of \nchoice, allowing taxpayers to choose what they want to do. Not theirs. \nYou cannot choose in theirs; this is the way it is. You only get to \naddress 3 out of the 65 on theirs.\n  What else is going on here? The majority party wants a vote on a \nparliamentary procedure so many amendments--or few amendments--that \nboth sides want to offer could not be offered. They are afraid of these \namendments. They are afraid of an amendment to provide prescription \ndrug benefits for senior citizens. They are afraid of an amendment to \ndeal with Medicaid. They are afraid of an amendment which will help \nAmericans provide education for their children. They are afraid of \namendments on their side. They are afraid of an amendment, perhaps, \ndealing with estate taxes. They are afraid of that. They do not want \namendments. They are afraid of them.\n  Why are they afraid of them? I don't know why they are afraid of \nthem. They don't want the Senate to vote on these amendments, \namendments which are of very great concern to a vast majority of \nAmerican citizens. Frankly, that is why we are here, to try to serve \nthe public interest by offering and voting on amendments which affect \nAmerican citizens.\n  The problem, I might say, is this. There are maybe 80 legislative \ndays this year. That is all. We have not been voting Mondays or \nFridays, so there are probably about 50, that is all, remaining this \nyear--50 days, maybe, we will have votes. If we cannot offer amendments \nthat the American people want us to discuss and debate on this bill, \nwhen in the world are we going to have time to do it with only 50 days \nleft?\n  Basically, the majority does not want a vote on issues that concern \nthe American people. They also do not want a vote on a better idea on \nhow to address the marriage penalty because technically, if cloture is \ninvoked, the amendment offered by Senator Moynihan, which is the \nDemocratic amendment--a better idea--will not be in order. It will not \nbe in order to address all the 65 provisions of the code called the \nmarriage tax penalty. It will not be in order for Americans to choose; \nthat is, choose to file jointly or separately. An amendment will not be \nin order to allow Americans to choose.\n\n  It is no wonder all this smokescreen is being put up over here, \nplaying politics, lots of folderol. Cut right down to the bone, the \nissue is, Should we be able to vote for a better way to address the \nmarriage penalty or not? I think we should; therefore, that amendment \nshould be in order. It will not be in order if cloture is invoked. They \nknow that. They don't want us to be able to vote on that. In addition, \nthey don't want a vote on other amendments, such as education and \nprescription drug benefits, which are a good idea. They don't want a \nvote on those.\n  That is all this comes down to. I say let's vote on a couple of these \namendments. Then let's vote on which of the two marriage tax penalty \nprovisions is best. We will be doing the American people a great \nservice by solving the marriage tax penalty problem.\n\n[[Page S2964]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Montana and \ncommend the reasoning he has presented to this body.

Mr. President, on the issue of education, the elementary \nand secondary education legislation will be coming to the floor in the \nnext several days, according to what the leader has announced. I wish \nto indicate, once again, the position of those of us on this side of \nthe aisle and what we tried to do in the markup of the education \nproposal several weeks ago.\n  We attempted to follow some of the rather radical, but significant, \nchanges we have seen as a result of enhanced and improved academic \nachievement at the local level. We want some guarantees because of the \nscarce resources available to us.\n  As my colleagues know, 7 cents out of every dollar for education \ncomes from the Federal Government. We are strongly committed on this \nside of the aisle to building on tried and tested programs that are \nindicating enhanced achievement for the children of this country, \nrather than the alternative, which is a block grant program our \nRepublican friends have supported.\n  We will have a chance to go through their legislation. It is S. 2. \nInstead of providing targeted resources to local communities for \nimproving teacher quality, smaller class size, afterschool programs, \nthe majority, in this lengthy legislation, says it should be ``. . . \ndetermination of State participation, the Governor of a State''--not \nthe local parents, not the local school board, not the local community, \nbut the Governor of a State--``in consultation with the individual body \nresponsible for the education of the State shall determine. . . .'' We \nwill go through the legislation next week,\n  Their legislation says 5 years later there is going to be an \naccounting. We, on this side, do not want to wait 5 years to find out \nif their particular block grant program has been effective. All one has \nto do is go back to 1965 to 1969. We provided block grants to the \nStates under the title I program. We will go through some of this \nduring the debate. The State of Tennessee--all States have indicated \nhow they utilized the money--purchased 18 portable swimming pools in \nthe summer of 1966 at $3,500 each. The justification was that funds \noriginally approved for a summer remedial program would not be spent \nand the money would otherwise go unspent. There is the buying of \nfootball uniforms in some States, and the buying of musical instruments \nfor groups not even affected by title I. We will go through what has \nhappened historically with the block grant program.\n  Our programs are targeted to make sure we have a well-trained teacher \nin every classroom. We believe the overwhelming majority of American \nparents understand that and want that. We want to make sure we have \nsmaller class sizes. We do not need more studies. We have had all the \nstudies, and we have the results. We understand, as Senator Murray has \npointed out so effectively, that smaller class sizes result in enhanced \nacademic achievement. We believe, with the scarce resources available, \nwe ought to invest in a guaranteed program with guaranteed results of \nhaving the smaller class sizes. We believe in afterschool programs \nwhich are so important.\n  Modern, safer schools: Our schools are too crowded, out-of-date, and \ndilapidated. We owe it to our children to modernize our schools--to \nhave more classrooms, to provide modern teaching facilities, and to \nprovide our children with a safe and orderly learning environment.\n  Accountability for results: We should hold schools accountable for \nresults. We don't want to write a blank check to the states. We want \nfederal education dollars to go to proven programs that will bring \nabout real change. And we should require schools to use scarce federal \ndollars to bring about that change.\n  A greater role for parents: Children and schools need the support of \nparents. Senator Reed will propose an amendment to give parents a \nstronger role in the education of their children and in the decision-\nmaking in their local schools.\n  Gun safety: We should give gun safety top priority when it comes to \nour children and our schools. Child safety locks on guns should be a \nrequirement. And we should close the gun show loophole that has proven \nso deadly to our children and our schools. The Senate passed such \nlegislation last year, but it languishes in conference. We should act \nagain--this time in earnest--to protect our children and our schools \nfrom gun violence.\n  Republican colleagues will talk about change--they talk about having \nbetter teachers and safer schools. But if you read their bill, they \njust perpetuate the status quo. All they want to do is give more money \nto the governors and the states to use for their favorite programs. \nThere is no guarantee under the Republican bill that your local school \nwill spend the money on smaller classes, safer schools, or better \nteachers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Roth and Senator \nGrassley for helping us write a very good bill that will give relief to \n21 million married couples in this country; 42 million people will \nreceive a benefit.\n  When I go through my State and a policeman comes up to me and says, \n``I cannot believe how much more I am paying since I got married,'' or \na schoolteacher or a county clerk or a sheriff's deputy, I wonder what \ncould we be thinking. This is not a tax cut; this is a tax correction. \nTwenty-one million American couples are paying a penalty only because \nthey are married. That is not right.\n  The President of the United States, in his March 11 radio address, \naddressed six tax cuts he thinks would be a good idea. Two of those are \nin the bill we are voting on today. He said:\n\n       . . . a tax relief to reduce the marriage penalty, tax \n     relief to reward work and family with an expanded earned \n     income tax credit.\n\n  Of the six tax cuts he says he favors, two are in the bill on which \nwe will be voting. One has to ask the fair question: Why would so many \nof the Democrats refuse to let us bring up the bill that addresses \nexactly what the President has asked us to send to him?\n  We sent him marriage tax penalty relief last year. He vetoed the \nbill. He said there was too much in it; there were too many other tax \ncuts. I happen to believe there is not a tax cut that I do not like \nbecause I think hard-working Americans deserve more relief. We are only \nusing part of the income tax withholding surplus here, not Social \nSecurity surplus, not even all of the income tax withholding surplus. \nWe are only using part to give the money back to the people who earned \nit.\n\n  Nevertheless, the President said it was too much. So we said: All \nright, we are going to send him smaller tax cut bills just as he \nrequested.\n  We sent him one which removed that terrible added tax on Social \nSecurity recipients between the age of 65 and 70 who want to work and \nmake more than $17,000. That is gone. We passed the bill, we sent it to \nthe President, and he signed it.\n  There must be a real problem on the Democratic side, and I quote the \ndistinguished leader of the Democratic Party in the Senate in Reuters \non April 13 of this year when he said:\n\n       I think the Republican bill is a marriage penalty relief \n     bill in name only. It's a Trojan horse for the other risky \n     tax schemes they have that have been proposed so far this \n     year.\n\n  To what risky tax schemes could he be referring? Was it the Social \nSecurity earnings tests we eliminated for\n\n[[Page S2965]]\n\npeople who are over 65 and want to work? Was it the education tax \ncredits we have passed and is now in conference to help parents by \ngiving a credit for their children's education starting in kindergarten \nand going all the way through college? Or is it the small business tax \ncredits he thinks are risky tax schemes to help our small business \npeople create new jobs to keep our economy going?\n  I do not think one can make the case that this is a risky tax scheme. \nThis is marriage penalty relief for 21 million American couples who are \npaying the tax only because they got married. In addition, we add more \npeople who will get the earned-income tax credit because they are \ncoming off welfare and are working and feeling good about themselves. \nWe want to encourage them to do that. A family of four making $31,000--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will still get an earned-income tax credit when they \nmake $33,000.\n  There is no excuse. It is time to let us take up amendments on this \nbill and vote marriage tax penalty relief for the hard-working people \nof our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is important to be clear what this \nvote is about--and what it is not about. This vote is not a test of who \nsupports eliminating the marriage penalty. Virtually every member of \nthis Senate agrees: Married couples who work hard just to make ends \nmeet should not have to pay more in taxes simply because they are \nmarried.\n  If the plan proposed by our Republican colleagues only eliminated the \nmarriage penalty in a way that was fair and responsible, I would vote \nfor it. And so, I suspect, would every other Democrat in this Senate.\n  But the Republican plan goes far beyond fixing the marriage penalty. \nSixty percent of their $248 billion plan has nothing to do with fixing \nthe marriage penalty. That is what this vote is about. This vote is \nabout the tens of billions of dollars of tax cuts hidden in this bill \nthat have nothing to do with eliminating the marriage penalty on \nworking families.\n  In addition to the $99 billion it costs to address the marriage \npenalty, the Republican plan includes another $149 billion for tax \nbreaks that have nothing to do with the marriage penalty. Most of these \nnew tax breaks would go to those who arguably need it least--including \ncouples at the top of the income ladder who already get a marriage \nbonus!\n  We believe there is a better use for that additional $149 billion: \ncreating an affordable, voluntary Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nThat is what this vote is about: Should we use the extra tens of \nbillions of dollars in this bill to create more tax breaks that \ndisproportionately benefit upper income Americans--people who, in many \ncases, get a marriage bonus? Or should we eliminate the marriage \npenalty for couples who need a tax cut, and use the other $149 billion \nin this bill to create a Medicare prescription drug benefit?\n  What is really going on here? What are Republicans afraid of? \nEvidently, they are absolutely terrified of voting on our prescription \ndrug amendment. They seem to recoil at even the slightest mention of \nthose two words.\n  Our Republican colleagues filed cloture on this bill before debate \nhad even begun. They hope to rig the procedural situation so as to \nshield their faulty bill from public scrutiny and avoid voting on \nprescription drugs.\n  Senator Lott has said our amendments are ``ridiculous.'' He has said \nit would give him great joy to vote against them. We want to make his \nday. We want to give him that chance. That is why I once again will \nvote against cloture on this bill. If Republicans really think our \namendments are ``ridiculous,'' they can vote against them. If they \nthink that adding a prescription drug benefit is a ``poison pill,'' \nthey can vote against it.

On this vote, the yeas are 51, the nays are \n44. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I regret that this vote had to have been \ntaken. I have made it clear from the very beginning that my hope is we \ncan find some way to compromise. We have thought we have already \ncompromised extensively. We have limited the number of amendments. We \nhave limited the time on those amendments. We are now even prepared to \nallow second degrees so long as we get a vote. That is the regular \norder.\n  We believe, as strongly as we want to resolve the marriage tax \npenalty, that having the opportunity to offer a better alternative is \nsomething that is so fundamental to the rights of every Democratic \nSenator. This vote we took had nothing to do with the marriage tax \npenalty. It had everything to do with a Senator's right to offer an \namendment that would improve a marriage tax penalty bill. I am hopeful \nwe can have some resolution on this matter at some point in the not-\ntoo-distant future.\n  I will tell our colleagues in the majority that this vote will not \nchange. This vote will stay at 45 for whatever\n\n[[Page S2966]]\n\nlength of time it takes. So there will not be any diminution or any \nerosion in the strength of feeling we have about our right to offer \namendments. I am hopeful with that realization we can reach some \ncompromise.\n  Mr. President, I yield 2 hours to the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia under the cloture to be used as he deems appropriate \nduring the debate on the marriage tax penalty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has that right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S2966-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2966-S3011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES TO \n    PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CRIME VICTIMS--Motion To Proceed--Resumed\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are in the process of attempting to work \nout an arrangement of time for the debate on the pending motion. I ask \nfor all concerned if the Chair will describe the pending business of \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to proceed to \nS.J. Res. 3.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  We are in the process of determining just how much time speakers are \ngoing to need in order to conclude debate on the motion to proceed. \nSenator Feinstein and I both have some preliminary remarks we would \nlike to make in connection with that debate as the two chief proponents \nof the resolution. We understand Senator Leahy and Senator Byrd wish to \ntake some time, and Senator Biden as well a little later on.\n  As soon as we can confirm the amount of time people will need, we \nwill probably propound a unanimous consent request in that regard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am perfectly willing, from this side, to \nwork with the distinguished Senator from Arizona and the distinguished \nSenator from California on time. I do not expect an enormous amount of \ntime to be consumed. It has not been announced, but there is a certain \nsense that there may not be any more rollcall votes this week so a lot \nof people are probably going to be leaving. I will definitely try to \naccommodate them.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia does have a statement he \nwishes to make. I have a statement I wish to make. I am simply trying \nto protect some others who may want to speak, as I am sure the Senator \nis on his side. But I will continue to work with the distinguished \nSenator to cut down this time any way we can.\n  Mr. KYL. We will announce to all Members, if we can work that time \narrangement out, just exactly how this will proceed.\n  In the meantime, let me see if I can set the stage so everyone will \nknow where we are in this debate. Then I would like to thank some \npeople and then move on to a colloquy with Senator Feinstein, if I \nmight.\n  Because of the way the Senate works, we have moved back and forth in \nSenate business. But the pending business is the motion to proceed on \nS.J. Res. 3; that is, the crime victims' constitutional rights \nresolution sponsored by Senator Feinstein and myself.\n  We gained cloture earlier this week so we could proceed, and the \nmotion to proceed will certainly be agreed to, if we carry the debate \nthat far. Senator Feinstein and I, however, are of the view that \nbecause of various things that have occurred, it is unlikely that a \ncloture motion, if filed, would be supported by the requisite number of \nSenators to succeed early next week.\n  Therefore, what we are prepared to do is speak to the issue of the \nresolution, where we are with respect to the resolution, to thank the \nmany groups and sponsors and other individuals who have been so \nsupportive of this effort, and to seek permission of the Senate, when \npeople have finished their comments, to withdraw the motion to proceed \nand to move to other business. That merely means a timeout in our \nefforts to secure passage of this constitutional amendment.\n\n  We recognize at this point in time that proceeding will simply \nencourage more Senators to use a great deal of the Senate's time in \nunproductive speeches that really do not go to the heart of our \nconstitutional amendment but take time away from the Senate's important \nbusiness. We have no intention of doing that.\n  So we will make some remarks that will set the stage for what we are \nabout to do. But let me begin by noting the tremendous amount of \nsupport around the country that has accompanied our effort to bring \nthis measure to the floor of the Senate. I have to begin by thanking \ntwo people in particular, Senator Dianne Feinstein and Majority Leader \nTrent Lott. We could not have brought this amendment, over the course \nof the last 4 years, to the bipartisan level of support it now enjoys \nwithout the ability to work on both sides of the aisle. No one could \nhave carried this matter on the Democratic side more capably than \nSenator Dianne Feinstein. Before she came to the Senate, she was a \npassionate advocate for victims of crime. As mayor of San Francisco, \nshe was a proponent of area residents who were victims of crime and \ncarries that passion with her to this debate now.\n  She and I have worked closely with victims' rights advocates to shape \nthe legislation. I might say, while some of our colleagues have \nsuggested there is something wrong with the fact that we have conducted \ndozens of meetings with the administration, Department of Justice, and \nmany others, and honed this amendment in 63 different drafts, we are \nvery proud that we have included anyone who wanted to talk about this \nin our circle of friends working to get an amendment that could pass \nthe Senate and that we have carefully taken their suggestions into \naccount, thus accounting for the many different drafts as the 4-year \nprogress of this resolution has brought us to this point.\n  The fact that we have taken their suggestions to heart and \ncontinually polished this amendment we think is a strong point. While \nwe were criticized yesterday on the floor for engaging in yet more \nnegotiations that might result in a final, 64th draft, I must say that \nwas largely at the instigation of Senator Feinstein, who said, given \nthe fact the Department of Justice has four concerns still pending with \nregard to our specific proposal, let's meet with them and see if we can \ncome to closure on those items.\n  Because of her leadership, we were able to come to closure on three \nof them. We believe we made more than a good faith effort with respect \nto the fourth, which had to do with the protection of defendants' \nrights. We were willing to acknowledge that the rights enumerated in \nthis proposal take nothing whatsoever away from defendants' rights. I \ndo not know how more clearly we can say it. That was not acceptable to \nthe Department of Justice.\n  But it is not for want of trying, on the part of Senator Feinstein, \nthat we have been unable to secure the support of the Department of \nJustice for this amendment. So my first sincere thanks go to the person \nwithout whom we would not be at this point, my colleague Senator \nFeinstein.\n  I also thank Leader Lott. When I went to him with a request for floor \ntime for this amendment, his first response was: You know all the \nbusiness the Senate has to conduct. Are you sure you want to go forward \nwith this? I said we are absolutely certain.\n\n  Despite all the other pressing business, he was willing because he, \ntoo, believes strongly in this proposal, as a cosponsor, to give us the \nfloor time to try to get this through. It is partially out of concern \nfor his responsibilities as leader that we recognize that to proceed \nwould result in a vote that would not be successful, and therefore, \nrather than use that precious time, we are prepared to visit privately \nwith our colleagues to further provide education to them about the \nnecessity of this amendment since, clearly, the methodology we have \nengaged in thus far was not working. We would make strong arguments, \nbut I daresay it didn't appear that anyone was here on the floor \nlistening because when various opponents would come to the floor, they \nwould repeat the same mantra over and over again that we had already \naddressed.\n  Part of that mantra was, Did you know this amendment is longer than \nthe Bill of Rights? We would patiently restate that is not true, that \nall of the rights of the defendants in the Constitution are embodied in \nlanguage of more words than this amendment that embodies the victims' \nrights and so on.\n\n[[Page S2967]]\n\n Then that individual would leave the floor, and another individual \nwould come to the floor and repeat the same erroneous information, and \nwe would have to patiently respond to that.\n  Rather than continue that process, we believe it is better that we \nvisit with our colleagues when we are not using this time on the floor \nand explain all of this to them, with the hope they will then be better \nable to support us in the future.\n  So I thank Senator Feinstein. We have gone through a lot together on \nthis. There is nobody in this body for whom I have greater respect.\n  Again, I thank Senator Lott, the majority leader, for his support for \nus as well.\n  The National Victims' Constitutional Amendment Network is one of the \nreally strong victims' rights groups that has backed us throughout this \nprocess. Roberta Roper has been involved in that. She was in my office \nthis morning. She was with us yesterday. She has been with us \nthroughout the process, helping us evaluate these various proposals and \nassisting us.\n  The National Organization for Victim Assistance, known by the acronym \nNOVA, headed by Marlene Young and John Stein, and all the people on the \nNOVA board, we are enormously appreciative of their strong support and \nassistance throughout this effort. They are going to continue to fight \nfor sure.\n  Marsha Kight, whom Senator Feinstein and I have come to know and \nrespect because of her advocacy as someone whose daughter was killed in \nthe Oklahoma City bombing, brought the experience of that trial and the \nfirsthand knowledge of how victims were denied their rights even to \nattend the trial. She has been an important witness for us before the \nJudiciary Committee and at various other forums.\n  One of the groups in the country that is most strongly in support, \nand has provided a lot of grassroots support, is Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving, or MADD. Also, Students Against Drunk Driving, SADD, a group \nof younger people, has been helpful. Tom Howarth, Millie Webb, \nKatherine Prescott, and others have been very helpful to us in that \nregard.\n  Parents of Murdered Children has been enormously helpful. Rita \nGoldsmith is from my State of Arizona, from Sedona.\n  We have had tremendous help from legal scholars such as Professor \nLaurence Tribe, Professor Doug Beloof, and Professor Paul Cassell. I \nthank them for their enormous help in this effort, including their \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee.\n  There are many prosecutors. I need to mention a couple from my own \nState. The two largest counties in Arizona are Maricopa and Pima \nCounties. Rick Romley, the Republican-elected attorney from Maricopa \nCounty, the sixth largest county by population in the country, and \nBarbara LaWall, a Democratic-elected attorney from Pima County, have \nbeen very strong supporters and helpful in our work.\n  Law enforcement has been very well represented by organizations and \nindividuals. From the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, Darlene \nHutchinson and Laura Griffith have been helpful.\n  Various attorneys general, such as Delaware Attorney General Jane \nBrady, Wisconsin Attorney General Jim Doyle, and Kansas Attorney \nGeneral Carla Stovall. By the way, these are Democrats and Republicans \nalike. It is a totally bipartisan effort. As a matter of fact, the \nNational Association of Attorneys General--we have a very good letter \nsigned by the vast majority of attorneys general in support of our \ncrime victims' constitutional rights amendment.\n  We also have support from former U.S. Attorneys General: Ed Meese, \nBill Barr, and Dick Thornburgh are strongly supportive of our proposal.\n  From a show with which Americans are familiar, ``America's Most \nWanted,'' John Walsh has been an early and strong supporter of our \nproposal.\n  From the Stephanie Roper Foundation--I mentioned Roberta Roper--but \nSteve Kelly of the Stephanie Roper Foundation has been very helpful.\n  Arizona Voice for Crime Victims; a person who helped Senator \nFeinstein in the early years, Neil Quinter, a superb former Senate \nstaff member and with whom I visited just this morning, continues his \nsupport for this.\n  Matt Lamberti and David Hantman of Senator Feinstein's office; Jason \nAlberts, Nick Dickinson, and Taylor Nguyen of my office; and, most \nimportant, Stephen Higgins of my staff and Steve Twist, an attorney \nfrom Arizona, whose support and competence in helping us through this \nprocess was, frankly, simply indispensable.\n  Also, I will submit for the Record two things. One is a list of crime \nvictims' rights amendment supporters. This list includes, in addition \nto those I mentioned, more than half a page of law enforcement \norganizations. I mention this because there has been some suggestion \nthat law enforcement does not support us:\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, Law Enforcement \nAlliance of America, American Probation and Parole Association, \nAmerican Correctional Association, the National Criminal Justice \nAssociation, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \nExecutives, National Troopers Coalition, Concerns of Police Survivors, \nand on and on.\n  This amendment is strongly supported by prosecutors, law enforcement, \nlegal scholars, attorneys general, Governors, former U.S. Attorneys \nGeneral, and many more. I ask unanimous consent to print this list of \nsupporters in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Crime Victims' Rights Amendment Supporters\n\n\n                            public officials\n\n       42 cosponsors in the U.S. Senate (29R; 13D).\n       Former Senator Bob Dole.\n       Representative Henry Hyde.\n       Texas Governor George W.

Bush--April 7, 2000\n\n       I strongly support passage of the Victims' Rights \n     Amendment. Two years ago, I joined my colleagues on the \n     National Governor's Association in calling for a national \n     Amendment, like the one we have in Texas and 30 other states. \n     For too long, courts and lawyers have focused only on the \n     rights of criminal defendants and not on the rights of \n     innocent victims. We need to make sure that crime victims are \n     not forgotten, that they are treated fairly and with respect \n     in our criminal process.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 14, 2000.\n       Dear Senators Kyl and Feinstein: During our years of \n     service as Attorneys General of the United States, we saw \n     first hand how the criminal justice system must command the \n     respect of all our citizens if it is to be effective. That \n     respect can only be eroded when the system unfairly treats \n     those it is supposed to serve.\n       For victims, the system is neither fair nor just. Despite \n     federal statutes and states constitutional amendments passed \n     to ensure fair treatment of crime victims, in too many \n     courtrooms across the country, crime victims continue to be \n     excluded and silenced; they are neither informed of \n     proceedings nor given a right to be present or heard.\n       We believe the only way to extend the fundamental fairness \n     demanded of our system for crime victims, is to secure their \n     rights in our fundamental law, the U.S. Constitution. That is \n     why we are writing now to express our strong and unqualified \n     support for the constitutional amendment you propose, the \n     Crime Victims' Rights Amendment (S.J. Res. 3). This \n     amendment, once ratified, will restore to our justice system \n     the basic fairness necessary to command the respect of all \n     our people. The rights spelled out in the amendment are \n     simple, yet profound. They are practical and attainable, and \n     they will transform our justice system so that it will truly \n     protect the rights of the law abiding as well as the lawless.\n           Sincerely,\n     William Barr.\n     Edwin Meese III.\n     Richard Thornburgh.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Office of the\n\n\n                                     Maricopa County Attorney,\n\n                              Maricopa County, AZ, April 14, 2000.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: As the chief prosecutor for the sixth \n     largest prosecutor's office in the nation, handling over \n     40,000 felony and delinquency prosecutions each year, I have \n     first hand knowledge of the ramifications of providing \n     constitutional rights for victims.\n       I have been a strong proponent for victims' rights for many \n     years, having served on the Arizona Victim's Bill of Rights \n     Steering Committee that was responsible for the passage of \n     constitutional rights for victims in 1990. I also \n     participated in subsequent legislative ad hoc committees \n     charged with developing the enabling legislation. I strongly \n     support S.J. Res. 3 and your efforts to see constitutional \n     rights for victims become a reality in the United States \n     Constitution.\n       I recently read the Minority views in the Judiciary \n     Committee's Report on S.J. Res. 3. The ``worst case'' \n     examples that were raised were for the most part extreme \n     predictions which we in Arizona have not experienced, \n     notwithstanding our long history with victims' rights. I \n     would like to take this opportunity to address several of the \n     Minority report concerns.\n       Victims' Rights Do Not Result in Substantial Costs To The \n     System--\n       Providng victims with constitutional rights has not \n     resulted in substantial costs to law enforcement, \n     prosecutors, the courts, corrections or probation \n     departments. My office provides victims' rights services to \n     over 30,000 victims each year and although the ``exact cost'' \n     is difficult to determine, our estimates are that it costs my \n     office approximately $15.00 per victim.\n       While we have experienced an increase in trials, the \n     increase cannot be attributed to our constitution amendment \n     for victim rights. Any such increase has been in response to \n     our mushrooming population and the resulting increase in case \n     filings.\n       The Arizona Court of Appeals and the Arizona Supreme Court \n     have not been besieged with appeals based on victim rights \n     arguments.\n       Victim Rights Do Not Restrict The Discretion Of The \n     Prosecutor--\n       A victim's right to be heard regarding a plea agreement \n     does not mean a crime victim can veto a judge's final \n     decision. Judges, of course, consider the victim's opinion \n     when determining whether or not to accept a plea agreement, \n     however that opinion is merely one factor among others which \n     contribute to the deliberative process. In Arizona, the \n     victim's right to allocution has not caused our judicial \n     officers to abrogate their responsibility to render a \n     decision free of bias. There is no reason to believe that \n     federal judicial officers will act otherwise when weighing \n     the appropriateness of accepting a negotiated plea.\n       I have implemented a policy in which prosecutors solicit \n     the victim's opinion regarding the final outcome of the \n     prosecution and take the victim's opinion into consideration \n     when neogitating a plea agreement. In this way, the \n     prosecutor considers the victim's wishes, including the harm \n     caused by the crime, throughout the plea negotiation process \n     and pretrial phase of prosecution. Consideration of the \n     victim's views are again but one factor considered by the \n     prosecutor. Our experience has been that my deputies are not \n     inappropriately influenced by emotion. To presuppose \n     otherwise does a disservice to these dedicated public \n     servants who have sworn to strive for equal justice.\n\n[[Page S2969]]\n\n       Prosecutors are responsible for informing victims of the \n     plea agreement and the reasons for the negotiated settlement. \n     It has been our experience that very few victims object to a \n     plea agreement when fully informed of the reasons and \n     benefits of the plea. However, in some instances, after \n     considering the plea and victim's opinion, the judge will \n     reject the plea agreement holding that the interests of \n     justice are not served by the plea. When this happens, \n     although rare in our experience, the court has fulfilled its \n     function as an arbiter not an advocate.\n       Victim Rights Do Not Under Cut The Rights Of The Accused--\n       Victims desire to see justice, first and foremost. their \n     natural desire to gain justice, is not something to fear. In \n     our experience it has helped our office achieve that goal.\n       While victims have a right to be present throughout the \n     course of trial in Arizona, it has been our experience that \n     defendants and/or the friends and family of the defendants \n     are much more likely than victims to become disruptive during \n     trial. In the rare cases where a victim has been emotionally \n     overwhelmed in court, he or she has either voluntarily left \n     the courtroom to calm down, or is requested to do so upon \n     instruction by the court. In every courtroom in our land, the \n     judge has the responsibility of maintaining order and \n     ensuring that the jury is not influenced by factors other \n     than those presented from the witness box. To assume that the \n     presence of a victim in the courtroom will somehow so \n     prejudice a jury that they would disregard the evidence and \n     return a verdict of guilty predicated and influenced by an \n     individual sitting in the spectator section of the court, \n     presupposes that juries will ignore the instructions of the \n     court to be fair and impartial and to base their decision \n     exclusively on the evidence. To adopt this position, one must \n     conclude that juries will ignore the law. To do so, would be \n     to conclude that our jury system is incapable of justice.\n       Defendants have a constitutional right to a speedy trial. \n     Oftentimes defendants waive this right for strategy \n     advantage--hoping for memories to fade, critical witnesses to \n     relocate, or victims to die. Victims have as much an interest \n     in the timely disposition of the criminal case as do the \n     defendants and need to have equal consideration when a judge \n     considers whether or not to delay the disposition of a case.\n       Federal Constitutional Rights Do Not Infringe On State's \n     Rights--\n       While those victimized by crime in Arizona are afforded \n     victim rights in state court, that same victim would not be \n     afforded constitutional rights if that offense occurred on \n     federal land, or if an Arizona resident were victimized in a \n     state that does not have constitutional rights. These rights \n     are too important to be left to a patchwork of rights from \n     state to state. Consistency in the application of our laws \n     are paramount if our citizens are to realize the benefit of a \n     judicial system that is balanced between the accused and the \n     interest of society at large. Inconsistency breeds contempt \n     and cynicism. Adoption of a federal constitutional amendment \n     will recognize that there is but one law for all.\n       My office has nearly a decade of experience championing in \n     assisting victims in exercising their state constitutional \n     rights. It would be disingenuous if I were to say that there \n     had been no costs, yet the benefit to the victim, to the \n     citizens of Arizona and our system of justice far outweighs \n     those costs.\n       Our state constitutional amendment has increased \n     cooperation of victims with police and prosecutors. Victims \n     feel more of a part of the criminal justice process. I \n     believe that this has enhanced the ability of law \n     enforcemenet to put criminals behind the bars, and thus has \n     been a factor in the decrease in crime that we have \n     experienced in recent years.\n       The scales of justice must be balanced, providing victims \n     with equal access to the courts, information and a voice in \n     the criminal justice system. Our system of justice is \n     dependent upon the voluntary participation of those who have \n     been harmed by crime--without their participation, our \n     country would see an increase in lawlessness and vigilantism. \n     Balancing the scales of justice by providing for victim \n     rights restores faith in our system without detracting from \n     the rights of those accused.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard M. Romley,\n     Maricopa County Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 2000.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kyl and Feinstein: We are writing to express \n     our strong and unequivocal support for your efforts to pass \n     S.J. Res. 3, the proposed Crime Victims' Rights Amendment, \n     and send it on to the States for ratification.\n       As Attorneys General from diverse regions and populations \n     in our nation, we continue to see a common denominator in the \n     treatment of crime victims throughout the country. Despite \n     the best intentions of our laws, too often crime victims are \n     still denied basic rights to fair treatment and due process \n     that should be the birthright of every citizen who seeks \n     justice through our courts. We are convinced that statutory \n     protections are not enough; only a federal constitutional \n     amendment will be sufficient to change the culture of our \n     legal system.\n       The rights you propose in S.J. Res. 3 are moderate, fair, \n     and yet profound. They will extend to crime victims a \n     meaningful opportunity to participate in each critical stage \n     of their cases. At the same time, they will not infringe on \n     the fundamental rights of those accused or convicted of \n     offenses. Neither will these rights interfere with the proper \n     functioning of law enforcement. Attorney General Reno spoke \n     for many of us in law enforcement when she noted,\n       ``[T]he President and I have concluded that a victims' \n     rights amendment would benefit not only crime victims but \n     also law enforcement. To operate effectively, the criminal \n     justice system relies on victims to report crimes committed \n     against them, to cooperate with the law enforcement \n     authorities investigating those crimes, and to provide \n     evidence at trial. Victims will be that much more willing to \n     participate in this process if they perceive that we are \n     striving to treat them with respect and to recognize their \n     central place in any prosecution.''\n       Some have argued that federal constitutional rights for \n     victims will infringe on important principles of federalism. \n     We disagree. Each of our state criminal justice systems \n     accommodates federal rights for defendants. To provide a \n     similar floor of rights for victims is a matter of basic \n     fairness.\n       Please share this letter with your colleagues so that they \n     may know of our strong support for S.J. Res. 3.\n     (Signed by 30 attorneys general.)\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement of Marsha A. Kight, Director, Families and Survivors United, \n                   Oklahoma City, OK., March 24, 1999\n\n       My daughter, Frankie Merrell, was murdered in the Oklahoma \n     City bombing, and in tribute to her and all the others, I \n     founded Families and Survivors United, which took a leading \n     role in advocating for the victims and survivors before and \n     during the trials which followed. This is now I first came to \n     meet Beth Wilkinson.\n       Having attended every day of the McVeigh trial, I came to \n     regard Beth Wilkinson as the most effective advocate on the \n     prosecution team. More than that, I and others trusted her to \n     bring the victims' perspective into the courtroom, and she \n     lived up to that trust. So I believe that her statement \n     before the Judiciary Committee today is from the heart--that \n     she really believes that if our Victims Rights Amendment were \n     in place, it might have jeopardized a very basic right--the \n     ``right of just conviction of the guilty,'' as she puts it.\n       But she is wrong. As she describes so well, the prosecution \n     team worked hard to earn our trust, and for the great \n     majority of the 2,000-plus of us who were designated victims \n     under the law, we gave them our trust. But on the one \n     tactical issue she says argues against the Amendment, the \n     prosecution team chose not to trust us for the reasons she \n     describes, and in the process, that team broke both our trust \n     and the law.\n       She claims that, had the Amendment been in place, its right \n     for victims to be heard before a plea bargain is accepted \n     might have harmed the prosecution. Specifically the \n     suggestion that might have persuaded the judge to not accept \n     the guilty plea of Michael Fortier--and thus might have \n     jeopardized the eventual conviction of Timothy McVeigh and \n     Terry Nichols. There are three things wrong with this \n     conjecture.\n       First, Michael Fortier's testimony was not critical to \n     either conviction, as several jurors later made clear to me.\n       Second, had the Justice Department taken us into its trust \n     on the usefulness of the Fortier plea, the great majority of \n     us would have reciprocated that trust and encouraged the \n     judge to accept the plea. I think from everything else Beth \n     Wilkinson describes about the trust-building between the \n     prosecution and the victims confirms this belief. We were not \n     blind sheep, willing to accept everything the prosecutors \n     said was so--we were, most of the time, informed citizens who \n     were persuaded by the prosectuors' reasoning. Beth Wilkinson \n     as much as admits this when she notes that the victims \n     overwhelmingly asked for a provable and sustainable case \n     against the guilty.\n       And third, the prosecution team's mistrust of us over the \n     Fortier plea agreement was so great that it chose not to \n     notify us over the hearing in which the plea was offered, and \n     it chose not to confer with any of us beforehand about the \n     plea--both of which were in violation of existing federal \n     law.\n       So when Beth Wilkinson says that statutory reform will meet \n     our just demands, we must ask, what happened to the statutes \n     already on the books?\n       I am increasingly persuaded that the most formidable enemy \n     of crime victims' aspirations for getting justice under our \n     Constitution are criminal justice officials--even well-\n     meaning ones like Beth Wilkinson--who believe that only \n     government lawyers know best. Her testimony is in fact \n     Exhibit A in the case for the Amendment because it is the \n     voice of a superior government extending handouts as an act \n     of grace, not protecting legitimate rights of a free people. \n     She says that the ``concerns'' of the victims must be \n     balanced with the ``need for a just trial,'' as though these \n     important values were somehow in conflict, and that only the \n     government knows how to achieve this goal.\n       I cannot tell you how these words hurt me; they confirm my \n     worst fears about the treatment of victims in our justice \n     system and\n\n[[Page S2970]]\n\n     how nothing will change without constitutional rights.\n       It is painfully obvious to me that she thinks of us as mere \n     meddlers who must be kept out of this important government \n     business for fear that we might break something. Beth \n     Wilkinson may believe that she ``grew to understand my grief \n     first hand,'' but clearly she does not. For me and so many of \n     our families our grief was profoundly extended when our \n     government minimized and discounted our interests by refusing \n     to consult with us about this important development early in \n     the case.\n       For example, consider the point Beth Wilkinson makes about \n     grand jury secrecy. She says, ``Due to the secrecy rules of \n     the grand jury, we could not explain to the victims why \n     Fortier's plea and cooperation was important to the \n     prosecution of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.'' Under \n     existing federal law, however, courts are authorized to \n     enter appropriate orders allowing for the disclosure of \n     grand jury information in advance of a court proceeding. \n     It apparently did not even occur to her then, nor does it \n     today, to have sought such a court order for disclosure. \n     Nor is clear that such an order would even have been \n     necessary, as surely there would have been ways to explain \n     the circumstances to the victims without going \n     confidential grand jury matters.\n       Perhaps most disturbing of all to me is Beth Wilkinson's \n     assertion that the Victims Rights Clarification Act of 1997 \n     ``worked--no victims were precluded from testifying.'' In \n     fact, I was precluded from testifying in the sentencing phase \n     of the trial. As she is well aware, I very much wanted to be \n     a penalty phase witness. But because of my philosophical \n     beliefs in opposition to capital punishment, I was not \n     allowed by the government prosecutors to testify. Clearly the \n     statute did not work for me.\n       In addition, a number of victims lost their right to attend \n     the trial of Timothy McVeigh because of legal uncertainties \n     about the status of victims' rights. As I testified before \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1997, Judge Matsch rejected \n     a motion made by a number of us to issue a final ruling \n     upholding the new law as McVeigh's trial began. His \n     reluctance led the prosecution team (including Beth \n     Wilkinson) to tell us that, if we wanted to give an impact \n     statement at the penalty phase, we should seriously consider \n     not attending the trial. Some of the victims on the \n     prosecution's penalty phase list followed this pointed \n     suggestion and forfeited their supposedly protected right to \n     attend McVeigh's trial. Our lawyers also sought further \n     clarification from the judge (unsuccessfully), but had to do \n     so without further help from the prosecution team. The \n     prosecutors were apparently concerned about pressing this \n     point further because the judge might become irritated.\n       Beth Wilkinson urges the Congress to ``consider statutory \n     alternatives to protect the rights of victims.'' While she \n     says that she opposes the Victim's Rights Amendment in its \n     ``current form,'' the context of this statement makes it \n     clear that she opposes any constitutional rights for crime \n     victims. She concludes with the following prescription: ``We \n     must educate prosecutors, law enforcement and judges about \n     the impact of crimes so that they better understand the \n     importance of addressing victims' rights from the outset.'' \n     But the truth is that there will be no real rights to \n     address, as my experience makes clear, unless those rights \n     are enshrined in the United States Constitution. Only then \n     will victim's rights be meaningful and enforceable.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am going to make some concluding remarks \nabout why we believe so strongly in this amendment, how we intend to \npursue the amendment, and why supporters of this amendment should take \nheart about how far we have come in this process and not at all be \ndispirited by the fact that there will not be a final vote on the \namendment at this time. I will make those comments after Senator \nFeinstein has had an opportunity to make some comments that I know she \nstrongly wishes to make.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I asked the Senator to yield for two \nquick requests. I forgot to do this yesterday. I mentioned a letter \nfrom the Judicial Conference on this amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nto print this letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Committee on Criminal Law of the Judicial Conference of \n           the United States,\n                                   Greenville, SC, April 17, 2000.\n     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re: S.J. Res. 3, the Victims' Rights Amendment\n       Dear Senator Schumer: Thank you for your letter requesting \n     the views of the Judicial Conference of the United States \n     regarding S.J. Res. 3, the Victims' Rights Amendment to the \n     Constitution. On behalf of the Judicial Conference, I \n     appreciate the opportunity to have its viewpoint considered \n     as the Senate takes up this important legislation.\n       In March of 1997, the Judicial Conference resolved to take \n     no position at that time on the enactment of a victims' \n     rights constitutional amendment. However, if the Congress \n     decides to affirmatively act in this area, the Judicial \n     Conference strongly prefers a statutory approach as opposed \n     to a constitutional amendment.\n       A statutory approach would allow all participants in the \n     federal criminal justice system to gain experience with the \n     principles involved without taking the unusual step of \n     amending our nation's fundamental legal charter, with its \n     concomitant application to the various state systems. Many of \n     the principles contemplated in S.J. Res. 3 represent a \n     significant change in our criminal justice system, literally \n     realigning the interests of defendants and victims, as well \n     as the process by which criminal cases are adjudicated. The \n     rights and protections heretofore afforded to citizens under \n     the Constitution were largely part of the fabric of the law \n     well-known and understood by the Founding Fathers, while many \n     of the concepts in the victims' rights area are largely \n     untested, at least in the federal system. It could take years \n     for a settled body of law and judicial administration to \n     evolve. A statutory approach would accommodate this process.\n       A statutory approach would also vitiate the potential \n     specter of significant federal court involvement in the \n     operations of the state criminal justice systems under a \n     victims' rights constitutional amendment. Finally, a \n     statutory approach is more certain and immediate, an \n     advantage to victims. Conversely, an amendment potentially \n     would not be effective for many years, awaiting the ponderous \n     and uncertain ratification process required under Article V.\n       While S.J. Res. 3 appears to have less potential adverse \n     impact on the federal judiciary than some previous amendment \n     proposals, there remain a number of fundamental concerns:\n\n\n    classes of crimes and victims to which the amendment will apply\n\n       Under S.J. Res. 3, the proposed amendment will apply to any \n     person who is a ``victim of a crime of violence, as these \n     terms may be defined by law.'' It is not clear from the \n     proposed amendment whether these terms are to be defined by \n     Congress, the states or through case law. The term ``crime of \n     violence,'' which is commonly utilized in legal parlance, has \n     many meanings under state and federal law. Thus, it is \n     unclear as to which specific crimes this provision would \n     actually apply. This problem is magnified by the fact that \n     this provision applies to misdemeanor cases, the number of \n     which is particularly large in the state courts. Failure to \n     provide a clear and practical definition of this term may \n     well result in protracted and unnecessary litigation that \n     will likely take years and great expense to resolve.\n       Closely associated with this issue is the question of what \n     classes of persons will qualify as a ``victim.'' We note that \n     the proposed amendment includes no definition of victim. This \n     leaves many fundamental questions unanswered, including:\n       Must a person suffer direct physical harm to qualify as a \n     victim?\n       Is it sufficient if the person has suffered pecuniary loss \n     alone?\n       What if the person is alleging solely emotional harm? Is \n     that enough to qualify him or her as a victim?\n       Are family members of a person injured by a crime also \n     victims?\n       Suppose that a defendant is accused of committing a series \n     of ten violent armed robberies. Due to evidence strength and \n     efficiency considerations, the prosecutor sends only six of \n     those cases to the grand jury. Are the other four injured \n     persons victims under the proposed amendment?\n       Suppose an agreement is reached whereby the defendant \n     agrees to plead guilty to just one of the cases. Are the \n     other nine injured persons victims under these circumstances? \n     Will the answer affect a prosecutor's ability to obtain plea \n     agreements from defendants?\n       Extending the definition of victim to those who claim \n     emotional harm from criminal offenses dramatically \n     exacerbates the potential impact of this proposal. The number \n     of persons who could claim to be emotionally harmed by \n     significant, well-publicized crimes could be quite large. \n     Moreover, substantial litigation could result from the \n     requirement of restitution, especially in cases involving \n     non-economic injury. Finally, cases involving large numbers \n     of victims, particularly victims of terrorist acts, are \n     particularly troubling. Providing the rights\n\n[[Page S2971]]\n\n     enumerated in the proposed amendment to large numbers of \n     victims could overwhelm the criminal justice system's ability \n     to perform its primary function of adjudicating guilt or \n     innocence and punishing the guilty.\n\n\n                              enforcement\n\n       The proposed amendment states that nothing ``in this \n     article shall provide grounds to stay or continue any trial, \n     reopen any proceeding or invalidate any ruling.'' Unlike some \n     previously introduced victims' rights constitutional \n     amendment proposals, S.J. Res. 3 does not stipulate that a \n     victim has no grounds to challenge a charging decision. This \n     addition would be a significant and valid limitation. \n     Allowing victims to challenge a prosecutor's charging \n     decision could result in significant operational problems. We \n     suggest that Congress also consider modifying the proposed \n     amendment to prohibit a victim from challenging a \n     ``negotiated plea.'' Permitting the challenge of a proposed \n     plea interferes with the prosecutor's ability to obtain \n     convictions of defendants whose successful prosecution may \n     rest on the cooperation of another defendant. Guilty pleas \n     are sometimes also negotiated because the prosecution \n     witnesses are, for various reasons, not as strong as they \n     appear to be on paper. Also, the sheer volume of cases would \n     generally overwhelm any prosecutor's office and the courts \n     unless the vast majority were settled. Permitting challenge \n     to a prosecutor's judgment regarding an accepted plea could \n     lead inadvertently to a failure to secure a conviction. The \n     significance of this issue should not be underestimated.\n\n\n                               federalism\n\n       The matter of victim enforcement raises significant \n     federalism concerns. While the proposed amendment includes \n     provisions that bar monetary damages as a remedy, it appears \n     that victims may be able to seek injunctive relief against \n     state officials for violation of their new constitutional \n     rights. Such claims, almost inevitably filed in federal \n     courts, could cause significant federal court supervision of \n     state criminal justice systems for the purpose of enforcing \n     the amendment. These conflicts between federal courts and \n     state governments would be avoided by a statutory approach to \n     victims' rights.\n\n\n                  administration of justice exception\n\n       S.J. Res. 3 permits Congress to create exceptions to the \n     proposed amendment ``when necessary to achieve a compelling \n     interest.'' While this is a very valid and useful provision, \n     Congress should carefully consider the need for a further \n     exception based on adverse impact on the administration of \n     justice. Inevitably, courts will handle cases where the \n     rights of victims collide with the functional administration \n     of justice. Such cases might fall into two general \n     categories. The first category relates to the very real \n     practicalities of the administration of justice. One \n     example would be an action involving exceptionally large \n     numbers of possible victims wishing to attend the \n     proceedings and overwhelming any available courtroom or \n     other suitable location. A similar problem would be \n     encountered if large numbers of victims wished to exercise \n     their rights to allocution at sentencing, unduly \n     prolonging the proceedings and pushing back other cases \n     that need to be heard. The second category of cases are \n     those in which the rights of victims, exercised under \n     certain circumstances, may have a substantive effect upon \n     the rights of defendants or others, impairing due process \n     or the right to a fair trial. An example of such a case \n     would be if a victim wished to both attend the trial and \n     testify at the guilt phase, even though the trial judge \n     had ordered all witnesses sequestered. This could impair \n     the fundamental integrity of the trial.\n       Congress should consider modifying the proposed amendment \n     to allow a judge, while recognizing the rights of the victims \n     to the extent practicable, to provide for exceptions in \n     individual cases when required for the orderly administration \n     of justice. Congress may also wish to consider modifying the \n     proposed amendment to additionally allow Congress to \n     statutorily enact exceptions in ``aid of the administration \n     of justice.'' At the very least, Congress should provide an \n     exception permitting the sequestration from trial proceedings \n     of a victim who will appear as a witness at the guilt phase \n     of the trial. This could be accomplished through a general \n     provision in the proposed amendment stating that the victim's \n     rights should not ``interfere with the constitutional rights, \n     including due process rights, of the person accused of \n     committing the crime.'' It could also be accomplished through \n     a more narrow provision, similar to that in the Wisconsin \n     Constitution, by the addition of a phrase allowing \n     sequestration when ``necessary to a fair trial for the \n     defendant.'' Another approach, similar to that taken under \n     the Constitution of Florida, would add a phrase allowing \n     sequestration ``to protect overriding interests that may be \n     prejudiced by the presence of the victim.''\n\n\n                      speedy trial considerations\n\n       The proposed amendment includes a victim's right to \n     ``consideration of the interest of the victim that any trial \n     be free from unreasonable delay.'' Determining the meaning of \n     this phrase and how it interacts with existing speedy trial \n     provisions should be a fertile source of diversionary \n     litigation.\n       In federal court, the sixth amendment right to a speedy \n     trial and the Speedy Trial Act, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3161-\n     3173, not only guarantee the defendant's right to a speedy \n     trial, but also recognize the public's, and therefore the \n     victim's, interest in swift justice. However, the Speedy \n     Trial Act also recognizes several legitimate bases to \n     postpone trial, including plea negotiations. See 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3161. This mechanism is an integral part of the criminal \n     justice system, balancing the desirability of a speedy trial \n     with the realistic requirements of a fair proceeding.\n       How is this right to consideration of the interest of the \n     victim that any trial be free from unreasonable delay to be \n     enforced? Will the victim have a right to seek relief from \n     unreasonable delay? A motion to move the case faster would \n     require a collateral hearing to determine the extent of the \n     delay and whether it is unreasonable. The victim would then \n     be in an adversarial position to the prosecutor and perhaps \n     to the presiding judge. Would another judge be required to \n     make the determination? Would a federal judge be asked to \n     pass judgment on the efficiency of a state court?\n       With ever increasing criminal dockets and limited \n     prosecutorial and judicial resources, victims in several \n     cases on the same docket, insisting upon speedier \n     proceedings, could potentially cause severe internal \n     conflicts within units of the same court.\n\n\n                                 notice\n\n       It is important that the responsibility for providing \n     notice of proceedings and of the release or escape of a \n     defendant be appropriately allocated to the prosecution, law \n     enforcement agencies, or corrections agencies as is the law \n     and practice in virtually all the states providing for \n     victims' rights. Many of the rights under the proposed \n     amendment must attach long before a defendant is formally \n     charged in court. The judiciary would not have access to much \n     of the information necessary to provide the required notice. \n     It has neither the personnel nor resources to provide such \n     notice to large numbers of victims or to provide the \n     specialized types of victim assistance that is available from \n     the first line of contact that victims have with the criminal \n     justice system. The situation is likely no better--and \n     possibly worse--in the state courts.\n       Once again, I thank you for the opportunity to express the \n     views of the Judicial Conference on this important issue. If \n     you have any questions regarding the matters discussed \n     herein, please do not hesitate to contact me. I may be \n     reached at 864/233-7081. If you prefer, your staff may \n     contact Dan Cunningham, Legislative Counsel at the \n     Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. He may be reached \n     at 202/502-1700.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                           William W. Wilkins, Jr.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, second, I thank both Senator Kyl and \nSenator Feinstein for the passion, the erudition, the conviction, and \nfor the cause. It is, obviously, wise to delay this. I know we may be \nback for another day. Maybe we can all come together. I plead with them \nto consider a proposal of making this a Kyl-Feinstein statute, as \nopposed to a Kyl-Feinstein constitutional amendment, where I think it \nmight get close to unanimous support on the floor.\n  I thought the debate we were having and may well continue to have, at \nleast to my young years in the Senate, was one of the best times of the \nSenate, where we each talked about the issue with our concerns, our \nintelligence, and our passions. We tried to meet the issue head on. I \nthank both the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California for \ntheir good work on this and hope we can come together on some sort of \ncompromise on an issue about which we all care so much.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I reiterate what I said yesterday, and that \nis, the best part of the debate we had was the debate with Senator \nSchumer whose approach to this was serious and intelligent. He asked \nthe best questions. I believe we answered them, but we did not come to \nagreement. Of course, we will be working with him in the future on this \nmatter and, hopefully, persuade him that a constitutional amendment is \nthe best way to go. The debate we had among Senator Feinstein, Senator \nSchumer, and myself I thought was the highlight of this debate. I \nappreciate his remarks.\n  I yield to Senator Feinstein for comments I know she wants to make.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona. I also thank the Senator from New York, and I thank you, Mr. \nPresident, for allowing me to proceed.\n  I begin by thanking the Senator from Arizona. Mr. President, I say to \nJon Kyl, working with him on this amendment has truly been one of the \nhighlights of my 7 years in the Senate. He has worked with credibility \nand with integrity. He has been fulsome in his sharing of detail. We \nhave gone shoulder to shoulder through virtually every rung of this, \nthrough 4 years of discussions, of conferences, of hearings, of 800 \npages of testimony, some 35 witnesses.\n\n[[Page S2972]]\n\n I agree with everything he said about the inclusive nature of the \nprocess.\n  I must tell Senator Kyl how much I admire him. We worked together on \nthe Technology and Terrorism Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. I \nsaw it there. I have never seen it with another Senator as pronounced \nas it was in these past 4 years in the work on this issue. I believe a \nfriendship has developed in the process, one which means a great deal \nto me. His leadership has been superb, and there is certainly nothing \neither one of us has done for the misunderstanding out there still \nabout what we are trying to do and the importance of it. We will come \nback another day; there is no question in my mind about that. I cannot \nthank him enough. From the bottom of my heart, I thank Senator Kyl for \nhis credibility, his intelligence, his integrity. He did his party \nproud. I am very happy to be a colleague of his and a friend as well.\n  Before I get into my remarks, I also echo the thanks Senator Kyl \nprovided to a whole host of victims, literally tens of thousands of \nthem, to 37 State attorneys general, to many Governors, to all those \nacross both party lines who support this and understand it. I \nparticularly thank three legal scholars who were with us every step of \nthe way.\n  I thank Larry Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard \nUniversity, for his testimony, for the phone calls, for the advice he \nhas provided and for the statements he has made.\n  I also thank one of the primary legal scholars in this country who \nhas been a victims' rights representative, legal counsel--just a \nwonderful human being I have also gotten to know--and that is Professor \nPaul Cassell, professor of law at the University of Utah.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank Steve Twist on behalf of both \nSenator Kyl and myself. There are few people who have been as ardent in \nthe cause as Steve Twist has been, with his knowledge, with his \nexpertise, with his representation of victims throughout this entire \nprocess.\n  I know that none of the three above-mentioned individuals is going to \ngo away. We have them as part of this enormous victims coalition. We \nwill come back, and we will fight again another day.\n  But today, Mr. President, I rise with a sad heart because we must \npostpone our battle for a crime victims' rights constitutional \namendment.\n  This is a fight that actually began 18 years ago when the President's \nTask Force on Victims of Crime recommended an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States which would address victims' rights. \nThis isn't a new idea. It has been around. There is a track record to \nshow why it is necessary.\n  As I said, Senator Kyl and I introduced that amendment 4 years ago. \nWe have worked long and hard. I think enough has been said about that.\n  What is unbelievable to me is that we have also been criticized for \nthe hard work we have put into this amendment over the past 4 years.\n  Senators have come to the floor and told us that the fact that we put \nour amendment through so many drafts and consulted so many interested \nparties shows that our amendment does not deserve to be in the \nConstitution of the United States. Yet, in fact, drafting an amendment \nto the Constitution of the United States requires an uncanny kind of \nprecision. Because this isn't 1791 when the Bill of Rights was written, \nor 1789 when the Constitution was adopted, there has been a whole \npanoply of case law and interpretations that have come throughout the \nages that makes the drafting of a constitutional amendment such as this \none very difficult. However, I believe we have developed a document \nthat will, in fact, stand the test of time.\n  What we have tried to do, in essence, is very simple. I would like to \nshow a chart, once again. We have tried to take the Constitution, which \nprovides 15 specific rights to the accused, and no rights to victims of \nviolent crimes--with a scale of justice which we believe is weighted in \na certain way to exempt victims from the administration of criminal \njustice--and give victims some status and standing in the \nadministration of criminal justice, so that the scale of justice would \nnot be so badly tilted but would look something like this other chart \nwhere the accused would have certain basic rights, and victims would \nhave certain basic, although limited, rights: The right to notice when \na trial takes place; the right not to be excluded from a public \nproceeding; the right to be heard at that proceeding, if present; the \nright to submit a statement in writing; the right to notice of the \nrelease or the escape of an attacker; the right to consideration for \nthe assurance of a speedy trial; the right to an order of restitution; \nand the right to consideration of their safety in determining any \nconditional release of an attacker--simple, basic rights of status and \nstanding.\n\n  We have heard much about the fact that this should not be in the \nConstitution. There has been much talk on the floor about James Madison \nand other framers. Senators have suggested that our forefathers would \nnot support the amendment.\n  I tried to point out why our forefathers did not have reason to \nconsider the amendment because when both the Constitution and the Bill \nof Rights were written, victims had a role in the process. Up until \n1850, victims had a role in the process. But it was with the \ndevelopment of the public prosecutors, when victims were no longer in \nthe courtroom, that they became summarily excluded from the process.\n  I point out that if we look back in history, I find my views very \ncommensurate with those of Thomas Jefferson. He was not among those who \nwrote the Constitution, but he thought deeply about the Constitution \nand how and when we should amend it. He was also the inspiration for \nour Bill of Rights, a document actually drafted by James Madison.\n  In 1816, 25 years after the Bill of Rights became the law of the \nland, Thomas Jefferson wrote to Samuel Kercheval, stating his views on \namending the Constitution. I think it is important that the Record \nreflect these views. He said:\n\n       I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried \n     changes in laws and constitutions. I think moderate \n     imperfections had better be borne with; because, when once \n     known, we accommodate ourselves to them and find practical \n     means of correcting their ill effects. But I know also that \n     laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress \n     of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more \n     enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths \n     disclosed and manners and opinions change with the change of \n     circumstances, institutions must advance also and keep pace \n     with the times.\n\n  Similarly, 13 years earlier, he said in a letter to Wilson Nicholas:\n\n       Let us go on perfecting the Constitution by adding by way \n     of amendment, those forms which time and trial show are still \n     wanting.\n\n  I believe very deeply that time and trial show that our amendment is \nstill wanting and should be adopted.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, in recognition \nof the widespread support we have received, letters from virtually \nevery law enforcement agency and every crime victims group.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 County of Shasta,\n\n\n                              Office of the District Attorney,\n\n                                      Redding, CA, April 17, 2000.\n     Re: Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate HWA Office,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to offer my wholehearted \n     support for your efforts in sponsoring the Crime Victims' \n     Rights Constitutional Amendment. Your proposed amendment \n     would fill a gaping hole in the rights guaranteed to citizens \n     in our Constitution by providing basic, essential rights to \n     victims of crime in our nation. As a prosecuting attorney, I \n     have all too often seen the rights of perpetrators of \n     horrendous crimes protected at all costs while the basic \n     human rights of victims and families of victims of those \n     crimes are ignored and forgotten. It will be great day when \n     our Constitution and criminal justice system work as hard to \n     protect the rights of victims as they do the rights of \n     criminals. I commend you on your efforts to make that day a \n     reality. Do not hesitate to call upon me if there is anything \n     I can do to support you with this work.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                McGregor W.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to lend my support to \n     your efforts to protect victims' rights. As one of the \n     original nine members of President Reagan's Task Force on \n     Victims of Crime, I have long supported a Constitutional \n     Amendment to protect the rights of victims of crime.\n       As the vice-Chairman, and soon to be Chairman, of the \n     National Governor's Association, I would like to assist you \n     by raising this issue with our nation's governors.\n       In Nevada, we've made great strides in protecting victims' \n     rights through legislative measure ranging from guarding \n     consumers against auto repair fraud to expanding our domestic \n     violence laws to cover people in dating or live-in \n     relationships. Despite these efforts, more changes need to be \n     made to ensure that victims are treated fairly. The criminal \n     justice system should not overlook the interest of victims in \n     light of protecting the rights of the criminals. I firmly \n     believe that a speedy trial and information about the \n     proceedings of the trial are minimal rights that the \n     constitution should grant to all victims.\n       Please let me know what other ways I can help you with this \n     cause.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bob Miller,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Justice for Murder Victims,\n\n                                San Francisco, CA, April 19, 2000.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Regarding: Support of S.J. Res. 3, the Victims Rights \n         Constitutional Amendment\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of Justice for Murder \n     Victims, I would like to inform you of our strong support of \n     S.J. Res. 3, the ``Victims Rights Constitutional Amendment''\n       Criminals' rights are inherently included in America's \n     criminal justice system, while crime victims, historically, \n     have not had a place and/or voice within the criminal justice \n     system. In fact, to add insults to injury, the majority of \n     victims are violated and betrayed a second time by the \n     system. S.J. Res, 3 will secure basic rights for countless \n     victims of crime throughout our nation as they struggle to \n     survive their victimization.\n       Under this legislation, victims would have a right to \n     receive notice of public proceedings related to the crime \n     perpetrated against them, notice of the offender's escape or \n     release from custody, as well as notification of parole \n     hearings and to have a voice at these hearings. Without the \n     help and determination of so many crime victims, the system \n     cannot hold criminals accountable and stem the tide of future \n     crime.\n       Victims of crime need to have the same rights across this \n     great nation. We ``THANK YOU'' for taking an active role in \n     this very important legislation and for the concern and \n     support that you continue to show victims of crime and their \n     survivors.\n       Please feel free to call on us anytime we may be of help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Harriet Salarno,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 20, 1996.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n     Attention: Neil Quinter\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for meeting with me on \n     such short notice last week and sharing the Crime Victims' \n     Rights Amendment. As I am currently spending the majority of \n     my days in court attending the trial of my daughter's killer, \n     I know too well the inequities facing the families of \n     victims.\n       For that reason I wish to offer my whole hearted \n     endorsement and approval of your attempt to guarantee rights \n     for the victims and families of victims of violent crime. If \n     there is anything that I can do to promote your efforts, \n     please feel free to call on me at any time.\n           Sincerely,\n     Marc Klaas.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Victims & Friends United,\n\n                                   Sacramento, CA, April 21, 2000.\n     Hon.

We \n     ensure that existing victims' rights laws are zealously \n     enforced, and encourage the drafting of new legislation to \n     further protect the rights of crime victims and improve \n     public safety.\n       As President and Board member of VFU, I am writing to ask \n     you and your co-sponsored Senators to urge the full Senate to \n     pass the Crime Victims' Rights Amendment to the U.S. \n     Constitution. In supporting this amendment, the Senate has an \n     historic opportunity to take a stand for the millions of \n     Americans who are victimized each year in this country.\n       For decades we have seen court decisions expanding the \n     ``rights'' of criminals. Finally, it is encouraging to see \n     legislators beginning to place equal emphasis on the rights \n     of crime victims. The rights to be present, heard and \n     informed throughout the criminal justice process are basic \n     tenets guaranteed by our U.S. Constitution to those accused \n     or convicted of crimes in our nation, yet the rights of their \n     innocent victims are not articulated in our U.S. \n     Constitution. The Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional \n     Amendment is necessary to ensure that victims' rights are \n     respected and enforced in our criminal justice process.\n       Thank you for all that you do for Californians, keep up the \n     good work, and realize that you have our full support. If we \n     can be of further assistance or you need someone from our \n     organization to testify, please give us a call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Patsy J. Gillis,\n     President and Co-Founder.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               The Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                          Alliance of America,\n\n                                     Lynbrook, NY, April 12, 2000.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Law Enforcement \n     Alliance of America, I would like to inform you of our strong \n     organizational support of S.J. Res. 3, the ``Victims Rights \n     Constitutional Amendment.'' LEAA is asking for your active \n     support of this important legislation that is expected to go \n     for a Senate floor vote in late April. Additionally, LEAA \n     asks that you oppose any attempts to dilute the intent of \n     this critical legislation.\n       LEAA is the nation's largest coalition of law enforcement \n     professionals, crime victims, and concerned citizens \n     dedicated to finding solutions to the problems plaguing our \n     country's criminal justice system. Fighting for passage of \n     victims' rights legislation is of paramount importance in \n     realizing just one of LEAA's many goals.\n       Paradoxically, criminals' rights are inherently included in \n     America's most supreme document while crime victims, \n     historically, have not had a place and/or a voice within the \n     criminal justice system. In fact, to add insult to injury, \n     the majority of victims are violated and betrayed a second \n     time by the system. S.J. Res. 3 will secure basic rights for \n     countless victims of crime throughout our nation as they \n     struggle to survive their victimization.\n       Under this legislation, victims would have a right to \n     receive notice of public proceedings related to the crime \n     perpetrated against them, notice of the offender's escape or \n     release from custody, as well as notification of parole \n     hearings and a voice at these hearings. As the President's \n     Task Force on Victims reported in 1982, ``The criminal \n     justice system is absolutely dependent upon the cooperation \n     of crime victims to report and to testify. Without their \n     help, the system cannot hold criminals accountable and stem \n     the tide of future crime.''\n       LEAA feels it is imperative to pass legislation to protect \n     the country's violent crime victims. The high number of \n     victims in this country (including the tens of thousands of \n     officers assaulted each year and dozens murdered) indicates \n     that we cannot afford to overlook this proposed amendment. \n     Another reason to endorse this amendment is that in the 18 \n     years we've discussed this provision, 32.4 million Americans \n     have been victims of violent crime. And they simply deserve \n     better treatment in the criminal justice system.\n       Once again, we urge you to take an active role in passing \n     this very important legislation. If there is any information \n     LEAA can provide on S.J. Res. 3, please don't hesitate to \n     call me or LEAA's Crime Victims Advocate Darlene Hutchinson \n     at (703) 847-2677.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James J.

(WEAVE), I am happy to lend our \n     support of your Crime Victims Rights Constitutional Amendment \n     (Senate Joint Resolution 3). This amendment is supported \n     throughout our nation by 49 of 50 governors as well as \n     Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Parents of Murdered Children \n     and the National Organizational for Victim Assistance.\n       While criminal defendants have almost two dozen separate \n     constitutional rights, fifteen of which specifically provided \n     as constitutional amendments, victims of crime have no \n     constitutional rights. The Crime Victims Rights Amendment \n     brings much needed balance to our justice system by granting \n     victims the right to be informed, present and heard at \n     critical stages throughout trials.\n       We should not forget that justice is an attempt to give \n     back to victims the sense of closure and fairness taken by \n     their perpetrators. This amendment is a long overdue step \n     toward justice for victims.\n       Please convey WEAVE's strong support to your colleagues in \n     the U.S. Senate. Thank you for your advocacy efforts on \n     behalf of victims and victim advocacy organizations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Mary Struhs,\n                                               Associate Director.\n\n[[Page S2974]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                           Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                               East Northport, NY, April 21, 2000.\n     Hon.

Res. 3, the \n     ``Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment.''\n       FLEOA, the voice of America's federal criminal \n     investigators, agents, and officers, is the largest \n     professional association in the nation exclusively \n     representing the federal law enforcement community. FLEOA, a \n     non partisan, volunteer organization comprised of active and \n     retired federal law enforcement members from the agencies \n     listed on the left side of this document is dedicated to the \n     advancement of the federal law enforcement community.\n       We are an organization comprised of individuals who have \n     dedicated their lives to protecting and serving the American \n     public. It is our belief that the time is right to amend the \n     Constitution to correct the injustice that that has developed \n     in this area. This amendment will ensure that those who have \n     been touched by crimes of violence are not further victimized \n     by laws that may prevent them from being notified, and \n     provided the opportunity to be present and heard at critical \n     stages of their cases. We believe that the Founders created \n     the Constitution to be a living document and this proposed \n     amendment is consistent with that principle.\n       FLEOA looks forward to working with Congress and the States \n     in securing passage of the Crime Victims' Rights \n     Constitutional Amendment.

The California Police Activities League supports \n     your Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. As \n     law enforcement personnel, we understand the importance of \n     this Constitutional Amendment to the many victims of crime \n     that we meet during a criminal investigation. In many cases, \n     it is youth, which are the victims. They should have the same \n     rights as every citizen of the United States of America. A \n     victim of a violent crime should have the following rights:\n       To reasonable notice of public judicial proceedings\n       To attend all public proceedings.\n       To be heard at crucial stages in the judicial process.\n       To receive reasonable notice of the offender's release or \n     escape.\n       To consider in the interest of the crime victim that the \n     trial is free from unreasonable delay.\n       To receive restitution from the convicted offender.\n       To consider for the safety of the victim any conditional \n     release from custody.\n       The California Police Activities is only asking that the \n     8.6 millions victims of violent crime in our country receive \n     fair treatment by the judicial system, which they deserve. \n     For those accused of crimes in our country, the Constitution \n     specifically protects them. However, nowhere in the text of \n     the United States Constitution does there appear any \n     guarantee of rights for crime victims.\n       The time has come for a Victim Bill of Rights. The \n     California Police Activities in the name of its members \n     support your drive for the passage of this Constitutional \n     Amendment. Please call us if we can be of help in your effort \n     to protect the rights of crime victims. CAL PAL commends you \n     for taking up this cause in the name of 8.6 million \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Ron Exley,\n     Government Relations Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         City and County of San Francisco, Office of the Sheriff,\n                                San Francisco, CA, April 24, 2000.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to lend my support to \n     Senate Joint Resolution 3, the proposed amendment to the \n     Constitution intended to protect the rights of crime victims.\n       As Sheriff of San Francisco, I have witnessed the \n     empowerment experienced by victims of crime when given the \n     opportunity to speak about how their lives were impacted by \n     violence. I have also witnessed the effect on violent \n     offenders of hearing how their crimes harmed individuals and \n     the entire community. As part of our Resolve to Stop the \n     Violence Project, an in-custody treatment program for men \n     with violent criminal histories, victims come to the jail to \n     tell how the violence done to them changed their lives. For \n     the first time, many offenders realize that their actions \n     have serious and harmful consequences, and this is often the \n     catalyst for real change. Not only does the experience give \n     voice to crime victims, it gives both victim and offender the \n     opportunity to work toward the common goal of the eradication \n     of violence.\n       Participation of victims in the criminal justice dialogue \n     is essential to their well being and that of the entire \n     community. I am proud to support the Crime Victims Rights \n     Constitutional Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael Hennessey,\n                                                          Sheriff.\n\n[[Page S2975]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                  San Diego County\n\n\n                                         Sheriff's Department,\n\n                                    San Diego, CA, April 24, 2000.\n     Hon.

Your proposed amendment would fill \n     a void in the rights guaranteed to citizens in our \n     Constitution by providing basic, essential rights to victims \n     of crimes all across our nation.\n       Law Enforcement has long recognized that crime victims \n     deserve a rightful place in the criminal justice system. \n     While criminal defendants have nearly two dozen separate \n     constitutional rights, fifteen of which are specifically \n     provided as constitutional amendments, crime victims have no \n     constitutional rights as it relates to being the victims of \n     crimes. The Crime Victims Rights Amendment will bring much \n     needed balance to our justice system by providing victims the \n     right to be informed, present and heard at all critical \n     stages throughout their respective trials.\n       The opponents of this legislation claim that the amendment \n     would place burdens on the justice system, we cannot afford \n     to forget the intent of justice is to give back to victims, \n     the sense of security, closure and fairness, taken by the \n     perpetrators of their crimes.\n       I applaud you for your efforts and I stand with you as you \n     pursue this important issue.

One of the unfortunate aspects of the debate in these \nhallowed Halls is the fact that many have chosen to ignore the fact \nthat this amendment would actually help poor minority communities beset \nby crime. It would give victims in these communities rights our \ncriminal justice system often deny them through bureaucratic neglect \nand casual racism.\n  Among the many supporters of the amendment, for example, is a group \ncalled Racial Minorities for Victim Justice. This group includes Norm \nEarly, the former district attorney of Denver, CO, and the founding \npresident of the National Black Prosecutors' Association. It includes \nJoseph Myers, executive director of the National Indian Justice Center; \nDavid Osborne, an Asian American who is assistant secretary of the \nState in California; Azim Khamisa; Christine Lopez; Steven Njemanze. \nThe group includes minority victims such as Teresa Baker, whose rights \nwere denied after her son was coldbloodedly murdered in Maryland; \nClementine Garfield, whose two teenage sons were shot in Detroit; Sarah \nFletcher, whose husband Reginald, son Ricky, daughter Crystal, and \nunborn granddaughter were all murdered. They wrote me an eight-page \nletter laying out their thoughts about the amendment. I will read some \nof that letter.\n\n       The undersigned are founding members of Racial Minorities \n     for Victim Justice which strongly support Senate Joint \n     Resolution 3, the Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional \n     Amendment. We are aware that some groups that seek \n     conscientiously to speak for the interests of racial \n     minorities have expressed opposition to your proposed \n     amendment. We claim some understanding of the fundamental \n     concerns that guide their position--concerns we share--but we \n     also believe that they have reached the wrong conclusion on \n     this issue.\n       To put it in the simplest terms, no one in our society \n     stands to benefit more from the adoption of the Victims' \n     Rights Amendment than people of color--for it is our people \n     that suffer the highest rates of victimization in the Nation.\n       Let us start with some common ground on which the great \n     majority of racial minorities stand in this country. \n     Historically, we have had deep suspicions of the agencies of \n     criminal justice. Speaking specifically of the African \n     American experience, it was the agents of criminal justice \n     who were the enforcers of the Fugitive Slave Act and all the \n     Jim Crow laws--often with lawless brutality.\n       While we are proud of recent progress to end this pattern \n     of bigotry in the administration of justice--proud because \n     African Americans and other minorities have led the way in \n     reforming these practices--we are not so naive as to believe \n     that our criminal justice system has grown altogether color-\n     blind.\n       More than most Americans, we believe criminal justice has \n     become too fearful of people of color, too punitive toward \n     minority offenders, with too few opportunities for their \n     treatment and rehabilitation.\n       This is where we share common ground with most members of \n     the minority communities in America. What we cannot \n     understand, however, is why some in those communities have \n     concluded that one way to bring justice agencies into harmony \n     with our higher ideals is to deny the victims of crime any \n     effective and enforceable rights. To us, that makes no sense. \n     We do nothing to improve the fair treatment of minority \n     defendants by impeding the fair treatment of minority \n     victims.\n\n  I couldn't agree with that more. They go on to say:\n\n       Leaders of America's criminal defense bar have testified \n     frequently and heatedly against passage of the Crime Victims' \n     Rights Amendment, citing amorphous dangers to defendants' \n     rights and liberties. And how many cases did they cite where \n     their millions of clients had run afoul of some overzealous, \n     unfair and harmful interpretation of a crime victim's rights \n     already provided in State Constitutions? Two hundred? Twenty? \n     Two? Not even one!\n       It is important to understand that victims' rights statutes \n     echoing those in the proposed Amendment are to be found on \n     the books of every state--buttressed by constitutional \n     amendments in 32 of them. While compliance with those laws is \n     woefully spotty (more on that below) it is fair to estimate \n     that in hundreds of thousands of cases, the victims rights \n     were fully implemented, giving rise to not one single appeal \n     as to the fairness of the application of those laws.\n       In our opinion, people of color should be especially \n     outraged at these disproportionate deprivations of our legal \n     and human rights, for it is our minority communities who \n     disproportionately suffer the pain of criminal victimization.\n\n  I agree with that very much. There is perhaps none but, at most, very \nfew minority victims of violent crime who can afford the counsel to \nprocess their rights under State constitutions, under State laws, or \nunder the patchwork of laws to protect victims across this Nation at \nthis time. Every time, if they do, they will eventually lose because \nthe rights of the defendants or the accused are deeply embedded in the \nheart of this great Constitution. They will find that, in effect, as \nthey press a case in court, they have no standing under the \nConstitution of the United States. That is what this is all about, to \ngive victims standing in the Constitution of the United States. No case \ndemonstrated that more clearly than the Oklahoma City bombing case.\n  As we sum up, I will quickly refresh why that is the case. We had \npassed two statutes--one in 1990--which allowed victims to watch the \ntrial and testify at sentencing. The Victims of Crime Bill of Rights, a \n1990 law, passed by the House, passed by the Senate, and signed by the \nPresident, references the right to be present at all public court \nproceedings related to the offense, unless the court determines that \ntestimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim \nheard other testimony at the trial. In spite of that statute, the court \ndenied the prosecutors' request. The victims made a similar request, \nand the court denied that request, holding that victims lacked standing \nto raise their rights under that statute.\n\n  The prosecutors and the victims were not satisfied. They both had \ngood attorneys, Washington attorneys, Paul Cassell, distinguished \nattorneys. They appealed that to the Court of Appeals of the Tenth \nCircuit. As Professor Cassell, one of the lawyers put it:\n\n       Three months later, a panel of the Tenth Circuit rejected--\n     without oral argument--both the victims' and the United \n     States' claims on jurisdictional grounds. With respect to the \n     victims' challenges, the court concluded that the victims \n     lacked ``standing'' under Article III of the Constitution \n     because they had no ``legally protected interest'' to be \n     present at the trial and consequently had suffered no \n     ``injury in fact'' from their exclusion. The Tenth Circuit \n     also found that victims had no right to attend\n\n[[Page S2976]]\n\n     the trial under any First Amendment right of access. Finally, \n     the Tenth Circuit rejected, on jurisdictional grounds, the \n     appeal and mandamus petition filed by the United States. \n     Efforts by both the victims and the Department to obtain a \n     rehearing were unsuccessful, even with the support of \n     separate briefs urging rehearing from 49 members of Congress, \n     all six Attorneys General in the Tenth Circuit, and some of \n     the leading victims groups in the nation.\n\n  We heard about that. We responded with alacrity. The House passed the \nVictims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997. That statute said, \nnotwithstanding any statute, any rule or other provision of law, a U.S. \ndistrict court shall not order any victim of an offense excluded from \nthe trial of a defendant accused of that offense because such victim \nmay, during the sentencing hearing, testify as the effect of the \noffense on the victim and the victim's family or as to any other factor \nfor which notice is required. That is clear. We cleared it up. We gave \nthem standing by law, passed by the House, passed by the Senate, signed \nby the President of the United States. But the district court then said \nthat this statute might be unconstitutional and postponed a decision \nuntil after the trial. So the judge paid no attention to the House of \nRepresentatives, the Senate of the United States, or to the signature \nof the President of the United States.\n\n  This is why we press this cause today. This is why we do not believe \nthat a statute will ever be adequate to give victims basic rights. Push \nsort of comes to shove. There is an old expression called ``carrying \nwater on both shoulders.'' It is sometimes a way that people feel, in \nour business--that they can appease a group by saying, oh, something \nelse will do. This case, to me, is irrevocable evidence that the \nchallenge of making a statute work is extraordinarily difficult to give \nany minority or impoverished victim any meaningful right in real life. \nSo we intend to continue to press this case.\n  I want to ask the distinguished Senator from Arizona now that he has \nheard the outline of what happened--some people have criticized me, I \nthink, because I have used this case over and over again, but it is the \nonly clearly definable case we have following the passage of two laws \npassed by our bodies to make a judgment--and, true, we are making that \njudgment just on the Tenth Circuit Court--nonetheless, does the Senator \nnot believe it is an applicable judgment to add to this to confirm the \nfact that a statute probably won't work in this situation?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator Feinstein is exactly correct. I think \nit illustrates the inconsistency of the opponents of the amendment. In \nthe first place, they say we should try a statutory remedy. When we try \nthe statutory remedy and the court says you lose, you still don't have \nthe rights--and as Senator Schumer said, the court essentially ignored \nwhat Congress did, and that was offensive to him because he had been \none of the authors of that legislation--we come back and say that \nillustrates the fact that you need a constitutional protection because \nuntil you have that, the courts can't continue to ignore these \nstatutes. Then Senator Schumer said: But courts cannot ignore statutes; \nthey are just like the Constitution. You have to apply statutes. The \nanswer to that is, well, you should, but what is the remedy if you \ndon't?\n  As the Senator pointed out, until we provide standing in a \nconstitutional amendment, if the courts don't abide by the statutes, \nthere is no recourse. That is the bottom line as to why a \nconstitutional amendment is necessary in these kinds of cases.\n  The other inconsistency is the other side says you don't have a lot \nof court decisions overturning statutes for State constitutional \nprotection, so we don't need a constitutional amendment.\n  That is an odd argument. Most of the constitutional protections are \nnot the result of a Supreme Court decision to strike down a statute or \na State provision. In fact, I don't know of any that are, frankly.\n  Most of the constitutional protections for defendants and other \ncitizens have come about because of the recognition that there are \ncertain fundamental rights that need to be protected, and we ought not \nto wait for courts to strike something down in order to assume that it \nis time to propose a constitutional amendment. But if that were the \nproper standard, then we have a clear reason to do so because as the \nSenator from California pointed out, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals \nhas now ruled that is the precedent, and for at least, I think, seven \nStates in the Tenth Circuit, they have a very bad ruling on their \nhands; namely, victims have no standing to assert the rights we \nprovided for in statute. So if that is to be the standard--that you \nhave to have a court decision that proves the need for a constitutional \nprotection--we have it. So whichever way you want to argue it, I think \nthe point is made that we need a constitutional amendment to provide \nreal protection for victims of crime.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator for that comment. I would like to \nfollow up with something. My staff has handed me a letter from \nProfessor Tribe dated today. It is on this point. I think it adds some \nadditional very distinguished credibility to what the Senator is \nsaying. It says:\n\n       I am writing to address one consideration in particular \n     that is highlighted by the proposed Crime Victims Assistance \n     Act, S. 934, whose sponsors--many of whom are my good \n     friends--evidently hope that by this Federal statute they \n     obviate the need for the proposed constitutional amendment. I \n     favor S. 934's enactment, at least in principle. I assume \n     that closer study of the detailed provision than I have been \n     able to undertake would disclose ways in which it might be \n     improved. But minor technical flaws, or even design defects \n     in the contemplated statute would be beside the point and are \n     not my focus. After all, detailed problems with the statute's \n     terms could be cured by redrafting and would not in \n     themselves explain why only an amendment to the Constitution \n     could meet the need for fuller national protection of \n     victims' rights.\n\n  Then he goes on to say this--and I am skipping some:\n\n       The mere brandishment of the banners of defendants' rights \n     or of prosecutorial needs too often suffices to push the \n     needs and interests of victims--to be notified, to observe, \n     to be heard, to have their views considered, to achieve \n     closure, and to be compensated if possible--into the \n     background. Rather than creatively and determinedly seeking \n     ways to protect victims' rights in ways that manage fully to \n     respect the genuine rights, privileges, and needs both of the \n     accuser and the accused, state and local officials are \n     understandably but unfortunately tempted to relegate victims \n     and their rights to second-class status or to shelf them \n     altogether, as merely hortatory and aspirational provisions \n     of law enacted with something much stronger and more \n     operational in mind.\n\n  He essentially goes on to say again why a statute won't work. He \nsays:\n\n       The argument is flawed first, because it fails entirely to \n     come to terms with the basic reasons, set forth above, that \n     merely statutory measures would be unable to combat the \n     deeply rooted attitudinal problems confronting victims and \n     their claims of right; and second, because insofar as it \n     assumes broad congressional power to act under Section 5 of \n     the Fourteenth Amendment, it is simply ignorant of the series \n     of decisions in the 1990s and reaching into 2000, beginning \n     with the invalidation of the Religious Freedom Restoration \n     Act and continuing with the invalidation of provisions of the \n     Patent Reform Act and the Age Discrimination Employment Act, \n     in which the modern Supreme Court has dramatically curtailed \n     the legislative authority of Congress to use its Section 5 \n     power to protect interests that Congress, but not yet the \n     Court, is prepared to recognize as constitutional rights, or \n     even to protect Court-recognized constitutional rights in \n     circumstances, or by means, not shown in the legislative \n     record to be ``necessary.''\n\n  What Professor Tribe at this stage is adding to this is that any \nstatute passed by us does not take into consideration the courts \nstriking down of the Religion Freedom Restoration Act, the Patent \nReform Act, the Age Discrimination and Employment Act. He is saying \nthat the authority of Congress is now more limited to use its section 5 \npower to protect interests that we think are valid.\n  The striking down of these bills, in effect, makes the \nconstitutionality of anything that we might pass by way of a Federal \nstatute extraordinarily vulnerable. I think this is new information \nwhich we have not had a chance to analyze and consider which may enable \nus to come back and fight another day.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, another point Senator Feinstein made \nyesterday which people need to continue to focus on is that a Federal \nstatute is going to apply to Federal crimes. A U.S. constitutional \namendment applies to all cases in all courts in every State, whether at \nthe trial court level in the county--we call it superior court in \nArizona--all the way to any other court,\n\n[[Page S2977]]\n\nincluding Federal courts. But a statute that we pass applies to Federal \ncourt trials for the most serious crimes. In Federal law, that accounts \nfor about 1 percent of the victims of violent crime in the entire \ncountry.\n  Almost always the local police catch the perpetrator, that \nperpetrator is tried by the local county prosecutor in the county \ncourts, and the appeals go up through the State court process. \nSometimes they can jump over to the Federal court because of a \nconstitutional issue involved. But except on military reservations, \nIndian reservations, certain kinds of kidnapping cases, and things of \nthat sort where it is not a Federal case, a Federal statute doesn't \napply.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Of course that is right. I think the Senator from \nArizona said it very well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notes that the time of the Senator \nfrom California has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from California may have time \nyielded to her from someone else in her party to advance the rest of \nher argument. She might find out how much time there is.\n  I inquire of the Chair. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 2 hours 13 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I shall not take nearly that much time. It is my \nunderstanding that I can't yield any of that time to Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has time under the cloture rule to \nyield time to other Senators.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent to yield 1 hour of my time to \nSenator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right as manager of the \nbill.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate it. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I \nthank the Chair.\n  Let me briefly summarize. I sincerely believe that the only way to \nafford victims of violent crime standing under the Constitution to be \nable to assert a right that is provided is by amendment to the \nConstitution. I don't use my judgment. This is the judgment of the most \ndistinguished legal scholars.\n  I know there are strong forces at work in this in front of the scenes \nand behind the scenes. I know there are some people who believe what we \nare trying to do is weaken defendants' rights. That is simply not \ncorrect. Defendants' rights, as I see them, are basically rights that \ndo not come into collision with the rights we would afford the victims. \nThey are totally different rights. If there is a collision, our view is \nthat the judge then provides the balancing mechanism. This gives the \nvictim a standing in law to assert the right that, in a sense, can't be \ntrusted.\n  This issue goes down--let me be very candid--on one phrase. That one \nphrase is the addition of language that would say nothing in this \nConstitution would abridge the right of a defendant as provided by this \nConstitution.\n  That is a paraphrase of what it is.\n  The Department of Justice insists on that language. We will not get \nadministration support, I believe, without that language. The victims \nmovement believes they would not have sufficient standing in these \nrights to really assert them in a meaningful way unless they were able \nto be balanced against the rights of the defendant.\n  The question I wanted to ask my friend and colleague, Senator Kyl, is \nI think our challenge in proceeding may be how we could reconcile this \nwith the very real concern of victims that they once and for all--\nalbeit for a limited right but nonetheless real rights--have standing \nfor those rights in a court of law.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator Feinstein has touched on a central \npoint because none of the advocates for victims have ever sought to \ndeny one single right to the defendant. In point of fact, the victims' \nrights that we protect do not deny or abridge the defendants' rights \nunder the Constitution. It is not our intention, and it doesn't happen. \nWe have been willing to acknowledge that in a variety of ways and in a \nvariety of words in the Constitution.\n  We are not willing to say if there is ever a case in which the \ndefendant asserts a right under the Constitution then that right \nautomatically wins over any of these victims' rights. What we said, and \nwhat people in the Department of Justice and the President and others \nhave agreed with, is there should be a balancing just as there is a \nbalancing of two constitutional rights, defendants' rights to a speedy \nand public trial, a fair trial, and the right of free press.\n  When the press wants to get into the courtroom, sometimes, as we all \nknow, the judges say: No. We are only going to allow a limited number \nof certain kinds of media in the courtroom. We don't want a media \ncircus in the courtroom. That wouldn't be fair to the defendant.\n  The media says: Wait a minute. We have a first amendment right.\n  The defendant says: I have a constitutional right, too, which amounts \nto a right for a fair trial.\n  The judge says: You are both right, and you are both going to get \nyour rights vindicated, but neither of you have an absolute right that \nexcludes any other consideration. The judge says to the defendant: I am \nnot going to allow your case to be prejudiced by a media circus. Media, \nyou are going to have to restrain yourselves to the following \nconditions. Judges say that every day.\n  The defendant has a right to sit at his trial. But he can't sit there \nif he is going to be yelling, screaming, and jumping up and down and \nthreatening people. The judge has a way to control his courtroom, and \nso on.\n  We are perfectly willing to make it crystal clear in our language \nthat the enumeration of these rights for victims does not abridge any \nrights guaranteed in the Constitution for defendants or those accused \nof crime. We are unwilling to say, if there has to be any balancing, \nthe defendant always wins. That would deny exactly what we are trying \nto achieve for the victims, which is some equal consideration under the \nConstitution for their fairness given all of the things we have rightly \ndone for defendants.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I think the analogy is actually \na very good one. I know defendants' rights are extraordinarily \nprivileged, and well they should be. Senator Kyl and I have discussed \nthis. We believe that our amendment does not collide, and we understand \nhow victims feel.\n  I think one of the points is that throughout all of this we have \ncommunicated with victims groups. We have been their advocates. We have \ntried to march to the sound of their drum.\n  The tragedy for me, today, is that we are so close that, if we could \nbridge that one gap, getting the support of the Justice Department, the \nPresident's support, the Vice President's support, perhaps we might, on \nour side, pick up some votes. That one inability to reach this kind of \nconsensus within the timeframe we have, in view of the feelings of our \ncolleagues, is really the necessity of what we are doing here this \nafternoon. But I think at this stage there is an impasse. Does my \ncolleague agree?\n  Mr. KYL. I do. If I may read one paragraph from a piece written by \nProfessor Paul Cassell, I think it helps to elucidate what we are \ntalking about, if the Senator would not mind.\n  We are talking about potentially conflicting rights under the \nConstitution. Senator Biden has made this point. Hopefully, he will be \nhere a little bit later to speak to this, but he made the point he \ncan't see there ever being an irreconcilable conflict between the \ndefendant's rights and the victim's rights, and in one sense I think he \nis absolutely correct because you can vindicate two conflicting rights \nthrough a balancing test. But the fact is, there is only one situation \nI can think of in which you even have that conflict, and that is the \nright to attend a trial, where the defendant would say, it is not fair \nto me if the victim or the victim's family attends the trial, and the \nvictim's family or the victim says, wait a minute, that's one of my \nmost fundamental rights, and the Senator guaranteed that in this \nprovision.\n  There are ways to accommodate both the defendant's and victim's \nrights, of\n\n[[Page S2978]]\n\ncourse. At least the Senator and I understand that, but there are some \nwho find that very difficult and troubling. But here is the analogous \nsituation which I think makes our case. This is what Professor Paul \nCassell says:\n\n       Confirmation of the constitutional worthiness of victims' \n     rights comes from the judicial treatment of an analogous \n     right: the claim of the media to a constitutionally protected \n     interest in attending trials. In Richmond Newspapers v. \n     Virginia, the Court agreed that the First Amendment \n     guaranteed the right of the public and the press to attend \n     criminal trials. Since that decision, few have argued that \n     the media's right to attend trials is somehow unworthy of \n     constitutional protection, suggesting a national consensus \n     that attendance rights to criminal trials are properly the \n     subject of constitutional law. Yet the current doctrine \n     produces what must be regarded as a stunning disparity in the \n     way courts handle claims of access to court proceedings. \n     Consider, for example, two issues actually litigated in the \n     Oklahoma City bombing case. The first was the request of an \n     Oklahoma City television station for access to subpoenas for \n     documents issued through the court. The second was a request \n     for various family members of the murdered victims to attend \n     the trial, discussed previously. My sense is that the \n     victims' request should be entitled to at least as much \n     respect as the media request. Yet under the law that exists \n     today, the television station has a First Amendment interest \n     in access to the documents while the victims' families have \n     no First Amendment interest in challenging their exclusion \n     from the trial. The point here is not to argue that victims \n     deserve greater constitutional protection than the press, but \n     simply that if press interests can be read into the \n     Constitution without somehow violating the ``sacredness of \n     the covenant,'' the same can be done for victims.\n\n  That is the end of Professor Cassell's quotation, the point being--to \nthose who say the Constitution is sacred; we cannot change it--it \nincludes rights of the media to attend trials, but somehow it would be \nwrong to grant those same rights to victims. That, indeed, is a \ndisparity. To the extent a defendant might say, ``but I don't want the \nvictim or the victim's family in the courtroom,'' just as the \nConstitution says, but there is a right that we have to balance with \nyour concerns--and that is the media's right--we would be saying here: \nThe victim also has some consideration here, and the court needs to \ntake that into account in deciding the circumstances under which \nvictims and victims' families would be present.\n  If we were to somehow insert language that made it possible for \ncourts to rule that the defendant would always win in the case of such \nan assertion, then we would have, I think, perpetrated a cruel hoax on \nvictims who would think they had something that in fact they would not \nhave. It would be similar to what victims experienced when they proudly \nwent into court with their new statute that the Congress had passed, \nsaying: ``Now, judge, we have a right to attend the trial,'' and he \nignored it. If we put it in the Constitution, the judges can't ignore \nit.\n  But if we said in the Constitution: However, the defendant is always \ngoing to prevail in the case of a conflict, then that would be a cruel \nhoax. I think we have gone so far as to suggest we are willing to \nacknowledge that the rights enumerated for victims do not abridge \nrights guaranteed in the Constitution to defendants. I do not know how \nmuch more clearly we can say that. It leads us, and those who are \nsupportive, to conclude, if that is not good enough, that perhaps there \nreally is not a desire on the part of those on the other side to come \nto an agreement here in a way that could permit us to have a chance of \nsucceeding in this debate this week or next.\n\n  That is the unfortunate state of play. Senator Feinstein is \nabsolutely correct. Perhaps in the ensuing weeks we will have an \nopportunity to explore other ways of expressing this that make it clear \nwe are not taking anything away from defendants. But by the same token, \nwe have to give meaningful rights to victims.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, I think the Senator has summarized it very \nwell. I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor. I know \nthere are some other distinguished Senators who wish to come to the \nfloor and speak.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, until those in opposition wish to be here, \nthen, I will speak to close out, really, what I have to say about this. \nI would like to do two things: Just to reiterate a couple of \ncircumstances why this is necessary, and, second, to respond to some of \nthe arguments that have been adduced against what we propose.\n  Why do we need these rights? Suppose your daughter was raped and \nmurdered and you wanted to attend the trial and you were told that, \nunder the law, you were going to have to sit outside the courtroom \nevery day. The defendant, the defendant's family and friends, they can \nbe in the courtroom, they can watch the trial, but you are going to \nhave to sit outside on the bench in the hallway. That is not fair. It \ntears at the gut of those who have been victimized already by the \ncommission of the crime that hurt or killed their loved one.\n  Suppose you pick up the newspaper someday and read that the person \nwho raped you, or assaulted you, is out on the street. He had been \nincarcerated. Your testimony helped put him there. You have no idea he \nis running free. His may be the knock on your door or the person at the \nother end of the telephone which rings. You did not get notice of his \nparole hearing. You could not even go down and tell the parole board \nhow vicious a person this was and why they ought to think twice before \nreleasing him on parole. You did not even have a chance to go down and \nsay, ``Will you please consider my safety in establishing conditions \nfor his release, that he has to stay away from me,'' for example.\n  We are talking about things that are serious, not frivolous. These \nare real cases. Both of the examples I cited are real cases--multiple \ncases, I might add. What are the arguments against it? One argument is \nit is too long and specific. Right after that, we heard it is too \ngeneral. Senator Schumer said we should just have a general statement \nabout the fairness that victims are entitled to and leave it at that. \nOthers say that would be far too general. How would we ever define \n``unreasonable,'' which is one of the words in our amendment here? Of \ncourse, one could have argued that same thing about some of the \nprotections for defendants in the Bill of Rights. How will we define \n``unreasonable search and seizure,'' it could have been argued. We have \ndone all right on that.\n\n  We were fairly specific about the enumerations of these rights \nbecause we didn't want to take anything away from defendants. We wanted \nit to be crystal clear exactly what the rights were so nobody could \ncontend they went further than they go, so that nobody could argue we \nmight be stepping on the toes of a defendant. We didn't want to step on \nthe defendant's toes.\n  We wanted to make sure the government wouldn't deny victims access to \ncertain points in the criminal justice process. We were very careful to \ndefine this. Indeed, the Department of Justice met with us on numerous \noccasions and said we would have to be more precise in our description \nbecause they could envision possible problems if we do not nail it \ndown. We nailed it down. That took a few words.\n  Then we were criticized for having too long an amendment; it is \nlonger than the Bill of Rights. We pointed out, it is not longer than \nthe Bill of Rights. Indeed, our amendment is shorter than all of the \nrights guaranteed to defendants in the Constitution. The defendants' \nrights consume 348 words; the victims' rights consume 179 words. There \nare 307 words in our amendment, excluding the purely technical \nprovision.\n  Isn't it amazing we have gotten down to a word count, if that is one \nof the big objections of opponents? ``It is a little too long.'' It is \nnot too long. If it were shorter, their argument would be it is not \nspecific enough, we need to be more specific--and that takes more \nwords.\n  Perhaps the least argument--and there will be others propounding this \nargument--is that because the Constitution is sacred, it should not be \namended. Maybe it is appropriate to read something in the sacred \ndocument, article V: Whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it \nnecessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution . . . when \nratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States, it \nbecomes effective as part of this Constitution.\n  Thomas Jefferson said: I am not an advocate for frequent changes in \nlaws in the Constitution, but laws and institutions must go hand in \nhand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more \ndeveloped, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths \ndiscovered and manners and\n\n[[Page S2979]]\n\nopinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must \nadvance to keep pace with the times.\n  Indeed, Thomas Jefferson also said: Happily for us, when we find our \nConstitution is defective and insufficient to secure the happiness of \nour people, we can assemble with all the coldness of philosophers and \nset them to rights, while every other nation on Earth must have \nrecourse to arms to amend or restore their constitutions.\n  It is certainly a reflection of our wonderful United States of \nAmerica and our Constitution that from time to time we have found it \nnecessary to grant rights in this sacred document: the right to vote, \nthe right to vote when you are 18, the right to vote and not to be \ndefined by one's sex, the right to a speedy trial. These are rights \nthat were granted by amendment to citizens after this sacred document \nwas written. We all agree with the proposition that it is a wonderful \ndocument, a sacred document, a document that ought not lightly be added \nto, which has a wonderful and glorious history. Indeed, I submit that \nsome of the most profound and glorious aspects of the history of this \nConstitution are found in its amendments.\n\n  To suggest that somehow those who propose an amendment to the \nConstitution are doing a great disservice and are assaulting the \nConstitution is itself a great disservice to the process set forth in \nthe Constitution.\n  It is said that the Constitution ordinarily precluded the government \nfrom affecting the rights of citizens, whereas we are granting rights \nto people. I talked about three or four amendments that granted rights \nto people: the right to vote if you are 18, the right to vote if you \nare a woman, the right to a speedy trial. Those were rights granted to \ncitizens. Other rights are expressed in terms of preventing the \ngovernment from intruding on your rights. For example, the government \nwill not preclude you from having a speedy trial. They will not deny \nyou the right to a speedy trial. They won't deny you the right to \ncounsel.\n  You can express it either way--as a grant of a right or the \ngovernment not denying you the ability to do these things. We say the \ngovernment cannot exclude you from the courtroom. They can't exclude \nyou from the trial. We are not really saying you have a right to attend \nthe trial; we are saying you have a right not to be excluded from the \ntrial. There is a difference. The former could lead to assertions that \nthe government should pay for your getting to the trial, that your \nemployer should have to let you off work or pay. We don't address that. \nWe only say if you show up, you get to attend; the government cannot \nexclude you.\n  Some of the other rights are expressed in terms of direct rights. \nHowever, they all infer that the government can't exclude you from \nthese proceedings. We are doing exactly what other amendments to the \nConstitution have done. They are similar rights. The right of the press \nto be able to cover a trial, it seems to me, should be no greater than \nthe right of a victim to be present at the trial. What is the \ndifference? I conclude by challenging anybody to tell me what the \ndifference is between granting the media the right to attend a trial \nand granting the victim in the case the right to attend the trial.\n  I don't understand why there is such a visceral negative reaction to \nwhat we are trying to do. If you have ever been a victim or been part \nof a tragedy that has affected others, you know how much they want to \nbring closure to the event, why they want to witness the criminal \njustice process that brings the matter to a close, why they want to \nparticipate at a couple of the stages, particularly at the time of \nsentencing and also at the time of a conditional release so that their \nsafety can be considered, as well as the safety of others.\n  No one opposing our amendment has suggested that those are unworthy \nof protection. Rather, they have said we can do it by statute. But what \ndid we find yesterday when we looked at the data according to the \nNational Institute of Justice? After 18 years of Federal and State \nstatutes and State constitutional provisions, looking at the statistics \nfrom the States that do it the best, that have the most stringent \nrequirement for notice, fewer than 60 percent of victims were notified \nof the sentencing hearing and fewer than 40 percent were notified of \nthe pretrial release of the defendant.\n  As I said yesterday, would we consider those adequate percentages for \ndefendants being given their Miranda warnings, something which isn't \neven in the Constitution? No. But somehow we think it is OK that \nstatutes provide notice to only 40 percent of the people who want to be \npresent at the parole board, or at least have the opportunity to be \npresent, to say, please, don't let my assailant go; he will hurt \nsomeone. We are no longer talking about somebody accused of a crime; we \nare talking about somebody who has been convicted and who has been \nserving time for the commission of that crime.\n\n  I mentioned the case of Patricia Pollard--because it is a case from \nArizona--who was brutally raped and left to die. She wasn't told that \nthe parole board was meeting to consider and then eventually decided to \nlet her assailant out of prison on a home arrest kind of program. By \naccident, she was made aware of it. When she went back to the parole \nboard and asked them to reconsider their decision, after hearing her \nstory, they kept him in prison.\n  When I asked her if she thought her life was in danger had he gotten \nout, she said: Maybe he would have tracked me down, but, frankly, I was \na random opportunity for him. I came along at just the time he wanted \nto do this to somebody, and he did it to me. Mostly I was concerned \nwhat would happen to somebody else because if he got out he would be \nsure to do this to somebody else.\n  This is what we are talking about. This is not frivolous. This is not \ntrivial. This is people's lives we are talking about. When opponents \nsay, we can protect it by statute, we say, the State of Arizona had a \nvery good statute. In fact, it was better than a statute; it was a \nconstitutional provision in the State. She still didn't get notice. In \nfact, 60 percent of people don't get notice under these constitutional \nprovisions and State statutes.\n  Opponents say: That is good enough; maybe we can pass a Federal \nstatute.\n  We say a Federal statute can only affect 1 percent of all of these \ncases, and there is little reason to believe a Federal statute would be \nobserved any better than State constitutional provisions are, as the \nOklahoma City bombing case reveals.\n  I am at a loss. I agree with Senator Feinstein. We are moved by these \ncases. We are moved by the people. We want to help. Everybody wants to \nhelp. Even opponents, I am convinced, want to help. So let's do \nsomething about it. It is not doing something effective about it to \nfall back on the notion: Well, we will just rely on another statute; \nlet's pass another law. That is not the answer.\n  We are at this point now because we have not done enough to educate \nour colleagues, and I will accept part of the blame for that. I should \nhave spent a lot more time--although I must confess my colleagues got \ntired of me coming around saying: Are you sure you wouldn't like to \nhear a little bit more about this? Maybe we should have tried a little \nharder to say: Will you please listen one more time to our plea?\n  What has happened is a very superficial mantra of inaccuracies and \nfalsehoods have persuaded colleagues to oppose this to the extent they \nwould not be willing to allow it to come to a vote. In other words, \nwhen we would seek to bring this to a final vote, we would not be able \nto stop the talking, to stop the filibuster, in effect, to get 60 of \nour colleagues to agree to bring the matter to a vote or to prevent \nnongermane amendments. There had been a suggestion by some that if we \nproceed, then we can expect a whole flurry of amendments that have \nnothing to do with what we are talking about.\n  Obviously, we do not want to tie up our colleagues' time with that, \nso we come to the unhappy conclusion that we have more work to do.\n  The good news is that we prevailed with 80-some votes--perhaps the \nSenator can recall exactly how many votes we got on the cloture motion \nto proceed. But it was over 80, as I recall. We have 41 cosponsors of \nour amendment now, which is real progress. We got a good bipartisan \nvote out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  This is the first time this Federal constitutional amendment has been \nbrought to the floor of either House. We have reached a real milestone. \nWe\n\n[[Page S2980]]\n\nhave done well. Most constitutional amendments never pass. All of them \ntake a long time. I do not know of any, at least in modern history, \nthat passed the first time they were presented on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The fact we have been thwarted part way down the road temporarily, \nwhile a setback of sorts, should not dissuade those advocates or crime \nvictims in their efforts. As Senator Feinstein said, we will be back, \nand hopefully next time when we are back, more of our colleagues will \nhave had an opportunity to study this carefully, more victims and \nvictims' rights organizations will have had an opportunity to visit \nwith Senators and Representatives, and we will have been able to \npersuade a sufficient number of them to allow us to proceed to a final \nvote.\n  While there is some sorrow in our inability to bring this to \nconclusion today, I am buoyed by the prospect and the fact we have at \nleast gotten to this point.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n\n  Mr. KYL. I yield.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also am buoyed by the prospects. As \nwe go through this more and more, I understand more and more what is \nhappening behind the scenes. I do want to enter into the record this \nlatest letter from Professor Larry Tribe. Senator Kyl will be \ninterested in one quote. He says deep into his letter:\n\n       I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of \n     ostensibly ``liberal'' lawyers and scholars who do not look \n     askance when they learn of my support for this amendment. \n     Friends who otherwise respect me and admire my work have a \n     difficult time, it seems, assimilating the notion that a \n     liberal champion of defendants' rights--something I think I \n     have been all my life--should take seriously the idea that \n     the victims of violent crime actually have ``rights'' that \n     the Constitution should compel government to take seriously \n     and to treat with respect, rather than merely being the \n     unfortunate--well, victims--of criminal predations that the \n     state is charged with combating, in a system where the only \n     ``rights'' worth naming and treating as such of course belong \n     to those unfortunate enough to find themselves on the wrong \n     end of the machinery of criminal justice. With all respect, I \n     do not share that perspective. Rather, I regard its deeply \n     ingrained nature as the principal argument for the conclusion \n     that statutory measures will never fully suffice.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print Professor Tribe's \nletter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                Harvard University\n\n\n                                                   Law School,\n\n                                    Cambridge, MA, April 27, 2000.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I have previously set forth my \n     reasons for supporting S.J. Res. 3, the proposed Victims' \n     Rights Amendment now under consideration in the Senate, and \n     little purpose would be served by my repeating those reasons \n     here. I understand the objections some have raised to the \n     proposed amendment and have enormous respect for many who \n     oppose the measure, but on balance I am persuaded that the \n     considerations favoring the amendment outweigh those against \n     it, even placing an appropriately skeptical thumb on the \n     scale's negative side.\n       I am writing to address one consideration in particular \n     that is highlighted by the proposed Crime Victims' Assistance \n     Act, S. 934, whose sponsors, many of whom are my good \n     friends, evidently hope by this federal statute to obviate \n     the need for the proposed constitutional amendment. I favor \n     S. 934's enactment, at least in principle. I assume that \n     closer study of its detailed provisions that I have been able \n     to undertake would disclose ways in which it might be \n     improved, but minor technical flaws or even design defects in \n     the contemplated statute would be beside the point and are \n     not my focus here. After all, detailed problems with the \n     statute's terms could be cured by redrafting and would not in \n     themselves explain why only an amendment to the Constitution \n     could meet the need for fuller national protection of \n     victims' rights.\n       My concerns are different ones. First, I am concerned that, \n     as the authors of S. 934 doubtless realized given how they \n     wrote their bill, it does nothing directly for the vast \n     majority of crime victims--those victimized by violations of \n     state or local rather than federal law. To be sure, S. 934 \n     would offer the states money for pilot projects and the like, \n     and money of course helps, but the basic reasons for the \n     dramatic underprotection of state crime victims are more \n     attitudinal than fiscal: Even when states enact victims' \n     rights measures of their own in response to pressures from \n     constituents, there is a tendency to ignore or underenforce \n     such rights whenever they appear to rub up against either the \n     rights of the criminally accused or the needs or wishes of \n     the prosecution. And I do mean to say ``appear to rub up \n     against,'' for the problem I have in mind arises in those \n     situations where a careful analysis would reveal that the \n     seeming conflict between victims' rights and the rights of \n     the accused or the interests of the state is a false or a \n     readily avoidable one. The mere brandishment of the banners \n     of defendants' rights or of prosecutorial needs too often \n     suffices to push the needs and interests of victims--to be \n     notified, to observe, to be heard, to have their views \n     considered, to achieve closure, to be compensated if \n     possible--into the background. Rather than creatively and \n     determinedly seeking ways to protect victims' rights in \n     ways that manage fully to respect the genuine rights, \n     privileges, and needs both of the accuser and of the \n     accused, state and local officials are understandably but \n     unfortunately tempted to relegate victims and their rights \n     to second-class status or to shelve them altogether, \n     treating as merely hortatory and aspirational provisions \n     of law enacted with something much stronger and more \n     operational in mind.\n       State statutory and constitutional provisions cannot \n     overcome this phenomenon so long as the only parties whose \n     rights receive federal constitutional recognition, \n     recognition that reinforces and amplifies traditional habits \n     of mind at the state and local levels, are the defendants in \n     criminal prosecutions. And S. 934, which obviously could not \n     touch the actual conduct of state and local criminal \n     investigations, prosecutions, and adjudications, is \n     manifestly incapable of affecting this pervasive tendency.\n       Indeed--and this is my second major concern--even in the \n     federal criminal context within which S. 934 would operate, \n     the proposed statute would take effect against the background \n     of a legal culture in which the very notion of ``victims' \n     rights'' has traditionally been dismissed either as a vague \n     metaphor or as an atavistic throwback to a primitive era of \n     private justice. In a federal universe within which victims \n     are pervasively perceived as mere passive beneficiaries of \n     government protection--as bystanders to the majesty of the \n     criminal process rather than as entitled participants in that \n     process--a merely statutory codification of certain \n     ``rights,'' removable by the grace of the same Congress that \n     bestowed them, is most unlikely to effect the pervasive \n     attitudinal change that is so badly needed. When push comes \n     to shove, even where adequately protecting victims does not \n     in truth entail any abridgment of the federal constitutional \n     rights of criminal defendants or of the needs of government \n     prosecutors to protect the public and vindicate the law, any \n     superficially plausible protest from either the prosecution's \n     table or the defense bar is likely to shove victims and their \n     S. 934 rights back into the shadows, from which a federal \n     judiciary steeped in precisely the same legal culture is \n     unlikely to rescue them.\n       Evidence of the depth and pervasiveness of this basic \n     attitude, and of the view that to defend the rights of \n     victims is to engage in a primitive exercise in emotionalism, \n     incompatible with the structure of our adversary system of \n     justice and with the rational character of the modern \n     bureaucratic state, is the ferocity and generality of the \n     opposition to a constitutional amendment to protect victims' \n     rights, at least among the elite and especially in the \n     supposedly enlightened circles with which I like to think I \n     associate. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number \n     of ostensibly ``liberal'' lawyers and scholars who do not \n     look askance when they learn of my support for this \n     amendment. Friends who otherwise respect me and admire my \n     work have a difficult time, it seems, assimilating the notion \n     that a liberal champion of defendants' rights--something I \n     think I have been all my life--should take seriously the idea \n     that the victims of violent crime actually have ``rights'' \n     that the Constitution should compel government to take \n     seriously and to treat with respect, rather than merely being \n     the unfortunate--well, victims--of criminal predations that \n     the state is charged with combating, in a system where the \n     only ``rights'' worth naming and treating as such of course \n     belong to those unfortunate enough to find themselves on the \n     wrong end of the machinery of criminal justice. With all \n     respect, I do not share that perspective. Rather, I regard \n     its deeply ingrained nature as the principal argument for \n     the conclusion that statutory measures will never fully \n     suffice.\n       Permit me to add one point before closing: I want to \n     address the argument that S. 934 should not be faulted for \n     failing to reach state proceedings because, after all, it is \n     designed only to operate at the federal level, and because \n     either state statutes or state constitutional provisions or \n     perhaps federal civil rights-like legislation enacted under \n     Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment could fill the state \n     and local gap that S. 934 necessarily leaves unfilled. That \n     argument is flawed first, because it fails entirely to come \n     to terms with the basic reasons, set forth above, that merely \n     statutory measures would be unable to combat the deeply \n     rooted attitudinal problems confronting victims and their \n     claims of right; and second, because, insofar as it assumes \n     broad congressional power to act under Section 5 of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment, it is simply ignorant of the series of \n     decisions in the 1990s and reaching into 2000, beginning with \n     the invalidation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and \n     continuing with the invalidation of provisions of the Patent \n     Reform\n\n[[Page S2981]]\n\n     Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, in which \n     the modern Supreme Court has dramatically curtailed the \n     legislative authority of Congress to use its Section 5 power \n     to protect interests that Congress, but not yet the Court, is \n     prepared to recognize as constitutional rights, or even to \n     protect Court-recognized constitutional rights in \n     circumstances, or by means, not shown in the legislative \n     record to be ``necessary.''\n       In sum, although S. 934 represents an intelligent step in \n     the much-needed strategy of operationalizing and \n     institutionalizing the rights of victims, neither by itself \n     nor as part of a series of measures, both federal and state, \n     can it hope to provide a satisfactory substitute for the more \n     fundamental constitutional step represented by S.J. Res. 3, a \n     step that I consider not only wise but necessary despite--and \n     (paradoxically) in part because of--its current lack of \n     appeal for ``the usual suspects'' on the criminal justice \n     scene, both in the defense and civil liberties bars and among \n     prosecutors and their champions.\n       I hope you find these observations to be of some use, and I \n     apologize for my inability to get them to you sooner. I wish \n     you well in the difficult effort to obtain passage of this \n     amendment by the requisite two-thirds vote and, should you \n     succeed in that respect, in the onerous effort to win its \n     ratification by the requisite three-fourths of the state \n     legislatures.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Laurence H. Tribe.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I extend my deepest thanks to \nProfessor Tribe for his letter and for his support. We will certainly \nbe consulting both he and Professor Cassell again and come back to \nfight again another day.\n  I want to say something to the victims who have been so heartrending \nin this process. Those of us who are political come to grips with the \nsophisticated lobbying around this place. One of the things I have seen \nin the people whom we represent is they are real people. They have been \nmaimed, they have been harmed, they have been hurt, and with this--I \nhave seen this in the past when I was active in the criminal justice \nsystem--victims almost become catatonic. They almost become unable to \ngo out and do the lobbying that is necessary to move something such as \nthis.\n  I want them to know how much we identify with their cause, how much \nwe intend to continue to pursue this cause. It is a just cause. It is a \ncause that deserves remedy and recognition in the Constitution of the \nUnited States. It is a cause where, once victims have these rights, \nthey lost them.\n  This Congress--the other body and our body--should provide these \nrights again. I am hopeful that in the coming years, we will be able to \ncontinue our work on this. Perhaps we will be able to solve this one \ndilemma of the balancing. It is interesting; anytime one reads a \nstatement by the President or by the Attorney General, it mentions the \nbalancing of these rights. Yet when we write something in the \nConstitution which, in effect, would provide for this, it brings out \nthe criminal defense bar; it brings out the liberal scholars; it brings \nout people who say: You can't do this. You can't give victims these \nrights.\n  The cause is just that they have these rights. A statute, we believe, \nwill be unable to provide them, but as to their standing in the \nConstitution, there is a time and there is a place, I predict, when \nthat standing will happen and take place.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to add something to a point Senator \nFeinstein just made. I do not think she would take offense at my \nmentioning what occurred in my office about 4 hours ago.\n  We were summarizing the events and what led to the inability to get \nthis across the goal line this week. I said it is partially my fault \nfor not bringing more victims to the Senate to talk directly with \nSenators and share their personal stories.\n  I told that to Roberta Roper, who heads up the Stephanie Roper \nFoundation. Stephanie Roper was brutally murdered, and Roberta, her \nmother, has carried this cause in Stephanie's name. They do a lot of \ngood in terms of victim support, in addition to victim advocacy.\n  She said: You have to understand, though, we are conditioned not to \npresent these stories in an emotional, personal way. We have been told \nover and over again in the court that ``there can be no display of \nemotion.'' Those are the words the judges used. I have been told that a \ndisplay of emotion would be wrong.\n  Now, think about that. Part of what makes us great as a people is the \nwillingness to act out of our heart as well as our mind. We should \nnever do incorrect things or unintelligent things, acting purely on the \nbasis of emotion, but nor should we deny that emotion can be a potent \nforce in developing public policy.\n  I tried to tell Roberta that I think it was a mistake, on my part, \nnot to appreciate what she was telling me, not to understand it in \nadvance, and not to counsel her to go ahead in this environment and \nexpress it in emotional terms. This is not a court of law. This is \nwhere the people's business is done.\n  I believe that until one fully appreciates what a victim goes \nthrough, it is hard to appreciate the necessity for what we are doing \nhere.\n  Perhaps I could conclude by reading a paragraph again from the \nremarks of Professor Paul Cassell before the Judiciary Committee.\n  He said:\n\n       The available social science research suggests that the \n     primary barrier to successful implementation of victims' \n     rights is ``the socialization of [lawyers] in a legal culture \n     and structure that do not recognize the victim as a \n     legitimate party in criminal proceedings.''\n\n  He is talking about a professor, a colleague of his, who disagrees \nwith our position, Professor Mosteller.\n  He says:\n\n       Professor Mosteller seems to agree generally with this \n     view, explaining that ``officials fail to honor victims' \n     rights largely as a result of inertia and past learning, \n     insensitivity to the unfamiliar needs of victims, lack of \n     training, and inadequate or misdirected institutional \n     incentives.'' A constitutional amendment, reflecting the \n     instructions of the nation to its criminal justice system, is \n     perfectly designed to attack these problems and develop a new \n     legal culture supportive of victims. To be sure, one can \n     paint the prospect of such a change in culture as ``entirely \n     speculative.'' Yet this means nothing more than that, until \n     the Amendment passes, we will not have an opportunity to \n     precisely assay its positive effects. Constitutional \n     amendments have changed our legal culture in other areas, and \n     clearly the logical prediction is that a victims' amendment \n     would go a long way towards curing official indifference. \n     This hypothesis is also consistent with the findings of the \n     National Institute of Justice study on state implementation \n     of victims' rights. The study concluded that ``[w]here legal \n     protection is strong, victims are more likely to be aware of \n     their rights, to participate in the criminal justice system, \n     to view criminal justice system officials favorably, and to \n     express more overall satisfaction with the system. It is hard \n     to imagine any stronger protection of victims' rights than a \n     federal constitutional amendment. Moreover, we can \n     confidently expect that those who will most often benefit \n     from the enhanced consistency in protecting victims' rights \n     will be members of racial minorities, the poor, and other \n     disempowered groups. Such victims are the first to suffer \n     under the current, ``lottery'' implementation of victims' \n     rights.\n\n  I think that expresses well the reason for the frustration we have \nshared, the reason so many of our colleagues have come here repeating \nthe mantra of the legal profession that it has never been this way \nbefore. Maybe it is time to change the way things have been. That is \nwhy we have been so strongly in support of this amendment.\n  I see one of the opponents of the amendment is here. I know he wishes \nto speak. Therefore, let me conclude my remarks by again thanking \nSenator Feinstein for her stalwart, effective support and her desire to \ncontinue this battle on behalf of the victims of crime.\n  I assure you, Mr. President, that even though we will be withdrawing \nour motion to proceed on S.J. Res. 3, we will continue to meet with, \nand work with, anyone who wishes to work with us on this--opponents and \nproponents--to try to get it into the condition that will finally be \napproved by two-thirds of this body and two-thirds of the other body. \nThat is our challenge. That is our commitment. It is our promise that \nwe will continue in this effort.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the sponsors of S.J. Res. \n3 have decided to withdraw their proposal to amend the Constitution. \nOne of the reasons they gave for their decision is that the many \nSenators who came to the floor to oppose their amendment have not, in \ntheir view, engaged on the merits of their specific language. Because \nof this, and because they have vowed to continue in their efforts to \namend the Constitution to address victims' rights, I feel obliged to \nsay a few words about some of the most glaring defects of S.J. Res. 3.\n  One of the most fundamental responsibilities of United States \nSenators is to make sure that we understand what\n\n[[Page S2982]]\n\nwe are enacting into law. That duty is heightened when we are \nconsidering a constitutional amendment. Justice John Marshall said that \nthe Supreme Court ``must never forget, that it is a constitution we are \nexpounding.''\n  We, too, must never forget that it is a constitution--the \nConstitution of the United States of America--that we are being urged \nto amend.\n  I could speak for hours about the defects of this proposed amendment, \nbut I trust that Senators have had an opportunity to consider the \nminority views in the Committee report that I submitted, along with \nSenators Kennedy, Kohl, and Feingold.\n  The minority views run about 40 pages, and identify several specific \nproblems with the drafting of this amendment.\n  I would also direct Senators to the additional views to the \nCommittee's 1998 report, submitted by our distinguished Chairman. \nSenator Hatch's views subject this amendment to penetrating criticism. \nHe reiterated such concerns just yesterday in his statement to the \nSenate in which he indicated the following reservations about the \nproposed constitutional amendment:\n\n       Its scope: the amendment's protections apply only to \n     violent crimes;\n       Its vagueness: some of its definitions are unclear and will \n     be subject to too much judicial discretion; and\n       Its effects on principles of federalism: the proposed \n     amendment could pave the way for more federal control over \n     state legal proceedings.\n\n  For the moment, I will just focus on a few fundamental flaws.\n  Let us start with the first, and most important, seven words of the \namendment. The amendment gives rights to ``a victim of a crime of \nviolence.'' Supporters of this amendment have often compared it to the \nfifth and sixth amendments, which give rights to those accused of \ncrimes. So let us compare them.\n  The most basic point about any constitutional right is, whose right \nis it? The fifth and sixth amendments are clear on that point: They \ngive rights to people who have been charged with committing crimes, and \nwe know who those people are. Of course, the other amendments to our \npresent Constitution are no less clear, since they apply without \nexception to ``the people,'' or to ``citizens of the United States,'' \nor, in the case of the fourteenth amendment, to ``all persons born or \nnaturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction \nthereof.'' But do we know who would have rights under the proposed \nvictims' rights amendment?\n  The answer in the text of the amendment is ``a victim of a crime of \nviolence.'' Who is that? Let us make it easy by taking the most obvious \ncrime of violence--murder. Who is the victim of a murder? The last time \nI prosecuted a murder case, the victim was the dead person. But that \nanswer, what Justice Scalia might call the plain language approach to \ninterpretation, will not do here, unless the purpose of the amendment \nis to enable the corpse to attend the trial.\n  So who, if anyone, gets the benefit of the proposed constitutional \nrights in a murder case? Maybe nobody. Or maybe the reference in \nsection 2 to ``the victim's lawful representative'' refers to the \ntrustee of the victim's estate in a murder case, although I do not see \nwhat the trustee of a murder victim's estate would have to contribute \nto a bail or parole hearing. Or maybe the amendment's supporters are \nbanking on what I believe are called ``activist judges'' to add words \nto the amendment that are not there and extend rights to a murder \nvictim's family.\n  This would raise other questions, like what happens when members of \nthe victim's family hold different views about parole, or each wants a \nshare of the mandatory restitution order? Would unmarried couples, be \nthey heterosexual or homosexual, count as families? Would the six-year-\nold son of a victim be entitled to make arguments in connection with a \nnegotiated guilty plea?\n  Okay, you may say, so murder is a problem. What about other crimes of \nviolence? Let us take robbery. Let us say there is an armed robbery of \na bank. A gun is pointed at a lot of people, tellers and customers. A \nsecurity guard is shot and injured. The bank loses a lot of money. A \npretty simple factual story, and one that I know, from my time as a \nprosecutor, happens all too often.\n  Pretend I am the prosecutor in this bank robbery. Tell me who are the \nvictims I have to notify. The security guard? The 20 customers who were \nuninjured but had a gun pointed at them? The 10 bank tellers? The CEO \nof the bank? And while you are at it, tell me who gets the mandatory \nrestitution--the bank that lost the money, the security guard who was \ninjured, or the customers and tellers who were scared, or the teams of \nplaintiffs'--or, I guess, victims'--lawyers who are fighting out these \nquestions.\n  And who gets to reopen the restitution hearings? Or the bail \nhearings? Feel free to assume that I am a competent prosecutor who can \nfigure out some administrative details. But, if you are going to pass \nthis amendment, do not pass the buck to me to decide who has \nconstitutional rights and who does not. That is your job if you want to \nbe a Framer of the Constitution; it is not the job of individual courts \nand prosecutors.\n  I have talked about two of the most infamous crimes of violence, \nmurder and robbery. Other crimes, such as compound crimes under the \nfederal RICO statute that can include lots of different criminal acts, \nsome violent and some non-violent, over an extended period of years, \nwill involve even harder problems when we try to identify who is and \nwho is not a ``victim of a crime of violence.'' But we should also \nconsider the most common form of violence that afflicts our society, \ndomestic violence.\n  Here is a typical scenario. The police get a call from neighbors who \nhear shouting and screaming and pots and pans being thrown. They reach \nthe house and find the husband and wife hysterically angry at one \nanother and a young child cowering in the corner. It is not entirely \nclear who attacked whom, but the husband is injured and the police \narrest the wife and charge her with assault. The wife's bail hearing \ncomes up, or maybe there are plea negotiations. The wife claims it was \nself-defense; the husband claims she attacked him without provocation.\n  The wife claims she is a victim of a crime of domestic violence; so \ndoes the husband. Maybe the child is too. The proposed amendment leaves \nus with no clue whether a witness to violence who is psychologically \nbut not physically injured by the violence has the new constitutional \nstatus of ``victim''.\n  Under current law, it is up to the jury to determine who is the \nvictim and who is the criminal in this sad domestic scenario, and the \njury makes that determination after hearing all the evidence from both \nsides at trial. Under the proposed amendment, that determination must \nbe made before the wife's bail hearing or plea negotiation. If the \nhusband can persuade the prosecutor that he is the victim, and not the \ninstigator of the violence, he gets the special new constitutional \nrights of a crime victim at the bail and plea bargaining stage, before \nthe wife has even had a chance to present her evidence to the jury that \nthe husband is really the guilty party.\n  Or maybe the wife can insist on extra-judicial proceedings to contest \nthe husband's status as a victim--although I do not know how you would \nsqueeze in extra proceedings before bail or indictment hearings.\n  Assuming that the husband is the ``victim'' for purposes of our new \nconstitutional amendment, what does that get him? Maybe he will push \nfor bail or for a plea with a minimum sentence conditioned on his \ngetting custody of the child, perhaps accompanied by a new kind of \nchild support called ``restitution.''\n  Or maybe the husband will be satisfied with his new constitutional \nright to notice of his wife's release from custody, which will help him \ntrack her down and exact revenge.\n  In some cases, the right end result may be reached. But the process \nthat the proposed amendment seem to involve bypassing a trial on the \nmerits and potentially bypassing family court. By creating pre-trial \nrights for an undefined category of victims, it requires someone--I \nguess the prosecutor--to decide who is the victim of a given crime, and \nwho gets special constitutional rights before there has been a trial or \neven an indictment.\n  Deciding who has constitutional rights and who does not before there \nhas been even an ex parte judicial proceeding is un-American. Doing so \nin a\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\ncase, like a domestic violence case, where there are likely to be self-\ndefense issues, risks giving special constitutional rights to the \ncriminal instead of the victim.\n  One more comment on this half-baked, undefined term ``victim of a \ncrime of violence.'' Thus far, I have discussed the easy cases in terms \nof what constitutes a ``crime of violence''--murder, robbery, and \nassault. But there are a lot of hard cases, too.\n  Is drunk driving a crime of violence if the driver physically injures \na pedestrian? What if the driver runs over the pedestrian's dog, or \ncrashes into a parked car? Can the same offense be a crime of violence \nif someone is physically injured, but not otherwise?\n  What about elder abuse or child abuse? We have all heard heart-\nbreaking stories of seniors and disabled people who have suffered \nhorrible abuse and neglect at the hands of their so-called care-givers, \nand of children locked up in squalid conditions and subjected to \nappalling psychological abuse by their parents.\n  Neglect of the weak and vulnerable in our society by those who have \ntaken the responsibility of being their care-givers can cause as much \nharm as almost any violence, without a hand ever being lifted against \nthem. But are neglect and non-physical abuse ``violence''? What about \nthe horrifying slavery case involving more than 50 Mexican immigrants \nin New York a few years ago? Is enslavement a crime of violence? And \nwhat about kidnapping? If a parent who has been denied legal custody of \na child kidnaps the child, is that a crime of violence, and if so, who \nis the victim, the child, the custodial parent or both?\n  The words of the proposed amendment do not answer these questions. \nThe majority report suggests answers, some of which seem to stretch the \nconcept of a ``crime of violence'' to the breaking point. It suggests, \nfor example, as possible crimes of violence burglary, driving while \nintoxicated, espionage, stalking, and the unlawful displaying of a \nfirearm--very serious crimes, but crimes that usually do not involve \n``violence'' in the normal sense of the word.\n  Last year, Senator Hatch criticized the proposed amendment's reliance \non the term ``crime of violence'' as ``arbitrary.'' I can do no better \nthan to quote his language:\n\n       I believe we must tread carefully when assigning \n     constitutional rights on the arbitrary basis of whether the \n     legislature has classified a particular crime as ``violent'' \n     or ``non-violent.'' Consider, for example, the relative \n     losses of two victims. First, consider the plight of an \n     elderly woman who is victimized by a fraudulent investment \n     scheme and loses her life's savings. Second, think of a \n     college student who happens to take a punch during a bar \n     fight which leaves him with a black eye for a couple of days. \n     I do not believe it to be clear that one of these victims is \n     more deserving of constitutional protection than the other. \n     While such distinctions are commonly made in criminal \n     statutes, the implications for placing such a disparity into \n     the text of the Constitution are far greater.\n\n  It is interesting to note that in their additional views in this \nyear's Committee report, Senators Kyl and Feinstein do not in any way \ndisagree that the scope of their proposed amendment is arbitrary. \nInstead, they explain it as a political compromise.\n  I do not recall Madison and Jefferson saying at the constitutional \nconvention that the provisions they drafted were not great, but \npolitics are politics and you should not expect too much. I believe \nthat we owe the American people something more than arbitrary political \ncompromises when we amend their Constitution.\n  For anyone who shares Senator Hatch's and my concerns about the \narbitrariness of focusing on ``crimes of violence,'' there is, by the \nway, a solution at hand. Vote against the proposed constitutional \namendment and, instead, pass the Crime Victims Assistance Act, which \nprovides strong and effective rights for all crime victims.\n  I have said a lot about the first, and most important, seven words of \nthe proposed amendment; and I could identify many more problems. But \nlet us sum up where we are so far. We are not sure whether the \namendment applies at all to the most obvious ``crime of violence,'' \nmurder, and we have no idea who gets the new constitutional rights for \n``victims'' in a murder case if it does. In other fairly common crimes \nof violence such as robbery, the amendment appears to apply, but even \nassuming clear and simple facts, we are not sure which type of person \naffected by the crime gets to exercise the ``victim's'' rights, and the \nanswer may well be a large number of people affected in vastly \ndifferent ways--some physically, some emotionally, and some \nfinancially--who have vastly different views and interests. In what is \nprobably the most common violent crime scenario, domestic violence, the \namendment appears to require the prosecutor to decide who is the \ncriminal and who is the victim as a constitutional matter, without the \nbenefit of evidence at trial and without participation of judge or \njury. And then we have what perhaps we should call ``borderline \ncrimes,'' a wide range of crimes that may or may not be classified as \ncrimes of violence.\n  On the ``of violence'' issue, Senator Hatch has raised troubling \nconcerns that it is arbitrary as a matter of principle. I agree, and \nadd the further concern that it is yet another huge point of \nuncertainty as to the meaning of this amendment. On this and other \npoints, the answer of the amendment's supporters appears to be ``don't \nworry, someone else will figure this out later.''\n  ``Don't worry, someone else will figure this out later.'' I think we \ncan all agree that is not a principle that Congress should ever follow, \nespecially not in the context of a constitutional amendment. Supporters \nof the amendment will no doubt contend that it is an unfair \ncharacterization of their position. Well, let us see what their \namendment says.\n  The amendment seems quite candid in admitting that its central terms \nare yet to be defined. Section 1 says that the new constitutional \nrights created by the amendment go to ``A victim of a crime of \nviolence, as these terms may be defined by law.'' I take it that \n``these terms'' mean the two terms that we have identified as \nhopelessly vague: (1) ``victim'' and (2) ``crime of violence.''\n  The phrase ``as these terms may be defined by law'' is a new one for \nthe United States Constitution. There is a reason for this. Our \nConstitution was conceived as, and is, ``the supreme Law of the Land.''\n  As Chief Justice John Marshall explained in Marbury versus Madison in \n1803, our Constitution, as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, is \nthe law by which our other laws, State and Federal, are to be judged; \nit is not whatever our other laws, enacted by shifting political \nmajorities from time to time, say it is.\n  Take, for example, the fourteenth amendment guarantee of equal \nprotection of the laws. That does not mean equal protection ``as \ndefined by law.'' If it did, the legislature and Governor of Arkansas \nmight have been entitled to do what they did in 1957, when they \n``defined'' the equal protection rights of public school students to be \nrights to a ``separate but equal,'' racially segregated education. But \nour Constitution has never worked that way, and in 1958, in Cooper \nversus Aaron, the Supreme Court rightly ruled that Arkansas' attempt to \nredefine the fourteenth amendment was unconstitutional, and \ndesegregated Arkansas' schools.\n  Our Constitution has a provision, and a process, for defining new \nconstitutional rights or for redefining existing constitutional rights. \nThat provision, the amendment provision, is in Article V. Article V \nprovides for two-thirds of the members of both Houses of Congress, plus \nthree-fourths of the State legislatures, to amend the Constitution when \n``necessary''. It does not provide for us to pass the buck to bare \nmajorities in State legislatures or in a future Congress to define or \nredefine constitutional rights as we go along.\n  As a matter of principle, therefore, I believe that an ``as may be \ndefined by law'' provision is an abdication of our duty, sitting as we \ndo today as constitutional Framers, to provide clear constitutional \nstandards against which other laws may be judged. In a constitutional \ndemocracy, the rule of law means that constitutional rights are to be \nfound in the Constitution, not in ordinary statutes passed from time to \ntime.\n  If we are going to pass the buck, we should at least be clear about \nwho we are passing it to. Who gets to write the ``law'' that \n``define[s]'' the critical terms of this constitutional amendment? This \nis yet another basic question that the amendment itself does\n\n[[Page S2984]]\n\nnot answer. So I have studied the Committee report for an answer.\n  In a statement that must be profoundly troubling to those Senators \nwho complain regularly about ``activist judges'' making law, the report \nfirst says that ``[t]he `law' which will define a `victim' (as well as \n`crime of violence') will come from the courts interpreting the \nelements of criminal statutes until definitional statutes are passed \nexplicating the term.'' This, I suppose, is the ``don't worry, the \ncourts will figure it out'' theory. Anyone who subscribes to this \ntheory should be prepared to confirm the most activist judges this \ncountry has ever seen, because that is certainly the vaguest, blankest \ncheck that has ever been written to the judiciary.\n  The Committee report ``anticipates'' that judicial law-making under \nthis constitutional amendment may be short-lived--that Congress and the \nState legislatures would quickly step in and enact ``definitional \nlaws'' for purposes of their own criminal systems.\n  It is worth pausing for a moment to consider what this means. One of \nthe main arguments that we have heard in support of this amendment is \nthat we need to eliminate the current ``patchwork'' of victims' rights.\n  We are told we need this amendment because even though all 50 States \nprovide rights for victims, the rights vary from State to State. A \nconstitutional amendment that may be defined differently from State to \nState would not correct this situation --it would simply replace one \npatchwork with another. The superficially simple concept of basic \nbaseline rights for victims will fracture into more than 50 different \nschemes of rights. I do not think that there is anything wrong with \nsuch diversity; indeed, I believe that the present system of defining \ncrimes and the rights of crime victims and enforcing criminal justice \nprimarily at the State level has served this country well throughout \nour history. But I do object to a shell game that dresses up rights \ndefined by State law as Federal constitutional rights, thus \ntrivializing the United States Constitution and casting doubt on the \nrights that it currently protects.\n  Finally, I should note that the ``as these terms may be defined by \nlaw'' provision is not the only delegation in this proposed amendment. \nSection 3 provides that ``The Congress shall have the power to enforce \nthis article by appropriate legislation.'' In their additional views, \nSenators Kyl and Feinstein note that they originally proposed to give \nenforcement power to the States as well as to Congress, but then \nreached another of this amendment's political compromises.\n  I am, however, mystified as to what function the section 3 \nenforcement power could possibly serve. Similar provisions are \ncontained in the fourteenth amendment and in the various amendments \nthat protect voting rights. In the fourteenth and voting rights \namendments, the Federal enforcement power against the States was \njustified by the long history of resistance of certain States to the \nFederal constitutional mandates for equal protection of law and equal \nvoting rights. But there is no such history of State abuses with \nrespect to victims' rights. In fact, many States provide more \nprotections for crime victims than Federal law provides.\n  The majority report alleges no conflict between States and the \nFederal Government that would necessitate a Federal enforcement power. \nRather, the reason given by the amendment's principal sponsors for \nputting victims' right in the Federal Constitution at all is that the \nStates supposedly need Federal help to protect them effectively. They \nclaim that:\n\n       States have had difficulty extending rights to victims of \n     crime through State statutes and constitutional amendments \n     precisely because courts are used to considering, first and \n     foremost, Federal constitutional rights. By extending Federal \n     rights to victims throughout the States, it will then become \n     easier for State criminal justice systems to protect the \n     rights of victims.\n\n  I frankly do not understand this explanation. If you want to empower \nState courts to take State statutes and constitutional amendments \nseriously, the last thing you do, I would think, is impose a complex \nnew Federal mandate on them. If you want to help willing States protect \nvictims, the last thing you do, I would think, is to place their \ncriminal justice systems under congressional supervision and subject \nthem to Federal enforcement through the Federal courts.\n  We are left, therefore, with an enforcement provision that mimics \nother amendments, but without any suggestion of the need to coerce \nrecalcitrant States that justified such provisions elsewhere. Coercing \nthe States here because we have done it before in other contexts is \nharmful to State sovereignty. And empowering Congress to enforce \nagainst the States constitutional rights which it is up to the States \nto define is likely to be futile. If the goal is, as asserted, to help \nthe States protect victims' rights, we should not be piling new \nconstitutional duties on the States; we should be providing assistance. \nInstead of threatening them with the stick of federal enforcement, I \nbelieve that we should offer the States the carrot of funding for the \nprotection of victims' rights. If you agree with me, you should reject \nthis amendment and, instead, support the Crime Victims Assistance Act.\n  Senators Kyl and Feinstein urge us not to make perfect the enemy of \nthe good. If this amendment responded to an urgent need that could not \nbe met by statute, and if it were well-drafted but imperfect, I would \ngive that argument serious consideration. I have explained before why I \nbelieve the goals of this amendment are not merely adequately served, \nbut better served, by statute. But I want to highlight briefly the \nother problem with this amendment. Not only is it not perfect; it is \nnot well-drafted. In fact, it is remarkably sloppy.\n  I have just discussed the two major problems with the text of the \namendment. Section 1 creates a complex scheme of new federal \nconstitutional rights without saying with any clarity who is entitled \nto those rights, then says ``don't worry; someone, somewhere, in a \ncourt or in Congress or in the States, will make a law that will \nidentify who gets these rights.'' Section 3 then empowers Congress to \nenforce those rights on behalf of these yet-to-be-identified people \nagainst the States, not because the States are unwilling to recognize \nthose rights, but because Congress has been empowered to enforce other \nconstitutional rights in the past, so ``why not here.''\n  I do not want to skip section 2. Let me read you a sentence:\n\n       Nothing in this article shall provide grounds to stay or \n     continue any trial, reopen any proceeding or invalidate any \n     ruling, except with respect to conditional release or \n     restitution or to provide rights guaranteed by this article \n     in future proceedings, without staying or continuing a trial.\n\n  Let us call that ``the tax lawyer's provision,'' since it is so \nobscure that I think only someone who has spent half their life \nplumbing the depths of the tax code could understand it. It would \ncertainly be the first triple negative in the United States \nConstitution. I think that ``Nothing in this article shall provide \ngrounds to stay or continue any trial'' should be a sentence on its \nown, since I do not think that this rule ends up being subject to the \nexception, in light of the exception to the exception, but frankly I am \nnot sure.\n  I am also puzzled by the exception that appears to allow victims to \nreopen proceedings or invalidate rulings ``to provide rights guaranteed \nby this article in future proceedings.'' If the concern is with future \nproceedings, I see no need for the exception to allow the reopening of \npresent proceedings. But maybe I missed a turn somewhere in the \ndrafters' maze.\n  Regardless of how it is ultimately interpreted, this intricate web of \nexceptions is not the stuff of a Constitution. One of the great virtues \nof our Constitution is that it speaks with a clear voice, articulating \nprinciples of justice that ordinary Americans can understand. The \nproposed amendment fails to meet that standard.\n  Finally, let me say a few words about section 5, which states that \nthe new constitutional rights for victims shall apply ``in Federal and \nState proceedings, including military proceedings to the extent that \nthe Congress may provide by law, juvenile justice proceedings, and \nproceedings in the District of Columbia and any commonwealth, \nterritory, or possession of the United States.'' This section is truly \nan enigma. No provision of the current Federal Constitution goes into \ndetail about its geographic scope. There is a reason for that.\n\n[[Page S2985]]\n\n  The purpose of the Bill of Rights, as envisioned by the Framers, was \nto provide a fundamental uniform platform of rights enjoyed by all \npeople throughout the United States. Of course every provision of the \nConstitution applies throughout the United States. The fact that the \ndrafters of this amendment felt the need to state that here suggests a \nfundamental confusion about the nature of the Federal Constitution, \nwhich is, by definition, the supreme law of the land. It was, perhaps, \nthat same confusion that led them to provide for the key phrase of this \nfederal constitutional amendment, ``a victim of a crime of violence,'' \nto be defined by a patchwork of State and Federal statutes.\n  A degree of uncertainty at the margins on questions of law and fact \nmay be inevitable in legislation. But, despite the fact that it would \nbe one of the longest-ever amendment to the Constitution, the half-\nbaked proposal before the Senate is hopelessly vague on the basics. I \ndo not know from looking at this amendment and listening to its \nsupporters when it applies and who it applies to, or how that will be \nfigured out.\n  Senator Hatch has made many of the same points about this proposed \nconstitutional amendment. At our last Committee markup in September \n1999, however, the distinguished Senator from Utah said that he \nintended to vote for this amendment, even though he has ``real \nquestions'' about it, ``because of the hard work that has been put into \nit.'' I cannot go along with that reasoning. I commend the efforts of \nthose who have worked on this amendment, as I commend the efforts of \nFederal and State legislators across the country who have worked to \nprovide rights for victims of crime.\n  But ``A'' for effort is not good enough if it means subjecting the \nAmerican people to a ``C''-grade Constitution.\n  As a Senator, I believe I have a constitutional duty not to inflict \non the American people and our busy courts a new constitutional \nprovision when I and they have no idea what it means in the most \nobvious type of case to which it theoretically might apply. And I have \na constitutional duty as a Senator not to pass the buck to the courts \nby saying, ``Here's a new constitutional provision that no one \nunderstands. Go make something up.''\n  When Madison, Jefferson and their compatriots wrote the original \nConstitution, they did not settle for ``don't worry, someone else will \nfigure this out later.'' Nor should we.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record, a letter to me from \nthe NAACP dated April 10, 2000, opposing the proposed constitutional \namendment, and a letter to Senators Lott and Daschle dated April 19, \n2000, from over 300 law professors opposing the proposed amendment as \nunnecessary and dangerous.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Washington Bureau--National Association for the \n           Advancement of Colored People,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 2000.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Since this nation was first founded, \n     Americans of color have been the victims of all types of \n     crimes--both violent and non-violent--in disproportionately \n     high numbers. It is for this reason that the National \n     Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has \n     always had a keen interest in seeing that crime victims are \n     treated honorably, fairly and compassionately by the American \n     judicial system, and that in the end they feel that justice \n     has been served.\n       Yet people of color have also historically been wrongly \n     accused in this nation of crimes varying from the very minor \n     to the most heinous. It is for this reason that the NAACP has \n     also been a strong and steadfast supporter of the \n     Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the concept of due \n     process in the American judicial system. It is our deeply \n     held belief in the need to protect the innocent and allow \n     every American the right to a fair trial that leads us to \n     oppose S.J. Res. 3, the proposed constitutional amendment to \n     protect the rights of victims of crimes.\n       While we are very sympathetic to the rights and the needs \n     of crime victims throughout this nation, and while we agree \n     that victims are often not treated as compassionately as they \n     should be by the judicial system, the NAACP does not believe \n     that S.J. Res. 3 is the answer. Rather than expend the time \n     and energy necessary for the enactment of an amendment to the \n     Constitution, the NAACP urges you to work together and with \n     state legislatures to develop comprehensive packages of laws \n     that address the specific and diverse needs of crime victims. \n     The statutory route is preferable as it is easier to update \n     laws and to fit them to the changing yet very specific needs \n     of victims, and laws, as opposed to a broadly worded \n     constitutional amendment which is less likely to have long-\n     lasting negative repercussions on the rights of the accused.\n       The NAACP appreciates and commends the attempts of the \n     members of the Senate to improve the way in which the \n     American judicial system treats crime victims, and we agree \n     that we can and should do more to see that victims feel safe \n     and have closure after their ordeal. We support efforts to \n     pass laws that help victims of crimes, and we would like to \n     work with you to develop a more narrowly tailored and \n     effective package. Yet we cannot support S.J. Res. 3 for, as \n     well meaning as it is, we have grave concerns that the \n     negative effects this amendment would have on the rights of \n     the accused seeking a fair and impartial trial would outweigh \n     the benefits it bestows upon victims.\n       Thank you in advance for your attention to the concerns of \n     the NAACP. If you have any questions or comments, I hope that \n     you will feel free to contact me at (202) 638-2269. I look \n     forward to working with you on this serious and important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Hilary O. Shelton,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 19, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC\n\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Senate Minority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: We are law professors and \n     practitioners who oppose adding a ``Victims' Rights \n     Amendment'' to the Constitution (S.J. Res. 3). Although we \n     commend and share the desire to help crime victims, amending \n     the Constitution to do so is both unnecessary and dangerous. \n     Indeed, ultimately the amendment is likely to be counter-\n     productive in that it could hinder effective prosecution and \n     put an enormous burden on state and federal law enforcement \n     agencies.\n       The Constitution has been amended only 17 times since \n     ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791. Amendments should \n     be added to our basic charter of government only when there \n     is a pressing need that cannot be addressed in any other way. \n     No such necessity exists in order to protect the rights of \n     crime victims. Virtually every right contained in the \n     proposed Victims' Rights Amendment can be safeguarded by \n     statute.\n       Thirty-three states have passed constitutional amendments \n     and every state has either a state constitutional amendment \n     or statute that protects victims' rights. Many of the rights \n     offered by the VRA are already protected by these laws. For \n     example, restitution for crime victims is required in federal \n     court by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of \n     1996 and in every state by statute or constitutional \n     amendment. Similarly, the right of victims to attend \n     proceedings can be protected by statute as shown by laws that \n     exist in many states and by the recent federal legislation \n     that mandates that victims be allowed to attend even if they \n     will be testifying during the sentencing phase of the \n     proceedings. Victim impact statements are now a routine part \n     of sentencing proceedings at both the federal and state \n     levels. There is every reason to believe that the legislative \n     process will continue to be responsive to protecting crime \n     victims so that there is simply no need to amend the \n     Constitution to accomplish this.\n       Not only is the VRA unnecessary, there are grave dangers in \n     amending the Constitution. The framers were aware of the \n     enormous power of the government to deprive a person of life, \n     liberty and property in criminal prosecutions. The \n     constitutional protections accorded criminal defendants are \n     among the most precious and essential liberties provided in \n     the Constitution. The VRA will undermine these basic \n     safeguards. For example, the proposed Amendment would give a \n     crime victim the right ``[t]o a final disposition of the \n     proceedings relating to the crime free from unreasonable \n     delay.'' Any victim of a violent crime has standing under \n     the Amendment to intervene and assert a constitutional \n     right for a faster disposition of the matter. This could \n     be used to deny defendants needed time to gather and \n     present evidence essential to prepare their defense, \n     resulting in innocent people being convicted. It could \n     also be used to force prosecutors to trial before they are \n     ready, leading to guilty people going free.\n       Section three of the proposed Amendment authorizes Congress \n     to enact legislation to enforce the Amendment. This authority \n     could be used to negate the rights of criminal defendants in \n     an effort to protect crime victims. Courts would then face \n     the enormously difficult task of determining the extent to \n     which legislation to implement the new Amendment can \n     undermine the rights of those accused of crimes.\n       Moreover, the Amendment is likely to be counter-productive \n     because it could hamper effective prosecutions and cripple \n     law enforcement by placing enormous new burdens on state and \n     federal law enforcement agencies. Prosecutions could be \n     hindered by the creation of an absolute right for crime \n     victims to attend and participate in criminal\n\n[[Page S2986]]\n\n     proceedings. In many instances, the testimony of a \n     prosecutorial witness will be compromised if the person has \n     heard the testimony of other witnesses. Yet, the proposed \n     Amendment creates a constitutional right for a victim to be \n     present at criminal proceedings even over defense or \n     prosecution objections.\n       Prosecutorial efforts could also be hampered by the ability \n     of crime victims to ``submit a written statement . . . to \n     determine . . . an acceptance of a negotiated plea or \n     sentence.'' It is unclear how much weight judges will be \n     required to give to a crime victim's objection to a plea \n     bargain. Over 90 percent of all criminal cases do not go to \n     trial but are resolved through negotiation. Even a small \n     increase in the number of cases going to trial would unduly \n     burden prosecutors' offices. There are many reasons why \n     prosecutors enter into plea agreements such as allocating \n     scarce prosecutorial resources, concerns about weaknesses in \n     the evidence, or strategic choices to gain the cooperation of \n     one defendant to enhance the likelihood of convicting others. \n     Prosecutorial discretion would be seriously compromised if \n     crime victims could effectively obstruct plea agreements or \n     require prosecutors to disclose weaknesses in their case in \n     order to persuade a court to accept a plea.\n       The Amendment would impose tremendous financial costs on \n     state and federal law enforcement agencies. These departments \n     would be constitutionally required to make reasonable efforts \n     to find and notify crime victims every time a case went to \n     trial, every time a criminal case was resolved, and every \n     time a prisoner was released from custody. Additionally, the \n     Amendment can be interpreted as creating a duty for the \n     government to provide attorneys for crime victims. The term \n     ``victim's representative'' in section two might well be seen \n     as creating a right to counsel in order to adequately protect \n     these newly created rights. Criminal defendants do not \n     receive adequate counsel in many cases. Adding the financial \n     burden of providing counsel to victims will likely further \n     limit defendants' access to counsel.\n       Protecting crime victims by federal and state statutes \n     provides flexibility that is absent in a federal \n     constitutional amendment. Moreover, amending the Constitution \n     in this way changes basic principles that have been followed \n     throughout American history. Principles of federalism always \n     have allowed states to decide the nature of the protection of \n     victims in state courts. The ability of states to decide for \n     themselves is denied by this Amendment. Also, no longer would \n     protecting the rights of a person accused of crime be a \n     preeminent focus of a criminal trial.\n       Crime victims deserve protection, but that must not be \n     accomplished at the expense of the rights of the accused. As \n     law professors and practitioners we urge the rejection of the \n     proposed Victim's Rights Amendment as unnecessary and \n     dangerous.\n           Sincerely,\n         Prof. Richard Abel, University of California, Los Angeles \n           School of Law; Prof. David Abraham, University of Miami \n           School of Law; Prof. Catherine Adcock Admay, Duke \n           University School of Law; Prof. Albert W.

Chafee). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been asked by the two distinguished \nprincipal proponents, as I understand it, to allow the motion to \nproceed to be withdrawn by unanimous consent, after which I and others \nwho are opposed to the constitutional amendment could proceed to make \nour speeches.\n  I am opposed to that procedure. I think that if we are going to call \nup constitutional amendments around here--and certainly Senators have a \nright to offer constitutional amendments--but if they are going to be \ncalled up, I think we ought to take the full time and discuss them, the \nfull time allowed to us under the rules and discuss those amendments--\npro and con--and not allow them to be withdrawn and then, afterwards \nmake our speeches.\n  That does not make sense to this Senator. They have a perfect right--\nthe proponents--to seek consent to have the amendments withdrawn. But I \nsay, let's have a full discussion of them and then give consent to \ntheir being withdrawn.\n  I honor those proponents who have worked hard, especially the two \nprincipal ones, Mr. Kyl of Arizona and Mrs. Feinstein of California. \nThey are very dedicated, very worthy, very formidable protagonists. I \nrespect them and respect their viewpoints. They have as much right to \ndisagree with me as I have with them. They certainly have the right to \ntheir viewpoints. I do not quarrel with that right at all.\n  Let me also say to the victims of crime, wherever they may be, if \nthey be watching, listening or reading the congressional record of \nthese statements, I certainly am not against victims' rights. I am sure \nI speak for all of those in this body who oppose this constitutional \namendment. We are not against victims' rights. I am for victims' \nlegitimate rights. As one who has been about as firm as any other \nSenator could be when it comes to dealing with criminals, as one who \nbelieves in capital punishment, as one who believes in the death \npenalty, as one who has seen a public execution, as one who believes in \nmaking the criminals pay, I certainly do not take a back seat to anyone \nwhen it comes to supporting legitimate victims' rights. I am for that. \nBut I am not for this amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  I think victims' rights can be secured, are being secured, and will \ncontinue to have my support, when statutes are devised to protect those \nrights. But when it comes to amending the Federal Constitution, that is \nsomething else. That is entirely another matter. We don't need to amend \nthe Federal Constitution to secure victims rights.\n\n     I saw them tearing a building down,\n     A group of men in a busy town;\n     With a ``Ho, heave, ho'' and a lusty yell,\n     They swung a beam and the sidewall fell.\n\n     I said to the foreman, ``Are these men skilled\n     The type you'd hire if you had to build?''\n     He laughed, and then he said, ``No, indeed,\n     Just common labor is all I need;\n     I can easily wreck in a day or two,\n     That which takes builders years to do.''\n\n     I said to myself as I walked away,\n     ``Which of these roles am I trying to play?\n     Am I a builder who works with care,\n     Building my life by the rule and square?\n     Am I shaping my deeds by a well-laid plan,\n     Patiently building the best I can?\n     Or am I a wrecker who walks the town,\n     Content with the labor of tearing down?''\n\n  That is the picture we have before us. We are talking about the \nhigher law of our land, the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica. It was centuries in the making, but it can be trivialized in a \nday.\n  We are talking about the Federal Constitution, the Constitution of \nthe United States of America, the Constitution that was signed by 39 \ndelegates on September 17, 1787.\n  Listen to them: New Hampshire, Nicholas Gilman and John Langdon; \nMassachusetts, Nathaniel Gorham and Rufus King; Connecticut, Roger \nSherman and William Samuel Johnson; New York, Alexander Hamilton; New \nJersey, William Paterson, David Brearley, William Livingston, Jonathan \nDayton; Pennsylvania, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Mifflin, Robert Morris, \nGeorge Clymer, Jared Ingersoll, Thomas FitzSimons, Gouverneur Morris--\nthe tall man with the peg leg--and James Wilson; Delaware, George Read, \nJohn Dickinson, Jacob Broom, Richard Bassett; Maryland, Daniel of St. \nThomas Jenifer, Daniel Carroll, James McHenry; Virginia, George \nWashington, John Blair, James Madison; North Carolina, William Blount, \nRichard Dobbs Spaight, Hugh Williamson; South Carolina, Charles \nPinckney, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, John Rutledge, Pierce Butler; \nGeorgia, William Few and Abraham Baldwin.\n  What would they think? What would they think of this amendment? Not \nwhat professor so-and-so of such-and-such university may think, but \nwhat would those framers of the Constitution say if they were here?\n  Most Americans can recall seeing the statue of ``Blind Justice'' \nholding aloft a balance scale in a courthouse or as a logo for a \nfavorite TV crime show. It is an impressive and powerful representation \nwith roots in Greek and Roman mythology.\n  The scale symbolizes the impartial weighing of evidence, while the \nblindfolded figure, the goddess Themis, symbolizes equal justice under \nthe law for the accused.\n  But in a larger sense, the scale symbolizes something even more \nsignificant. It symbolizes competing interests--universal tensions, if \nyou will--such as innocence versus guilt, truth versus falsehood, \npersonal privacy versus the public welfare, the power of the State \nversus the rights of the individual. When those scales are put into \nequilibrium, they are said to be in balance, the right side weighed to \nbe exactly at level with the left.\n  When it comes to human affairs, balance is a very difficult state to \nachieve. But once achieved, the sweet harmony of balance--one tension \noffset by just the right measure of the competing tension--allows for \nthe calmest, most rational functioning of man's institutions of order.\n  Nowhere is the example of beautiful and near-perfect balance, despite \ncompeting and conflicting ambitions, goals, and passions more \nprofoundly demonstrated than in that venerable charter, the U.S. \nConstitution, which I hold here in my right hand.\n  Our Constitution embodies the accommodation of such difficult-to-\nrectify aspirations as the National Government's need for supremacy and \nthe individual State's need for autonomy. Our Constitution satisfies \nthe States' desire to maintain order without trampling on the \nindividual's right to enjoy liberty. Liberty. That is the key word. \nLiberty. Our Constitution bestows power on the institutions and offices \nof Government in such a way as to allow them to adequately carry out \ntheir duties and yet be curbed and checked by the duties and \nresponsibilities of other officials and institutions. Such is the \nbrilliance and the genius of our national charter that it has been \namended only 27 times in our more than 200-year history. Ten of those \n27 amendments, of course, comprise the Bill of Rights, leaving only 17 \namendments in these 212 years. Seventeen amendments.\n  One of those--the prohibition amendment of 1919--was repealed, wiped \nout--that was the 18th amendment; it was wiped out by the 21st \namendment. So take one away--the 18th amendment--and that leaves only \n16 amendments.\n\n[[Page S2989]]\n\n  One might say: How about the 21st amendment, which wiped it out? \nDon't subtract that one because there is a portion of that amendment \nthat is still in the Constitution, and it will remain there until such \ntime as it may be repealed. But you might say there are 16 amendments. \nOver 11,000 amendments to the Constitution have been introduced in both \nHouses.\n  The men who created this amazing--and it is amazing. One may read \nShakespeare and one may read the Bible time and time and time again, \nand each time one reads that Holy Writ, he or she will find something \nnew--every time. But think of this truly amazing, durable Constitution. \nIt is a durable crucible for liberty. The men who created this durable, \namazing, wonderful crucible for liberty were students of history and \nstudents of various methods of governing going back, back, back, back, \nback into the misty centuries of antiquity, long before 1787. They were \nstudents of the philosophies of the various methods of government. \nThese men who wrote the Constitution came fresh from the mistakes of \nthe experience of the Articles of Confederation, the first Constitution \nof the United States. They lived under the Articles of Confederation; \nthey knew what the flaws of the Articles were. They knew where they \nfell short. They knew where those provisions were lacking. The memory \nof the Revolutionary War and the bloodshed in that struggle for freedom \nwere at the forefront of their minds. They--the framers--God bless \ntheir names--bequeathed to me, to us, something very profound--\nsomething strong, yet something also quite delicate. Over the years, I \nhave come to believe that we should tinker with their magnificent work \nonly very, very rarely.\n  Each Member of this body takes an oath when he or she becomes a U.S. \nSenator, and there have only been 1852 men and women who have taken \nthat oath to be Members of this great body. Think--just think--for a \nmoment about that oath. Think about the words: ``Support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic.'' Then think, if you will, about the extreme difficulty of \nthe procedure laid out in that same Constitution for changing that \nConstitution in any way. I do believe that the framers were quite wary \nof injudicious disruptions to, and even the meddling, piddling, \ntinkering, and tampering with the careful balance that they had so \nlaboriously achieved. As in most things, they were only too right.\n\n  In the 106th Congress, as of April 17 of this year, there had been 63 \nconstitutional amendments proposed--63 constitutional amounts proposed. \nThe Senate has only been in session 43 or 45 days this year. In the \n105th Congress, there were 107 constitutional amendments proposed. I \nthink that it is clear the framers' fears were quite well founded. \nThese amendments are proliferating at an unalarming level.\n  That is why I have taken the floor on yesterday, that is why I have \ntaken it today, and that is why I shall take it, the Lord willing, time \nand time again in the days to come.\n  These amendments are proliferating at an alarming level. It seems \nthat we are almost intent on disrupting what has served us and \ncontinues to serve us so well--the elegant wisdom and the very careful \nbalance inherent in the Constitution. For the second time within 30 \ndays, the U.S. Senate--that remarkable body which Gladstone, who had \nbeen Prime Minister of Britain four times, remarked about--``that \nremarkable body,'' the U.S. Senate, ``the most remarkable of all of the \ninventions of modern politics,'' the U.S. Senate is being called upon \nto adopt an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  It would be laughable if it weren't so serious.\n  Who are we to conjure up all of these myriad amendments to that great \ndocument?\n  So I say the Senate perhaps had better adopt a resolution designating \nApril as ``Amend the Constitution Month.''\n  Let's have at it. Let's have a resolution calling April, the fourth \nmonth of this year of our Lord, the year 2000, the last year in the \n20th century, the last year in the second millennium.\n  Fie on the media, and fie on politicians who try to hand the American \npeople all of this flimflam about this year's being the first year of \nthe 21st century--this year's being the first year of a new century. \nTake the old math, take the new math, whatever math you want to take. \nIt all comes out the same.\n  There are 100 years in every century, and 1,000 years in every \nmillennium. We are today in the last year of the 20th century.\n  I was invited down to the White House a few days before the beginning \nof the new year. I don't go down very often. I don't get invited down \nas much as I used to, but it doesn't bother me. I went down when I was \nmajority leader, when I was minority leader, and when I was majority \nleader again, and when I was President pro tempore of the Senate--all \ntoo much. I got tired of going down there.\n  I must say they were very kind to invite me down to what I think they \ncalled the New Millennium party.\n  I said to my fine staff person, you tell that nice lady that the new \nmillennium hasn't begun yet, and it won't begin until the year 2001, \nJanuary.\n  Now we have the latest constitutional amendment--something called the \ncrime victims' rights constitutional amendment, with the Senate poised \nto consider it following, you guessed it, ``National Crime Victims' \nRights Week,'' a week during which the Senate was in recess.\n  Does this suggest something to us? To me, it suggests a less than \nserious, dare I say somewhat frivolous, view of the gravity and far-\nreaching nature of constitutional amendments in general, and of this \nconstitutional amendment in particular.\n  To those victims out there who are watching over that electronic eye, \nlet me assure you again that I am for your legitimate rights. But I am \nnot for adding an amendment to the Constitution. It isn't necessary.\n  The amendment which is being proposed is intended to restore and \npreserve--although I understand there were some negotiations going on \nwith respect to this amendment as to how it might be changed and \naltered from what it is in the printed amendment upon the desks of \nSenators, negotiations going on with the White House, I understand. Why \nthe White House? What do they have to do with it? The President of the \nUnited States doesn't sign a joint resolution that carries a \nconstitutional amendment. That is a joint resolution that doesn't go to \nthe President's desk. He can't veto it. He can't sign it. Why negotiate \nwith him?\n  The amendment which is being proposed is intended to restore and \npreserve, ``as a matter of right for the victims of violent crimes, the \npractice of victim participation in the administration of criminal \njustice that was the birthright of every American at the founding of \nour Nation.''\n  This is a very impressive goal for the amendment, and, if the matter \nonly stopped there, undoubtedly it would enjoy the sympathy and the \nsupport of every Member of this body because who is there who would be \nopposed to the legitimate rights of victims of violent crime? The title \nand the substance of the measure are certainly worthy of consideration.\n  The Committee on the Judiciary recommended that victims' rights under \nnine general headings be protected in the amendment to the Federal \nConstitution. These nine rights are set forth as follows: (1) a right \nof victims to receive notice of criminal justice proceedings; (2) a \nright of victims to attend criminal justice proceedings related to \ncrimes perpetrated against them; (3) a right of victims to be heard at \nfive points in the criminal justice process, namely, plea bargains, \nbail or release hearings, sentencing, parole hearings, and pardon or \ncommutation decisions; (4) a right of victims to notice of, and an \nopportunity to submit a statement concerning, a proposed pardon or \ncommutation of sentence; (5) a right of victims to notice of release or \nescape of the accused; (6) a right to consideration of the victims' \ninterest in a trial free from unreasonable delay; (7) a right of \nvictims to an order of restitution; (8) a right of victims to have \ntheir own safety considered whenever an accused or convicted offender \nis released from custody.\n\n  These sound like good things, good amendments. They are good.\n  No. 9, notice to the victims of these rights inasmuch as such rights \nare of little use if the victims remain unaware of them.\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\n  What is wrong with that? Nothing is wrong with that. We can all be \nfor that.\n  These participatory rights of victims are laudable and are worthy of \nconsideration, certainly in the instance of legislation, but not when \nit comes to amending the Federal Constitution.\n  Such rights can already be assured--here is the problem--such rights, \nas those we are talking about, can already be assured to victims by \nFederal or State legislation.\n  The majority states in the committee report that the first Federal \nconstitutional amendment to protect the rights of crime victims was \nintroduced with hearings thereon in 1996 and that additional hearings \nwere conducted in 1997, 1998, and 1999. The report also indicates that \nover these years, many changes were made to the original draft, several \nof which responded to concerns expressed in the hearings.\n  The fact that so many changes were made over the years indicates to \nme that the subject matter could be better dealt with by legislation \nthan by a Federal constitutional amendment. If it needs changing, if it \nneeds modifying, if it needs altering, it can be done by legislation. \nAnd if we find that something is wrong and it isn't working right, we \ncan change that law again the next session. We can even change it \nduring this session. Congress can change, can alter, can modify, can \namend the law almost overnight, if necessary, but not a constitutional \namendment. That would take years to do. Statutes can be modified and \nrefined by subsequent legislation during a single session of the \nlegislative branch. But once a constitutional amendment is set into \nplace, the only way to refine or amend that constitutional amendment is \nto further amend the Constitution of the United States, a procedure \nwhich necessarily requires years to do. The Prohibition amendment was \non the books from January 1919 to December 1933. It took years.\n  What are we talking about? This Constitution may not be perfect, but \nthis amendment wasn't perfect. It was changed, and then it was changed, \nand then it was changed again, and now it is being pulled back because \nthere need to be further changes. What does that tell us? What if it \nhad been welded into the Constitution of the United States and then \nthey would have found, lo and behold, this ought to be changed, this \nisn't right, this is wrong, we need to change it. That is a long \nprocess.\n  I was interested, as I scanned the committee report, to note that the \ntwo legal experts who testified in support of the amendment in the \nfirst hearing in 1996 testified again and again and again in the \nsubsequent three hearings. Professor Paul Cassell--I have never had the \npleasure of meeting that gentleman--Professor Paul Cassell of the \nUniversity of Utah College of Law and Steve Twist, former chief \nassistant attorney general of Arizona, were the chief legal experts. \nThey may have been the best in the Nation; I don't know. Professor \nCassell appears at all four hearings in support of the amendment. It \nseemed to me there was a paucity of expert academic witnesses who \nappeared in furtherance of the amendment.\n\n  This duo--and I say it with great respect for them; they may be the \nbest two in America--the same duo were heard over and over again. \nWouldn't it have been well to have a few more? Wouldn't it have been \nwell to add to the list of experts?\n  It should not go unnoticed that the committee report states that the \nU.S. Judicial Conference favors a statutory approach because it ``would \nhave the virtue of making any provisions in the bill which appeared \nmistaken by hindsight''--that is 20/20, you know--``to be amended by a \nsimple act of Congress.''\n  The report also says that the State courts favor a statutory approach \nto the protection of victims' rights, citing the fact that the \nConference of Chief Justices--we only have one Chief Justice of the \nUnited States, but there are many chief justices of the 50 States--\nciting the fact that the Conference of Chief Justices has underscored \n``the inherent prudence of a statutory approach'' which could be \nrefined as appropriate.\n  Other major organizations, including several victims' groups, opposed \nthe amendment, as is stated in the Committee report. For example, the \nNational Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women takes the \nposition that statutory alternatives are ``more suitable'' than an \namendment to the Federal Constitution. Victim Services, the nation's \nlargest victim assistance agency, also opposes S.J. Res. 3, arguing \nthat the proposed amendment ``may be well intentioned, but good \nintentions do not guarantee just results''. The National Network to End \nDomestic Violence, as well as the National Organization for Women Legal \nDefense and Education Fund, and Murder Victim's Families for \nReconciliation, a national organization of family members of murder \nvictims, are united in opposing the joint resolution. Moreover, \nprosecutors and other law enforcement authorities all across the \ncountry ``have cautioned that creating special Constitutional rights \nfor crime victims would have the perverse effect of impeding the \neffective prosecution of crime.''\n  It seems to me that one of the foremost rights of a victim of crime \nwould be to see the perpetrator of that crime brought to justice, \ntried, convicted, and punished. That is the first and foremost right of \nthe victim.\n\n  The National District Attorneys Association has cautioned that the \nproposed amendment would ``afford victims the ability to place \nunknowing, and unacceptable, restrictions on prosecutors while \nstrategic and tactical decisions are being made about how to proceed \nwith the case.''\n  Prosecutorial discretion over plea bargaining ``is particularly at \nrisk'' if S.J. Res. 3 were to be adopted. While I personally believe, \nand have long believed, that there is entirely too much plea \nbargaining--I believed that for a long time--the committee points out \nthat a prosecutor may need to obtain the cooperation of a defendant who \ncan bring down an entire organized crime ring, or may need to protect \nthe identity of an informant-witness, or may think that the evidence \nagainst the defendant will not convince a jury beyond a reasonable \ndoubt, in which case the accused killer, or whatever he might be, would \ngo scot-free. Will the victim's rights have been upheld? Will the \nvictim's rights have been secured if the killer goes free? If the \nrobber goes free? If the burglar goes free?\n  In any event, I support the main objectives in the measure for the \nprotection of victims' rights, but such protection can be afforded by \nlegislation at the Federal and State levels, and there is absolutely no \nneed for a Federal constitutional amendment to meet the needs set forth \nin the resolution.\n  The chief justices of the States have expressed grave concerns that \nthe proposed constitutional amendment would lead to ``extensive lower \nfederal court surveillance of the day to day operations of state law \nenforcement operations.''\n  Now, get that. How many times have we heard it said, ``Get the \nGovernment off our backs! Get the Government off our backs!'' Wasn't \nthat one of the complaints in the great, so-called--what was it \ncalled?--contract, the great contract they talked about some few years \nago, the Contract With America. Why, of course, that was one of the \ngreat things they talked about--Get the Government off our backs; \nContract With America. Whoopee. Well, I will tell you, I have my \nContract With America right here in my pocket. I know this Senator \nhere, from Vermont, he had two men from Vermont who signed this \nConstitution, John Langdon and Nicholas Gilman. He has his Contract \nWith America in his pocket--I have. It is called the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  Here we have grave concerns expressed by the chief justices of the \nStates, grave concerns that the proposed constitutional amendment would \nlead to ``extensive lower federal court surveillance of the day to day \noperations of state law enforcement operations.'' Get the Government \noff our back, they say on one hand. Then they say, Oh, let's adopt this \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The minority view on the Senate Judiciary Committee shares these \nconcerns, but states that the laudable goal of making State and law \nenforcement personnel more responsive to victims should not be achieved \nby establishing Federal court oversight of the criminal justice and \ncorrectional systems of the 50 States. They do not want the Government \non their backs, so they do not\n\n[[Page S2991]]\n\nsupport this proposed constitutional amendment.\n  The minority on the committee states that there is no pressing reason \nto displace State laws in an area of traditional State concern, and \nthat there is no compelling evidence pointing to the need for another \nunfunded mandate.\n\n  They passed a bill here a few years back dealing with unfunded \nmandates. That was one of the first great so-called great plaints in \nthe Contract--what was it? The Contract With America?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I called it the \nContract On America. They called it the Contract With America. I think \nit was a Contract On America.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Contract On America. All right. Call it a Contract On \nAmerica.\n  The minority also states that there is no need for more Federal court \nsupervision and micromanagement of State and local affairs, when every \nState is already working hard to address the issues in ways that are \nbest suited to its own citizens and its own criminal justice system.\n  There have been some 63 drafts of the proposed amendment, and it \nremains both excessively detailed and decidedly vague. The level of \ndetail provided in this amendment is inconsistent with the structure \nand the style of our country's great governing document, and, indeed, \nthe resolution reads like a statute, which suggests that that is, in \nfact, how the problem of protecting the rights of crime victims should \nbe addressed.\n  The majority report cites examples of overwhelming popular support \nand demonstrates that change toward better implementation of victims' \nrights is occurring now, already, in the States. The majority admits \nthat ``there is a trend''--the majority in this subcommittee report \nissued by the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate--admits that \n``there is a trend toward greater public involvement in the process, \nwith the federal system and a number of states now providing notice to \nvictims.'' Hence, it is my belief that we, here at the Federal \nlegislative level, should avoid the adoption of a Federal \nconstitutional amendment and that we should allow the States to \ncontinue to come up with innovations of their own without undue Federal \nintervention in a matter which, basically, is in the purview of the \nStates.\n  Our illustrious friends who are the chief cosponsors of the \namendment, very honorable Members of this body, one from the Democratic \nside and one from the Republican side, have told us that they will be \nback. ``We'll be back,'' they say.\n  In the meantime, I hope we can educate ourselves a little better with \nrespect to the constitutional principles that we are here to defend and \nto protect. I hope that during this interim, while they are preparing \nto come back, that we will be educating ourselves a bit further and \nhelping to educate others as to the history of American \nconstitutionalism so that Senators, in the future, may be a little \nbetter prepared to take on this new amendment when it is brought back \nbefore the Senate, as we are assured that it will be.\n  I have heard, during this debate, that you can include these victims' \nrights in statutes, but they won't be enforced. Some of them are \nalready in statutes, but they are not being enforced. That is what we \nheard the proponents say. They are not being enforced. They won't be \nenforced. They are in the laws of various States, but they are not \nbeing enforced so what we need is a constitutional amendment. How about \nthat? How can be assured that a constitutional amendment will be \nenforced?\n  Let's return to the Book our fathers read:\n\n       19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in \n     purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:\n       20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was \n     laid at his gate, full of sores.\n       21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from \n     the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his \n     sores.\n       22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was \n     carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also \n     died, and was buried;\n       23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and \n     seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.\n       24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, \n     and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in \n     water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.\n       25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy \n     lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus \n     evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.\n       26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great \n     gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you \n     cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from \n     thence.\n       27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou \n     wouldest send him to my father's house:\n       28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, \n     lest they also come into this place of torment.\n       29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the \n     prophets; let them hear them.\n       30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto \n     them from the dead, they will repent.\n       31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the \n     prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose \n     from the dead.\n\n  That is the lesson. If the people in the States will not be persuaded \nby the statutes of the States that are already on the books, if they \ncannot be enforced, then will they listen to Moses and the prophets \neven if they rose from the dead? Will they hear even if it is a Federal \nconstitutional amendment?\n  Why should we think they will hear better, that they will see better, \nthat they will honor more, that they will abide more by words that are \nwritten into the Federal Constitution than they will those words that \nare already written in the statute books of the States and the Federal \nstatutes as well? If they will not hear them, they will not hear Moses \nand the prophets, even though they were brought from the dead.\n  If they will not abide by the statutes, if they will not enforce \nthem, what is there to ensure us that they would enforce the strictures \nof a new constitutional amendment? And if they did not, what would we \nbe doing to the Federal Constitution? We would trivialize it; we would \nminimize it; we would lower it in the estimation of the people.\n  When it comes to amending the highest law in our constitutional \nsystem, it behooves us to step back and behold the forest, not just the \ntrees.\n  Once before in our history we amended the Constitution without \ncarefully thinking through the consequences. That was when the 18th \namendment, dealing with prohibition, was ratified on January 16, 1919.\n  I can remember as a boy seeing those revenue officers come around to \nthe coal company houses. I can see them climbing the hills of the coal \nmining community going to various houses, going into the woods, looking \nfor the moonshine stills. Those were the revenuers, as they used to \nsay--the revenuers. That was under prohibition. That amendment opened a \nPandora's box, or as Senator Jeff Bingaman says, a box of Pandoras. \nThat amendment opened a Pandora's box of unintended and unforeseen \nconsequences, and it was not until almost 15 years later that the 21st \namendment repealing the 18th amendment was ratified on December 5, \n1933. It took a long time to get the genie back into the bottle, and we \nshould have learned a lesson from that experience.\n  As a principle of simple prudence, we should be ever cautious about \namending the organic law of our Nation. Justice Cardozo was explicit in \nhis warning, uttered in the case of Browne v. City of New York, and we \nshould heed that warning. Here it is:\n\n       The integrity of the basic law is to be preserved against \n     hasty or ill-considered changes, the fruit of ignorance or \n     passion.\n\n  Mr. President, the Constitution itself in article V, the article that \nprovides for amendments to the Constitution, carries such an \nimplication. Here is what it says--listen carefully--as an implication \nagainst hasty or ill-considered changes:\n\n       The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem \n     it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, \n     . . .\n\n  There is the warning, ``whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem \nit necessary.'' The word ``necessary'' is not just a throwaway word \nthat was just inserted to fill up space in article V of the U.S. \nConstitution. We can be sure that the constitutional framers chose the \nword carefully, as they did all other words in that unique document.\n\n  It was the word chosen by Governor Edmund Randolph when he presented \nthe Virginia Plan to the Constitution\n\n[[Page S2992]]\n\non May 29, 1787. That is my wedding anniversary date. My wife and I \nwere married on May 29. It will be 63 years ago on May 29. I will never \nforget it. And that is the date in 1787 that Edmund Randolph rose at \nthat Constitutional Convention and laid down his plan containing 15 \nresolves, 15 resolutions. The 13th of the 15 resolutions, according to \nMadison's notes, read as follows:\n\n       Resolved that provision ought to be made for the amendment \n     of the Articles of Union whensoever it shall seem necessary, \n     . . .\n\n  William Paterson of New Jersey laid the New Jersey Plan before the \nConvention on June 15, and with respect to amending the Constitution, \nhe used the words that the Congress be authorized ``to alter & amend in \nsuch manner as they shall think proper''--``in such manner as they \nshall think proper.''\n  When one compares the pertinent language in the two plans, it is \nreadily apparent that Randolph's language in the Virginia plan was the \nstronger and more exacting upon those who would undertake to amend the \nConstitution. Paterson's proposal provided for constitutional \namendments in such manner ``as they (the Congress) shall think \nproper.'' In other words, there is no requirement of necessity. The \nstandard, ``as they shall think proper,'' can vary with whim or caprice \nor political motivation. Thus, without any firm anchor, what may be \nthought ``proper'' one day, might very well not be thought ``proper'' \non the next. But on the contrary, Randolph's language, ``whenever two-\nthirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary,''--``whenever two-thirds \nof both Houses shall deem it necessary''-- provides a surer anchor and \nfirmer foundation, and like the warning sign at a railroad crossing, \n``stop, look, and listen'', commands not only the rapt attention, but \nalso the considered judgment and focus of those who would alter, \nmodify, add to, or repeal the fundamental law of the Nation.\n  Needless to say, Randolph's language weathered the scrutiny of the \nCommittee of Style and Arrangement; the Committee of Detail; the \nCommittee of the Whole; and survived the storms and changing \nvicissitudes of the Convention itself.\n  The word ``necessary'' made it through all the committees, all the \ndisputations, all the disquisitions, all the arguments, and came out at \nthe end in that almost immortal document, the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  That word ``necessary'' is not just an empty word. It is not just a \nplace holder. It is not just a word to be thrown in to fill out the \nwhole. It meant something. It required something. The word was \n``necessary.'' ``Whenever two-thirds of the States shall deem it \nnecessary to amend.''\n  Supreme Court Justice Campbell, in Marshall versus Baltimore & \nO.R.R., offered these words which we might do well to ponder in this \ninstance. Here is what he said: ``The introduction of new subjects of \ndoubt, contests and contradiction, is the fruit of abandoning the \nConstitutional landmarks.''\n  We would profit greatly by reviewing the constitutional landmarks as \nwe are confronted today with this proposed constitutional amendment.\n  Madison, in The Federalist No. 43, alluded to ``that extreme facility \nwhich would render the Constitution too mutable''; and he proceeded to \nimplore against appeals to the people that were too frequent.\n  This was Madison talking. In The Federalist No. 43, he alluded to \n``that extreme facility which would render the Constitution too \nmutable'' and proceeded to implore against appeals to the people that \nwere too frequent.\n  Here we have 11,000 of these proposed amendments to the Constitution \nthat have been floating around in one or both Houses throughout the \nyears--11,000.\n  In the Federalist No. 49 Madison warned: ``. . . As every appeal to \nthe people would carry an implication of some defect in the government, \nfrequent appeals would in great measure deprive the government of that \nveneration which time bestows on everything, and without which perhaps \nthe wisest and freest governments would not possess the requisite \nstability.''\n  That was James Madison. He was only 36 years old, less than half my \nage. Listen to him. Let me say it again. He warned: . . . ``As every \nappeal to the people''--as we are being asked to appeal to the people \nhere with S.J. Res. 3--``. . . As every appeal to the people would \ncarry an implication of some defect in the government, frequent appeals \nwould in great measure deprive the government of that veneration which \ntime bestows on everything, and without which perhaps the wisest and \nfreest governments would not possess the requisite stability.''\n  In this same Federalist paper, Madison went on to say: ``The danger \nof disturbing the public tranquility by interesting too strongly the \npublic passions, is a still more serious objection against a frequent \nreference of Constitutional questions to the decision of the whole \nsociety.''\n  Ah, what if Madison were here today to speak. The galleries would be \nfilled. The media galleries would be crowded. There would not be a seat \nvacant. They would be all ears, all eyes, because this would be \nMadison, 36 years of age, purported to be the father of the \nConstitution, speaking.\n  Listen to him.\n  ``But the greatest objection of all is, that the decisions which \nwould probably result from such appeals, would not answer the purpose \nof maintaining the Constitutional equilibrium of the government.''\n  Finally, Madison clinched his point, when he said: ``It appears in \nthis, that occasional appeals to the people would be neither a proper \nnor an effectual provision, . . .''\n  Mr. President, an overriding question, therefore, as we examine the \nproposed Constitutional amendment, is simply this: ``Is it necessary?''\n  ``Is it necessary?'' That is the standard that is set forth in the \nverbiage of the Constitution: ``Is it necessary?''\n  Penetrating light has been shed upon this question by the minority \nviews of Senators Leahy, Kennedy, Kohl, and Feingold, who, in the \ncommittee report, beginning on page 57, set forth a litany of major \nlaws recently enacted by Congress to grant broader protections and \nprovide more extensive services for victims of crime. Among these laws \nare the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982; the Victims of Crime \nAct of 1984; the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990; the \nViolence Against Women Act of 1994; the Mandatory Victims Restitution \nAct of 1996; the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997; the Crime \nVictims with Disabilities Awareness Act of 1998; the Identity Theft and \nAssumption Deterrence Act of 1998, as well as the Torture Victims \nRelief Act; and the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act, of \nMarch 10, 2000.\n  These are public laws. They have already been passed by both Houses. \nThey have been signed into law.\n  Obviously, as the minority on the Senate Judiciary Committee point \nout, there is nothing in the U.S. Constitution that currently \nconstitutes a barrier, that currently inhibits the enactment of State \nor Federal laws that protect crime victims.\n  With 33 States having adopted state constitutional amendments dealing \nwith victims' rights, and while every State and the District of \nColumbia already have some type of statutory provision providing for \nincreased victims' rights, including some or all of the rights \nenumerated in S.J. Res 3, what is needed is better enforcement of State \nlaws and increased funding, not a Federal constitutional amendment.\n  This should be ``as clear,'' as our former illustrious and dear \ncolleague, the late Sam Ervin, used to say, ``as the noonday sun in a \ncloudless sky.''\n  Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once stated: ``In my opinion, the \nLegislature has the whole lawmaking power except so far as the words of \nthe Constitution expressly or impliedly withhold it.'' There is no \nindication whatsoever that the Federal Constitution of today provides \nany barrier--either expressly or impliedly--to the lawmaking power in \nthe subject area of victims' rights. It would, therefore, be far better \nfor lawmakers at the Federal and State levels to exert their talents \ntoward enactment of any further legislation that may be needed--I will \nbe there to join them--rather than pursuing a course of amending the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 85--this is the final Federalist \npaper--states: ``It appears to me susceptible of absolute \ndemonstration, that it would be far more easy to obtain subsequent than \nprevious amendments to the Constitution.'' How right he was. In the\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\nlight of Hamilton's wise words, members of the Senate should proceed \nwith the utmost caution in proposing and supporting Constitutional \namendments.\n  It is more than noteworthy to again reflect upon the fact that during \nthe 212 years of the American Republic, its organic law has been \namended only 27 times--including the first time in which all ten \namendments were ratified in one fell swoop. Those ten amendments \nconstituted the Bill of Rights. During this period of over two \ncenturies, more than 11,000 constitutional amendments have been \nproposed in Congress, but Congress has withstood the pressure behind \nthis flood. Pheobe Cary's I long ago read poem about the lad who put \nhis finger in the hole in the dyke: he ``held back the sea by the \nstrength of his single arm''. The Senate must once again act to prevent \na hole in the dyke which, if exploited here, might, in time, become a \nvirtual flood.\n  Hamilton, in the Federalist Essay No. 85, states: ``For my own part, \nI acknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments which may, upon \nmature consideration, be thought useful, will be applicable to the \norganization of the government, not to the mass of its powers; . . .'' \nIt should be preeminently clear to all observers that the amendment we \nare considering at this time, would not, as Hamilton had noted, ``be \napplicable to the organization of the government,'' but, instead, \npertains ``to the mass of its powers.''\n  The Founders departed from practically all historical precedents by \nproducing the system known as American federalism, and they did this \nwith great care and skill, for the issue of the States' sovereignty was \na flashpoint upon which the endeavor at Philadelphia could very quickly \nhave disintegrated.\n  The Constitution really consists of two types of provisions. One set \nof provisions is concerned with structure--the separation of functions \nand powers, the departments of administration, the House of \nRepresentatives, the Senate, the President, the Judiciary, and their \nrelations to one another. The other set of provisions is concerned with \nthe relation of the States to the general government. The powers of the \ngeneral government are limited and the powers of the States are also \nunder certain restrictions.\n\n  This federalism was entirely new. There was nothing like it in the \ncolonial charters or in the state Constitutions of 1776 and 1777. The \ndevelopment of federalism went through similar stages and took almost \nas long in its processes as the development of the structural parts of \nthe Constitution. It had been an important and a much debated question \nfor more than a 100 years before 1776, and more than 20 plans of power-\nsharing had been suggested and discussed.\n  As the Articles of Confederation clearly demonstrated, the protection \nof the States' prerogatives continued to be held very dear, even in the \nface of the exigencies of newly claimed independence and armed conflict \nwith Britain. What the Framers successfully crafted in 1787 was a \nsystem which retained enough sovereignty for the States to keep them \nfrom rejecting the new Constitution, while at the same time providing \nsufficient power to the national government so that it could be \neffective at home, and establish a credible presence in international \naffairs--quite an achievement!\n  The minority on the Judiciary Committee--headed by my illustrious \nfriend, the very able Senator from Vermont the 14th State--indubitably \nare of the view that the amendment before us constitutes a significant \nintrusion of Federal authority into a province traditionally left to \nState and local authorities. The minority viewpoint States a truism: \n``Under our federal system the administration of criminal justice rests \nwith the states except as Congress, acting within the scope of those \ndelegated powers, has created offenses against the United States.'' \nScrews vs. United States\n  Mr. President, let us view, therefore, with a jaundiced eye, this \nproposal to amend the Constitution. As I have already indicated, there \nis nothing in the Constitution which currently inhibits the National \nand State legislatures from enacting legislation and providing the \nnecessary funds to deal with the many problems surrounding victims' \nrights.\n  Let me say again, for the benefit of those victims who may not be \nsitting nearby but who may be out there on the plains, in the \nAlleghenies, in the forests, on the lakes of this great country, let me \nsay to them: There is nothing, absolutely nothing, in this Constitution \nwhich currently inhibits the National and State legislatures from \nenacting legislation and providing the necessary funds to deal with the \nmany problems surrounding your rights, victims' rights--nothing!\n  All needful legislation at the national and local levels should be \nconsidered and should be exhausted before we embark upon a course that \nleads to a further amendment of the Constitution. That is what we are \nsaying. Let's try all the others, and let's enforce the laws if they \nare not being enforced. Once we go down that road of amending the \nConstitution, one amendment leads to another amendment, and then to \nanother amendment, and as Hamilton predicted in Federalist No. 85, ``it \nwould be far more easy to obtain subsequent than previous amendments to \nthe Constitution.'' Willy-nilly amendments to the Constitution can only \nserve to trivialize it.\n  As Hippocrates admonished physicians everywhere, ``Do no harm,'' we \nSenators who have taken an oath to support and defend the Constitution \nof the United States should measure our actions likewise: Let us do no \nharm to the Constitution. When amendments to the Constitution become a \npolitical way of life, when they dovetail with hortatory national weeks \nfor this or for that, then we have transcended mere bumper sticker \npolitics and entered the very shaky world of bumper sticker amendments \nto the U.S. Constitution. As a result, the public respect for that \nvenerable document will certainly diminish. Just amend it enough and \nthe public veneration for that unique document, the Constitution of the \nUnited States, will certainly diminish.\n  This particular amendment appears to contemplate rewriting the \ncriminal justice code and placing that rewrite into the Constitution. \nIf we wish to rewrite the criminal justice code, that is one thing. Let \nus have at it, let us be about it, and while we are about it, scan this \nproposed amendment for its best provisions to incorporate. Certainly, \nvictims' rights, or rather protections, as I prefer to call them, are a \ncause that I can enthusiastically support. I can embrace them and hold \nthem close to my heart. But why, oh why, do we need to take the step of \npinning such a measure to the Constitution itself, rather like some \nsort of artificial tail? It would be quite funny if it weren't so \nserious.\n  The material which has been circulated in support of the need for \nthis constitutional amendment seems to cite two primary reasons as its \njustification--the first being that the criminal justice system does \nnot give adequate protection to the interests of victims of crimes, and \nthe second being that existing statutory and State provisions are not \nuniform. While both may be true, neither is a reason for a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  In the first instance, these concerns can be addressed through \nstatutory means. In the second instance, the concern can also be \naddressed through statutory means, and to achieve it via the route of \namending the Constitution could be deleterious to a very important \nbedrock principle in the Constitution. That principle is one of the \nmain thrusts and achievements of the framers coming out of the \nexperience of the Articles of Confederation, and one which is a central \npillar of our Republic. What is that? Federalism!\n  Each of the States in its wisdom, through its legislature and its \nelectorate, has the power and the right to protect and accommodate the \ninterests of victims within its own criminal justice system. All of \nthese decisions--those that have been made, and those that will be made \nin all 50 States--would become subservient to a constitutional standard \nif we were to adopt this amendment, which in all likelihood no one \nState would have chosen for its own particular citizens.\n  Obviously, the proposed amendment mandates a significant intrusion of \nthe Federal Government into an area traditionally left to State and \nlocal authorities. Nearly 95 percent of all the crimes are prosecuted \nby the States. The Federal Government does not have general\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\npolice power. As the Supreme Court reminded us in United States v. \nLopez:\n\n       Under our Federal system, the states possess primary \n     authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law.\n\n  This proposed amendment could drastically shift the responsibility by \nforcing States to put consideration of these new victims' rights and \nprotections on an equal footing with the rights of the accused. \nFurthermore, in the majority report accompanying this amendment, \nconcerns about disruptions to federalism are deflected by the \nincredible assertion that States will have ``plenary authority'' to \ntailor the amendment to fit the needs of their various criminal \nsystems--that they may flush out such definitions as ``victims of \ncrime'' and ``crimes of violence.'' So much for uniformity. They talk \nabout uniformity. Well, so much for uniformity.\n  The result of such a reading of this amendment is, again, the very \npatchwork of laws that the proponents say they are trying to avoid. \nMoreover, for the first time, we will have turned the concept of \nfederalism on its head by saying that States and various State laws may \nbe allowed to implement the intent of a constitutional amendment. This \nis pure folly. What we will achieve if this poorly conceived amendment \nmanages to end up as part of our Constitution is a serious aberration \nregarding the crowning achievement of the framers--federalism--and a \nrecipe for a very nasty little stew of conflicting interpretations of \nwhat is and what is not a victim's right. I shudder to think of where \nthat can lead us.\n  The term ``victim'' is undefined and could be interpreted to mean any \nnumber of individuals--some quite removed from the usual understanding. \nIn the case of a murder, couldn't an entire family be considered \n``victims''? Take the tragedy at Columbine High School; could not the \nentire town of Littleton be considered ``victims''? If a battered \nspouse, finally driven to retaliate to repeated violence, strikes back, \nis the abuser then also a ``victim'' and therefore entitled to a \nvictim's protections?\n  An ``exceptions'' clause is included in this constitutional \namendment. Consider that. Unlike any other part of the Constitution, we \nare inviting exceptions without stating who can make the exceptions. \nAre we suggesting that Federal constitutional rights can mean different \nthings from State to State?\n  Please let us come to our collective senses. Let us come back down to \nearth again. Let us not shred the concept of federalism with one ill-\nconsidered vote in the frenzy of an election year.\n  Let us pay attention to what we are about to do, remembering John \nMarshall's words:\n\n       We must never forget that it is a Constitution we are \n     expounding.\n\n  This resolution, S.J. Res. 3, consists of 403 words. I counted them. \nI learned to count by the old math. Yes, I memorized my multiplication \ntables back in that little two-room schoolhouse in southern West \nVirginia more than 75 years ago. But it is still the same \nmultiplication tables; it hasn't changed, and it won't change. This \nresolution consists of 403 words. I am including, of course, the \nheadings. In itself, it exceeds the number of words in 9--not the first \n9, but 9 of the 10 amendments comprising the Bill of Rights. Now, many \nof us have participated in that little game of counting the words. I \ndid so, also. Why not? Why should I not?\n\n  According to the committee report accompanying this constitutional \namendment, over 450 law professors expressed opposition to this \namendment to the Constitution. Why weren't they invited to the \nhearings? In addition, the Cato Institute, the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation, the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys, \nthe National Legal Aid and Defenders Association, the NAACP, the ACLU, \nthe Justice Policy Institute, the Center on Juvenile and Criminal \nJustice, the Youth Law Center, the National Center on Institutions and \nAlternatives, the American Friends Service Committee, and the Friends \nCommittee on National Legislation--among others--have expressed \nopposition to such an amendment. They take the position that statutes \nwork, statutes are more flexible and are more easily enacted and more \neasily corrected and are more able to provide specific, effective \nremedies on behalf of victims of crimes.\n  The majority report cites President Clinton as having endorsed the \nconstitutional amendment. Well, so what! President Clinton also \nsupported the line-item veto, but the U.S. Supreme Court knocked it \ndown. Presidents can be wrong and so can majorities.\n  The majority also cites the National Governors' Association as having \npassed a resolution in 1997 supporting a Federal constitutional \namendment on victims' rights. So what?\n  As I recall, the National Governors' Association not too long ago \nalso supported a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Yes--a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget. The National \nGovernors' Association supported that. The Federal Government has since \nbalanced the budget, at least on paper, without resorting to a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  We didn't need it. We didn't need it all along. But what if we had \nwritten it into the Constitution?\n  I submit that the rights of victims of crimes can be clarified and \nenhanced by legislation at the Federal and State levels without \nresorting to an amendment to the Federal Constitution.\n  For, as Madison cogently stated in the Federal No. 49, ``A \nConstitutional road to the decision of the people, ought to be marked \nout, and kept open for certain great and extraordinary occasions.'' The \noccasion for this amendment falls far short of being either ``great'' \nor ``extraordinary,'' and does not measure up to Madison's \nprescription. Congress can immediately pass a statute and provide the \nfinancial resources necessary to assist the states in giving force to \ntheir own locally-tailored statutes and Constitutional provisions, thus \navoid tampering with our national charter.\n  Jesus said it well, when he sat at meat in the house of Levi: ``No \nman also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new \npiece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made \nworse.'' Let us not add this piece of clashing new cloth to the \nvenerable and beautiful garment of the Constitution, lest the new piece \ntrivialize the old and a rent is made in the carefully coordinated \nsystem of federal and state relations.\n  The Constitution of the United States was not meant to be a \npolitician's plaything. It is not mine to play with. It is not yours to \nplay with. It is not ours to play with. It is a sad commentary that we \nfind ourselves having to prepare in haste, without adequate notice and \nunder the strictures of possible cloture, to fend off this proposed \nchange in our Federal Constitution. Think of it!\n  I do not question the sincerity of the proponents of the measure, but \nI do question the necessity for a constitutional amendment to achieve \ntheir goals and our goals. I also question the necessity, which is \nbeing forced upon us, to make such a basic decision under the Damocles' \nsword of limited debate. That is not what our forefathers had in mind \nfor this great Senate.\n  Surely no Senator needs to reread history in order to remember how \nmuch blood and treasure it has cost throughout the long centuries, \ndating back to the Magna Carta and beyond, to establish the greatest \ndocument of its kind that was ever written--the Constitution of the \nUnited States, a Constitution which, in the words of Chief Justice \nStory, is ``not intended to provide merely for the exigencies of a few \nyears'' but ``to endure through a long lapse of ages, the events of \nwhich were locked up in the inscrutable purposes of Providence.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to do what I have done several times \non the floor this week, and that is to thank my good friend and \ncolleague, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. He is \nto all our colleagues not only a dear friend but a great mentor. As I \nhave said--and I realize I repeat myself--I have learned so much \nhistory not only this week but in the 25 years I have served with him.\n  Senator Byrd was one of the very first Senators I met after I was \nelected to the Senate. We chatted at a dinner, in Boston, which he will \nrecall, at the residence of the then-mayor of Boston--he and I and a \nclassmate of mine from law school, John Durkin. John and I had both \ngraduated from law school 10 years before, and probably of hubris, \nchutzpah, or foolishness, we\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\nwere both running for the Senate--10 years later, in 1974. We met with \nSenator Byrd at that time.\n  I began my practice of keeping a journal. I recently went back to \nread it. The Senator from West Virginia told of his childhood--not \nbeing one born with a silver spoon in his mouth. There probably wasn't \na silver spoon in the house. He told me what he had done--self-taught, \nwent on to school, learned more, and learned history as few men in this \ncountry ever have. But then he had the opportunity not only to learn \nhistory but to live history, as he has done day after day after day for \nover 40 years in the Congress of the United States, in both bodies.\n  I wrote down some of the things he said that night. I even wrote down \nthe music we heard that evening.\n  When I came to the Senate as a 34-year-old--I was going to say \n``former prosecutor'' but the first time I met him was before I was \nsworn in. I was still a prosecutor. I recall meeting with him during \nthe lame duck session. I don't want to embarrass my good friend from \nWest Virginia, because he met so many young Senators. But I remember so \nwell that it was a lame duck session. I sat in the reception room and \nSenator Byrd came out. I started to reintroduce myself--after all, he \nmeets so many--and he immediately referred to having met me and \nSenator-elect Durkin. He had absolute, total recall of that time.\n\n  I think about this because recently in an unpleasant and unfortunate \nconstitutionally necessary event in this body a year ago when all 100 \nMembers of the Senate sat at the impeachment trial. I recall a member \nof the other body made disparaging remarks about the Senate and that \nthe House Managers would have to simplify things so we Senators could \nunderstand it. He came over to introduce himself to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia. I was sitting here.\n  He said: Senator Byrd, I may have somewhat overstated that.\n  Senator Byrd looked at him and said: I want you to understand two \nthings: I pay close attention and I have a long memory.\n  I repeated that to my oldest son and he said: Dad, Senator Byrd's \nright on both accounts.\n  I know that long memory and we benefit by it.\n  I was thinking today when I came to work how fortunate I am. I have \nsaid many times on the floor of the Senate, we serve at the wishes of \nour State, but service is a privilege. Every time I come to the Capitol \nI feel privileged. I have felt no more privileged in my 25 years than \nin the past few days in this debate on the constitutional amendment. We \ncan not debate anything more significant on this floor, anything that \nwill affect history, long after we have gone. Some day, all 100 \nSenators who now serve will be gone and others will take our place. I \nhope they revere the Constitution, too.\n  I have not enjoyed any debate more than I have the past few days, \npartly because of my friend from West Virginia. We stood on many \nbattles together on constitutional amendments. The Senator mentioned \nthe balanced budget. I am sure we could go to West Virginia, Vermont, \nor anywhere else and take a poll on whether voters want a balanced \nbudget amendment to balance the budget and, resoundingly, yes would be \nthe answer. Senator Byrd, myself, and others had to go back and explain \nto the people of our States: You have trusted us with this vote. If we \npander to you on this, we misplace your trust. We have to do it the \nright way.\n  We have a dear friend, a former colleague, a man for whom we both \nhave respect and great affection, the distinguished former Senator from \nOregon, Mark Hatfield. He and the Senator from West Virginia have \nserved alternately as chairman and ranking member and then as ranking \nmember and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I have \nquoted Senator Hatfield on this floor, and I believe my friend from \nWest Virginia remembers very well that balanced budget vote under \nenormous pressure on the Senator from Oregon, especially when he knew \nit would be a 1-vote margin. He said he would vote to protect the \nConstitution and do what was right. Both the Senator from West Virginia \nand I complimented him afterwards. I remember the steadfastness of \nSenator Hatfield.\n  That is what we have to do on this floor. We have stood together on \nvery difficult treaty matters. We have stood side by side casting votes \nthat at the time were unpopular. History has proven us right.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has cast well over 15,000 votes; I \nbecame the 21st person to cast 10,000 votes, so I have a long way to \ncatch up. We can all go back and find votes we might do differently \ntoday. But if it is a statute, if it is an amendment, if it is a \nprocedural motion we usually get a chance to vote on it again.\n  If it is a budget matter, whatever the issue might be, it is going to \ncome up again and again. Use your experience to make sure you do it \nright--maybe modify it, maybe change it, maybe repeal it, maybe add to \nit. There is one exception--a constitutional amendment. Write a \nconstitutional amendment. If that is then ratified, if that goes into \neffect, we do not come back and change it.\n\n  Look at the example the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nmentioned about prohibition, a bad mistake in the Constitution. A lot \nhappened. Finally it was changed, but only after a great battle.\n  That is why we should always hesitate. That is why the dean of our \nparty, the No. 1 in seniority in our party, has opposed this proposed \nconstitutional amendment. From one who is No. 6 in seniority to the \nSenator who is No. 1, I applaud what the Senator has done.\n  This is not a party issue. The Senator from West Virginia knows we \nhave had Senators from both sides of the aisle, even some who were \ncosponsors, say, ``You are right, let's back up.'' This proposed \namendment will be withdrawn some time today. I hope the United States \nhas learned the Constitution is not something to treat in a cavalier \nfashion.\n  I thank my friend from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the able senior Senator from Vermont \nfor his overly charitable words concerning me. I thank him for his \nsteadfast support on the Constitution. I thank him for the positions he \nhas taken on many occasions during the years we have served together--\npositions that were in the best interest of the Constitution, best \ninterest of this institution, and in the best interest of our country.\n  I join with the Senator in recalling the new profile in courage that \nwas established by our former colleague, Senator Hatfield. He stood as \na rock under the pressures of colleagues. Those were difficult \npressures, in the party conference. He was threatened with his position \nas chairman of the Appropriations Committee. That took courage. And he \nhad it. He had the real stuff. I hope he is listening today. We don't \nforget men such as Mr. Hatfield.\n  Again, I thank my friend; he is my friend, and I think of him as my \nfriend. He is a very generous person, a person whom I would think of as \na Good Samaritan in this journey of life.\n  I thank him for his work here. He will be here, he will be, long \nafter the good Lord has taken me away. But he will be there holding the \ntorch, holding the Constitution, holding up this institution. And there \nwill by others, and I hope there will be more, day by day.\n  I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in my capacity as ranking member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, I also think it is necessary, as we wind \ndown this debate, that I take care of a couple of misconceptions that \noccurred during the debate.\n  My late father, a man who had so much to do with shaping my views, a \nman who was a self-taught historian--a very good one, I might say--\nalways told me if somebody misstates history, it is wise that someone \nelse stands up and states it correctly so the mistake does not go down \nto the next generation.\n  There was a popular misconception behind the proposed constitutional \namendment. The distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, \ntouched on this on the first day of the debate, and actually again \ntoday, when she discussed her theory as to why victims are not \nspecifically mentioned in either the original Constitution or the Bill \nof Rights.\n\n[[Page S2996]]\n\n  According to Senator Feinstein, when the Constitution and the Bill of \nRights were written in the late 18th century, public prosecutors did \nnot exist. I should quote exactly what the distinguished Senator, my \ngood friend, told us on this point. She said:\n\n       When the Constitution was written, in America in the late \n     18th century and well into the 19th century, public \n     prosecutors did not exist. Victims could, and did, commence \n     criminal trials themselves by hiring a sheriff to arrest the \n     defendant, initiating a private prosecution. The core rights \n     of our amendment to notice, to attend, to be heard were \n     inherently made available to a victim of a violent crime.\n\n  She then quotes the following passage from an article by Juan \nCardenas, in the ``Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy'':\n\n       At trial, generally, there were no lawyers for either the \n     prosecution or the defense. Victims of crime simply acted as \n     their own counsel, although wealthier crime victims often \n     hired a prosecutor.\n\n  She then continued:\n\n       Gradually, public prosecution replaced the system of \n     private prosecution. . . . [T]his began to happen in the mid \n     19th century, around 1850, when the concept of the public \n     prosecutor was developed in this country for the first time.\n\n  She then argued the Constitution must now be amended to rebalance the \ncriminal justice system and ``restore'' rights to crime victims.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, also my \nfriend, Senator Hatch, told us on Tuesday that he draws the same \nconclusion from history. He said that when the Constitution was \ndrafted:\n\n       There was no such thing as a public prosecutor; victims \n     brought cases against their attackers.\n\n  He then said:\n\n       When the Constitution was drafted, victims of crime were \n     protected by the same rights given to any party to \n     litigation.\n\n  Not surprisingly, the majority views in the report of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee are likewise predicated on the notion of \n``restoring''--``restoring'' rights to crime victims that they enjoyed \nat the time the Constitution and Bill of Rights were being ratified. \nThe majority views said the following:\n\n       The Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment is \n     intended to restore and preserve, as a matter of right for \n     the victims of violent crimes, the practice of victim \n     participation in the administration of criminal justice that \n     was the birthright of every American at the founding of our \n     Nation.\n       At the birth of this Republic, victims could participate in \n     the criminal justice process by initiating their own private \n     prosecutions. It was decades after the ratification of \n     the Constitution and the Bill of Rights that the offices \n     of the public police and the public prosecutor would be \n     instituted. . . .''\n\n  When I heard my distinguished colleague say there was no such thing \nas a public prosecutor in this country when the Constitution was \ndrafted, I was surprised. I had been a public prosecutor. I was the \nvice president of the National District Attorneys Association at the \ntime I was elected to the Senate. The fact is that, had I not opted for \nthe anonymity of the Senate, I was next in line to become president of \nthat association, one of my few regrets in having to leave to come \nhere, but the Senate would not wait. And, frankly, I did not want to \nwait.\n  But as a former public prosecutor and one who studied a great deal of \nhistory of prosecution, I was quizzical. So I did a little research.\n  I might say, when I state that, you understand, of course, we \nSenators are often times but constitutional impediments to our staff. \nBut, by the same token they deserve a lot of credit, Julie Katzman, in \nmy office, an able lawyer, did a lot of research as did Bruce Cohen \nfrom the Judiciary Committee. They found this article by Mr. Cardenas \nthat Senator Feinstein quoted, which does appear in volume 9 in the \n``Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy.'' In fact, if you take the \npassage the distinguished Senator from California quoted and relied \nupon, from page 367, about how victims of crime used to act as their \nown counsel, it is describing the general practice in this country in \nthe 17th century, not in the late 18th century when the Constitution \nwas written.\n  Mr. Cardenas discusses what happened at the time of the American \nRevolution on page 371, a few pages after the passage quoted by the \nsponsor of this proposed constitutional amendment. He writes:\n\n       Whatever its derivation, the American system of public \n     prosecution was fairly well established at the time of the \n     American Revolution.\n\n  Mr. Cardenas notes that Connecticut was the first colony to establish \na system of public prosecutors, in 1704, over 80 years before the \nConstitution was written.\n  In Vermont, the Office of the State's Attorney is established in \nchapter II, section 50 of the State constitution of 1793. Even before \nVermont joined the Union as the 14th State, it had a system of public \nprosecutions run by the State's Attorneys. Samuel Hitchcock was State's \nAttorney for Chittenden County, VT, from 1787 to 1790, during the time \nthat the Federal Constitution and the Bill of Rights were being \nwritten. Samuel Hitchcock was State's Attorney in Chittenden County, \nfrom 1787 to 1790, some time before I became State's Attorney, in the \nlast century--or, this century, depending upon how we do this. In May \nof 1966, until 11:59 in the morning on January 3 of 1975, I served as \nState's Attorney, also, of Chittenden County. At 12 noon, January 3, I \ntook a different job. I have held it ever since.\n  Now, private prosecutions may not have been eliminated in all the \ncolonies by the time the Constitution was written. They were, however, \neliminated in Virginia, home of some of the foremost architects of the \nConstitution. Mr. Cardenas writes:\n\n       [B]y 1711, the attorney general [of Virginia] appointed \n     deputies to each county in the state, and these deputies \n     began exercising their authority to prosecute not only in \n     important cases, but in routine ones as well. . . . By 1789, \n     the deputy attorney general had complete control over all \n     prosecutions within his county.\n\n  There was a place that had the sort of criminal justice system that \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and others \nattributed to the time the U.S. Constitution was written, but that \nplace was not the United States. Mr. Cardenas describes it on page 360 \nof his article:\n\n       The right of any crime victim to initiate and conduct \n     criminal proceedings with the paradigm of prosecution in \n     England all the way up to the middle of the 19th century.\n\n  It was England that had a system of private prosecution in the 18th \nand 19th centuries, not the United States, not even New England in the \nUnited States.\n  To make sure I had my facts straight, I had to look through some \nother historical source material. I looked at an essay in volume 3 of \nthe ``Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice'' by Professor Abraham S. \nGoldstein on the history of the public prosecutor in America. Professor \nGoldstein tells us essentially the same thing as Mr. Cardenas.\n  Most American colonies followed the English model of private \nprosecutions in the 17th century, but as Professor Goldstein tells us, \nthat system ``proved even more poorly suited to the needs of the new \nsociety than to the older one.'' For one thing, victims abused the \nsystem by initiating prosecutions to exert pressure for financial \nreparation. These colonies shifted to a system of public prosecutions \nbecause they viewed the system of private prosecutions as \n``inefficient, elitist, and sometimes vindictive.''\n  According to Professor Goldstein, some of the colonies have no \nhistory at all in private prosecutions. In the areas settled by the \nDutch in the 17th century, consisting of parts of what are now \nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, the \nDutch brought public prosecutions with them.\n  In any event, Professor Goldstein comes to the same conclusions as \nMr. Cardenas. On page 1287, he writes:\n\n       [B]y the time of the American Revolution, each colony had \n     established some form of public prosecution and had organized \n     it on a local basis. In many instances, a dual pattern was \n     established within the same geographical area, by county \n     attorneys for violations of state law and by town prosecutors \n     for ordinance violations. This pattern was carried over into \n     the states as they became part of the new nation.\n\n  Actually, for almost 200 years that was the system in my own State of \nVermont. Now prosecutions are done by the State's Attorneys of the 14 \ncounties and, in some instances, by the Attorney General.\n  Professor Goldstein goes on to discuss the fact that the Federal \nsystem of prosecution was always a system of public prosecution. Under \nthe Judiciary Act of 1789, enacted the same year\n\n[[Page S2997]]\n\nthe Constitution was ratified, the U.S. Attorney General was ``to \nprosecute and conduct all suits within the Supreme Court of the United \nStates in which the United States might be concerned.'' The general \nauthority to ``prosecute in each district'' for Federal crimes was \nvested in local U.S. district attorneys appointed by the President.\n  Professor Goldstein is a highly respected scholar. He is the Sterling \nProfessor of Law at Yale Law School. In fact, at one time he was the \ndean of that prestigious institution. He is widely regarded as an \nauthority on criminal law and criminal procedure. When Professor \nGoldstein says every American colony had established some form of \npublic prosecution by the time of the Revolution, I think we Senators \ncan probably take that to the bank.\n  To be on the safe side, since we heard Senators say otherwise about \nthis, I thought we should check further. We checked another source, a \n1995 article by Professor Randolph Jonakait of the New York Law School. \nIt appears in volume 27 of the Rutgers Law Journal beginning on page \n77. Not surprisingly, it says much of the same thing about the history \nof public prosecutions as I had already learned from Mr. Cardenas and \nProfessor Goldstein.\n\n  I quote from page 99:\n\n       Although the American colonies initially followed the \n     English prosecutorial pattern, a different process began to \n     emerge around 1700. Public officials took responsibility for \n     the prosecution of crimes generally or just for the limited \n     set of offenses that directly affected the sovereign. As \n     public prosecutors emerged, private prosecutions in the \n     colonies disappeared. This evolution of the American criminal \n     justice system was quick and thorough. By the time of the \n     Revolution, public prosecution in America was standard, and \n     private prosecution, in effect, was gone. Indeed, it was so \n     established and taken for granted at the inception of the new \n     Federal Republic that public prosecutors, although not \n     mentioned in the Constitution, were, without debate, granted \n     exclusive control over prosecutions in Federal courts.\n\n  Mr. Cardenas, Professor Goldstein, and Professor Jonakait are all \nquite clear that the concept of government-paid public prosecutors did \nnot develop in this country for the first time ``around 1850,'' as the \nSenate was mistakenly told on Tuesday. All these authorities agree that \npublic prosecutors have been around in this country for much longer--\nabout 150 years longer--and that they were the rule, not the exception, \nby the time Mr. Madison and Mr. Hamilton and all the other framers of \nour Constitution got together in Philadelphia in 1787 to draft our \nNation's founding charter.\n  If the Bill of Rights, which was written a few years later, makes no \nspecific mention of crime victims, it is not because the framers \nthought victims were protected by a system of private prosecutions.\n  My point, of course, is the proposed constitutional amendment on \nvictims' rights cannot be justified as ``restoring'' victims' rights \nenjoyed at the time the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were \ndrafted. Rather, if we are to draw any lesson from history, it is that \nthe framers believed victims were best protected by the system of \npublic prosecutions that was then, and remains, the American standard \nfor achieving justice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter dated April 25 from Assistant Attorney General Robert Raben \nopposing the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: I write to convey the views of \n     the Department of Justice on S.J. Res. 3, a resolution \n     setting forth the text of a proposed Victims' Rights \n     Amendment (VRA) to the Constitution, which was voted out of \n     the Committee on the Judiciary on September 30, 1999, and \n     sent to the full Senate. The Department continues to have \n     significant concerns with four aspects of S.J. Res. 3. \n     Although we continue strongly to support a victims' rights \n     amendment to the Constitution, and would support S.J. Res. 3 \n     if the concerns detailed in this letter were addressed, we \n     oppose the amendment in its current form. In the interim, we \n     hope you will continue to help crime victims through the \n     enactment of appropriate legislation.\n       As you know, the President and the Attorney General both \n     strongly support a victims' rights amendment that will ensure \n     that victims have a voice in the criminal justice system. See \n     Pres. Proc. No. 7290, 65 FR 19823 (Apr. 10, 2000); Speech of \n     Attorney General Janet Reno to the National Organization for \n     Victim Assistance (Apr. 7, 2000). At the same time, this \n     Administration believes that our constitutional system, which \n     the Framers established after much deliberation and debate, \n     has served our nation well for more than 200 years and should \n     not be altered without the most cautious deliberation. See \n     Statement of President Clinton in Support of Victims' Rights \n     Constitutional Amendment (June 25, 1996). Our support for the \n     VRA has rested on the premise that the Amendment would not \n     undermine existing constitutional provisions' thus, our first \n     concern has been that the resolution lacks an express \n     provision preserving the rights of the accused. In light of \n     our role as the chief federal law enforcement agency, our \n     support has also depended on the Amendment not hampering \n     effective law enforcement; accordingly, our second concern \n     has been the unduly stringent standard for creating \n     exceptions to the Amendment's applicability where necessary \n     to promote the interests of law enforcement. We are committed \n     to an amendment that gives real rights to victims while \n     satisfying these basic criteria. This letter augments our \n     previous letter of June 17, 1998 (enclosed), regarding the \n     then-current S.J. Res. 44, in which we noted the above-\n     mentioned concerns. This letter also reflects further \n     concerns we have about the Amendment's application to the \n     pardon power and the reopening of restitution that we \n     discussed with committee staff before markup in September.\n\n\n                  preserving the existing constitution\n\n       As we stated in our previous letter, we believe that, to \n     ensure the protection of existing constitutional guarantees, \n     the VRA should contain language that expressly preserves the \n     rights of the accused. To that end, we urged that the \n     following language be added: ``Nothing in this article shall \n     be construed to deny or diminish the rights of the accused as \n     guaranteed by the Constitution.''\n       Moreoever, we are concerned that new language that has been \n     added to the proposed VRA would further alter our existing \n     constitutional framework. Section 1 of S.J. Res. 3 has been \n     amended to grant victims the right ``to reasonable notice of \n     and an opportunity to submit a statement concerning any \n     proposed pardon or commutation of a sentence.'' This \n     provision would create an unprecedented incursion on the \n     President's exclusive power to grant pardons, commute \n     sentences and remit restitution. See U.S. Const. art. 2, \n     Sec. 2, cl. 1 (pardon power); Schick v. Reed, 419 U.S. 256, \n     263-64 (1974) (commutation power falls within the pardon \n     power); see also Knote v. United States, 95 U.S. 149, 153-155 \n     (1877) (pardon power includes authority to remit unpaid \n     financial obligations imposed as part of a sentence). The \n     Supreme Court has observed that ``the draftsmen of [the \n     pardon clause] spoke in terms of a `prerogative' of the \n     President, which ought not be `fettered or embarrassed.' '' \n     Schick, 419 U.S. at 263. The Court has also observed that \n     ``whoever is to make [the pardon power] useful must have full \n     discretion to exercise it.'' Ex parte Grossman, 267 U.S. 87, \n     121 (1925). In addition, we note that this provision could \n     encroach upon the clemency powers of governors in states \n     where their authority is also plenary.\n       S.J. Res. 3 does more than simply diminish the control over \n     pardons that the Framers vested in the President; it does so \n     in particularly significant ways. The proposed language would \n     require the President to give victims notice and an \n     opportunity to submit a statement (Section 1), and would \n     arguably permit a court to reopen a pardon, commutation, or \n     remission of restitution (Section 2). It also seemingly would \n     authorize Congress to regulate the pardon power in some \n     respects by granting Congress ``the power to enforce [the \n     VRA] by appropriate legislation,'' rather than reserving \n     enforcement authority to the President (Section 3). By \n     contrast, under our existing constitutional framework, the \n     President has both the responsibility and authority to \n     determine the procedures for his Administration's handling of \n     executive clemency requests so that he may receive the \n     information he deems necessary, including input from victims \n     and others. The current procedures are set out at 28 C.F.R. \n     Sec. Sec. 1.1-1.10. The Department is presently exploring \n     how, and under what circumstances, additional victim \n     interests can be best integrated into the Department's \n     advisory role in counseling the President as he makes \n     decisions about clemency.\n       Furthermore, the pardon provision differs from the rest of \n     the VRA, which focuses on criminal proceedings. Although \n     other provisions of the VRA would give victims rights \n     in proceedings in which defendants have rights, the pardon \n     provision would grant victims rights in a setting in which \n     no one--including defendants--has ever possessed rights, \n     and that has always been controlled entirely by the \n     President. The Framers assigned this power wholly to the \n     President, and we oppose any amendment that would encroach \n     upon it.\n\n\n                        law enforcement concerns\n\n       As we have noted previously, we are concerned that the very \n     high standard for exceptions to the Amendment's victims' \n     rights guarantees in Section 3 of S.J. Res. 3 would render \n     the government unable to remedy the practical law enforcement \n     problems that may arise under the Amendment. We believe\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\n     that the authority to create exceptions should exist where \n     necessary to promote a ``significant'' government interest, \n     rather than the ``compelling'' interest required by the \n     current draft. It is important that the VRA be flexible \n     enough to permit effective and appropriate responses to the \n     variety of difficult circumstances that arise in the course \n     of implementing the Amendment. This concern is explained in \n     more detail in our letter of June 17, 1998.\n       Our last issue concerns the addition of restitution to the \n     list of proceedings and rulings subject to retrospective \n     relief. We believe that any remedies provision should strive \n     to make rights of victims real and enforceable, while \n     ensuring that society's and victims' interests in finality \n     and effective law enforcement are not undermined. Measured \n     against these objectives, we believe Section 2 of S.J. Res. 3 \n     is overly broad and would unduly disrupt the finality of \n     sentences. The current language would appear to permit a \n     victim to reopen the restitution portion of a sentence for \n     any reason at all, at any time, even after a sentence has \n     been served in full. The problems for law enforcement that \n     could be caused by this provision include, for example, the \n     possibility that because of the limited economic means of \n     many defendants, restitution awarded to some victims at \n     sentencing might have to be decreased to accommodate \n     subsequent claims by victims who come forward after \n     sentencing; the potential that defendants will litigate the \n     reopening of a restitution order without the reopening of \n     other parts of the sentence; and the difficulty in reaching \n     and defending plea agreements in light of possible reopenings \n     of and changes in the terms of restitution. In our view, \n     these issues constitute serious obstacles to including \n     restitution among the matters subject to retrospective \n     relief.\n       Further, we believe the inclusion of restitution in Section \n     2 is not necessary in light of existing legislation providing \n     relief for victims who are denied restitution or whose \n     restitution is inadequate. If a federal court fails to impose \n     restitution in accord with controlling statutes, the \n     government can appeal the unlawful sentence without impairing \n     the defendant's Double Jeopardy rights. See 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3742(b); United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 137 \n     (1980). Likewise, the States can legislatively protect \n     victims in this regard by authorizing state prosecutors to \n     appeal criminal sentences that do not satisfy state \n     restitution statutes. Congress and the States can also enact \n     legislation to address perceived gaps in current laws without \n     going so far as to amend the Federal Constitution.\n\n\n          doing more for victims while improving the amendment\n\n       This Administration, with Congress, as kept its commitment \n     to victims of crime, even as it has pushed aggressively for a \n     victims' rights amendment. We have witnessed historic \n     reductions in violent crime over the past seven years, and \n     through our efforts, criminal victimization is at its lowest \n     point in twenty-five years.\n       Even with the significant drop in violent crime, we have \n     not become complacent. In 1994 the President signed into law \n     the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which \n     gives victims of violent crime and sexual abuse the right to \n     speak out in court before sentencing, providing them the \n     opportunity to describe the impact such victimization has had \n     on their lives.\n       The Department, working with Congress, has also provided \n     unprecedented levels of funding for victims' services. Since \n     1993, we have received over $2.2 billion in the Crime \n     Victims' Fund, over 90 percent of which has been distributed \n     to the states and victims' compensation and assistance funds. \n     The Violence Against Women Act has also infused new dollars \n     into victim services: under that act, the Department has \n     funded nearly $1 billion in new domestic violence programs \n     for states, communities, and tribes since 1995.\n       In addition to funding, the Department has taken other \n     steps to improve the way it provides services to victims. We \n     are auditing every component that has any responsibility for \n     our contact with victims to assure appropriate staffing, \n     improve practices and address problems. We have also revised \n     and updated the Attorney General's guidelines for victim \n     assistance.\n       There is more yet that can be done while we continue to \n     strive for an appropriate constitutional amendment. For \n     example, as then Associate Attorney General Raymond Fischer \n     testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1998, we \n     can enact federal legislation that will improve victims' \n     rights and services in the federal system while at the same \n     time providing funds and other incentives to states to \n     improve their own victims' rights laws and policies.\\1\\ By \n     passing such legislation, we can build a crucial bridge to \n     the victims' rights amendment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ In this regard, it is worth noting that, thanks to the \n     concerted efforts of crime victims' advocates and \n     governmental bodies at all levels, all fifty States have now \n     enacted laws safeguarding crime victims' rights in the \n     criminal justice process, and 32 States have amended their \n     constitutions accordingly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       We appreciate the Judiciary Committee's willingness to work \n     with the Department on issues relating to the Victims' Rights \n     Amendment over the last four years. Although we continue \n     strongly to support a victims' rights amendment to the \n     Constitution, and would support S.J. Res. 3 if the concerns \n     detailed in this letter were addressed, we oppose the \n     amendment in its current form because it fails to do so. We \n     urge the Senate to continue to work with the Department in \n     improving the constitutional amendment, while in the interim, \n     continuing to assist crime victims through the enactment of \n     appropriate legislation. Should you have any questions, \n     please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Robert Raben,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have said over and over that no one in \nthe Senate is against crime victims. I care deeply about the rights of \ncrime victims, just as I care about the rights of all Americans.\n  I established one of the first formal systems in my State to make \nsure crime victims are heard. It is something that is done all the time \nnow. In fact, one of the distinguished family court judges, Judge Amy \nDavenport, was in town yesterday and listened to part of this debate. \nShe said: There is nothing you talked about here that we just don't do \nautomatically. In Vermont, we do not need a constitutional amendment to \ndo it.\n  We all care about the rights of crime victims. This is not a case of \nfor or against amending the Constitution. We establish whether we care \nabout crime victims. We all do. I care about their rights. I also care \nabout the rights of mothers and expectant mothers, the rights of \nimmigrants, the rights of workers, the rights of farmers, the rights of \nhospital patients, the rights of the young, the rights of the old, the \nrights of people seeking housing, the rights of students, the rights of \nartists, journalists, and scientists, the rights of those people who \ncare about the environment, and the rights of families.\n  I do not know anybody in this body, Democrat or Republican, who does \nnot care about the rights of all these people.\n  We all care about the rights of all law-abiding Americans. We could \neasily pass unanimous resolutions to that effect. But Americans want \npractical solutions to practical problems from their Government, not \njust expressions of concern. They certainly do not want us to try to \ndefine every one of these rights in a separate constitutional \namendment.\n  So the issue is not whether we care about the rights of crime \nvictims. I point out that a couple weeks ago my dear friend Senator \nFeingold voted against a constitutional amendment to limit campaign \ncontributions. Anyone who would infer from that vote that Senator \nFeingold is not passionate about campaign finance reform knows nothing \nabout Senator Feingold and his attitude about campaign finance reform. \nIn all the years I have been here, I have never seen anybody as \npassionate about it as he.\n  Recently we voted on a constitutional amendment to criminalize \nphysical destruction of the American flag. Senators Bob Kerrey, Robert \nByrd, Mitch McConnell, Bob Bennett, Daniel Inouye, Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, and many others voted against that constitutional amendment. \nMany of them are decorated war veterans. Bob Kerrey, for example, is \nthe only Member of this body to hold the Congressional Medal of Honor. \nThe vote did not mean they do not respect the flag.\n  When Gen. Colin Powell and Senator John Glenn opposed the flag \namendment, it was not because they lack devotion to this country. \nAnybody would be hard pressed to find two people more patriotic than \nthey. Far from it, they are American heroes who showed their patriotism \nby standing up for the Bill of Rights. Frankly, that is ultimate \npatriotism.\n  There have been studies over time in which people are asked about \ndifferent parts of our Bill of Rights that we all rely upon, and the \nstudy would say: Would you vote for the right of free speech today, the \nright of assembly, or some of these others? People say: Yes, all except \nthis or all except that. Thank goodness people had the courage to write \nand vote for it earlier. Our country has it. And then others made sure \nwe did not go back and change it because we might have some problems.\n  In my years in public life, I cannot think of more times that \ndevotion to the first amendment has been tested or that any area in the \nConstitution has been tested more than the first amendment. We do not \nneed the first amendment to protect popular speech; we need it to \nprotect unpopular speech.\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\n That really is the crux of why we should care about amending our \nConstitution and carving exceptions or making changes in our \nConstitution.\n  We had a Member of Congress in Vermont who was prosecuted under the \nAlien and Sedition Act in a way that we all know would be highly \nunconstitutional. Why? Because he criticized the Federal Government. \nThey locked him up. You know what? This is why I love my native State \nof Vermont: We do not let other people tell us what to think. While he \nwas locked up, what did we do? We reelected him and sent him right back \ndown to Congress. And the shame was on those who supported the Alien \nand Sedition Act, they were soon gone.\n  It was a Vermonter, I think the most outstanding Vermont U.S. Senator \nof the 20th century, who stood on the floor of this body--a \nquintessential conservative--Republican Ralph Flanders of Vermont, who \nintroduced a motion of censure against Joseph McCarthy, the late \nSenator from Wisconsin. Joseph McCarthy ran roughshod for too long over \nthe first amendment of the United States, and lives and careers were \nruined because of his accusations. Ralph Flanders stood up and called a \nhalt to that. Then other Senators came forward and joined with him. \nThat reign was over.\n  I would say to anyone who visits the United States, from whatever \ncountry, if you want to guarantee a democracy, guarantee two things: \nGuarantee the freedom of speech, including the freedom to say things \nthat might be unpopular at the moment because you may find within a few \nyears they will be the popular ones; and, secondly, guarantee the right \nto practice any religion you want, or none, if you want. Because if you \nprotect those two rights, you protect diversity. If you protect \ndiversity in your country, you protect democracy.\n\n  I say that those who have opposed this constitutional amendment are \nnot doing it because they lack concern for victims' rights. Decent and \nsincere people in both parties who serve in this Chamber respect \nvictims' rights, but many of us oppose this amendment. I support crime \nvictims' rights. I do not support a victims' rights constitutional \namendment.\n  The issue before the Senate is whether to amend the U.S. \nConstitution--and almost double the length of the entire Bill of \nRights--by adding a complex listing of constitutional victims' rights \nand limitations that may diminish the Constitution and do little to \nprotect victims. It is not like passing a commemorative resolution.\n  Do we have to pass constitutional amendments to prove we care about \npeople? We care about victims, but we also care about mothers, \nimmigrants, workers, farmers, hospital patients, the young, the old, \nartists, journalists, scientists, nature lovers, and families.\n  We have heard complaints in this Chamber more than a few times about \n``group entitlements.'' We are not going to have a constitutional \namendment for every group.\n  Stuart Taylor recently wrote in the National Journal about this \namendment. He wrote:\n\n       Most of us agree, of course, that prosecutors and judges \n     should be nice to crime victims (as they usually are). Most \n     of us also agree that parents should be nice to their \n     children. But would we adopt a constitutional amendment \n     declaring, ``Parents shall be nice to their children''? Or \n     ``Parents shall give their children reasonable notice and an \n     opportunity to be heard before deciding whether and how to \n     punish older children who have pushed them around''? Would we \n     leave it to the courts to define the meaning of terms like \n     ``reasonable'' and ``nice''?\n       A ban on spanking, perhaps? A minimum of one candy bar per \n     day? Would we let the courts override all state and federal \n     laws that conflict with their interpretations?\n       We don't need constitutional amendments to embody our broad \n     agreement on such general principles. And we should leave it \n     to the states (and Congress) to detail rules for applying \n     such principles to the messy realities of life.\n\n  There is no precedent in a national constitution for a victims' \nrights amendment. But there is precedent for treating constitutional \nprovisions as group entitlements. For most of the 20th century, there \nwas a nation that rejoiced in criticizing America for not caring about \nthe rights of various groups of law-abiding people because we did not \nhave such provisions in our Constitution. That nation had special \nconstitutional provisions for mothers, immigrants, workers, farmers, \nhospital patients, the young, the old, artists, journalists, \nscientists, nature lovers, and families.\n  I would have brought a copy of its 1977 constitution along with me \ntoday if I could carry it. But some of our visitors today know that \ncountry is no longer here, the former Union of Soviet Socialist \nRepublics. Back then, I felt confident that Mr. Madison and his \ncompatriots had done a better job of drafting a Constitution than Mr. \nLenin, Mr. Stalin, or Mr. Brezhnev, and I am no less proud to be an \nAmerican today. Madison, Jefferson, Washington, and the other founders \nunderstood three key lessons other countries are only learning now, 200 \nyears later.\n\n  First, in a democracy, it is better to have a short constitution \neveryone can read and understand rather than a long one full of \nsymbolic declarations, legalese, and procedural details. I hold the \nConstitution, including the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of \nIndependence in this little booklet.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from New York mentioned a country we \nall respect, a democracy, France, which amended its Constitution so \nmany times to fit in every single little thing they could possibly \nthink of so that, as the story goes, in the libraries they do not file \nit under ``constitution,'' they file it under ``periodicals.'' Well, I \ndo not want that to be the U.S. Constitution.\n  Secondly, in a free society, the purpose of a constitution is to \nconstrain the government, to establish a government of limited powers, \nwith the rest of the powers to the people, not a government of \nexpanding responsibilities. Jefferson and Madison trusted to the States \nand the American people to care for the rights of victims of crime and \nof other misfortunes by means of the democratic process and by using \nthe tool at hand to solve problems as they arose. They did not mandate \na set of procedures for relief of every problem by calling them rights \nand then tacking them on to the Constitution. Instead, they reserved \nthe Constitution for the protection of the people from the government \nitself.\n  Thirdly, in a nation of ordinary practical people, what is needed are \npractical responses to practical problems, not symbols of concern that \nat the end of the day are empty. Madison and Jefferson designed the \noriginal Bill of Rights to respond to actual government abuses such as \nsuppression of unpopular speech or unpopular religion or unpopular \nnewspapers, that the States and the Federal Government could not be \notherwise trusted to remedy in the normal course of events.\n  Likewise, the Reconstruction Amendments did not enact a long litany \nof procedural rights without substance. Instead, they responded to a \nreal, practical history of abuse by State governments of the rights of \nAfrican-Americans. Even then our Nation was shamefully slow in \nimplementing the anti-slavery amendments.\n  The proposed amendment under consideration is fundamentally \nmisconceived. It would be the most procedurally complex provision of \nthe entire Constitution, within just a few words of doubling the length \nof the entire Bill of Rights. Every school child, every senior citizen, \nevery American can pick up this Constitution and read it and understand \nit. That is the beauty of it. That is the strength of it. That is why a \nquarter of a billion people live in such freedom.\n  We have referred to the last American precedent for a constitutional \namendment to increase the power of government over law-abiding \ncitizens. That was prohibition. It was well intentioned but, my word, \nwhat a disaster. It ended up staining the reputation of Senator \nVolstead and others who championed its cause. It was so ill suited to \nthe framework of our Constitution that it bears the distinction of \nbeing the only constitutional amendment that had to be repealed.\n  I still remember the stories I was told as a child, many in Vermont, \nof good, upright citizens who prospered greatly during prohibition, \nperhaps because of the fortuitous aspect of our geographical location \nbordering on Canada.\n  If I could digress for a moment, we have a large lake in the northern \npart of Vermont, Lake Memphremagog. My wife was born on the shores of \nLake Memphremagog, as she quickly points out, on the Vermont side. Her \nparents,\n\n[[Page S3000]]\n\nof French Canadian descent moved there to take up life as new American \ncitizens. She became a first-generation American.\n\n  Lake Memphremagog is a magnificent lake that is half in Vermont and \nhalf in Canada. During prohibition time, some of the farmers who had \nlittle farms, one or two cows and a falling down barn along the lake, \nhad very expensive Chris-Craft speedboats. I mention this because the \nlocal Customs official had a slower boat with an outboard motor. Every \nevening about dusk, these farmers would go out with their high-powered \nspeed boats and they would have their fishing rod and a couple worms \nand they would head out across the lake toward Canada to go fishing, \ntheir speedboats riding high.\n  About 2 o'clock in the morning, you would hear this awful roar across \nthe lake as several of these came back, obviously the ``fishing'' \nhaving been very successful because the boats are now riding much, much \nlower. You can imagine the chagrin of the poor Customs agent who had to \ntry to fulfill the prohibition provision of the Constitution, as he \nwondered which one of these fishing boats he should try to intercept, \nknowing he could not intercept any of them because he could not catch \nthem.\n  Whether it was because of the ``fishing'' or not, for at least a \ngeneration thereafter, the two most popular brands of alcohol in \nVermont were the two that are also the most popular in the Province of \nQuebec, right across the lake.\n  As I said, I digress. But prohibition caused such a disrespect for \nthe law. It really made us look foolish, but it took forever to change \nit because it was in the Constitution. If we made the mistake of doing \nit as a statute, we could have amended it. We could have changed it \nwithin a year. Everybody knew it was not working. Everybody knew it was \nincreasing the power of organized crime. Everybody knew it was bringing \nabout corruption and bribery and everything else. But worse than that, \na democracy can enforce its laws only if people respect the laws. A \ndemocracy can work only if we know that these laws are fair and these \nlaws are just.\n  We do not have a police officer in everybody's house. We do not have \na police officer on every corner. We expect people to obey the laws. \nBut if they have no respect for them, then they do not. In all the \nyears it took to repeal this, for over a decade, the laws in this \ncountry and the people's respect for the laws of this country \ndiminished every single year. Nobody could do anything about it because \nit takes so long to repeal a constitutional amendment.\n  So let us look at statutes when we can. Let us think of article V of \nthe Constitution, which says you amend only when necessary.\n  Last, but by no means least, the proposed amendment is not a \npractical response to a practical problem. Many States are ahead of the \nFederal Government in protecting victims' rights. Recent years have \nseen huge advances in protection of victims' rights in State \nconstitutions and State legislation, in the provision of restitution or \nother compensation where practical, and in improvement of law \nenforcement resources and techniques to ensure proper regard for \nvictims.\n  While Congress has been focusing its attention on more than 60 drafts \nof a constitutional amendment on victims' rights, it has actually \nslowed us down from doing real improvement to the way crime victims are \ntreated in Federal courts and by Federal prosecutors. Our legislative \nachievements of the period from 1994 through 1997 have not been matched \nin the last several years. I fear this debate on the proposed \nconstitutional amendment will be in lieu of consideration of scores of \nsignificant legislative proposals introduced by Senators on both sides \nof the aisle to help victims.\n  Violent crime is a serious practical problem in our society--far more \nthan it was even when I was a prosecutor. As a parent, as a \ngrandparent, that troubles me greatly. But there is not a fundamental \nproblem--certainly not one requiring a rigid, one-size-fits-all set of \nconstitutionally mandated procedures--in how the States treat victims \nof violent crimes today.\n  We have visitors in the gallery today from Russia, the successor to \nthe former Soviet Union. The old Soviet Constitution demanded the \nobedience of Russians. It really was not very subtle about it. Article \n59 declared that every citizen was ``obliged to observe the \nConstitution and comply with the standards of socialist conduct.''\n  Well, the U.S. Constitution does not command; instead, it counsels \nhumility. It is humbling to consider the great minds that drafted it, \nits clarity and simplicity in laying down a framework to protect law-\nabiding people by ensuring limited, democratic government. It is also \nhumbling to think how it has stood the test of time. It remains \nextraordinary what was achieved in 4 short months in Philadelphia in \n1787, when communication meant walking from one building to another to \ntalk to somebody, or sending a letter by horseback. In 4 short months, \nlook at what they wrote.\n  By contrast, we have been waiting twice that long for the House-\nSenate conference on the juvenile crime legislation to meet and \ncomplete its work--something that could really help victims of crime in \nthis country, something that could be done now and something that could \nbe sent down to the President and signed into law and it would be the \nlaw of the land immediately. But we do not meet because the gun lobby \nsaid do not meet.\n  We ought to be very slow in this Chamber to presume that we know \nbetter than the founders how to balance the power of government and the \nrights of the accused. We should be reluctant to presume that we can \ndraft a one-size-fits-all set of detailed procedural rules that will \nwork to protect different people who are victims of different crimes in \ncases in different States--the kind of constitutional micromanagement \nof the judicial process the framers were too wise to attempt. These \n400-odd words of the 63rd draft of this proposed amendment do not fit \nwith the size and style, the limited Government vision, or the \npractical approach of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  I hope when we finish this debate all Senators will join in efforts \nto improve victims' rights through the States and through Federal \nlegislation.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Delaware on the floor. As \nchairman and as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Biden has worked very hard on legislation to help victims of \nall kinds of crime. The distinguished Senator from Delaware has helped \nwrite laws that can take effect and have money and teeth in them to \nhelp victims. I have done some, as have others. Usually, we join in \nbipartisan efforts to do it. But they have been pieces of legislation \nthat, once signed into law, we could watch. We could see if they were \nworking, and if they did, fine, we could expand them and give them more \nmoney. If they did not work, we could change them. We cannot do that \nwith a constitutional amendment.\n  I ask those who are for victims' rights to support congressional \naction on S. 934, the Crime Victims Assistance Act.\n  Mr. President, we have editorials in opposition to this \nconstitutional amendment from the Asheville Citizen-Times, the \nBaltimore Sun, the Chicago Tribune, the Herald, the Philadelphia \nInquirer, the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the San Francisco Chronicle, the \nSan Francisco Examiner, the San Jose Mercury News, the Seattle Post-\nIntelligencer, the St. Petersburg Times, the Washington Times, the \nCollegiate Times, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; and the South Bend \nTribune.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several of these articles be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 15, 2000]\n\n                      An Uncluttered Constitution\n\n                            (By Bruce Fein)\n\n       What keeps our Constitution sacred and accessible to the \n     ordinary citizen is majestic brevity and a confinement to \n     essentials.\n       Amendments should thus be limited to issues of great and \n     enduring moment that cannot be safely entrusted to popular \n     majorities. The pending Victims' Rights Amendment, under \n     active consideration by the House and Senate and lukewarmly \n     supported by the Clinton administration, falls short of that \n     historically exacting standard.\n       The amendment, House Joint Resolution 64, would dictate an \n     array of victims' rights in federal or state criminal or \n     auxiliary proceedings. The motivation is irreproachable:\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\n     to guarantee crime victims a minimum opportunity to be heard \n     or to be otherwise involved when the disposition of their \n     predators in question. But good motivation, without more, \n     does not justify a constitutional coronation. If it did, the \n     1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the 1968 \n     Fair Housing Act, Title IX of the Higher Education Act, the \n     American With Disabilities Act, and an endless list of \n     companion federal laws would be elevated to constitutional \n     status and the document would smack more of Edward Gibbon's \n     ``Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' than of Lincoln's \n     Gettysburg Address.\n       VRA crusaders have cobbled together an assortment of \n     unpersuasive reasons for their constitutional cause, as \n     though adding zero to zero repetitively may eventually equal \n     something. It is said criminal defendants and prisoners enjoy \n     constitutional rights that trump victims' rights enumerated \n     in scores of statutes and state constitutions. But nothing in \n     the constitutional text or United States Supreme Court \n     precedents even hints at a conflict with victims' rights \n     that command lower statutory status: the right to notice \n     and to have views considered in prosecutorial, sentencing, \n     parade, or commutation decisions and to attend criminal \n     trials. Amendment proponents have searched in vain for a \n     single court decision that supports their fretting.\n       Crime victims have demonstrated stunning success in \n     majoritarian politics who need no constitutional protection \n     from potentially hostile legislation. As a chief sponsor of \n     the Amendment, Rep. Steve Chabot, Ohio Republican, testified \n     last Thursday before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the \n     Constitution, ``In 1982, California became the first state to \n     pass a Victims' Rights Amendment to its constitution. Since \n     that time, 32 states, including my home state of Ohio, have \n     passed similar amendments . . . ratified [by an average of] \n     79 percent of the vote in state-wide referendums.''\n       That is no surprise. Crime victims evoke almost universal \n     sympathy, and no one campaigns boasting, ``I will vote \n     against victims' rights.''\n       Amendment apostles also urge that state laws are \n     disrespected by state judges or prosecutors. But that is \n     unvariably true of new laws during their childhoods. Legal \n     training and habits are customarily backward-looking, and \n     legal bureaucracies lie midpoint between sclerosis and rigor \n     mortis. But troglodyte judges, prosecutors, and clerks will \n     die or retire; their replacements will be victims' rights \n     enthusiasts indoctrinated in the new gospel. The problem of \n     inattention to state or victims' rights laws will solve \n     itself, in the same way that unionization rights flowered in \n     the legal system in the 1930s after decades of crabbed \n     interpretations and applications of statutes.\n       Amendment champions retort that victims' rights would \n     command more prosecutorial and judicial respect if enshrined \n     in the Constitution. But prosecutors and judges take oaths to \n     defend state laws every bit as much as they vow to enforce \n     the Constitution. If they would honor the first more in the \n     breach than in the observance, the second would fare no \n     better. History also speaks volumes. The 1866 Civil Rights \n     Act protecting freedom leaped into the Constitution with the \n     1868 14th Amendment, but the civil rights of blacks were \n     routinely ignored by courts, including the United States \n     Supreme Court, for almost a century during the ugly era of \n     Jim Crow. Similarly, did the Roman Catholic creed induce \n     greater compliance with the proclamation of Papal \n     infallibility in 1870?\n       Victims' rights paladins wrongly equate their cause with \n     the constitutional protections of persons accused of crime. \n     But criminal defendants, unlike crime victims, are generally \n     pariahs who need safeguards against an infuriated public \n     clamoring for instant justice. Further, what is at stake for \n     the accused is his life or liberty, the most precious of our \n     natural rights.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Every constitutional amendment dents our system of \n     federalism. It removes an issue from the agendas of state \n     governments that can more closely tailor solutions that \n     satisfy constituents and serve as laboratories for sister \n     states and the federal government without risk to the entire \n     nation. Errors can be corrected by simple legislation, which \n     is nimble compared to overcoming a constitutional misstep, \n     like the Prohibition Amendment. Deference to stale choice \n     additionally offers citizens greater opportunities to \n     participate directly in the responsibilities of self-\n     government, indispensable to sustaining a robust democratic \n     culture.\n       In sum, the Victims' Rights Amendment has nothing to \n     commend and much to deplore.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, April 25, 2000]\n\n             A Victims' Rights Plan That Goes Much Too Far\n\n       Victims of crime deserve consideration and compassion, but \n     a constitutional amendment giving them a new category of \n     ``rights'' goes too far.\n       The U.S. Senate will attempt this week to alter the \n     Constitution again, this time with a Victims' Rights \n     Amendment drafted on the premise that victims should have \n     more say about the trials and dispositions of defendants.\n       Specifically, it would give victims the right to attend all \n     proceedings, to make their views known about sentencing and \n     plea arrangements, to be notified whenever an offender is \n     released from custody, to demand a speedy trial and to get \n     restitution from the offending party.\n       Considering the often deep pain they suffer, victims \n     deserve to be heard and protected by the criminal justice \n     system, but tinkering with the Constitution is no way to do \n     it. Many of these concerns can and have been addressed \n     through legislation, which can be amended as problems and \n     unintended consequences are identified.\n       One of the problems with this amendment is that its \n     definition of ``victim'' is too vague, creating a financially \n     onerous and otherwise impossible mandate. For example, in the \n     Oklahoma City bombing, who would the victims be? The office \n     workers who survived the bombing, the family members and \n     friends of the hundreds killed or maimed, or anybody in town \n     still suffering the horrifying aftermath?\n       As such, all would have to be notified about trial \n     proceedings, have the right to speak and to push for specific \n     prosecution. And if they didn't agree on sentencing or the \n     way the case was adjudicated, what would the court do then?\n       Meanwhile, advocates for battered women dread what would \n     happen if a women is arrested for responding to domestic \n     abuse--namely that the abuser could become the victim with \n     rights to oppose her bail and seek restitution. Perhaps \n     that's why a slew of victims' rights groups is among those \n     most opposed to the amendment.\n       Although a grand gesture, this proposed constitutional \n     change is clumsy and cumbersome, destroying the very core of \n     our justice system--the right to a speedy trial and the \n     presumption of innocence. Both Congress and state \n     legislatures have the ability to strengthen victims' rights \n     without trying to alter the principles of justice set forth \n     in the U.S. Constitution.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the San Francisco Examiner, April 14, 2000]\n\n                     No Victims in the Constitution\n\n       Dianne Feinstein is wrong on this one. The usually astute \n     Democratic U.S. senator from California is leading a campaign \n     to get a victims' rights amendment added to the federal \n     Constitution.\n       Along with Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., and 40 other senators, \n     she is sponsoring legislation that would allow the states to \n     vote on ratification of the 28th amendment. The votes of 67 \n     senators are needed for passage. Three-quarters of the states \n     must ratify the amendment before it goes into effect.\n       Victims' rights is an idea that's seductive by its very \n     simplicity. Of course victims should have rights. Who can \n     deny that? But enshrining them in the Constitution is a feel-\n     good exercise of dubious value that carries potential harm.\n       ``The Constitution,'' argues Feinstein, ``gives 15 specific \n     rights to the accused, but victims have no basic rights under \n     the Constitution.''\n       That misses the point of what the Constitution and the Bill \n     of Rights are about. The rights enumerated are protections \n     for individuals against the awesome power of the government. \n     They are not intended to referee fights between citizens or \n     redress the grievances of victims of private action, no \n     matter how terrible the consequences.\n       Littering the Constitution with other matters cheapens it \n     and opens the door to inclusion of the flotsam and jetsam of \n     some citizens' oddball desires. If you think this overstates \n     the case, just look at the junk foisted on the California \n     Constitution by an overactive initiative process.\n       This is not to say there shouldn't be a law. In fact, \n     legislation is exactly where victims' rights belongs.\n       As a bill in Congress, the planks of victims' rights would \n     be unobjectionable. Consider the constituent parts of the \n     amendment. Among other features, it would give some 9 million \n     victims of violent crimes and their families the right to \n     notice of criminal proceedings in their cases and the right \n     to attend them; the right to testify or submit statements at \n     trials, parole hearings and other proceedings; the right of \n     notice if the felon escapes or is released, and the right of \n     restitution from the perpetrator of the crime.\n       So far, 32 states have passed legislation or constitutional \n     amendments specifying victims' rights. But Feinstein \n     complains that until the U.S. Constitution is changed, a \n     defendant's rights trump a victim's rights when there's a \n     conflict between the two.\n       We're glad she's not also proposing to change the standard \n     of criminal guilt from ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' to a \n     ``preponderance of the evidence.'' Presumably that would also \n     make trials more fair for victims. But the American system of \n     criminal justice is built on the sane principle that letting \n     a possibly guilty defendant go free is a thousand times \n     preferable to convicting an innocent person.\n       The 13 men released from death row in Illinois after new \n     exonerating evidence was uncovered would be glad to tell Sen. \n     Feinstein why legal protections for the accused are splendid \n     ideas. Anyway, the guts of a sensible victims' rights program \n     wouldn't conflict with legal protections for defendants.\n       Victims and their families sometimes do get poor treatment \n     from prosecutors and courts. Trying to remedy that by \n     amending the Constitution is a grandstand play that generates \n     a lot of publicity. But it is unnecessary and wrong. It would \n     dilute the time-\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\n     tested and trusted document that defines relations in this \n     nation between citizens and their government.\n       Don't make us all victims of an ill-considered crusade.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the San Jose Mercury News, April 20, 2000]\n\n     Victims of Crime Don't Need Congress' Constitutional Meddling\n\n                           (By Joanne Jacobs)\n\n       You have the right to remain silent, when accused of a \n     crime.\n       You have the right to speak up, when victimized by a \n     criminal. California and 31 other states have passed victims' \n     rights amendments to their constitutions; all the rest have \n     statutes.\n       So why do we need to amend the Constitution of the United \n     States of America to include a Crime Victims' Rights \n     Amendment?\n       Because it's an election year.\n       Next week, on April 25, the Senate will debate the victims' \n     amendment, sponsored by California Senator Dianne Feinstein, \n     a Democrat, and Arizona Senator John Kyl, a Republican. The \n     vote may be April 27 or 28.\n       Some 46 senators have signed on to the bill, but it will \n     take a two-thirds majority (67) and two-thirds of the House \n     (291) for passage, plus three-fourths of state legislatures \n     to ratify.\n       The Constitution shields Americans--especially the \n     unpopular--from governmental power.\n       The amendment grants rights to a politically popular and \n     sympathetic group, victims. But no legislation can guarantee \n     sensitivity by prosecutors and judges or competence by clerks \n     assigned to notify victims about changing court dates. No \n     amendment or law can give Americans what we really want: \n     freedom from killers, rapists and robbers.\n       Instead, the amendment would federalize rights already \n     offered by the states: Victims must be notified about bail, \n     plea bargains, trials, sentencing and parole hearings, and \n     about a prisoners' release or escape. They're entitled to a \n     restitution order, which is usually uncollectible.\n       Feinstein-Kyl also includes ``consideration of the interest \n     of the victim that any trial be free from unreasonable \n     delay,'' which means the victim could ask for a speedy trial \n     but the judge wouldn't have to grant it.\n       Victims would have a right to attend the entire trial, even \n     if they're going to be called as witnesses and might tailor \n     their testimony to fit an earlier witness's statement.\n       However, the judge could decide the defendant's \n     constitutional right to a fair trial outweighs the victim's \n     constitutional right to attend.\n       Other than adding a symbolic statement--``Pols (hurt) \n     Victims''--to the U.S. Constitution, this wouldn't change \n     much. Except to provide more ways to file lawsuits, which \n     isn't going to make justice any swifter.\n       Both presidential candidates are pro-victim.\n       ``I will lead the fight to pass a Victims' Rights Amendment \n     to the United States Constitution--so our justice system puts \n     victims and their families first again,'' Al Gore said in a \n     Boston speech last July.\n       Apparently, he hasn't started yet. Gore's ``Fighting \n     Crime'' agenda on his www.gore2000.org site doesn't mention \n     victims rights, and the vice president hasn't endorsed the \n     Feinstein-Kyl amendment.\n       The Clinton administration is wavering on the amendment, \n     worried about interfering with prosecutors, denying \n     defendants' rights and impinging on the president's power to \n     grant executive clemency. (If President Gore wanted to pardon \n     ex-President Clinton's perjury, who'd be the victim: Paula \n     Jones? Ken Starr? 275 million Americans?)\n       George W. Bush ``strongly supports'' the Feinstein-Kyl \n     amendment. It's not on his Website, www.georgewbush.com \n     however; there's no issue statement on crime.\n       Most victim's groups are for it, but not all.\n       Bud Welch, whose daughter was killed in the 1995 Oklahoma \n     City bombing, chairs Citizens for the Fair Treatment of \n     Victims, which opposes the amendment. Emotional relatives \n     might hamper prosecutors, Welch argues. Many relatives of \n     victims objected to a plea bargain made to secure testimony \n     of an accomplice of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, Welch \n     Writes. ``Had this amendment been in place, the judge may \n     have refused the plea agreement, making it significantly more \n     difficult for the government to convict McVeigh and \n     Nichols.''\n       Furthermore, consulting all the family members of all the \n     victims--168 were killed and many more injured--would have \n     created chaos, delaying the trial.\n       Feinstein cites the Oklahoma City bombing as proving the \n     need for the amendment. The judge told victims' families they \n     couldn't sit through the trial if they wanted to testify at \n     the sentencing hearing. When Congress passed a law allowing \n     it, the judge said the Constitution, guaranteeing a fair \n     trial to the defendants, trumped the law.\n       This is Feinstein's only example of a conflict that would \n     require a constitutional amendment.\n       The amendment also gives victims rights before a court has \n     determined they're really victims, noted Robert P. Mosteller, \n     a Duke law professor, in testimony before the House Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       Imagine the Rodney King case, with no videotape, Mosteller \n     said. The police officers charge King attacked them. As \n     victims, the officers could ``sit in the courtroom during the \n     testimony of all other witnesses as a matter of federal \n     constitutional right. This provision would permit the true \n     perpetrators of the crime to coordinate their false version \n     of the facts'' and convict the real victim.\n       A judge could weigh witness-victims' right to attend and \n     the defendant's right to a fair trial, Feinstein argues. The \n     defendant might win.\n       Or be convicted by tainted testimony, leading to more \n     appeals.\n       It's not worth it.\n       My bottom line is simple: Don't mess with the U.S. \n     Constitution. Since the Bill of Rights was added 209 years \n     ago, only 17 amendments have been added to the Constitution. \n     It should not be changed unless absolutely necessary. It's \n     not necessary in this case, not even close. Leave the \n     Constitution alone.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, April 25, 2000]\n\n                    The Wrong Way on Victims' Rights\n\n       Some national issues of grave importance can be dealt with \n     adequately only by amending the United States Constitution. \n     That was true of slavery, women's suffrage, and the income \n     tax. But the same can't be said about the treatment of crime \n     victims.\n       Their needs are real and worthy of concern. The Victims' \n     Rights Amendment due for a Senate vote this week, however, is \n     overdoing a good thing.\n       Every state has a law or constitutional provision assuring \n     that crime victims may attend judicial proceedings that \n     concern them, be notified of the impending release of their \n     attackers, sue the offender for restitution, and the like. \n     Many of these measures are relatively young and, according to \n     victims' rights advocates, have not fulfilled the hopes \n     lodged in them.\n       That's an argument for better funding and more meticulous \n     implementation. It's grounds for electing prosecutors and \n     judges who will take them seriously. It's also grounds for \n     realistic expectations: Some goals are not likely to be \n     realized no matter what. Restitution, for example, is largely \n     a vain hope simply because most criminals are poor and thus \n     lack the money to pay it.\n       The proposed constitutional amendment, however, threatens \n     to do more harm than good. Its guarantees could sometimes \n     conflict with the rights of defendants, as when it gives \n     victims the right to demand a speedy trial. In such \n     instances, the suspect's right to defend himself could be \n     compromised, increasing the risk that innocent people will go \n     to jail. Or the defendant's right could trump--in which case \n     the new amendment would amount to little more than empty \n     symbolism.\n       In either case, the decision will be made by judges, not \n     legislators or voters. The advantage of protecting victims' \n     rights by law is that different states can experiment with \n     different approaches to see which are most effective and \n     affordable. Once this amendment is entrenched in the federal \n     Constitution, though, the entire nation will have to live \n     with a ``one size fits all'' approach--and we may find that \n     one size fits none.\n       Someone once said that a vice is often just a virtue taken \n     too far. The Senate shouldn't make that mistake on victims' \n     rights.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have so much respect and affection for \ntwo key sponsors, Senator Kyl of Arizona and Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia. They, as the other 98 Senators of both parties, care deeply \nabout the rights of victims. Anybody who has seen some of the violent \ncrimes in this country could not feel otherwise. A great, powerful, \nwealthy nation ought to care about the victims of child abuse, or \nfraud, and victims of all crime. That is not the issue. The issue, I \nsay to my friends, is the legacy we leave to the next generation. So \nmuch of that legacy as Senators is what is in the Constitution.\n  We will not vote on anything more important than constitutional \namendments, unless it is a declaration of war. There have been \nthousands of votes I have cast, and many that I can remember were \ninconsequential. Virtually all of them were on issues on which, if we \ndid not like the results we could come back and revisit it the next \nCongress and change it. You cannot do that with a constitutional \namendment. You do it with practical, pragmatic legislation that \nactually helps people--legislation that the Senator from Delaware has \npassed, legislation that I have passed, legislation that Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle have passed, including Senators Nickles, \nDeWine, and others. I do not mean to exclude other people who have \njoined in on real legislation that really works for victims.\n  Mr. President, how much time is still available to the Senator from \nVermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). There are 48 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, is the Senator from Delaware under a time \nconstraint?\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the cloture situation, the Senator has \nup to 1 hour.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank my friend from \nVermont for his kind comments. It is rare on matters of constitutional \nlaw and matters of civil rights and civil liberties that the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont and I end up on opposite sides of \nthe issue. We are on opposite sides of this issue. I, as the Senator \nfrom Vermont, have been very reluctant over my 28 years in the Senate \nto support constitutional amendments. I think they are a matter of \nsignificant concern and should not be undertaken without significant \nneed and only after it is concluded that the same result could not be \naccomplished statutorily. So it is after some considerable thought--\nand, I might add, a considerable amount of work with the two primary \nsponsors of this amendment--that I have arrived at the point where I \nsupport this amendment.\n  Before I begin to discuss the details of the amendment, let me \nsuggest to the Senator from Vermont that I came in at the tail end of \nhis initial comments regarding public prosecution as opposed to \nprivately going out and hiring a prosecutor to redress a criminal wrong \nthat had been done to you, and his discussion about whether or not it \nwas an established principle that the founders thought public \nprosecution was appropriate at the time of the Constitution. He is dead \nright on the facts. But I suggest to him, and others, that I suspect \nthe points being made--and I have been in Colombia spending a good deal \nof time with President Pastrana on the drug and narcotrafficking \nproblem he faces, so I missed a day of debate on this. So I may be \nmistaken in what I am about to say. But I expect that those who talked \nabout public prosecution versus private prosecution were trying to make \nthe generic point--I hope they were--that at one point in our English \njurisprudential history, and for a number of centuries early on, the \nissue of moving forward to prosecute a wrong against you was totally in \nthe hands of the victim. The victim made that judgment.\n\n  Early on, to overstate it, in the 14th, the 15th, the 16th and 17th \ncentury, if I were mugged in the stable, it would be Biden v. Jones. It \nwould not be the Crown v. Jones. I was not represented by anyone but \nmyself. This process evolved. The only good part of that process was \nthat the victim controlled his or her own fate to a significant degree.\n  All of the years and years that I was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the ranking member, we held hearing after hearing about \nhow victims feel disenfranchised. One of the things that victims of \nviolent crime need to be able to come to closure with is the dilemma \nand the horrible position in which they were placed. They have to see \nit come to fruition. They have to be able to know that they had some \nhand in the idea that the person who did bad things to them was \npursued, and they got their day in court--``they,'' the victim.\n  Also, there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that began to pile \nup in the 1960s, 1970s, and then in the 1980s it reached a high pitch. \nIn the 1990s it pertained as well. That is where people lost respect \nfor the government and lost respect for the law because they believed \nthey were not treated with respect--where victims found themselves, in \ntheir view, victimized not only by the criminal but victimized by the \nsystem.\n  That is why, I note parenthetically, when I wrote the Violence \nAgainst Women Act I provided for a means by which a woman who was a \nvictim of violent crime could, if the prosecutor chose not to go after \nher assailant, after the person who did those bad things to her, she \ncould at least go into the civil court and sue that individual.\n  Again, there was overwhelming testimony from psychiatrists and \npsychologists that there is a need for healing. Part of the catharsis \nin healing is to be able to go through the process and believe you are \ngetting fair and decent treatment.\n  There are two things at stake when this cause of victims' rights \nbegins to arise.\n  The public prosecutors, not because they were no longer caring, but \nbecause of the overwhelming burden, found themselves becoming \nincreasingly callous about the plight of the victims.\n  I used to be a public defender. When I was a young lawyer, I would be \nassigned three or four or five cases to be tried in 1 day. The \nprosecutor would be assigned five, six, seven, or eight cases to be \ntried in 1 day. Everyone knew that plea bargaining process was \nnecessary.\n  Often, looking back on it, the victim, or the alleged victim of the \ncrime, found himself or herself showing up for court and learning from \nsome prosecutor that they had dismissed the case. We didn't think there \nwas sufficient evidence, or we decided to allow them to plead to petty \nlarceny rather than robbery or burglar, or we decided so on and so on.\n  The impact upon victims and their faith in the system and their \nnotion of whether or not government worked was always damning--always \nimpacting upon them in a negative way.\n  To make a long story not quite so long, the Senator from Vermont is \ncorrect. Public prosecution did take place when our Republic became a \nrepublic. There were not, for example, in the city of Philadelphia, \n25,000 felonies tried a year in one little city. There were not 68,000 \nhabeas corpus out there. There was not the need for a prosecutor to \nfind himself or herself in the position where they dismissed a large \nnumber of cases just because they didn't have time to get to them. \nThere were not circumstances where the victims of crime who were so \ncallously treated that they weren't even informed, and the person \nagainst whom they had sworn out the warrant they found sitting in the \ntrolley car with them on the way home. They were not in that position.\n\n  What are constitutional amendments about?\n  Constitutional amendments are about dealing with serious concerns of \nthe public that come about as a consequence of changed circumstances. \nOne of the circumstances changed--and I suspect what previous speakers \nhave been speaking to when they talked about how the system used to \nwork--is that there is a feeling on the part of the vast majority of \nthe victims of crimes that they have no control over the situation. \nThey have no control. Not only were they victimized by the criminal, \nbut they go in and either find themselves in the circumstance where \nthere has been a deal made which they were no part of, or there was a \nsentencing that took place and they didn't get a chance to tell the \njudge how badly this guy beat them up, or that money that was stolen \nfrom them was the last money they had in the whole world, and they lost \ntheir home. Just the need to cry out and say: Listen to me, listen to \nme. Just listen to me. That is all I am asking you to do.\n  It is not that the prosecutors are bad guys or bad women. They are \nincredibly overloaded.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we have an incredible amount of time, \nnotwithstanding the fact it has dropped the last 7 years in a row.\n  This is about going back to a time when public prosecutors had the \ntime and exercised judgment to make a decision relative to moving \nforward against a defendant in conjunction with the concerns of the \nneeds of and the desires of the victims.\n  That is what is missing.\n  We are here today to discuss two matters that I have cared about for \nmany years. The first is crime--more specifically, the victims of \nviolent crime. The second is the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we came at the same time, and both of \nus dedicated a significant portion of our life in the Senate to various \nissues. We developed different interests, expertise, and/or \nassignments. In my case, it has been both the plight of crime victims \nand the preservation of our constitutional liberties. That is why I \nhave thought long and hard about amending the Constitution to guarantee \nthe victims of crime the elemental rights that they deserve, but too \noften are denied.\n\n  Time and again, I wrote and supported many statutory protections for \nvictims. To cite just a few examples:\n  The 1990 Victims Bill of Rights gave victims a number of important \nprocedural rights, including the right to notice of court proceedings, \nthe right to confer with the prosecutor, and the\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\nright to information about the conviction, sentencing, imprisonment, \nand release of the offender.\n  The 1994 Biden crime law:\n  Gave federal victims of sexual and child abuse the right to mandatory \nrestitution;\n  Gave victims of violent crimes and sexual abuse the right to be heard \nat the sentencing of their assailants;\n  Provided special court-appointed advocates for child victims of \ncrime;\n  And it also included the piece of legislation closest to my heart: \nthe Violence Against Women Act, which provided ground-breaking and \nsweeping assistance to victims of family violence and sexual assault--\nand which, I might add, needs to be re-authorized this year through my \nViolence Against Women Act II bill, which has 46 cosponsors.\n  The 1996 Anti-Terrorism Act included Hatch-Biden provisions \nguaranteeing mandatory restitution to all victims of violent federal \ncrimes;\n  And, now, I am pleased to support--and urge all of you to support--a \nconstitutional amendment to protect victims' rights.\n  I am proud of my track record on victims' rights. But I am convinced \nthat federal statutory guarantees are not enough. Judges are simply too \nquick to conclude, almost reflexively, that the defendant's \nconstitutional rights trump the victim's mere statutory rights, even \nwhen conflict is illusory or could readily be resolved. You heard about \nthe difficulties we had after the Oklahoma City bombing with a federal \nstatutory approach to help the victims and their families. Senator \nFeinstein outlined in detail the chronology of events there, and so I \nwill not repeat them.\n  But equally important, because more than 95 percent of all crimes are \nhandled at the state level, our federal statutory rights simply do not \nreach the great majority of crime victims.\n  Regrettably, the hodge-podge of protections for victims in place at \nthe state level is spotty and inadequate. There is no common \ndenominator of rights that victims are guaranteed in every state of the \nunion. As a December 1998 report by the National Institute of Justice \nfound:\n\n       Enactment of state laws and state constitutional amendments \n     alone appears to be insufficient to guarantee the full \n     provisions of victims' rights in practice.\n\n  This report found numerous instances in which victims were not \nafforded the rights to which they were entitled.\n  For example, even in states identified as providing ``strong \nprotection'' to victims' rights, more than 40 percent of victims were \nnot notified in advance of the defendant's sentencing hearing. And more \nthan 60 percent of victims in these strong-protection states did not \nreceive notice of a defendant's pre-trial release.\n  And so, I have come to the conclusion that it is time to write a \nbasic charter of victims' rights into our Constitution setting a \nnational, uniform baseline of rights for all victims of violent crimes.\n  Now, one of reasons there were more than 60 drafts of this \nconstitutional amendment is because I insisted on a number of basic \nchanges before I would agree to support it. And with the help of \nProfessor Larry Tribe, I proposed these changes, and the sponsors \naccepted them.\n  My three key specific ``principles'' for drafting the language of the \namendment were as follows:\n  Principle No. 1: The amendment must set out the specific rights to be \naccorded constitutional status--the core of which should be rights of \nparticipation. Victims should be entitled to the following rights of \nparticipation:\n  The right to be informed about, and not excluded from, any public \nproceedings involving the crime;\n  The right to make a statement to the court about bail, the acceptance \nof a plea, and sentencing;\n  The right to be informed about, and to participate in, parole \nproceedings to the same extent as the convicted offender; and\n  The right to be informed of an escape or release from custody.\n  Principle No. 2: The amendment must not unintentionally hamstring \ncriminal prosecutions. We cannot forget: the best thing for victims is \nto catch and convict the bad guys; we have to make sure that nothing in \nthe amendment would make that job more difficult.\n  Principle No. 3: The amendment must not abridge the rights of the \naccused. The protections in our Constitution for the accused--such as \nthe right to counsel, the right to a jury of one's peers, and the right \nagainst self-incrimination--are there, above all, so that our system \ndoes not convict an innocent person. Locking up an innocent person \nbenefits no one--except the guilty.\n  Let me describe for you a few of the changes on which I insisted, and \nwhich I believe makes this an amendment everyone can and should \nsupport:\n  Originally, the constitutional amendment would have covered the \nvictims of all crimes. But prosecutors worried that the extension of \nrights to non-violent crimes--particularly those crimes affecting \nmassive numbers of victims, such as may be the case with mail fraud or \nenvironmental crimes--would backfire, making it too difficult, too \nburdensome, to bring these cases. I insisted that the amendment be \nlimited to the victims of violent crimes, and that change was made.\n  Earlier drafts of the amendment gave victims the right to ``a final \ndisposition of the trial proceedings free from unreasonable delay.'' \nProsecutors believed that this could allow victims to force them to \nproceed to trial before they are prepared.\n  Defense lawyers believed that the language created the risk that the \ndefendant might be forced to proceed to trial without sufficient time \nto prepare a defense. In other words, this language would have made it \nboth more difficult for prosecutors to get convictions and easier for \nthose defendants who are convicted to overturn their convictions on \nappeal.\n  We want to make sure--above all--that we get the right criminal, and \nthat we don't convict an innocent person. And we also want to make sure \nthat the great police power of the government is not exercised in \nheavy-handed, over-reaching ways that threaten the constitutional \nliberties of all of us.\n  And so I insisted on modifying that language so that victims have the \nright ``to consideration of the interest of the victim that any trial \nbe free from unreasonable delay.''\n  This is an important change. This means--in plain English--that \nbefore granting a third, fourth, or fifth continuance, judges in every \nstate--from Delaware to Utah to California--must take into account the \ninconvenience and hardship to a victim and must proceed with the trial \nunless there is a good reason to wait.\n  What this does not mean is that judges must push lawyers to try cases \nbefore they're ready.\n  Next change: prosecutors and others worried that with the old drafts, \na defendant could withdraw his plea or a judge could be forced to throw \nout a sentence after it had been accepted, jeopardizing the \ngovernment's ability to get a conviction of guilty defendants.\n  I insisted on new language that makes it clear that nothing in the \namendment provides grounds to overturn a sentence or negotiated plea.\n  Finally, I was concerned with earlier drafts that the amendment could \nbe perceived as giving a victim's rights a higher constitutional \nstanding than those of the criminal defendant--in other words, that \nvictims' rights would be perceived as trumping defendants' rights. \nSection 2 of an earlier draft stated that nothing in the amendment \nwould ``provide grounds for the accused or convicted offender to obtain \nany form of relief.''\n  I insisted that we change that language, and with the help of \nProfessor Tribe, we redrafted Section 2 and removed that restriction on \nthe rights of the defendant.\n  While the language is clear that nothing in the amendment itself \ngives rise to a claim of damages against the United States, a State, a \npolitical subdivision, or a public officer or employee, at the same \ntime, it does nothing to bar defendants from obtaining relief for \nviolations of their own constitutional rights.\n  And let me comment further about the rights of the accused--an issue \nthat I know gives some of you pause about this amendment. I have spent \nmy entire career in the U.S. Senate looking\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\nout for the rights of the criminal defendant. There is an obvious and \nnatural tension in the system between protecting the rights of the \ncriminal defendant and ensuring that law enforcement is effective, and \nI have always worked to achieve a balance between these competing \ninterests.\n  I say to you that this constitutional amendment, with the changes \nupon which I have insisted, strikes that balance. Judges will have the \npower under this amendment to strike a balance.\n  I keep hearing critics of the amendment say that defendants' rights \nwill not be adequately protected if this amendment becomes part of the \nfabric of our Constitution.\n  For example, we heard testimony before the Judiciary Committee and \nstatements on the Senate floor giving examples of how judges \nroutinely--almost reflexively--exclude victims from the courtroom when \nthey are potential witnesses in the case. Critics of the amendment \ncontend that maybe that is how it should be, and they complain that the \namendment would change that presumption of exclusion.\n  These critics argue that the presence of victim-witnesses at trial \nwill undermine the defendant's right to a fair trial by giving the \nvictims the opportunity to observe the other witnesses testify and \ntailor their testimony accordingly.\n  I submit to you that that is not as it should be. That is not how it \nneeds to be. The witness sequestration rule is a prophylactic measure \nrather than a constitutional imperative. The purpose of the rule can be \naccomplished through defense cross-examination of fact witnesses, \ndefense argument about the opportunity to tailor, and jury \ninstructions, without categorically excluding victims from the trial.\n  There is nothing that remarkable about the scenario of one witness \nhaving the opportunity to listen to the testimony of others: the \ndefendant who is a witness has that opportunity. And the defendant who \nis a witness is also open to cross-examination and argument by the \nprosecutor that he had the opportunity to tailor his testimony.\n  Just last month, the Supreme Court ruled in a case called Portuondo \nv. Agard, that despite the fact that a defendant has the constitutional \nright to be present at his trial, the prosecutor was entitled to \ncomment in her closing argument on the fact that the defendant had the \nopportunity to hear all other witnesses testify and to tailor his \ntestimony. This same type of argument would be available in cases where \nthe victim-witness is present during the trial.\n  The constitutional amendment takes away nothing from the rights of \nthe defendant. If the defendant's constitutional rights actually \nconflict with the participatory rights the amendment would guarantee \nthe victim--and I submit to you that these conflicts would be few and \nfar between--the judge is permitted under this amendment to balance \nthese competing interests and grant exceptions where necessary.\n  Let me repeat: a constitutional amendment for victims does not mean \nthat victims' rights will take precedence over defendants' rights.\n  Both the criminal defendant and the victim can and should have the \nchance to participate at trial and at other related public proceedings. \nThere should be a balance. This amendment permits courts to balance.\n  A constitutional amendment is needed to set a national floor of \nrights for all victims of violent crimes. In every state--as well as in \nthe federal system--the doors of the criminal justice system must be \nopened to victims--to make sure that they are meaningful participants, \nand not just spectators, in a system that has for too long kept them on \nthe outside looking in.\n  With a victims' constitutional amendment, we will be telling \nprosecutors and judges, loud and clear: victims must be respected and \nincluded. They have rights--constitutional rights--that must be taken \ninto account during the entire case.\n  I believe that the contradiction that many people see between the \nrights of defendants and the rights of victims is a false one. Our \nConstitution is not a zero-sum game. We do not diminish the rights of \ndefendants by recognizing the rights of victims.\n  That is why I cosponsored this amendment. This amendment will give \nthe victims of crime a voice and a measure of dignity and respect in \nthe criminal justice process.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before I discuss my position on Senate \nJoint Resolution 3, the crime victims rights constitutional amendment, \nI would like to briefly talk about my views on amending the \nConstitution.\n  A recent letter each of use received from our colleagues Senator Byrd \n and Senator Leahy provides some of the history of our Constitution and \nefforts to amend it.\n  They note that, since its ratification, over 11,000 amendments have \nbeen proposed to the Constitution. In the last month alone, the Senate \nhas voted on three constitutional amendments. However, while thousands \nof amendments have been proposed, only 27 amendments have been adopted. \nOf those, the first 10, the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791. \nTherefore, since ratification some 200 years ago, we have generally \nheeded the caution of James Madison, one of the architects of the \nConstitution, that amendments to the Constitution should be reserved \nfor ``certain great and extraordinary occasions''. In other words, \namending the Constitution should not be done in response to what is \npolitically popular at the moment or because of passions of the moment. \nIf it was, I'm afraid many of those 11,000 amendments would now clutter \nour Constitution and undermine the very foundation of the freedoms and \nliberties it gives each of us.\n  Mr. President, the victims of violent crime are a compelling group of \nAmericans and deserve our supports and our attentions. Nothing is more \ndevastating to a family than loosing a loved one through a senseless, \nrandom act of violence. Nothing is more devastating to a community than \nthe kind of violence we see in our schools and on our streets almost \ndaily. Yet it is only in the past few years, perhaps 15 or 20, that our \nlaws and lawmakers have begun to focus on the group of people we now \nrefer to as ``crime victims''.\n  During those years, however, the states have not ignored the \nlegitimate calls of crime victims and their families for more \nprotection and more participation in the criminal justice process. \nThirty-three states, including my own, have passed either crime victims \nrights amendments to their constitution or statutes intended to provide \nmany of the same rights contained in S.J. Res. 3.\n  In New Mexico, the voters passed a constitutional amendment in 1992 \nthat is very similar to S.J. Res. 3 and the legislature subsequently \npassed enabling legislation. This, I think is appropriate and I am glad \nthat New Mexico recognizes the rights of crime victims to more fully \nparticipate in the criminal justice system. In fact, it is particularly \nappropriate that the states have acted in this area because the states \nare responsible for approximately 99 percent of the criminal \nprosecutions in this country.\n  From many indications, these amendments and statutes have worked. Not \nperfectly perhaps, but they have at least begun to bring victims of \nviolent crime into the judicial process in a meaningful way.\n\n  Because New Mexico has acted to protect the rights of crime victims, \ndistrict attorneys who I've spoken with often ask why we need to amend \nthe United States Constitution when New Mexico has already addressed \nthis issue? That, Mr. President, is an extremely important question to \nask ourselves before we vote on S.J. Res. 3.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution provides a process for amendment when \n``both Houses deem it necessary . . .'' Today I would argue that only \nwhen absolutely necessary or, in the words of Madison, for great and \nextraordinary occasions, should we vote to amend the Constitution. I \nwould also argue that, where doubt exists as to the absolute necessity \nof the occasion, the Senate should defer on amending that document.\n  While I support the participation of crime victims in our judicial \nprocess Mr. President, and support the efforts of New Mexico and other \nstates to give those rights to crime victims, I simply do find the \nevidence of a great occasion or compelling need to amend the \nConstitution in the arguments made by the sponsors of the amendment and \ntherefore will vote no on S.J. Res. 3.\n  As others have pointed out, S.J. Res. 3 is almost as long as the \nentire Bill of\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\nRights. It reads like a statute and not a constitutional amendment. \nThis is significant and more than simply a matter of form. Part of the \nreason why our Constitution and republican form of government have \nsurvived largely intact for over 200 years while virtually every other \nin the world has undergone radical, revolutionary change is the wisdom \nof the drafters in setting out clear principles and a coherent system \nto ensure the liberties that the Constitution guarantees. However, as I \nread the amendment before us today, I do not see the clarity or the \nsimplicity of principle that I see in the Bill of Rights or the other \namendments we've adopted. Because this amendment lacks clarity, I am \nconcerned about the litigation this amendment could potentially spawn \nand the additional costs to an already overburdened legal system. \nLitigation over who is a ``victim'' alone would likely fill volumes.\n  Mr. President, one of the biggest concerns with this amendment is \nthat, because of its vagueness, it will inevitably lead to a result \nwhich I think none of us, even the proponents, want, the diminishing of \nthe  rights of the accused.\n\n  No where in the amendment does it guarantee that it will not be \nconstrued to interfere with the rights of the accused. I understand \nthat an amendment was offered in the Judiciary Committee that would \nhave made that clear but was rejected. That to me is very troubling \nbecause, as important as the rights of victims are, we absolutely have \nto keep in mind that the rights of the accused must be paramount. That \nis because it is the accused that stands to lose life and liberty at \nthe hands of the government. This is a bedrock principle of our \njudicial system, without argument the best system in the world, and we \nmust not diminish that principle even in the name of a good cause.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am concerned by the lack of case law to \nsupport the arguments of the proponents of S.J. Res. 3. As I understand \nit, the proponents are unable to point to any cases in which victims' \nrights laws or State constitutional amendments were not given effect \nbecause of defendants' rights in the Federal Constitution. Nor, as the \ncommittee report noted, is there any case law where a defendant's \nconviction was reversed because of victims' rights legislation or a \nState constitutional amendment. Why then are we amending the \nConstitution when there is no body of law that justifies the \nextraordinary step of amending the U.S. Constitution? This is very \ndifferent from the situation we were in a few weeks ago when the Senate \nvoted on an amendment to the Constitution on the issue of the \ndesecration of the flag on campaign finance limits. In both of those \ninstances, at least we had a final determination by the Supreme Court \nwith which we could take exception. Without such a body of law I do not \nfind the arguments in favor of a Federal constitutional amendment \ncompelling.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the right of victims of violent \ncrime to be included in the criminal justice system in a meaningful \nway. I think it helps bring closure to the inured victims and provides \nan important balance to a system that admittedly has not always been \nsympathetic to the rights of victims. I would support additional \nfunding and resources for victims rights programs and to properly train \nthe judiciary in the need to be sensitive to the rights of crime \nvictims. However, before we take the drastic and, for all intents and \npurposes, irreversible step of amending our Constitution for only the \n28th time in our history, I believe we must be absolutely certain that \nwe have exhausted all other avenues. As the National Clearinghouse for \nthe Defense of Battered Women argues:\n\n       The Federal constitution is the wrong place to try to \n     ``fix'' the complex problems facing victims of crime, \n     statutory alternatives and state remedies are more suitable. \n     Our Nation's constitution should not be amended unless there \n     is compelling need to do so and there are no remedies \n     available at the state level. Instead of altering the U.S. \n     Constitution, we urge policy makers to consider statutory \n     alternatives and statewide initiatives that would include the \n     enforcement of already existing statutes, and practices that \n     can truly assist victims of crimes, as well as increased \n     direct services to victims.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe we should give the states additional time to \nimplement their victims rights amendments and statutes. Change occurs \nslowly, but I am convinced that real change for the victims of crime \nwill be addressed more effectively by the states and that the federal \ngovernment should not impose a one-size-fits-all, the federal \ngovernment knows best, solution on the states. Additionally, if we \ndetermine that action at the federal level is absolutely necessary, I \nbelieve we should try to fashion a legislative solution before we amend \nthe Constitution. I believe that we can do that and provide meaningful \nrights to victims of crime.\n  If, failing that, we find that victims are still not being afforded \nreasonable and real participation in the criminal justice system, then \nperhaps only a constitutional amendment will work but I am not \nconvinced that we have done all that we can do short of that.\n  Mr. President, good intentions do not necessarily produce good \nresults. The intentions of the supporters of S.J. Res. 3 are certainly \ngood and just and I share those intentions, as well as their belief \nthat we should be doing more for the victims of violent crime. However, \nI do not believe that this amendment will produce good results and may \nactually harm those it is intended to help and for that reason, I will \nvote against S.J. Res. 3.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to recognize all the Senators who \nparticipated in this important and healthy debate. In particular, I \nthank Senator Leahy and Senator Byrd for their tireless defense of the \nConstitution.\n  In addition, however, I also want to recognize Senator Feinstein for \nher commitment to victims of violence and for working to ensure that \nthey are treated with fairness and decency and respect. While I \nstrongly disagree with the approach the proponents of this amendment \nhave taken, I completely agree with the sentiments they express. \nVictims should have a strong voice in our criminal justice system. \nSenator Feinstein has been committed to this cause for decades and I \nbelieve her passion has brought new focus to this important issue.\n  Like many of us, I know what it is like when violence strikes your \nown family. I would not wish that pain on anyone. And I certainly do \nnot want to see any victim's grief compounded by a needlessly callous \nor insensitive judicial system.\n  The question we have been debating, however, is not whether victims \nshould have a voice in the criminal justice process. The question \nbefore us is whether we must amend our nation's Constitution to achieve \nthat goal. I believe the answer is ``no.''\n  On September 17, 1789, as our new Constitution was about to be \nsigned--after four long months of debate--Benjamin Franklin announced \nwith typical irony: ``I consent, sir, to this Constitution because I \nexpect no better, and because I am not sure it is not the best.''\n  Two-hundred and 12 years later, Mr. President, the United States \nConstitution is still the best constitution this world has ever known. \nIt is, in my opinion, nearly sacred. James Madison, who penned most of \nour Constitution, urged that it be amended only in--quote--``certain \ngreat and extraordinary occasions.''\n  For 212 years, Americans have heeded his words of caution. As Senator \nLeahy and Senator Byrd remind us, our Constitution has been amended \nonly 17 times since 1791, when the first 10 amendments--Our Bill of \nRights--was added.\n  More than 11,000 amendments have been offered during that time. But \nonly 17 have actually been added to our Constitution. Because of the \ngenius of the Framers, and the wise restraint of those who came after \nthem, we have today a document that we can fit in our pockets . . . \nthat we can understand . . . that we can refer to, and live by.\n  This beautiful document contains fundamental, unifying principles \nthat protect our individual liberties and guarantee our democratic \nrights. The amendment we have been considering--while clearly well-\nintentioned--does not belong in this document.\n  With all due respect to its authors, it is not a constitutional \namendment. It does not describe universal and eternal truths about \nhuman nature, or set forth the broad working of government. It is a \nstatute.\n  Last month, we debated another Constitutional amendment--to make \nflag-\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\nburning a crime. During that debate, some members of this Senate said \nit was right to take that extraordinary step because Americans had died \nto defend our flag.\n  Mr. President, this Constitution is why Americans have fought and \ndied for more than 200 years--not to protect a flag, but to protect the \nprinciples enshrined in this document. As United States Senators, we \ntake an oath to defend the Constitution. It is our most important \nobligation, our most sacred duty.\n  There is no ``great and extraordinary occasion'' requiring us to \nadopt this Victims' Rights Amendment. This amendment is popular. But it \nis not necessary. Every state--every single state--has some type of \nstatute that identifies and protects victims' rights. Thirty-two states \nhave passed state constitutional amendments protecting victims' rights. \nNot one of those statutes has been overturned. Not one of these state \nconstitutional amendments has been found to conflict with our federal \nConstitution.\n  Amending--re-writing--our Constitution--is a remedy that ought to be \ntried only when we have exhausted every other possible means, and they \nhave been found inadequate. When it comes to protecting victims' \nrights, there is much we can do, short of amending the Constitution.\n  Indeed, in my home state of South Dakota, every single protection \nidentified in this proposed amendment is guaranteed by state law. In \nSouth Dakota, victims are included in every stage of the criminal \njustice process. They have the right to be notified about every court \nproceeding involving their case. They are told in advance about bond \nhearings, plea offers and sentencing hearings, and they have the \nopportunity to have their opinions heard on these matters.\n  Crime victims in South Dakota are told about all of these rights, and \noffered help, if they need it, to exercise them. These state laws \nprovide South Dakotans with wide-ranging and effective protections. \nThey may not, however, be a blueprint for Massachusetts, or \nMississippi, or California.\n  There is another reason we should reject this amendment, Mr. \nPresident. Not only is it unwarranted. But also, ironically, this \namendment could actually weaken victims' rights by making it harder for \npolice and prosecutors to do their jobs. That is not simply my opinion.\n  This is a letter from the Chief Justice of the South Dakota Supreme \nCourt. ``Victims' rights will not be furthered by SJR 3--and may indeed \nbe harmed--as past state efforts in this area run headlong into an \nethereal national standard that is incapable of responding to the \nconstantly changing circumstances of the justice system.''\n  Here is another letter--this one from the State's Attorney and the \nVictim Witness Advocate representing my most heavily populated county. \nQuote--``While victims' rights are a very important issue, this \namendment would make it difficult for us to do our jobs and make \nappropriate decisions regarding the prosecution of criminal cases.''\n  Many of my fellow Senators have voiced similar concerns. Senator \nThompson has said--quote--``This constitutional amendment will make the \nprocedure by which the District Attorneys around the country are trying \nto prosecute defendants more complex, more costly, more time-consuming \nin many respects, and ultimately will harm [the goal] that the victim \nis the most interested in--seeing justice done and a guilty defendant \nfound guilty by our court system.''\n  The federal government should encourage states to set minimum \nstandards for victims' rights. But we should not trample the principles \nthat have served us so well for so many years. Under our system of \ngovernment, police powers are reserved for the states. That is why 95 \npercent of all crimes are prosecuted at the state and local level.\n  Do we really believe it is time to re-write this fundamental division \nof responsibility? Do we really believe we need to supercede state and \nlocal police powers with a national standard? A standard that can only \nbe enforced by an act of Congress? Wouldn't the wiser, more prudent \ncourse of action be to encourage or require states to devise and \nenforce their own victims' rights standards?\n  In addition to the threat this amendment poses to our constitutional \nframework, I am also concerned it may erode the rights of the accused. \nI know full well that accused criminals are not a popular group. But \nthe cornerstone of our justice system is the belief that we are all \npresumed innocent until proven guilty. If we undermine that basic \nprinciple in any way, we are all hurt.\n  Our Bill of Rights reflects our framers deeply held belief that the \nenormous power of the government to deprive persons of life, liberty \nand property in criminal prosecutions must be checked. Thus, the \ndocument I hold in my pocket protects us all from unreasonable searches \n. . . guarantees us all impartial juries, and protects us all against \ncruel and unusual punishments.\n  When these rights are diminished for some, they are diminished for \nall. For that reason, they should not be compromised lightly--no matter \nhow politically popular it might be to do so. What crime victims need \nis real hope, not paper promises. For that reason, I strongly support \nboth the Leahy ``Crime Victim Assistance Act'' and the Biden ``Violence \nAgainst Women Act'' re-authorization. Let's pass these bills.\n  Let's also look at making certain federal funds contingent on states' \nimplementation of meaningful victims' rights at the state level. In \nfact, I declare today that I will work tirelessly with any member of \nthis Senate who wishes to enact legislation to bolster the rights of \nvictims. But let us stop treating our Constitution so cavalierly.\n  I am deeply troubled by the increasing tendency of this Congress to \nturn to constitutional tinkering to solve problems, rather than taking \nup the hard job of legislating. This is the second constitutional \namendment we have debated in this Senate in a month!\n\n  In his final speech to the Constitutional Convention, just before the \nConstitution was signed, Benjamin Franklin said something that pertains \nhere. After calling the Constitution very likely ``the best'' human \nbeings could hope for, he told his fellow signers: ``I hope for our own \nsakes and for the sake of our posterity, we shall act heartily and \nunanimously in recommending this constitution and turn our future \nthoughts and endeavors to the means of having it well administered.''\n  That is our real responsibility as members of this Senate--not to \nsecond-guess the genius of this document not to alter and undermine it \nbut to see that it is well administered. In that regard, we have much \nwork to do. Let us do that work.\n  Again, I say to the sponsors of this amendment, I am as committed as \nanyone in this body to working with you to strengthen victims' rights. \nIndeed, I would consider every option--even conditioning federal funds \non state implementation of basic protections for victims. I cannot, \nhowever, and will not--as much as I respect the Senators from \nCalifornia and Arizona--amend our great Constitution unless absolutely \nnecessary.\n  By withdrawing their amendment, I believe the sponsors have acted \nresponsibly, in Senatorial fashion. The Senate should be proud that one \nmore time we have resisted the urge to tamper with the miracle created \nin Philadelphia in 1787--our Constitution.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that letters from United State \nDistrict Judge Lawrence Piersol, Chief Justice Robert Miller, State's \nAttorney Dave Nelson, Victim Witness Assistant Becky Hess and Marshal \nLyle Swenson be inserted into the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                     District of South Dakota,\n\n                                  Sioux Falls, SD, April 19, 2000.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I was surprised to learn that Senate \n     Joint Resolution 3 would be up on the calendar next week in \n     the Senate. I am very much opposed to this proposed \n     constitutional amendment. To begin with, I think it \n     diminishes our Constitution to attach to it what amounts to \n     legislation. That proposition is true not only of this \n     proposed constitutional amendment but also some other \n     amendments that have been promised but failed.\n       I realize at first impression that the public might find \n     such a resolution attractive because the rights of victims of \n     crime have\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\n     sometimes in the past not received the attention that they \n     should. I know from my day-to-day experience as the Chief \n     Judge for the District of South Dakota that victims' rights \n     are considered. I have had victims testify on various \n     occasions in my Court at the time of sentencing and I \n     regularly consider the views of victims both in their letters \n     as well as in comments that are made in the presentence \n     investigative reports as a result of the interviews of \n     victims by the presentence report writers. The writers of \n     those presentence reports are Court personnel and a part of \n     my staff. In addition, when restitution is paid, it is paid \n     first to the victims and then applies to other monetary \n     obligations that are paid to the government after the victim \n     has been monetarily compensated. I say ``monetarily \n     compensated'' because I recognize that in some instances \n     money alone cannot compensate a victim. In other instances, \n     in an attempt to compensate victims, I have had Defendants, \n     as a part of their sentence, write to victims and I have \n     reviewed the letters before they went to the victims so that \n     I could make sure that the letter was appropriate. As you \n     know, Congress has done much in recent years by legislation \n     to enhance the rights of crime victims. If Congress would \n     choose to do more it would do so by legislation.\n       On the other hand, a constitutional provision as broad and \n     as sweeping as this one is, especially without limiting \n     definitions in the language, poses many problems. Once those \n     problems come to light upon implementation, the problems will \n     not be able to be solved because it would be a constitutional \n     amendment. On the other hand, when legislation is passed and \n     it turns out upon implementation that there are problems or \n     that the solution should be addressed in a different way, \n     then the legislation can be amended. After I have drafted \n     this letter to you, I received a copy of a letter to Senator \n     Charles Schumer from Judge William Wilkins, Chair of the \n     Committee on Criminal Law for the Judicial Conference of the \n     United States. I am attaching his letter because it considers \n     in detail various problems with the proposed amendment. In \n     addition, it does make some suggestions for its improvement \n     if it is to be passed.\n       Legislation enhancing victims' rights can be passed now--\n     the amendment process and then its implementation if passed \n     by the states will take more than seven years.\n       Finally, from my point of view and experience as a trial \n     judge, and that experience includes 180 sentencings last \n     year, the amendment would prevent many guilty pleas in state \n     and federal court. With all of the additional criminal \n     trials, the courts would virtually be brought to a \n     standstill, affecting civil and criminal cases.\n       I urge that victims' rights continue to be addressed by \n     Congress by legislation.\n       Thank you for considering my views.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Lawrence L. Piersol.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Supreme Court,\n\n\n                                        State of South Dakota,\n\n                                                   March 14, 2000.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Office of the Democratic Leader, Capitol \n         Building, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I want to thank you for taking time \n     from your busy schedule to meet with me on Thursday, March 2. \n     I truly appreciated the time I was able to spend with you and \n     your staff. I am also deeply thankful for your interest in \n     our juvenile intensive probation program (JIPP) and your \n     efforts to secure more funding for it. The JIPP program \n     clearly demonstrates that community corrections can work for \n     certain juveniles who would otherwise be committed to \n     expensive institutions.\n       There is one other matter that I need to bring to your \n     attention. As you may know, the Senate has under \n     consideration Senate Joint Resolution 3 ``Proposing an \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States to protect \n     the rights of crime victims.'' It is difficult, on principle, \n     to argue against SJR 3. We are all clearly concerned that \n     victims of crime receive proper treatment by the justice \n     system. It is senseless for the system to re-victimize the \n     victims of crime through inattention to their needs and \n     concerns. In South Dakota, for example, we have built our \n     probation programs around a restorative justice philosophy \n     that seeks to restore victims of crime while working with \n     offenders to reduce recidivism. Regardless of how we consider \n     crime in the hypothetical world of legal theory, crime \n     produces real victims whose needs must be addressed by the \n     justice system.\n       The fact remains, however, that SJR 3 will not radically \n     change things for victims. Most if not all states in this \n     country have victim rights provisions. South Dakota law \n     provides a long list of victim rights, including the right to \n     restitution, notices of scheduled hearings and releases, an \n     explanation of the criminal charges and process, the \n     opportunity to present a written or oral victim impact \n     statement at trial, etc. There is little in SJR 3 that is not \n     already in place in most if not all states.\n       On the other hand SJR 3 creates a national standard against \n     which every aspect of the state and federal criminal justice \n     systems will be measured, regardless of local efforts to \n     address crime victim needs. In essence, SJR 3 would produce \n     federal oversight of state court operations far beyond what \n     may be in the interests of victims. For example, Congress, \n     believing that unreasonable delays in court proceedings are \n     harming the interests of victims, could pass national \n     legislation imposing time processing standards that may be \n     completely inapplicable to the peculiar circumstances of \n     state and local courts. Victims who do not believe proper \n     notice is being provided could seek a federal court \n     injunction to compel or prohibit certain state court \n     practices.\n       I cannot emphasize enough that the criminal justice system \n     in South Dakota is committed to restoring victims of crime. \n     We have not always done this as well as we should have, but \n     we have always had it as a focus of our efforts. We continue \n     to work on improving victim access to the court system while \n     maintaining our independence, neutrality and impartiality. It \n     is important for everyone to understand that our courts must \n     balance the interests of victims with the interests of the \n     accused, the interests of the state, and the constitutional \n     rights we all possess. This is a delicate and difficult \n     balance. I believe setting a single legal standard--as a \n     matter of our national constitution--is ill advised. it can \n     too easily be used in the future to upset this delicate \n     balance.\n       I hope you will give very careful consideration to SJR 3 \n     before casting your vote. Clearly our response to the needs \n     and interests of victims should be and must be improved. But \n     I believe those needs and interests are best addressed at the \n     state and local level through new programs and state laws \n     recognizing victim rights. Victims' rights will not be \n     furthered by SJR 3 and may indeed be harmed as past state \n     efforts in this area run headlong into an ethereal national \n     standard that is incapable of responding to the constantly \n     changing circumstances of the justice system.\n           Most sincerely,\n                                                 Robert A. Miller,\n     Chief Justice.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Office of the State's Attorney,\n\n                             Minnehaha County, SD, April 21, 2000.\n     Re Victim's Rights Amendment.\n     Senator Tom Daschle,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: As you ponder your vote on the \n     Victim's Rights Amendment, we would like to express our \n     concerns about a Constitutional Amendment of that nature \n     being passed. We would strongly urge you to vote against this \n     amendment.\n       Under our law in South Dakota, the victims' are afforded \n     many, if not all, of the rights contained in the amendment. \n     We currently have victim/witness assistants in many of the \n     prosecutor's offices across the state and are actively \n     working with victims on a daily basis. Each morning, our \n     office contacts by phone, if possible, all victims of crimes \n     against persons from the evening or weekend prior. We make \n     our attorneys aware of the victims' wishes and concerns \n     regarding the cases prior to arraignment. Following \n     arraignment, victims are notified of the next phase of court \n     either by phone or by letter. As the case proceeds, victims \n     are advised of any plea offers or possible issues or concerns \n     the attorneys may have with the case and are kept appraised \n     of the ongoing procedures. Additionally, victims are invited \n     to attend bond hearings, motion bearings, plea hearings, \n     sentencing hearings and any other hearings relevant to the \n     case. Victims are also encouraged to write victim impact \n     statements or letters to the court regarding their thoughts \n     and feelings about how this crime has affected them or their \n     family. Victims are also invited to speak at sentencing \n     hearings regarding these same issues.\n       In 1999, we averaged approximately 85-90 cases per month \n     involving crimes against persons. We attempted contact with \n     all of these except when the victim is transient and has no \n     phone or address of any kind. Of those cases, an average of \n     51 cases per month were domestic assaults. Our office has \n     adopted a `victimless' prosecution position in that the \n     victim does not need to be cooperative on a domestic case for \n     our office to prosecute. Due to the nature of domestic \n     violence, our concerns have been that the defendant has a \n     great deal of power over the victim and can often convince \n     the victim to be unavailable for court or to ask that we \n     dismiss the charges. While our victim's input is important, \n     we hesitate to allow it to become the driving force in the \n     prosecution of these cases. Our fear is that given the \n     influence of the defendant in domestic violence, we would be \n     doing defendant driven prosecution. Typically, our victims \n     report assault many more times than they actually agree that \n     prosecution is necessary or important. Consequently, our \n     ability to get convictions on domestic cases would be greatly \n     hindered if the victim were allowed to run the case or make \n     the final plea negotiation decisions. Our ability to \n     prosecute without the victim makes it possible to get \n     conditions on defendants and keep our victims and our \n     community safe.\n       I have enclosed copies of the letters that are sent to all \n     victims of every crime against persons. While there may be an \n     occasional victim that we fail to locate, we make every \n     effort to find them whenever possible. Occasionally, a victim \n     may ask that we stop notifying them of the next phases of \n     court and we honor that request.\n       Please consider these concerns and understand that while \n     victim's rights are a very important issue, this amendment \n     would make it difficult for us to do our jobs and make \n     appropriate decisions regarding the prosecution of criminal \n     cases.\n           Sincerely,\n     Becky Hess, LSW,\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\n       Victim Witness Assistant.\n     David R.

Thomas Daschle,\n     U.S. Senator, Office of the Democratic Leader,\n     Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re Senate Joint Resolution 3, Proposing an amendment to the \n         Constitution of the United States to protect the rights \n         of crime victims.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: As you are well aware, prior to my \n     current position as the United States Marshal for the \n     District of South Dakota, I served as the elected Sheriff of \n     Davison County for 32 years where I dealt directly with \n     victims of crime on a day to day basis. That experience \n     created a great deal of empathy towards victims on my part \n     and caused me to wonder about our system of justice at times. \n     I do have very strong feelings of support for victims of \n     crime and wish to help them in anyway possible.\n       That said, I strongly believe that amending the \n     Constitution is absolutely the wrong way to correct the \n     problem and will accomplish nothing other than a ``feel \n     good'' attitude and cost the American taxpayers endless \n     dollars! We already have many laws to protect victims so that \n     all that is needed is enforcement by prosecutors and the \n     Courts to correct any problem areas. If it is found that more \n     laws are necessary to better protect them, pass those laws as \n     needed but setting a national standard for all states to \n     follow may cause many more legal problems in the future than \n     we can imagine today.\n       In addition, consider the problems that will immediately \n     occur within all of our penal institutions, city and county \n     jails throughout the country. Many of the victims of crimes \n     are in those same institutions and/or are becoming victims \n     within those places. This amendment will bring on \n     transportation nightmares for those various institutions as \n     they try to get each prisoner to their necessary hearings \n     creating great cost problems and worse yet possible escape \n     situations.\n       Having 40 years experience dealing directly with prisoners \n     at the county jail level to the state penitentiary, I know \n     that most every one of them will attempt to use the system if \n     for no other reason than it would be a chance to abuse and \n     misuse the system! As an administrator now charged with the \n     responsibility of transporting prisoners to courts, to and \n     from institutions, I believe the associated problems would be \n     endless besides being very expensive.\n       I ask for your kind consideration in this matter and I \n     stand ready to work with you to ensure that all victims \n     rights are preserved and they are fairly represented in all \n     criminal proceedings. I believe that can be best accomplished \n     at the state and local level without tampering with the \n     Constitution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lyle W. Swenson,\n                                            United States Marshal.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I read the committee report relative to \nthis constitutional amendment from beginning to end. I did so because \nof the extraordinarily important issue which has been raised by \nSenators Kyl and Feinstein, and others: an effort on their part to \nprovide some compassion and some relief to victims of crime. I have \ntremendous respect for their effort and those of their cosponsors.\n  After reading the committee report and giving a lot of thought to \nthis issue, I have decided to oppose the amendment for a number of \nreasons.\n  First of all, we all start with the proposition that we want victims \nto have rights and Congress and the State legislatures should act to \nprovide those rights. I do not think there is a lot of dispute about \nthat issue. The question that is before us in this constitutional \namendment is whether or not the way to achieve that goal is through an \namendment to our basic document.\n  I believe it is fundamentally wrong to amend the Constitution for a \nnumber of reasons. First, the desired goals can be achieved by statute. \nEvery State has a constitutional amendment or a statute which protects \nvictims' rights. I do not believe there is one statute or one \nconstitutional amendment in any State protecting victims' rights that \nhas been held to be unconstitutional.\n  One of the complaints seems to be that State statutes and State \nconstitutional provisions are not being enforced adequately. Take, for \nexample, a story that Marlene Young, executive director of the National \nOrganization for Victim Assistance, brought to the attention of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on the Constitution in February. \nThis is what she said:\n\n       Just within the past 2 weeks, our office received a copy of \n     a letter published in the Sumter (Georgia) Free Press. It \n     reads in part: ``I write this letter as a victim, not only of \n     the person who violated me but as a victim of a system gone \n     bad. . . . I was sexually battered here in Sumter County. I \n     chose to press charges. Several days after the arrest and \n     release of the accused, I received a packet from the court \n     which included a list of my rights as defined by Georgia \n     State law. I should have received this information from (the \n     detective) the day I gave my statement. Georgia Law states \n     that the investigator will provide the victim with a copy of \n     Georgia Victims Bill of Rights in plain English upon initial \n     contact. . . . Victims are everywhere and we have the right \n     to be protected under Georgia Law. How many other victims are \n     there who don't know what their rights are because the \n     agencies are not working together? Lucky for me, to date, I \n     have not been further injured by the accused. Others in this \n     country may not be as lucky as I have been. It is time the \n     victims of crimes be treated with respect and the laws set \n     forth by the State of Georgia be followed. At what point are \n     the laws of this state important to the authorities?''\n\n  So, the problem in that case, and in so many other cases, was not \nthat the law in Georgia was incapable of protecting the victim; the \nproblem was that the law was not carried out or enforced. Georgia has a \nState statute guaranteeing victims' rights, and the officials in Sumter \nCounty did not abide by that statute or implement it in her case. Is \nthat a reason for a Federal constitutional amendment? Or is it, \ninstead, a plea to the Georgia attorney general--who supports a \nconstitutional victims' rights amendment, by the way, as is documented \nby his signature on a letter to us--to enforce the laws of his State? I \nargue that it is the latter.\n  Then we have the extraordinary testimony of Professor Laurence Tribe. \nProfessor Tribe starts our with the proposition that:\n\n       The States and Congress, within their respective \n     jurisdictions, already have ample affirmative authority to \n     enact rules protecting these rights,\n\nreferring to the rights of victims.\n  Then he says:\n\n       The problem . . . is that such rules are likely, as \n     experience to date sadly shows, to provide too little real \n     protection whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic \n     habit, traditional indifference, sheer inertia. . . .\n\n  What Professor Tribe is saying is that it is justifiable to amend the \nConstitution of the United States because statutes that are on the \nbooks are not enforced. That argument not only falls short of Madison's \ntest that there be a ``great and extraordinary'' need before the \nConstitution is amended, it does not even come close.\n  It is particularly inappropriate to amend the Constitution when the \ninterests sought to be protected are so complex and are still in \nformation. The question of who is a victim alone is a subject of much \ndiscussion.\n  We have had tragic instances in recent history, in New York City and \nin Oklahoma City, where the bombings of buildings created literally \nhundreds of victims--the families of those who were killed and the \nsurvivors.\n  Are all of them to be given the protection that is set forth in this \nconstitutional amendment? What restrictions can be put on their rights \nby statute? What about persons making false claims against others, \ncharging others with a crime? That person, an alleged victim, is given \nstanding to argue against bond in order to keep the person he falsely \naccused in jail, without bond, awaiting a trial.\n  We have had too many instances of false accusations, including one \nrecent notorious story of schoolteacher of 32 years, who taught not too \nfar from here, and was falsely accused by his students of sexual \nharassment and sexual assault.\n  The possibility for injustices of many varieties should be explored, \nas they are currently being explored in the 50 States, all of which \nhave either statutes or constitutional amendments that provide various \nmeans of protection for victims.\n  The pending amendment will be implemented by congressional enactment. \nCongress will be legislating for 50 State criminal court systems, which \nhandle\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\n95 percent of the criminal cases in this country. Far better for us to \npass legislation that will strengthen victims' rights in Federal \ncriminal cases, over which we have jurisdiction, and test the dozens of \ncritical concepts which are involved in the effort to provide victims \nwith rights, including: Who victims are? What is the impact on \nprosecutions? Is it negative, as some in law enforcement believe? Will \nthere be undue delays caused by the meaning of the many issues that are \nopen to litigation?\n  The Conference of Chief Justices of the States of the United States \nwrote a very compelling letter, part of which reads as follows:\n\n       . . . all states have some type of statutory guarantee for \n     the protection of victims' rights, most of which have been \n     enacted recently. At least 31 of the states also have \n     constitutional provisions and these enactments provide \n     victims with the opportunity to be heard at the various \n     stages of criminal litigation, particularly at the point of \n     sentencing and in respect to release on bail or on parole. \n     Most states are considering further constitutional changes. \n     If the sponsors of S.J. Res. 3 are searching for a single \n     settled law governing victims, the goal will not be achieved \n     through a Federal Constitutional Amendment. Preempting each \n     State's existing laws in favor of a broad Federal law will \n     create additional complexities and unpredictability for \n     litigation in both State and Federal courts for years to \n     come. We believe that the existing extensive state efforts \n     provide a significantly more prudent and flexible approach \n     for testing and refining the evolving legal concepts \n     concerning victims rights.\n\n  When the chief justices of our State courts make such a compelling \nargument, it seems to me that this body--always sensitive to the fact \nthat we live in a Federal system--should give it great attention.\n  Supporters have argued in the report at one place that the reason for \nthis constitutional amendment is to ``establish consistent, uniform \nrights'' for crime victims in this country. On the other hand, in the \nsame report the sponsors talk about giving the 50 different States the \nauthority to ``flesh out the countours of the amendment by providing \ndefinitions of victims' and crimes of violence.' '' They cannot have \nthat argument both ways.\n  The subject of trying to provide rights for victims in Federal \ncriminal cases is ripe for Federal statute, but it is wrong--it is \nsimply wrong--to treat the Constitution as though it were a statute \nbook.\n  This amendment does not meet the test of Federalist No. 49. This \ngreat document, written by James Madison, said that a constitutional \namendment provision should be reserved ``for certain great and \nextraordinary occasions.''\n  This is an occasion where the cause is surely important and great, \nbut the cause may be achieved by statutory means. It is not appropriate \nto amend the Constitution for this occasion.\n  As a student and as a young lawyer, I grew to revere the \nConstitution. As an American, I thank God for it every day. Amending \nthis hallowed document should be done when a great interest cannot \notherwise be protected and when it can be described simply and in \ntranscendent language. The amendment before us does not meet that test.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over the past few days, there has been a \ngreat deal of discussion on the rights of victims and the need for \nincreased participation of victims in the criminal justice system. I \nbelieve that all of us support victims' rights, greater federal \nrecognition of these rights. Clearly, they deserve enforceable rights \nthat are guaranteed by law. But, just as clearly, these rights can be \nachieved without taking the extraordinary step of amending the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  The Constitution is the foundation of our democracy, and it reflects \nthe enduring principles of our country. The framers deliberately made \nit difficult to amend the Constitution, because it was never intended \nto be used for normal legislative purposes. Chief Justice Rehnquist \ncaptures the essence of why this proposed amendment is misguided, when \nhe states that a statute, rather than a constitutional amendment, \n``would have the virtue of making any provisions in the bill which \nappeared mistaken by hindsight to be amended by a simple act of \nCongress.''\n  The Constitution is not a billboard which to plaster amendments as if \nthey were bumper sticker slogans. In this Congress alone, over a dozen \nconstitutional amendments have been introduced. With every new proposed \namendment of this kind, we undermine and trivialize the Constitution \nand threaten to weaken its enduring strength.\n  One of the guiding principles that has served the nation well for two \nhundred years is that if it is not necessary to amend the Constitution, \nit is necessary not to amend it. We have amended the Constitution only \n17 times in the two centuries since the adoption of the Bill of Rights. \nWe should consider such amendments only in rare instances, when the \nenactment of a statute is clearly inadequate.\n  We do have a responsibility to act to assure victims of crime that \ntheir rights in the criminal justice system will not be ignored. But \namending the Constitution is not the appropriate remedy, and the debate \nover such a remedy in recent years has, as a practical matter, delayed \nthe implementation of basic protections that are needed and that should \nbe accomplished by statute.\n  For too long, our criminal justice system has neglected the hundreds \nof thousands of victims of crime whose lives are shattered by violence \nor threats of violence each year. I believe, along with every other \nmember of the Senate, that the rights of victims deserve better from \nour criminal justice system.\n  Another irony is worth emphasizing in this debate. Many of the \nSenators who support the rights of victims and feel so strongly about \nthis constitutional amendment are the same Senators who refuse to allow \nfederal action, even by statute, to protect victims of hate crimes. For \nthe past two years, the Senate has failed to send hate crimes \nlegislation to the President's desk for signature. I hope that this \ndebate will at least have the beneficial affect of encouraging Congress \nto take action to protect victims of hate crimes. Their needs too can \nno longer be ignored.\n  Too often, the legal system does not provide adequate relief for \nvictims of crime. They are not given basic information about their \ncase--such as the case status, scheduling changes of court proceedings, \nand notice of a defendant's arrest and bail status. Victims deserve to \nknow about their case, They deserve to know about hearings and other \nproceedings. They deserve to know when their assailants are being \nconsidered for parole. And they certainly deserve to know when their \nattackers are released from prison.\n  Victims of crime and their families deserve legislation that will \nguarantee their basic rights and provide urgently needed support. \nHowever, particular provisions in the proposed constitutional amendment \nare of grave concern. It is no surprise that victims' rights groups and \ndomestic violence groups oppose the constitutional amendment for a very \npractical reason. If a victim of domestic violence acts in self-\ndefense, the batterer would be entitled to all of the constitutional \nrights created by S.J. Res. 3, including the right to attend court \nproceedings and the right to be heard.\n  Clearly, we can deal with this problem by statute, and I urge the \nSenate to do so. I would welcome the opportunity to work with my \ncolleagues to enact bipartisan legislation to accomplish the goal we \nshare of genuine protections for victims' rights.\n  Finally, I commend all of my colleagues who have so eloquently \ndefended the Constitution and opposed this misguided amendment, \nespecially Senator Byrd and Senator Leahy. They have given Congress and \nthe country an excellent lesson in the role of the Constitution in \nprotecting our liberties. Rarely has there been a better example of \nSenators living up to our oath of office ``to support and defend the \nConstitution.''\n  When we began this debate earlier this seek, the conventional wisdom \nwas that the proposed constitutional amendment was within a vote or two \nin the Senate of obtaining the two-thirds majority needed for passage. \nThe debate has so clearly demonstrated the fundamental flaws of this \namendment that the amendment is likely to be withdrawn. It is a proud \nmoment for the Senate, and I believe the founders who wrote the \nConstitution would be proud of us too.\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not want to conclude this debate \nwithout, again, acknowledging the commitment to crime victims of the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from California. I know that they \nare sincere in their support for crime victims. I compliment them as \nwell for the manner in which they have conducted themselves throughout \nthis debate and throughout the Judiciary Committee's work on this \nmatter. I view them not as opponents but as allies in our mutual \nefforts to assist crime victims.\n  I also want to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of the senior \nSenator from West Virginia and the thoughtful guidance of the \nDemocratic Leader. Senators Dorgan, Durbin, Schumer, Dodd, Moynihan, \nFeingold, Murray, Thompson, Wellstone, Levin, and Bingaman each \ncontributed greatly to the debate.\n  I thank Senators from both sides of the aisle--Senators who supported \npreserving the Constitution and those who supported the proposed \nconstitutional amendment. I commend the Senate for doing its duty and \nupholding the Constitution and Bill of Rights.\n  I would also like to thank Rachel King and her colleagues at the \nACLU; Sue Osthoff, Director of the National Clearinghouse for the \nDefense of Battered Women; John Albert, Public Policy Director of \nVictims Services; Donna Edwards, Director of the National Network to \nEnd Domestic Violence; Renny Cushing, Director of Murder Victims' \nFamilies for Reconciliation; Arwen Bird; Scott Wallace; Beth Wilkinson; \nEmmet Welch; and Professor Lynne Henderson. As always, I thank my \nstaff, as well as the hard-working staff of our distinguished \nDemocratic Leader.\n  Finally, my special thanks to Professor Robert Mosteller of the Duke \nLaw School, who has given so generously of his time, over many years, \nto many of us on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate. Professor \nMosteller is a leading scholar in this field, and his expertise and \ncounsel have been invaluable.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first, I compliment the wonderful \nstatement by the Senator from Michigan in opposition to this amendment. \nOn all issues I appreciate his knowledge and his understanding, and \nparticularly his extremely clear way of presenting his views on this \nvery important issue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3011-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3011-S3012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CALLING OF THE BANKROLL KICK-OFF\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues may remember, \nduring the first session of this Congress I initiated the Calling of \nthe Bankroll. It is a time when I come to the floor to chronicle the \nmassive amount of PAC and soft money pumped into the campaign finance \nsystem by donors looking to influence the work we do here on this \nfloor.\n  I called the bankroll many times last year--19 times, to be exact.\n  And I included not just donations by business interests but from \ninterests on both sides of these debates, including trial lawyers and \ngun control advocates.\n  Last year when I began my Calling of the Bankroll effort, I did so \nbecause I thought it was time for someone in this body finally to talk \nabout what we all think about and what the American people really are \nquite angry about; and that is, how money can influence what we do here \nand how we do it.\n  I know that this is an uncomfortable topic, and I know full well that \nthere are some who would prefer that I stop Calling the Bankroll--that \nthere are those who wish that I would stop putting the spotlight on \nfacts that reflect poorly on our system, and in turn on the Senate, and \non both major political parties.\n  I have to tell you, Mr. President, no one wishes I could stop Calling \nthe Bankroll as much as I do.\n  I wish wealthy interests with business before this body didn't have \nunlimited ability to give money to our political parties through the \nsoft money loophole, but they do.\n  I wish these big donors weren't able to buy special access to our \npolitical leaders through meetings and weekend retreats set up by the \nparties, but they can.\n  I wish fundraising skills and personal wealth weren't some of the \nmost sought-after qualities in a candidate for Congress today, but \neveryone knows that they are.\n  Most of all, I wish that these facts didn't paint a picture of \nGovernment so corrupt and so awash in the influence of money that the \nAmerican people, especially young people, have turned away from their \nGovernment in disgust, but every one of us knows that they have.\n  But I also know something else: that we have the power to change this \nembarrassing state of affairs.\n  Here in the Senate we have the power to show the American people that \nwe have the will to shut down the soft money system.\n  As I said, I Called the Bankroll 19 times last year--and I could have \ndone it even more times.\n  Unfortunatey there is never a shortage of material.\n  When I Call the Bankroll I describe how much money the various \ninterests lobbying on a particular bill have spent on campaign \ncontributions to influence our decisions.\n  I Called the Bankroll on: A mining rider to emergency supplemental \nappropriations, the gun control amendments to the juvenile justice \nbill, the Super Hornet amendment to DoD authorization, the Y2K \nliability legislation, the Patients' Bill of Rights--we did it twice on \nthat, China/NTR, the tobacco industry, last summer's tax bill, \nagriculture appropriations, the FCC rule on the siting of \ntelecommunications towers, oil royalties--we did it twice on that one, \nconsolidation in the railroad industry, the Passengers' Bill of Rights, \nthe F-22 program, the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, the Financial \nServices Modernization bill, and finally the Bankruptcy Reform Act.\n\n  As I said, there was no shortage of material for calling the \nbankrolls.\n  This year, it's time again to examine legislation before this body \nwith an eye to the interests that seek to influence the legislative \nprocess.\n  I have already begun that effort--I recently called the bankroll \nduring the debate on the budget resolution. Of course, the budget \nprocess itself is tainted by the flood of money that flows to those of \nus who decide the nation's spending priorities. During that debate we \naddressed the question of whether or not we should drill for oil in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge, and I called attention to the \nsignificant contributions by the companies with an interest in the \noutcome of that debate.\n  Before that I also called the bankroll on the interests lobbying both \nsides of the nuclear waste debate.\n  I talked about phony issue ads, PAC contributions, unlimited soft \nmoney contributions--the money that's always here, just beneath the \nsurface of our debates.\n  It's our unwillingness to discuss it or even acknowledge the \ninfluence of this money that speaks volumes about how uncomfortable so \nmany of us are with the current campaign finance system.\n  The purpose of the Calling of the Bankroll is to force this body to \nface up to the appearance of corruption the system causes and face up \nto our responsibility to do something about it.\n  So I can assure my colleagues that I will keep Calling the Bankroll \nuntil we do something about the campaign finance system that causes the \nAmerican people to question our motives when we act on legislation, \nand, I am afraid, to question the very integrity of this body and our \ndemocracy.\n\n  And today they have more reason than ever to take a cynical view of \nour work.\n  Because last year was another record-breaker in the annals of soft \nmoney fundraising--the national political party committees raised a \nrecord $107.2 million during the 1999 calendar year--81 percent more \nthan they raised during the last comparable presidential election \nperiod in 1995, according to Common Cause.\n  An 81 percent increase is astounding, especially considering that the \nyear it's compared with--1995, the last off-election year preceding a \npresidential election--which was itself a record-breaking year for soft \nmoney fundraising.\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\n  This year one of the most notable fundraising trends hits very close \nto home, or to the dome, as the case may be: Congressional campaign \ncommittees raised more than three times as much soft money during 1999 \nthan they raised during 1995--$62 million compared to $19.4 million.\n  That's a huge increase, Mr. President.\n  It is three times as much soft money--much of it raised by Members of \nCongress. The latest reports show record-breaking soft money figures \nfor the first quarter of the year 2000, as well.\n  How should the public view this?\n  What can we expect them to think as Members of Congress ask for these \nunlimited contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy \nindividuals, and then turn around and vote on legislation that directly \naffects those donors?\n  Frankly Mr. President, it's all the more reason for Americans to \nquestion our integrity, whether those donations have an impact on our \ndecisions or not.\n  But we can regain some of the public's trust by doing one simple \nthing--banning soft money.\n  On January 24, in its opinion in the Shrink Missouri case, the \nSupreme Court stated even more clearly to us that we may take that step \ntoday without the slightest offense to the First Amendment.\n  I'll continue the fight to ban soft money this year, and ask every \none of my colleagues to join me.\n  The fight to ban soft money is a fight to regain the public's trust, \nand Mr. President, there's no fight in our democracy today more \nworthwhile than that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, last night Senator John Warner, chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee, was the recipient of the James \nForrestal Memorial Award at a gathering of 900 distinguished leading \nindividuals involved in the industrial and military affairs of this \nNation. It was awarded last night in Washington. The Forrestal award \nhas been given since 1954 to distinguished Americans who most \neffectively applied Secretary Forrestal's ideas of a close working \nrelationship between the Government and the requirements of a strong \nnational defense. Other recipients were George Bush, Sam Nunn, Scoop \nJackson, John Tower, Barry Goldwater, John Stennis and, I believe, our \nPresiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Ted Stevens.\n  The award is given to a citizen of the United States who may be from \nthe military services, government, or industry. Senator Warner was \nhonored last night with the Forrestal award for his distinguished \npublic service relating to national security and national defense in a \nwide range of responsibilities. All of us in the Senate know that \nSenator Warner was a former Navy enlisted man in World War II, \nenlisting as a 17-year-old, then serving again in Korea as a marine \nofficer. I have heard him say he has gone through two basic trainings, \nboth Navy and Marine.\n  Later, during the cold war era, John served his Nation as Secretary \nof the Navy. His service to the Nation in this body began in 1978, and \nhe has been on the Senate Armed Services Committee ever since, a total \nof 21 years. I know that John enjoyed being honored by 900 of his \nfriends and companions who provide the equipment our soldiers and \nsailors, marines and airmen use every day to maintain a strong national \ndefense.\n\n  John's public thanks to those in industry and in the services is an \nexpression of thanks from all of us in Congress. I associate myself \nwith his remarks that he made so eloquently last evening.\n  There is no one in this body who cares more about the men and women \nin uniform, our military retirees, and our veterans than John Warner. \nThere is no one more committed to the defense of this Nation. The \nmarkup of our committee's bill for defense will be undertaken next \nweek, and the debate on this floor will show, without question, the \ndepth of Senator John Warner's commitment to the Nation.\n  We owe men such as John Warner our gratitude for leading us in times \nof turmoil. There have been many in history who have provided this kind \nof essential leadership. We are part of John's team. As a member of the \nArmed Services Committee, I am proud of him, his leadership and his \nfriendship. Congratulations, John, on being the recipient of the year \n2000 James Forrestal Memorial Award.\n  I have the honor of serving with Senator Warner on the Armed Services \nCommittee. He is a gentleman's gentleman, a patriot's patriot. He is \nproud of being able to preside this year over a budget that produced \nthe first real increase in defense spending in 15 years, a 4.8-percent \npay raise for our men and women in uniform. It was a real \naccomplishment.\n  I have been honored to serve with him. I share with this body my \npride in his being selected for this prestigious award.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

HERB CHEEVER\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, quite often on the floor of the Senate, \nwe give speeches about extraordinary people who do extraordinary \nthings. Today, I'd like to recognize someone whose name you won't see \nin the headlines, but who is truly extraordinary in every sense of the \nword. Earlier this year, my good friend Dr. Herb Cheever, Dean of the \nCollege of Arts and Sciences at South Dakota State University (SDSU), \nannounced that he would retire.\n  Dr. Cheever grew up in Brookings, South Dakota and received his \nundergraduate degree from SDSU. After earning his doctorate from the \nUniversity of Iowa and teaching in Kansas and Wisconsin, Dr. Cheever \nreturned to his alma mater. He and his wife Sydna raised three boys in \nBrookings--Jason, Michael and Gene--and Herb and Sydna have long been \ntireless advocates of the arts in our state.\n  South Dakota State University is a wonderful school. Its reputation \nfor academic excellence and cutting edge research is known across the \ncountry. Dr. Cheever is to be commended for the critical role he played \nin the development of the University, but he should also be recognized \nfor his commitment to the things one can't measure by a standardized \ntest.\n  Dean Cheever is a passionate believer in the importance of public \nservice.\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\n Throughout his teaching career, his commitment to serving others was \nsomething that was impressed upon all of his students. When I was an \nundergraduate at SDSU, Dean Cheever taught me more about the importance \nof public service than I could have imagined possible, and there is no \ndoubt in my mind that he helped steer me down the career path that I \neventually chose to follow.\n  The impact Dean Cheever had on me wasn't confined to his work as an \neducator. He was also instrumental in helping shape my interest in \npolitics. Dr. Cheever and I volunteered together on George McGovern's \nrace for the Senate in 1968. It was a true pleasure for me to work \nalongside him during that exciting time.\n  Later, Dean Cheever took leave from SDSU to help Dick Kneip remain \ngovernor, and to direct the South Dakota Democratic Party. \nPolitically--and luckily for me--Herb Cheever has worked on behalf of \nthe Democratic Party. However, as everyone who knows him can attest, \nthat is the only venue in which he plays favorites. Dean Cheever's \ncommitment to education and his community, and his passion for public \nservice have made a deep and lasting impression on thousands of young \npeople on SDSU's campus over the years, and I am pleased that I was \nfortunate enough to be among them.\n  I am proud to call Dean Herbert Cheever a friend, and I am pleased to \njoin Sydna, their friends and family in wishing him the best as he \nbegins the next important chapter of his life. While his colleagues and \nstudents will undoubtedly miss his daily presence in the classrooms of \nSDSU, I am confident that he will continue to touch many lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3013-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3013-S3014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, just a few days ago, the Congressional \nBudget Office released a paper entitled ``Budgetary and Technical \nImplications of the Administration's Plan for National Missile \nDefense.'' I bring this paper to the Senate's attention because I \nbelieve it is misleading and confusing. It has given support to critics \nof the program who also have contributed to the confusion.\n  Some reporters and editors have characterized this study as a \n``budget estimate'' of our National Missile Defense program which shows \nthat the costs will be far higher than previously predicted. This is \nnot so.\n  The paper is not a budgetary scoring of legislation that the CBO \ntraditionally engages in. This is a paper of a kind the CBO \noccasionally produces in response to Congressional requests, providing \nit can spare analysts from their other duties. The request for this \npaper was recently made by members of the Senate and the CBO \nacknowledges that it had insufficient time to fully consider all of the \nquestions it was asked to address.\n  The paper puts the total cost for a National Missile Defense system \nat $49 billion. I say ``a'' National Missile Defense system because the \nCBO paper did not examine the program actually in place and for which \nwe have received estimates in the past, but rather one that its \nanalysts thought should be in place. Mr. Ken Bacon, the Defense \nDepartment spokesman, characterized the estimate as an ``apples to gold \napples'' comparison.\n  The Defense Department has stated previously that acquisition and \noperation of a single site NMD system with 100 interceptors would cost \n$25.6 billion through 2015. The CBO estimate of $49 billion is for a \ndual site NMD system with 250 interceptors. Some news reports, such as \none published in the Wall Street Journal on April 25th have erroneously \nreported a figure of $60 billion for this year, which they arrive at by \nadding the cost of Space-Based Infrared Satellites. However, even the \nCBO paper correctly notes that those satellites will serve other \nmissile defense programs, as well as other entirely different mission \nareas, and are not part of the cost of the NMD system.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that a single interceptor site by \nitself will be insufficient to adequately protect the United States \nfrom missile attack, and additional capability will be needed. Whether \nthat should be a second ground-based site, as the CBO paper assumes, \none based at sea, or some other approach remains to be determined. But \nwe should not confuse the CBO's ``golden apple'' estimate with the \nestimates we have received previously, which address a different, \nsingle site NMD system.\n  Even where the CBO paper tried to make a direct comparison, it still \nbased its estimate on the program it thought should exist rather than \nthe one that does. For example, the paper determined that the Ballistic \nMissile Defense Organization should buy 75 percent more interceptor \nmissiles than it plans to for testing and spares in the so-called \n``Capability 1'' single site system. It made different assumptions \nabout construction costs, using the 30 year old Safeguard system in \nNorth Dakota as its model. And it based its costs on 30 operational \nflight tests over the first five years of system operation, three times \nthe number actually planned.\n  Projecting costs for a complex weapon system still under development \nis an uncertain enterprise, and different analysts can reasonably reach \ndifferent conclusions about what assumptions are warranted. It would \nhave been reasonable for CBO to present its conclusions to those who \nare actually building the NMD system and seek their views on whether \nthe different assumptions were warranted. This, after all, is the \nprocedure followed by the General Accounting Office when it produces \nsuch a study. It sends out a draft for comment by the relevant agencies \nand either incorporates the comments of those agencies or explains why \nit does not agree. Unfortunately, we have been told by the Ballistic \nMissile Defense Organization that, despite repeated offers to assess \nthe CBO findings, CBO declined to present its conclusions before \npublishing this paper. That is unfortunate; had it done so, there might \nbe less confusion about what this paper says.\n  I believe it is also important to note some costs that CBO did not \nconsider in this study.\n  The study doesn't examine the potential costs to the United States of \nnot having a missile defense system. We should keep in mind that the \nNMD program is not like a new tactical fighter or guided missile \ndestroyer or armored vehicle, replacing an earlier generation. We have \nno defense against long-range ballistic missiles launched against our \nterritory. That means that should the day come when some nation--for \nwhatever reason--launches a missile at the United States, without a \nNational Missile Defense system we will have no choice but to watch \nthat missile strike its target. If that missile is equipped with a \nweapon of mass destruction, the results would be the most catastrophic \nevent ever to take place in the United States. An assessment of these \ncosts is nowhere to be found in the CBO report.\n  Nor is the cost to U.S. leadership of our continued vulnerability to \nmissile attack. A missile doesn't have to be used to be useful in \ndeterring actions by other nations, and we need only look at our own \nexperience to confirm that. The United States has spent hundreds of \nbillions of dollars on ballistic missiles over the last 40 years, none \nof which have ever been used. We did so because we believed those \nweapons would deter other nations from taking certain actions that \nwould harm our interests.\n  The United States can be deterred, too, by the threat of missile \nattack. Our former colleague, Secretary of Defense Cohen, provided an \nexample of how that can happen when he spoke to our Allies in Munich in \nFebruary. He said,\n\n       If Saddam Hussein had five or ten or twenty ICBMs with \n     nuclear warheads, and he said that, if you try to expel me \n     from Kuwait, I'll put one in Berlin, one in Munich, one in \n     New York, one in Washington, one in Los Angeles, etc., one in \n     Rome--let's spread the wealth, one in England, London--how \n     many would have been quite so eager to support the deployment \n     of some five hundred thousand convention troops to expel him \n     from Kuwait? We would have had a different calculation, \n     asking, ``What kind of a risk are we running? . . .\n       We never want to be in the position of being blackmailed by \n     anyone who will prevent us from carrying out our Article 5 \n     obligations or responding to any threat to our national \n     security interests.''\n\n  Ther are significant costs to the ability of the United States to act \nin its national interests if it is vulnerable to missile attack. This \nreport from the CBO doesn't place a dollar value on that.\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\n  Mr. President, while our debates on various defense programs can be \nserved by additional views, I think this new paper from the \nCongressional Budget Office has done more to create confusion than to \ncontribute usefully to the debate.

Mr. President, I had the privilege of chairing a \nhearing of the Foreign Relations Committee on April 5 that examined the \nstatus of U.S. efforts to resolve still open questions of compensation \nand restitution arising from the tragedy of the Holocaust, and that \nlooked broadly at the persistent phenomenon of anti-Semitism that \ninspired and enabled that monstrous crime.\n  Extraordinary witnesses appeared before the Committee--led by Dr. \nElie Wiesel, who called on us and all civilized men and women to stand \nfirm against the dark forces of bigotry and other hatreds, and Deputy \nSecretary of the Treasury Stuart Eizenstat, who described the efforts \nof the United States and other countries to finally and squarely \nconfront with painful truths and achieve some level of justice for the \nHolocaust's victims and its survivors.\n  One subject that was analyzed for the Committee in great detail was \nthe current reach and impact of anti-Semitism, and I feel particularly \nindebted to David Harris, Executive Director of the American Jewish \nCommittee, for his thoughtful and comprehensive testimony on this grave \nmatter. This presentation reviewed not only the scourge of anti-\nsemitism in Europe but the increasingly troubling incidence of this \nform of bigotry in the Arab world.\n  At the same time that countries across the Middle East are engaged in \na peace process guided by Washington that promises a new era in \nrelations between Arabs and Israelis, old anti-Jewish enmities are too \noften tolerated, or even fanned, by important institutions in the Arab \nworld. Anti-Jewish and anti-Israel propaganda of the most grotesque \nnature is commonly available--on the newsstands, in schools, in \nprofessional societies and political conferences--and almost \nuniversally tolerated, even by governments committed to pursuing peace.\n  As the American Jewish Committee asserted, this sanctioning of hatred \nagainst Israel and Jews in general, profoundly complicates the search \nfor Middle East peace, fostering a climate in which compromise, \naccommodation, trust and understanding--on both sides--may be \nunattainable. This virulent hatred is simply incompatible with the \nsearch for peace, and it is the obligation of the region's leaders to \nact firmly against its continuing dissemination.\n  I am grateful that the American Jewish Committee distilled the \nessence of its testimony on this subject in an advertisement that ran \non the Op-ed Page of the New York Times on Tuesday, April 11. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the AJC ad be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, April 11, 2000]\n\n                          Hatred Versus Peace\n\n       A comprehensive and durable Arab-Israeli peace requires \n     more than signed agreements. What is needed are concrete \n     steps to build a culture of peace.\n       As Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak takes bold and \n     courageous initiatives to achieve a permanent settlement with \n     the Palestinians, to withdraw Israeli forces from southern \n     Lebanon, and to negotiate with Syria, hatred of Jews seethes \n     in the Arab government-controlled media, and in many Arab \n     schools, religious institutions, and professional societies.\n       Some recent examples:\n       The Palestinian Authority-appointed Islamic Mufti of \n     Jerusalem last month publicly trivialized the Holocaust just \n     before meeting with Pope John Paul II, echoing a view often \n     published in newspaper articles and editorials across the \n     Arab world.\n       Syrian textbooks are replete with anti-Semitism, Holocaust \n     denial, and open calls for the extermination of Jews.\n       Professional societies in Egypt and Jordan, countries \n     formally at peace with Israel, prohibit contact with \n     Israelis. The Jordanian Journalists' Association expelled one \n     member for committing the ``crime'' of visiting Israel and \n     compelled three others to sign an apology.\n       While Israeli diplomats originally invited to a University \n     of Cairo conference on March 28 were turned away at the door, \n     the Arab League, also meeting in the Egyptian capital, called \n     for an immediate end to Jewish immigration to Israel.\n       The Palestinian Authority's official news outlets regularly \n     assert that Israel is spreading viruses throughout the Arab \n     world.\n       Arab media have depicted, in words and cartoons, Israeli \n     Prime Minister Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy as \n     Nazis.\n       Such virulent anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial in the \n     Arab world must no longer be tolerated.\n       The spreading of hatred and the pursuit of peace cannot \n     coexist. Which will it be? The fate of the region may depend \n     on the answer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3014-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3014-S3015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES, DIFFERENT OUTCOMES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week, as the one-year anniversary of \nthe Columbine shooting approached, rumors of copycat violence prompted \npanic among teachers and students. Principals and administrators \nsensitive to such rumors heightened security by bringing in police \nprotection and extra security guards. Other districts relied on parents \nand community volunteers to monitor school activity, and still others \ncanceled classes altogether rather than suffer the fate of a school \nshooting, or even the threat of one.\n  For the most part, on the day the nation remembered Columbine, the \nrumors turned out to be just that--rumors. But the day did not go by \nwithout an act of copycat violence. The tragedy occurred, not here in \nthe United States, but in Ottawa in the province of Ontario, Canada.\n  An article in the Ottawa Citizen describes the attack by a 15-year-\nold boy as one directly linked to the Columbine killings. The teen-age \nboy was apparently obsessed with the school massacre, and reportedly \nhad photographs of the Columbine killers posted in his school locker. \nStudents remember the accused counting down the days in eager \nanticipation of the exact moment Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold began \ntheir reign of terror.\n  In many ways, the student in Ottawa had similar experiences to those \nof Harris and Klebold. Classmates teased him because of his appearance. \nHe felt depressed and suicidal. He longed to be noticed, and perhaps \nthought this act of violence would give him the notoriety he craved. \nAnd so, exactly one year and a few minutes after the Columbine massacre \nbegan, a boy in Ottawa picked up his backpack and pulled out his \nweapon.\n  Both scenarios seem similar but there is one critical difference \nbetween the now infamous April 20th act of violence in Littleton and \nthe more recent one in Ottawa that garnered virtually no attention. \nThat crucial, critical difference--the weapon.\n  Despite the Canadian boy's obsession with Columbine, his copycat \ncrime was not carried out with an arsenal of semiautomatic guns, but \nwith a kitchen knife. The weapon he pulled from his backpack caused \ngreat pain and anguish, but in the end, none of the five people he \nstabbed sustained any life-threatening injuries. By comparison, the \nColumbine rampage left fifteen dead and more than two dozen injured, \nsome of whom still have fragments of ammunition lodged deep in their \nbodies.\n  The circumstances of these cases were similar, but the outcomes were \ndifferent because one country successfully limits access to firearms \namong young people, and one does not. In Canada, citizens are subject \nto licensing and registration requirements and have limited access to \nhandguns and certain assault weapons. In the United States, our gun \nlaws are so riddled with loopholes a 15 year old can legally possess an \nassault rifle.\n  I've often made the point that Canadian children, who watch the same \nmovies and television programs, and play with the same toys and video \ngames, are far safer than their American counterparts. The key \ndifference between these children is not morals, religion or family, \nthe difference is access to guns.\n  How else can one explain that in 1997, the U.S. rate of death \ninvolving firearms was approximately 14 per 100,000, compared to \nCanada's rate of 4 per 100,000? In 1997, in my hometown of Detroit, \nthere were 354 firearm homicides. In Windsor, the Canadian town that is \nacross the river, there were only 4 firearm homicides for that same \nyear. Accounting for population, Detroit's firearm homicide rate was 18 \ntimes higher than Windsor's.\n\n[[Page S3015]]\n\n  Congress does not have to pass Canadian-style gun control laws to \nreduce the number of American firearm casualties, but surely we need to \nreduce access to firearms among minors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3015-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to the first Jewish congregation in the state of Michigan, \nTemple Beth El. The congregation, whose first services were held in \n1850 by twelve families in Detroit, begins the celebration of its 150th \nanniversary this year with a series of special events. Beginning in May \nwith a Musical Revue and concluding with a benefit in November, the \nevents will bring together members of the congregation as well as \nthousands of others from throughout the metropolitan Detroit area.\n  Founded at a time of unrest in our nation--when the debate over \nslavery was intensifying, the economy was booming, and the railroad was \ntransforming American culture--Beth El began with German immigrants. \nMembers of Beth El later joined in the Reform Judaism movement. By \n1867, the congregation had replaced German with English as the language \nof instruction, and in 1873 Beth El was one of the charter members of \nthe Union of American Hebrew Congregations which brought together the \nReform synagogues of America to establish an American rabbinical \nseminary.\n  Over the years, the congregation experienced steady growth, locating \nat several notable sites in Detroit. These include a temple that was \nconstructed at Woodward and Eliot in 1903 (now the Bonstelle Theater \nwhich is owned and operated by Wayne State University) and a temple \nthat was designed by the late Albert Kahn in 1922 and built at Woodward \nand Gladstone. Like these formidable architectural works that bear \nwitness to the congregation's vision and contribution, Beth El's rabbis \nwere pillars in the community and were instrumental in building and \ndeveloping the Detroit Jewish community and the national institutions \nof the Reform movement. Rabbi Louis Grossman, Rabbi Leo Franklin, Rabbi \nB. Benedict Glazer, and Rabbi Richard Hertz are among those who are \nwell-remembered for their significant leadership and prominent roles in \nhelping to strengthen human relations and the cause of social justice.\n  In 1973, the congregation opened its doors to its newest home in \nBloomfield Hills. Today it has a membership of over 1600 families. \nUnder the spiritual leadership of Rabbi Daniel Syme, Rabbi David \nCastigilone, Rabbi Sheila Goloboy and Cantor Stephen DuBov. Temple Beth \nEl continues to play an important role in the metropolitan Detroit \nJewish community, and it is recognized as one of the foremost Reform \ncongregations in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I would like to express my best wishes to Temple Beth \nEl on the celebration of this milestone in their history as a major \ncontributor to America's cultural strength and religious tradition. We \nall profit from the preservation and celebration of individual and \nreligious freedom that Temple Beth El so well embodies. I know my \ncolleagues will join me in congratulating the congregation of Temple \nBeth El and Rabbi Daniel Syme for achieving 150 years as a ``home that \nwelcomes all of Detroit's Jewish community'' and as a hallmark of \nspiritual development.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3015-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO MAYOR EMMA GRESHAM\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \none of the great civil servants of my state. On April 14, 2000, Mayor \nEmma Gresham of Keysville, Georgia, received an Essence Award from \nEssence Magazine for her outstanding service to the community. This \naward is a fitting tribute to a lady who has brought so much to her \ncommunity and Georgia as a whole.\n  Emma Gresham was born on April 13, 1925, the youngest of eight \nchildren. As the daughter of a pastor and a missionary, Emma Gresham's \ndesire to help other people was established at a young age. During her \nyouth she served as a scoutmaster, and went on to work as a teacher at \nher local church. All of her life Emma Gresham has sought to make other \npeople's lives better.\n  While Mrs. Gresham's commitment to the people of Keysville has \nexisted for decades, the town of Keysville has not. Although the town \nhad held a charter since 1890, it stopped having elections and \nessentially dissolved in 1933. In the mid-1980's the charter was \nrediscovered and found to be valid, and in 1985 the townspeople chose \nEmma Gresham as their mayor.\n  Ms. Gresham enjoyed her position for less than a day because the \ncharter was revoked due to concerns over the city's boundary. Following \na drawn-out process that involved excavations to discover a long-lost \nlandmark, the city's charter was reactivated and Ms. Gresham was \nelected again in 1988. Since taking office, Mrs. Gresham has served for \nfree.\n  Once in office, Mayor Gresham set to work. Since the town government \nhad been dormant for so long, Keysville lacked many of the necessities \nmost small towns enjoy. The city lacked clean water, streetlights, and \neven a fire department. In addition, the town's adult illiteracy rate \nwas dangerously high.\n  Today, thanks to Mayor Gresham's leadership and commitment, Keysville \nhas a water tower and a fire station. The first street lights were \nrecently installed, and the town started a medical clinic. Last, but \ncertainly not least, Keysville has an established adult literacy \nprogram as well.\n  The citizens of Keysville are now talking of building a new city hall \nand elementary school. This is quite a feat for a town that virtually \ndid not exist twelve years ago.\n  Now 75, Emma Gresham is likely to retire when her current term as \nmayor ends in 2002. We can only hope that her successor will follow in \nher footsteps and be as effective an advocate for Keysville as Mayor \nGresham.\n  Mr. President, the town of Keysville is certainly blessed. Without \nEmma Gresham's leadership, it is quite possible that it would not have \nmade the strides that it has in the last decade. I offer my sincere \ncongratulations to Mrs. Gresham for the award she earned through years \nof commitment to Keysville and its people, and wish continued success \nfor her and the community she leads.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3015-4", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3015-S3016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CAPTAINS JOHN AND GLORIA CAFFREY\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

These two outstanding Navy Nurse Corps officers culminate \ntheir distinguished careers at the Naval Hospital in Jacksonville, \nFlorida, where Captain Jack Caffrey served as the Director of \nOperational Medicine and Captain Gloria Caffrey as the Director of \nNursing Services and Associate Director of Clinical Services.\n  Captain Jack Caffrey has distinguished himself as a true leader and \npace setter in the Navy Nurse Corps. In addition to his last assignment \nin Operational Medicine, highlights of his\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\ncareer include serving as the Commanding Officer and Executive Officer \nof the Naval School of Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. His \nstrong leadership and dedication to excellence in education and \ntraining programs led to unprecedented technological advances in \ntraining materials and methodologies. For more than thirty years \nCaptain Jack Caffrey has met every challenge and every assignment with \nenthusiasm and zeal. He has served as a positive role model for all \nNurse Corps officers and his contributions will positively impact \nmilitary nursing and health care for years to come.\n  Captain Gloria Caffrey has also distinguished herself as an \noutstanding Nurse Corp officer for more than thirty years and has \nexcelled in numerous executive and clinical assignments. While her \naccomplishments have been many, highlights of her career include \nserving as the Head of the Nurse Corps Assignment Section in the Bureau \nof Naval Personnel. In this role, she expertly managed the assignment \nof 3,200 Nurse Corps officers to billets Navy-wide. Captain Gloria \nCaffrey was instrumental in increasing the number of Nurse Corps \nofficers selected to Executive Medicine billets and was key in \ndeveloping policy changes affecting Defense Officer Personnel \nManagement Act grade relief and subspecialty reductions. Her superior \nleadership, vision, and dedication to duty has been an inspiration to \nall military nurses. Captain Gloria Caffrey leaves a lasting legacy of \nexcellence.\n  Mr. President, more than fifty years ago, as I was recovering in a \nmilitary hospital, I began a unique relationship with military nurses. \nThe Caffreys embody what I know military nurses to be--strong, \ndedicated professional leaders, stepping to the forefront to serve \ntheir country and committed to caring for our Sailors, Marines, Airmen, \nSoldiers and family members during peacetime and at war. Captains Jack \nand Gloria Caffrey's many meritorious awards and decorations \ndemonstrate their contributions in a tangible way, but it is the legacy \nthey leave behind for the Navy Nurse Corps, the United States Navy and \nthe Department of Defense of which we are most appreciative. It is with \npride that I congratulate both Captain Jack Caffrey and Captain Gloria \nCaffrey on their outstanding careers of exemplary service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3016-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL CHARTER SCHOOLS WEEK\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, next Monday, May 1, 2000, is the \nfirst day of the first National Charter Schools Week in our nation's \nhistory, an event modeled after similar state level celebrations in \nMichigan and California. I feel that this is a momentous occasion which \nprovides the nation with an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate \nthe hard work and many accomplishments of charter school teachers, \nstudents, parents, administrators, and board members. Charter schools \nare a relatively recent phenomenon, but they have already established \ntheir mark on our nation's public education system.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely proud of the role the State of Michigan \nhas played in the development of charter schools. Since 1993, when \nMichigan became the ninth state to grant citizens the freedom to \nestablish charter schools, 173 public school academies, as they are \ncalled, have been founded. This places Michigan third in the nation in \nnumber of charter schools, behind just Arizona and California. In the \nfall of 1999, over 50,000 students attended these public school \nacademies, up from 30,000 in 1998. More importantly, 91 percent of \nMichigan parents said their charter public school did a better job of \neducating their child, and eight of ten said charter schools are better \nat motivating students.\n  It is my feeling that these numbers are an indication of the many \nbenefits charter public schools offer to communities. They provide \nparents and students with choice in education. They allow teachers a \ndegree of flexibility that cannot be found in traditional public \nschools. Furthermore, they allow administrators and board members a \ncertain amount of innovation in the founding, and also the funding, of \nschools, and in the decisions that are made in how they are to be run.\n  Mr. President, what charter schools do, first and foremost, is give \nteachers, students, parents, and administrators the ability to \nexperiment, to tinker with the system in the hopes of improving it, and \nthey do this while at the same time remaining accountable to local and \nstate school boards. If our educational system is to improve, if we are \ntruly going to strive to provide our nation's children with the \neducation they deserve, I feel that charter schools are going to play a \nvital role in this process.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, in charter schools, we have a situation where \neverybody wins. Parents are able to send their children to a safe \nschool environment where they will have more say in the entire process. \nTeachers are able to find new ways to do their own work, to work \ntogether with one another, and to work with members of the community. \nAdministrators are lifted from many of the restraints of the \ntraditional public school system. And the greatest benefactor of all \nthis will be our nation's public school students. They are the ones who \nwill benefit from the competition, the experimentation, and the \ninnovation, because of the effect that these things will have on our \nentire public education system.\n  Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of charter schools and \nthe many opportunities they offer. It was my pleasure last year to have \nsecured $925,000 in funding for Central Michigan University, which will \nuse this money to establish a national Charter Schools Development and \nPerformance Institute. The grand opening of the institute is May 1, \n2000, which also happens to be Michigan's Third Annual Charter School \nDay. The goal of the institute is to foster high-performing students \nand effectively run charter public schools by promoting development, \nachievement, and accountability. It will also disseminate information \non and assist schools with the design and the implementation of charter \nschool models.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely excited that the week of May 1-May 5, \n2000, is being officially recognized as National Charter Schools Week. \nI am hopeful that this will help to make our nation more aware of \ncharter schools, and the wonderful opportunities they offer to \nteachers, parents, and students throughout our nation. The sooner we \nfully realize the potential of charter schools, the sooner they will be \nable to fully reach this potential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3016-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3016-S3017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DR. WILLIAM SLOANE COFFIN\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, May 6th marks the 75th birthday of \nDr. William Sloane Coffin. Protestants for the Common Good is \ncelebrating that day with a tribute to Dr. Coffin in Chicago, and I \nwant to take a moment to call the Senate's attention to the life of \nthis remarkable man.\n  I should begin by mentioning that since his retirement, Bill has \nlived in Vermont, and I am proud to represent a man whose dedication to \npeace, the environment, and social justice I have long admired.\n  William Sloane Coffin first came to the world's attention during the \n18 years he served as the Chaplain of Yale University. As an outspoken \nand courageous supporter of civil rights and a founder of Clergy and \nLaity Concerned for Vietnam, he often sacrificed his own safety to \nensure and protect the rights of others. He protested against \nsegregation laws in the South, and with Dr. Benjamin Spock against the \nwar in Vietnam. Anyone who was fortunate to hear him speak on these \ngreat moral issues of our time remembers his tremendous eloquence, \npassion and conviction. What many people may not know is that he also \nserved his country as an infantry officer in Europe during the Second \nWorld War.\n  From New Haven, Dr. Coffin moved to New York City where he became the \nSenior Minister at Manhattan's Riverside Church. His soaring oratory \ninspired people from all walks of life.\n  Regularly challenging those who attended his services to seek justice \nin their own lives, Dr. Coffin set an example by consistently doing so \nhimself. He founded the Church's well-known disarmament program, \ntraveled throughout the world promoting peace and respect for human \nrights, and remains the President Emeritus of ``SANE/FREEZE: Campaign \nfor Global Security.''\n  Mr. President, I have been fortunate not only to know of William \nSloane\n\n[[Page S3017]]\n\nCoffin but to know him personally. He has had an extraordinary impact \non his community, his state, his country, and the world. His conscience \nis like a beacon, which challenges and guides us all.\n  Not long ago, I celebrated my 60th birthday. I hope that 15 years \nfrom now I will be able to look back at my own life, and look forward \nto the days ahead, with the sense of accomplishment, pride, and \ncommitment to equality, justice and peace that William Sloane Coffin \nshould feel on the occasion of his 75th birthday.\n  Happy birthday my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3017-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL GRANGE WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nMinnesota members of the National Grange. This week is Grange Week, \nwhich celebrates the oldest U.S. rural community service, family-\norientated organization with a special interest in agriculture. In \nrecognition of its members in Minnesota, and across the United States, \nI want to take this time to reflect on the accomplishments of the \nNational Grange during the past 133 years.\n  Organized in 1867, the National Grange assisted farmers who were \ntrying to dig out of financial troubles that plagued them after the \nCivil War. Today, this organization continues to advance the best \ninterests of agriculture and promote the family values that are rooted \nso deeply in rural America.\n  This commitment is easily seen in the Grange's involvement in many \nlocal service projects, such as organizing community response teams to \ncope with disasters, assisting in community development revitalization, \nvolunteering at local schools, and promoting farm and home safety, \nalong with other important activities.\n  In my home state of Minnesota, the State Grange has been influential \nin the development of many key projects and services since 1867. Around \nthe turn of the century, the State Grange played a crucial role in \nhelping farmers and people in rural areas get home delivery of their \nmail and take part in rural electrification projects. They also helped \nform the University of Minnesota School of Agriculture.\n  Mr. President, because its members understand the importance of the \nfamily farm and the communities they reside in, it is easy to see why \nthe Grange has been so successful in its many endeavors. I am pleased \nto make this statement on behalf of the Minnesota Grange, and I wish \nthem well and commend them for their many hours of volunteer service--\nservice that is vital to all our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3017-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              LARRY COOKE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Vermonter and good friend, Larry Cooke, who recently died \nafter a long illness. Born and raised in Vermont, Larry's love and \ndevotion to his state and home town of Brattleboro framed all of his \nactions. We in Vermont are saddened by his loss but heartened by the \nlegacy that he leaves behind.\n  Larry's dedication to public service began early in his life. As an \neighth grader, he was elected president of his class and never looked \nback. Like many of an earlier generation, Larry was a self-made man, \ngoing to work for his father immediately after graduating from \nBrattleboro Union High School.\n  Demonstrating a devotion to his country that would extend throughout \nhis life, Larry joined the Army and served in Germany before coming \nhome to earn his real estate license. In this profession that he found \nhis true calling, and it is here that he leaves his biggest footprint \non the town of Brattleboro.\n  Larry devoted his career to affordable housing and environmentally \nfriendly developments. His most important projects have included \nrenovating historic buildings to their original condition while making \nthem viable for modern day usage.\n  Larry was a consistent and important champion of affordable housing, \ntaking the lead on the issue at the age of thirty as a candidate for \nBattleboro town selectman. He then went on to serve on the Brattleboro \nHousing Authority for two decades, building and renovating affordable \nhousing and apartments throughout the area.\n  As if his professional and private life did not take up enough of his \ntime, Larry was active in every aspect of town affairs. He has served \nas president of the Kiwanis Club and as a corporator of Brattleboro \nMemorial Hospital. Among other activities too numerous to mention, \nLarry was a Mason, a member of the American Legion, the Shriners, and \nthe Elks.\n  Before he died, this close friend of mine gave one last gift to his \ncommunity. Larry donated a historic home in the center of Brattleboro \nto the town's historical society for use as its headquarters and \nmuseum. Although only a small part of Larry's life-long contribution to \nBrattleboro, the home will stand as a lasting monument to a man who \ndevoted his life to the betterment of his community.\n  It has been said that we live in deeds, not years. While Larry died \nyoung, his accomplishments rival those of the oldest of men. He will be \nmissed not only by Brattleboro and Vermont, but also by this country, \nwhere his life stands as a shining example for us all. My deepest \ncondolences go out to Larry's devoted Wide, Kathleen, and his four \ndaughters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3017-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n  [Note: The following message was signed by the President on Tuesday, \nApril 25, 2000 and received in the Senate on Wednesday, April 26, \n2000.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3017-4", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3017-S3018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF THE VETO OF THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2000--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 101\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States; which was ordered to be spread \nupon the Journal.\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval S. 1287, the ``Nuclear \nWaste Policy Amendments Act of 2000.''\n  The overriding goal of the Federal Government's high-level \nradioactive waste management policy is the establishment of a \npermanent, geologic repository. This policy not only addresses \ncommercial spent nuclear fuel but also advances our non-proliferation \nefforts by providing an option for disposal of surplus plutonium from \nnuclear weapons stockpiles and an alternative to reprocessing. It \nsupports our national defense by allowing continuing operation of our \nnuclear navy, and it is essential for the cleanup of the Department of \nEnergy's nuclear weapons complex.\n  Since 1993, my Administration has been conducting a rigorous world-\nclass scientific and technical program to evaluate the suitability of \nthe Yucca Mountain, Nevada, site for use as a repository. The work \nbeing done at Yucca Mountain represents a significant scientific and \ntechnical undertaking, and public confidence in this first-of-a-kind \neffort is essential.\n  Unfortunately, the bill passed by the Congress will do nothing to \nadvance the scientific program at Yucca Mountain or promote public \nconfidence in the decision of whether or not to recommend the site for \na repository in 2001. Instead, this bill could be a step backward in \nboth respects. The bill would limit the Environmental Protection \nAgency's (EPA) authority to issue radiation standards that protect \nhuman health and the environment and would prohibit the issuance of \nEPA's final standards until June 2001. EPA's current intent is to issue \nfinal radiation standards this summer so that they will be in place \nwell in advance of the Department of Energy's recommendation in 2001 on \nthe suitability of the Yucca Mountain site.\n  There is no scientific reason to delay issuance of these final \nradiation standards beyond the last year of this Administration; in \nfact, waiting until\n\n[[Page S3018]]\n\nnext year to issue these standards could have the unintended effect of \ndelaying a recommendation on whether or not to go forward with Yucca \nMountain. The process for further review of the EPA standards laid out \nin the bill passed by the Congress would simply create duplicative and \nunnecessary layers of bureaucracy by requiring additional review by the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission and the National Academy of Sciences, \neven though both have already provided detailed comments to the EPA. \nThis burdensome process would add time, but would do nothing to advance \nthe state of scientific knowledge about the Yucca Mountain site.\n  Finally, the bill passed by the Congress does little to minimize the \npotential for continued claims against the Federal Government for \ndamages as a result of the delay in accepting spent fuel from \nutilities. In particular, the bill does not include authority to take \ntitle to spent fuel at reactor sites, which my Administration believes \nwould have offered a practical near-term solution to address the \ncontractual obligation to utilities and minimize the potential for \nlengthy and costly proceedings against the Federal Government. Instead, \nthe bill would impose substantial new requirements on the Department of \nEnergy without establishing sufficient funding mechanisms to meet those \nobligations. In effect, these requirements would create new unfunded \nliabilities for the Department.\n  My Administration remains committed to resolving the complex and \nimportant issue of nuclear waste disposal in a timely and sensible \nmanner consistent with sound science and protection of public health, \nsafety, and the environment. We have made considerable progress in the \nscientific evaluation of the Yucca Mountain site and the Department of \nEnergy is close to completing the work needed for a decision. It is \ncritical that we develop the capability to permanently dispose of spent \nnuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, and I believe we are on \na path to do that. Unfortunately, the bill passed by the Congress does \nnot advance these basic goals.\n                                                  William J.

Santos began living and farming on the \n     Dededo lot in 1992, citing the fact that the government had \n     not used the land in many year; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. military and then the Federal Government \n     issued notice to Angel L.G. Santos to vacate the lot, and in \n     1993 the federal government sought and was granted federal \n     court injunction to keep him form the lot; and\n       Whereas, a concrete house built by Angel L.G. Santos on the \n     lot was destroyed by the Federal Government after the Federal \n     Court injunction was granted in 1993, but in 1999 Angel L.G. \n     Santos gave notice to the U.S. military that he would again \n     live on the lot as an act of civil disobedience protesting \n     the resistance of the Federal Government to allow excess land \n     to be returned to the original owners and their heirs; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. District Court of Guam sentenced Angel \n     L.G. Santos to federal prison for violating its injunction \n     against entering and using the Dededo lot and for violating \n     its order to appear in court on October 8, 1999; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government controls approximately one-\n     third of Guam's land, with 44,000 acres in its inventory of \n     which 12,000 acres is surrounded by a military fence and only \n     6,000 acres of that is actively being used by the military; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government has declared 10,000 acres \n     of land it claims in Guam as excess land and has expressed \n     its intent to return the excess land to the Government of \n     Guam, but resists the Government of Guam's expressed intent \n     in local law to return the excess Federal land to the \n     original landowners and their heirs; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government's holding of 44,000 acres \n     of Guam land, more than 30,000 acres of which have never been \n     developed, serves to stifle the Island's economy by not \n     allowing private land owners to develop, farm, or profit from \n     the land, by not allowing the local government to tax the \n     land, and by making land more scarce and more expensive, and \n     thereby driving up the cost of other goods and services on \n     the Island; and\n       Whereas, the unused federal land was condemned by a \n     government not elected by the people of Guam and is withheld \n     by a Federal Government not elected by the people of Guam; \n     and\n       Whereas, Guam has been colonized and administered for \n     hundreds of years by the Spanish, the United States of \n     America, and Japan, and while the people of Guam are as \n     patriotic as any other Americans, they seek democratic self-\n     determination that has been endorsed by President William \n     Clinton in his visit to Guam in 1998; now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That I Mina'Bente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     respectfully requests that clemency be granted for Angel L.G. \n     Santos by President William Clinton, that his sentence be \n     commuted, and that he be released and returned to Guam; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That I Mina'Bente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     respectfully requests that President William Clinton return \n     all excess federal lands to the Government of Guam as \n     expeditiously as possible; and be it further\n       Resolved, That I Mina'Bente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     respectfully requests that the United States Congress allow \n     all excess federal lands returned to the Government of Guam \n     to be disposed of as the local government determines, \n     including but not limited to the return of the land to \n     original landowners and their heirs when possible; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Speaker certify to and the Legislative \n     Secretary attest the adoption hereof and that copies of the \n     same be thereafter transmitted to the President of the United \n     States; to the President of the United States Senate; to the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives; to the \n     Secretary General of the United Nations; to the National \n     Organization for the Advancement of Chamour People; to \n     amnesty International; to Attorney Antonio Cortez; to \n     Rosaline Roberto Salas; to the Guam Congressional Delegate; \n     and to the Honorable Carl T.C.

Kristensen wrote to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service Regional Director on November 17, 1992, stating \n     concerns regarding ``the possibility of untenable restriction \n     on the military mission that could be created . . . which \n     could lead to significant limitation on the Department of \n     Defense Activities Perceived in the Future is incompatible \n     with Refuge operations.''; and\n       Whereas, the limitations on Guam's development, commercial \n     flights, basic Island infrastructure, financial arrangements, \n     original landowners and economic activity that would be \n     forced by a ``Critical Habitat'' designation would be without \n     significant evidence and scientific data showing that the \n     designation would in anyway be necessary for the continued \n     survival of any species; now therefore, be it\n       Resolved. That I MinaBente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     does hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, respectfully \n     request that the United States Department of Interior not \n     allow the designation of land on Guam as ``Critical \n     Habitat''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That I MinaBente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     does hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, respectfully \n     request that the Congress of the United States of America not \n     allow the designation of land on Guam as ``Critical \n     Habitat''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Speaker certify, and the Legislative \n     Secretary attests to, the adoption hereof and that copies of \n     the same be thereafter transmitted to the Honorable William \n     Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States of America; \n     to the Honorable Albert Gore, Jr., President of the United \n     States Senate; to the Honorable J.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to prescription drug \n     coverage for Medicare beneficiaries; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 7\n\n       Whereas, although Medicare provides important health \n     insurance for older Americans, its coverage is not \n     comprehensive, requires substantial cost-sharing for many \n     covered services, and does not cover prescription drugs; and\n       Whereas, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) \n     recently published a brief entitled ``Out-Of-Pocket Health \n     Spending by Medicare Beneficiaries Age 65 and Older: 1999 \n     Projections'' and revealed that Medicare beneficiaries age \n     sixty-five and older were projected to spend an average of \n     $2,430 or nineteen percent of income; out-of-pocket for \n     health care in 1999; and\n       Whereas, prescription drugs account for the single largest \n     component of out-of-pocket spending on health care after \n     premium payment; and\n       Whereas, on average, beneficiaries are expected to spend as \n     much out-of-pocket for prescription drugs as for physician \n     care, vision services, and medical supplies combined; and\n       Whereas, in many cases, prescription drugs have proven to \n     be more effective, more convenient, and less expensive than \n     alternatives such as surgery or hospitalization; and\n       Whereas, the nation is currently engaged in a debate about \n     how to provide prescription drug coverage to Medicare \n     beneficiaries, the vast majority of whom are age sixty-five \n     and over; and\n       Whereas, while about two-thirds of all Medicare \n     beneficiaries already have some form of prescription drug \n     coverage, many low-income seniors do not; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of Louisiana believes that all \n     seniors who need prescription drugs should have access to \n     them. Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to adopt a \n     program which will provide prescription drug coverage to \n     Medicare beneficiaries. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-465. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Minnesota relative to Americans who may be held \n     against their will in North Korea, China, Russia, and \n     Vietnam; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                            Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, United States satellite and spy plane photos show \n     names and rescue codes of missing servicemen spelled out on \n     the ground in Vietnam and Laos; and\n       Whereas, such rescue codes are constructed exactly as the \n     missing men were taught should they ever be captured; and\n       Whereas, the executive branch of the United States \n     government has declined to follow the unanimous \n     recommendation of the Senate Select POW/MIA committee to make \n     a by-name request of the government of Vietnam regarding the \n     fate of an individual associated with a June 5, 1992, symbol \n     at a Vietnamese prison; and\n       Whereas, the executive branch has steadfastly refused a \n     unanimous recommendation from the same committee to create an \n     imagery review task force to look for other symbols from \n     prisoners; and\n       Whereas, intelligence indicates a group of live American \n     prisoners held in North Korea; and\n       Whereas, intelligence reports indicate the presence of \n     American POWs held in North Korea, China, Russia, and \n     Vietnam; and\n       Whereas, the United States government has rebuffed \n     overtures from Vietnam and North Korea regarding the release \n     of live American POWs; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Minnesota, That \n     it urges the President and the Congress of the United States \n     to take whatever action is necessary to obtain the release of \n     Americans who may be held against their will in North Korea, \n     China, Russia, and Vietnam. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State of the State of \n     Minnesota is directed to prepare copies of this memorial and \n     transmit them to the President of the United States, the \n     President and the Secretary of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker and the Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and Minnesota's Senators and Representatives \n     in Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 331\n\n       Whereas, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     is required to submit a report to the U.S. Congress under the \n     Bevill Amendment of 1980, otherwise known as the Bevill \n     Regulatory Determination for Fossil Fuel Combustion Wastes; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Bevill Regulatory Determination requires the \n     USEPA to ``conduct a detailed and comprehensive study and \n     submit a report on the adverse effects on human health and \n     environment, if any, of the disposal and utilization of fly \n     ash waste, bottom ash waste, slag waste, flue gas emission \n     control waste, and other by-product materials generated \n     primarily from other combustion of coal or other fossil \n     fuels''; and\n       Whereas, The USEPA has studied this issue since 1981 and in \n     1993 decided that these coal combustion wastes do not pose a \n     threat to human health and the environment under current \n     disposal practices; and\n       Whereas, The new USEPA report may recommend that coal ash \n     be classified as a hazardous waste; and\n       Whereas, Illinois is a coal-producing state and a \n     determination that coal ash is a hazardous waste would \n     inhibit the sales of Illinois coal; and\n       Whereas, Coal is used in a number of industrial processes \n     by major employers and is a vital component of the Illinois \n     industrial fuel mix; and\n       Whereas, Coal ash can be a useful by-product of coal \n     combustion and can be incorporated in a number of products \n     such as gypsum board, roof shingles, abrasives, and fluid \n     fill material and classifying coal ash as a hazardous waste \n     would seriously damage recycling efforts and the business \n     economy associated with these products; and\n       Whereas, Illinois derives nearly half of its energy needs \n     from coal-fired power plants and further hindering their \n     operations could compromise the realiaibility of the electric \n     system; and\n       Whereas, Illinois coal-fired power plants would be put at a \n     competitive disadvantage if the Bevill Determination were to \n     recommend that coal ash be classified a hazardous waste; \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Ninety-first General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we urge the USEPA to \n     refrain from classifying coal ash as a hazardous waste; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to Vice President Al Gore, USEPA Director Carol \n     Browner, and every member of the Illinois congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-466.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 in order to \nprohibit any regulatory impediments to completely and accurately \nfulfilling the sufficiency of support mandates of the national \nstatutory policy of universal service, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                     universal service support act\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Universal \nService Support Act, a bill that will spur increased access to \ncommunications services for rural America. Just a few short years ago, \nwe took the dramatic step of reshaping our nation's communications \npolicy by passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996. A significant \nelement of that initiative was the codification of a reconstituted \npolicy of universal service, which guarantees all Americans with the \nability to access to quality communications services.\n  Nevertheless, a significant impediment to the fulfillment of this \nnational policy exists. There currently exist two regulatory caps that \nare limiting the amount of support that can be directed to high-cost \ninfrastructure deployment initiatives that are covered under the 1996 \nAct.\n  The regulatory caps were first instituted in 1994 at a time when a \nsignificant number of communications infrastructure acquisitions were \ntaking place. This was in the days prior to the 1996 Act, which \ninitiated competition and deregulation into the communications \nindustry. Many of the acquisitions of that time involved the rural \nexchanges of large incumbent local exchange carriers that were \ndivesting themselves of properties deemed to be unprofitable or \notherwise undesirable. The entities purchasing such exchanges were \ngenerally the small rural cooperative and commercial systems that have \nserved large portions of the nation's rural areas for years.\n  The Federal Communications Commission instituted these caps because\n\n[[Page S3024]]\n\nthe acquiring carriers were seeking support for these newly acquired \nexchanges in order to upgrade them to the standards of the day. \nGenerally this meant that universal service support was being sought \nand approved for areas which had never before received such support. \nThe FCC was concerned that the level of support might escalate and in \nresponse it imposed both a cap on individual areas and also on the \noverall support channeling through the system. While waivers to the \ncaps were occasionally granted, for all intents and purposes growth of \nuniversal service support other than for the addition of new lines was \neffectively halted.\n  However, shortly thereafter the 1996 Act was enacted, which radically \nchanged this nation's telecommunications landscape. The Act envisioned \nan evolving universal service support system which would help ensure \nthe deployment of advanced services. The regulatory caps are at odds \nwith this policy and must be repealed.\n  We cannot permit regulatory policies that are so clearly inconsistent \nwith statutory policy to stand unchallenged. A national, statutory \npolicy dedicated to universal communications service exists, and we can \nno longer allow inappropriate regulatory actions to undermine its \nintent. I urge my colleagues to join me in moving this initiative \nforward to passage prior to the end of this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 2477. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to provide \nadditional safeguards for beneficiaries with representative payees \nunder the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program or the \nSupplemental Security Income program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFICIARIES PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich would make Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits \nmisused by organizational representative payees, whole. While most \npeople receive their Social Security and Supplemental Security Income \nbenefit payments directly, others must have assistance in money \nmanagement. Benefits, totaling over $25 billion, to these people are \npaid through representative payees who receive and manage the payments \non behalf of the beneficiaries. Representative payee responsibilities \ninclude, but are not limited to, frequently monitoring the \nbeneficiary's current well-being for food, shelter, clothing, medical \ncare, and personal needs; informing the Social Security Administration \nof changes in the representative payee's own circumstances that would \naffect the performance of representative payee services; reporting \nevents to the Social Security Administration that may affect the \nbeneficiary's entitlement or amount of benefits; and submitting an \nannual accounting to SSA reporting about benefits received, used, and \nconserved.\n  Currently, about 6.5 million Social Security and Supplemental \nSecurity Income program beneficiaries rely on representative payees to \nmanage their monthly benefits. SSA usually looks for a payee among the \nbeneficiary's family and friends. For others, those traditional \nnetworks of support are not available, and SSA relies on state, local, \nor community sources to fill the need. Family members serve as \nrepresentative payees for about 88 percent of the beneficiaries \nrequiring them. 45,050 organizations, such as institutions, government \nagencies, financial organizations, and qualified fee-for-service \norganizations, serve as payees for the other 12 percent, totaling \n750,570 beneficiaries.\n  As Chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, I am especially \nconcerned about the 795,060 beneficiaries, age 62 and over, who are \nserved by representative payees. With the retirement of the baby boomer \ngeneration on the horizon, the number of institutions, such as nursing \nhomes, serving as payees stands to increase dramatically. Therefore, \naddressing this matter now is all the more urgent.\n  The majority of representative payees provide much-needed help to \nbeneficiaries without abusing this responsibility. A minority of payees \nmisuse their position. SSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has \nrecently investigated several instances of misuse by organizational \nrepresentative payees. One such investigation served as the subject of \na recent ``20/20'' television news program segment. In this segment, \nseveral elderly Social Security beneficiaries accused Greg Gamble, of \nthe Aurora Foundation, a former organizational payee, of using their \nbenefits for his own purposes. On March 14, 2000, Mr. Gamble entered a \nguilty plea in federal court of embezzlement of Social Security funds. \nAs part of the plea agreement, Mr. Gamble agreed to make restitution to \nSSA in the amount of $303,314.00. Although this is only one example of \nmisuse, SSA's OIG has just begun investigating several instances of \nmisuse. Since FY 1998, it has identified about $8 million in SSA \nrepresentative payee fraud loss. SSA's OIG expects the number of misuse \ncases to increase as SSA increases its review of organizational \nrepresentative payee records.\n\n  When any payee has been determined to have misused an individual's \nbenefits, SSA reassigns another payee to the beneficiary. \nUnfortunately, SSA can reissue the benefits only in cases where \nnegligent failure on SSA's part to investigate or monitor the payee \nresulted in the misuse. In virtually all other cases, the individual \nloses his or her funds unless SSA can obtain restitution, through civil \nprocesses, of the misused benefits from the payee. If SSA is able to \nrecover the misused amount, it may take years to do so. In the \nmeantime, the beneficiary has lost the amount misused and may be \ntemporarily inconvenienced, by not having money to pay rent, utilities, \nor food, until a new payee is assigned.\n  In order to prevent misuse of benefits in the future, and to provide \nbetter accountability of benefits to beneficiaries, I am introducing \nthe ``Social Security Beneficiaries Protection Act,'' along with my co-\nsponsor and Special Committee on Aging Ranking Member Senator Breaux. \nThis bipartisan bill:\n  (1) gives SSA the authority to re-issue benefits misused by \norganizational payees on its own determination (presently, benefits are \nonly re-issued when a court finds that SSA negligently failed to \ninvestigate/monitor the payee);\n  (2) requires non-governmental organizational payees to be bonded and \nlicensed (presently, there is a bonding or licensing requirement);\n  (3) requires fee forfeiture when payees misuse benefits;\n  (4) gives SSA overpayment recovery authority for benefits misused by \nnon-governmental payees; and\n  (5) extends civil monetary penalty authority to SSA (of not more than \n$5,000 per violation for misuse offenses).\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support Senator Breaux and me in \nensuring that our Nation's most vulnerable citizens, senior citizens \nand the disabled, will receive every dollar of benefits to which they \nare entitled.\n  I would also like to remind everyone that the Senate Special \nCommittee on Aging is holding a hearing on misuse of benefits by Social \nSecurity organizational representative payees Tuesday, May 2, 2000, at \n10:00 a.m. in 562 Dirksen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 2478. To require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a theme \nstudy on the peopling of America, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                THE PEOPLING OF AMERICA THEME STUDY ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, America is truly unique in that we are all \nimmigrants to the United States, coming from different regions--whether \nfrom Asia, across the Bering Sea, or from islands in the Pacific Ocean, \nor Mexico, Europe or many other regions of the world. The prehistory \nand the history of this Nation are inextricably linked to the mosaic of \nmigrations, immigrations and cultures that has resulted in the peopling \nof America. Americans are all travelers from other regions, continents \nand islands.\n  We need a better understanding of this coherent and unifying theme in \nAmerica. With this in mind, I am introducing, along with my colleague \nSenator Graham, a bill authorizing the National Park Service to conduct \na theme study on the peopling of America.\n  The purpose of the study is to provide a basis for identifying, \ninterpreting and preserving sites related to\n\n[[Page S3025]]\n\nthe migration, immigration and settling of America. The peopling of \nAmerica is the story of our Nation's population and how we came to be \nthe diverse set of people that are today. The peopling of America will \nacknowledge the diverse set of people that we are today. The peopling \nof America will acknowledge the first migrants who settled the North \nAmerican continent, the Pacific Islands, and the lands that later \nbecame the United States of America. The original peoples came across \nthe Bering Sea from Asia, or they arrived at our Pacific Islands across \nthousands of miles of ocean from the South Pacific and Micronesia. The \npeopling of America continued as Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch and \nEnglish laid claim to lands and opened the floodgates of European \nmigration and the involuntary migration of slaves from Africa.\n  This was just the beginning. America has been growing and changing \never since. The growth and change can be characterized as the movement \nof groups of people across external and internal boundaries, the \nstrength within their cultures, and the diffusion of cultural ways \nthrough the United States. The strength of American culture is in our \ndiversity and rests on a comprehensive understanding of the peopling of \nAmerica.\n  The theme study I am proposing will authorize the Secretary of the \nInterior to identify regions, areas, districts, structures and cultures \nthat illustrate and commemorate key events or decisions in the peopling \nof America, and which can provide a basis for the preservation and \ninterpretation of the peopling of America. It includes preservation and \neducation strategies to capture elements of our national culture and \nhistory such as immigration, migration, ethnicity, family, gender, \nhealth, neighborhood, and community. In addition, the study will make \nrecommendations regarding National Historic Landmark designations and \nNational Register of Historic Places nominations, as appropriate. The \nstudy will also facilitate the development of cooperative programs with \neducational institutions, public history organizations, State and local \ngovernments, and groups knowledgeable about the peopling of America.\n  Mr. President, as we enter a new century of hope and opportunity, it \nis incumbent on us to reflect on the degree to which the development of \nthe United States owes to our population diversity. Looking back, we \nunderstand that our history, and our very national character, is \ndefined by the grand, entangled progress of people to, and across the \nAmerican landscape--through exploration, colonization, the slave trade, \ntraditional immigration, or internal migration--that gave rise to the \nrich interactions that make the American experience unique.\n\n  We embody the culture and traditions that our forebears brought from \nother places and shores, as well as the new traditions and cultures \nthat we adopted or created anew upon arrival. Whether we settled in the \nrangelands and agrarian West, the industrialized Northeast, the small \ntowns of the Midwest, or the genteel cities of the South, our forebears \ninevitably formed relationships with peoples of other backgrounds and \ncultures. Our rich heritage as Americans is comprehensible only through \nthe stories of our various contituent cultures, carried with us from \nother lands and transformed by encounters with other cultures.\n  All Americans were originally travelers from other lands. Whether we \ncame to this country as native peoples, English colonists or African \nslaves, or as Mexican ranchers, or Chinese merchants, the process by \nwhich our nation was peopled transformed us from strangers from \ndifferent shores into neighbors unified in our inimitable diversity--\nAmericans all. It is essential for us to understand this process, not \nonly to understand who and where we are, but also to help us understand \nwho we wish to be and where we should be headed as a nation. As the \ncaretaker of some of our most important cultural and historical \nresources, from Ellis Island to San Juan Island, from Chaco Canyon to \nKennesaw Mountain, the National Park Service is in a unique position to \nconduct a study that can offer guidance on this fundamental subject.\n  Currently we have only one focal point in the National Park system \nthat celebrates the peopling of America with any significance. Ellis \nIsland is part of the Statute of Liberty National Monument. Ellis \nIsland welcomed over 12 million immigrants between 1892 and 1954, an \noverwhelming majority of whom crossed the Atlantic from Europe. Ellis \nIsland celebrates these immigrant experiences through their museum, \nhistoric buildings, and memorial wall. Immensely popular as it is, \nEllis Island is focused on Atlantic immigration and thus reflects the \nexperience only of those groups--primarily Eastern and Southern \nEuropean--who were processed at the island during its active period, \n1892 to 1954.\n  Not all immigrants and their descendants can identify with Ellis \nIsland. Tens of millions of other immigrants traveled to our great \ncountry through other ports of entry and in different periods of our \nNation's history and prehistory. Ellis Island only tells part of the \nAmerican story. There are other chapters, just as compelling, that must \nbe told.\n  On the west coast, Angel Island Immigration Station, tucked in San \nFrancisco Bay, was open from 1910 to 1940 and processed hundreds of \nthousands of Pacific Rim immigrants through its portals. An estimated \n175,000 Chinese immigrants and more than 20,000 Japanese made the Long \nPacific passage to the United States. Their experience are a west coast \nmirror of the Ellis Island experience. But the migration story on the \nwest coast is much longer and broader than Angel Island. Many earlier \nmigrants to the west coast contributed to the rich history of \nCalifornia, including the original resident Native Americans, Spanish \nexplorers, Mexican ranchers, Russian colonists, American migrants from \nthe Eastern states who came overland or around the Horn, German and \nIrish military recruits, Chinese railroad laborers, Portuguese and \nItalian farmers, and many other groups. The diversity and experience of \nthese groups reflects the diversity and experience of all immigrants \nwho entered the United States via the Western States, including Alaska, \nWashington, Oregon, and California.\n  The study we propose is consistent with the agency's latest official \nthematic framework which establishes the subject of human population \nmovement and change--or ``peopling places''--as a primary thematic \ncategory for study and interpretation. The framework, which serves as a \ngeneral guideline for interpretation, was revised in 1996 in response \nto a Congressional mandate (Civil War Sites Study Act of 1990, Public \nLaw 101-628, Sec. 1209) that the full diversity of American history and \nprehistory be expressed in the National Park Service's identification \nand interpretation of historic and prehistoric properties.\n  In conclusion, we believe that this bill will shed light on the \nunique blend of pluralism and unity that characterizes our national \npolity. With its responsibility for cultural and historical parks, the \nPark Service plays a unique role in enhancing our understanding of the \npeopling of America and thus of a fuller comprehension of our \nrelationships with each other--past, present, and future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2479.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a \nbill. We are going to be discussing, I hope, next week the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is \na very important act for the country, that provides the ways in which \nthe Federal Government supports our local school systems throughout the \ncountry. There are a few of us here who believe very strongly we need \nto change some of the ways we do that, to really focus on results and \nnot process, so we can stop funding failure and begin rewarding \nsuccess.\n  So I come to the floor today to introduce a bill because there are so \nmany ways we can help improve our schools. Because my time is limited, \nI cannot\n\n[[Page S3026]]\n\nlist them. But one of the ways we can do that is by helping to \nencourage good people to go into the field of teaching and to help \nraise teachers' salaries, if we can, in appropriate ways, to encourage \ngood, qualified teachers to stay in the classrooms.\n  As you know, Mr. President, we do not fund teachers' salaries \ndirectly. The bill I am introducing will provide a tax credit for those \nteachers who become nationally board certified. Currently, there are \nover 4,000 teachers who are nationally board certified. This will \nprovide a $5,000 tax credit. It is the least we can do to help \nencourage the States to continue the way they are encouraging good, \nqualified people to stay in the classroom and to help raise the \nsalaries of teachers in this Nation.\n  Just for the record, beginning teachers make $7,000 less than their \npeers, but, more tragically, teachers with a master's degree make about \n$35,000 less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2482. A bill to assist States and units of local government in \ncarrying out Safe Homes-Safe Streets programs; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                      SAFE HOMES-SAFE STREETS ACT\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nalong with Senator Lautenberg to help communities voluntarily reduce \nthe number of guns in their homes and on their streets. There are over \n200 million guns in America today. Alarmingly, that is almost one for \nevery man, woman, and child in this country. Of those 200 million guns, \n66 million are hand guns and the number of assault weapons is \nincreasing. Although statistics show a 4.7% decrease in the rate of \nfirearm-related injuries from 1996 to 1997, the rate of a firearm-\nrelated injuries is still unacceptably high.\n  More than 600,000 gun crimes are committed in the United States each \nyear. On average, approximately 200 people are wounded by guns and \napproximately 88 people are killed by guns everyday. Twelve American \nchildren, under the age of 19, are killed by guns everyday. The rate of \naccidental shooting deaths for children under the age of 15 in the \nUnited States is nine times higher than the rate of the other 25 \nindustrialized nations combined. Firearm homicides are the second \nleading cause of death for youth 15-24. Firearm suicide is the third \nleading cause of death in this age group. Handguns account for nearly \n70% of firearm suicides among all age groups. Guns kept in the home for \nself-protection are three times more likely to kill a friend or a \nrelative than an intruder.\n  The human cost of gun violence is great. Saving families from \nsenseless deaths caused by gun violence is long over due. Reducing the \nnumber of guns in our homes and in our streets is essential to curbing \ngun violence in this country.\n  In economic terms, it is estimated that the lifetime medical costs of \nthe 134,445 gunshot injuries in the United States in 1994 was $2.3 \nbillion. The average medical cost per injury was about $17,000. The \nmedical cost of gunshot injuries due to assaults was about $1.7 \nbillion. Taxpayers paid 49% or $1.1 billion of these medical costs. The \nestimated indirect costs of gunshot injuries, the value of lost \nproductivity due to fatal and non-fatal injuries, was about $19.7 \nbillion in 1994.\n  There are also non-economic costs which include pain and suffering of \nthe survivors, the fear which inevitably permeates all strata of \nsociety, the societal and emotional stress on both adults and children, \nand the influence gun related violence can have on a community.\n  The multiple costs of gun-related injuries--the human cost, the \neconomic cost, and the non-economic cost--amount to an exceedingly \ncostly epidemic and make finding a solution to gun violence a top \npriority. Unfortunately, there is no single cure for this disease. \nHowever, voluntary gun reduction programs that provide a means to \nreducing the number of weapons on the streets and in children's homes \nare an important step to creating safe and healthy environments.\n\n  That is why I have introduced the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act of \n2000. The purpose of this Act is to voluntarily reduce the number of \nguns in circulation by aiding State and local law enforcement \ndepartments that wish to conduct gun reduction programs to create safer \nhomes and safer streets.\n  Under the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act, law enforcement officials \nwould be permitted to--\n  (1) accept voluntary surrender of firearms from individuals seeking \nto dispose of them;\n  (2) provide gift certificates or other goods in exchange for \nfirearms;\n  (3) provide cash in exchange for firearms, in a value not to exceed a \npercentage of the estimated cost of a new firearm of the same type; or\n  (4) use any other innovative approach to encourage a voluntary \nreduction in the number of firearms in local communities.\n  This legislation would authorize $15 million for grants to States or \nlocal units of government to conduct these programs.\n  A program may include a criminal background check regarding the \nownership of each firearm or may offer amnesty from such background \nchecks, provided that the policy regarding criminal background checks \nis uniformly applied. Whenever any firearm is surrendered under this \nAct, State or local units of government shall inquire whether such \nfirearm is needed as evidence. If the surrendered gun is not needed as \nevidence, it shall be destroyed --thus preventing the potential \nrecycling of guns and possible illegal use. Any firearm that is a curio \nor relic or that has historic significance shall be donated to a State \nor local museum for display.\n  Safe Homes-Safe Streets programs would provide an excellent way for \ncommunities to draw attention to the problem of gun violence, which is \nfueled by the widespread, easy availability of firearms. Gun reduction \nprograms under the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act would also serve as a \ncatalyst for local communities and neighborhood organizations to work \nwith law enforcement in a collaborative manner. Moreover, gun reduction \nprograms under the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act would encourage citizens \nto become more involved in the fight against gun violence.\n  Most importantly, the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act would eliminate \ntens of thousands of guns from our homes and streets. With fewer guns \nin American homes, fewer guns can fall into the wrong hands and fewer \nguns can be used for crime or suicide. It makes no difference if older \nor newer guns are collected in the programs because all guns are \npotentially lethal and can be fired accidentally. Guns kept in the home \nfor self-protection are three times more likely to kill a friend or a \nrelative than an intruder. Safe Homes-Safe Streets programs would help \nstop violence before it occurs.\n  On their own volition, some communities have launched successful gun \nreduction programs to help rid themselves of guns and reduce the \nsenseless violence in their daily lives. Many communities have \nimplemented gun buyback programs; however, other communities have taken \na more innovative approach to address the circulation of illegal guns \non their streets. For example, in California and in my hometown of \nSpringfield, Illinois, law enforcement officials have implemented the \n``Stop Gun Violence Reward Program.'' Under the ``Stop Gun Violence \nReward Program,'' citizens are encouraged to anonymously and \nconfidentially call the CrimeStoppers hotline when handguns are seen in \npublic places. An officer is then dispatched to investigate the \ncompliant. If an illegal gun is recovered in a public place, the caller \nreceives a $100 cash reward. If the gun is stolen, it is returned to \nits rightful owner. If the gun is not needed as evidence, it is \ndestroyed. With federal assistance, more communities would be empowered \nto voluntarily help reduce the number of potentially lethal firearms in \ntheir homes and on their streets--helping to create safer homes and \nsafer streets.\n  Moreover, the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act would help communities \nincrease awareness of gun violence and gun possession; reduce the \nnumber of accidents and domestic violence with guns; reduce the \navailability of highly lethal weapons in the short term; reduce the \nlethality of crimes committed; enhance community solidarity; enhance \ncommunity-police relations; and reduce the taxing medical cost of gun-\nrelated injuries. The benefits of\n\n[[Page S3027]]\n\nthe Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act--legislation facilitating a voluntary \nreduction of the number of guns in circulation--is clear.\n  The Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act would help create safer homes and \nsafer streets for our families. Several organizations, including \nIllinois Council Against Hand Gun Violence, Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, Illinois Education Association, National Education \nAssociation, The Bell Campaign, and the American Public Health \nAssociation, have already recognized the need for legislation calling \nfor a voluntary reduction of the number of firearms in circulation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Lautenberg in taking \nsteps to cure the deadly epidemic of gun violence by supporting and \ncosponsoring the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2482\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $15,000,000 for each fiscal year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2483. A bill to provide for the eligibility of small business \nconcerns owned and controlled by women for assistance under the mentor-\nprotege program of the Department of Defense; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n    INCLUDE WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES IN THE DoD MENTOR-PROTEGE PROGRAM\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and the \nChairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, to \nintroduce a bill that will enhance an already successful program and \nhave a significant impact on women owned businesses. The purpose of the \nSnowe-Warner bill is to include women-owned businesses as eligible \nparticipants in the Department of Defense's Mentor-Protege Program.\n  In 1990, the Congress established the DoD Mentor-Protege Pilot \nProgram to provide incentives for major defense contractors to furnish \ndisadvantaged small business concerns with assistance. That act also \nestablished a participation goal of 5% for those small disadvantaged \nbusinesses; however, women-owned businesses were not covered under that \nlegislation.\n  The overall results of that legislation were impressive. According to \nthe GAO, from Fiscal Year 1992 through Fiscal Year 1998, appropriated \nmentor-protege funding of about $233 million was obligated through \ncooperative agreements, separate contracts, or line items in DOD \ncontracts. And, according to the Department of Defense, between 1994 \nand 1997 there was a net gain of 3,342 jobs within protege firms; there \nwas a net revenue gain in excess of $276 million within the protege \nfirms; and mentors reported an additional $695 million in subcontract \nawards to small disadvantaged businesses during this period. So, \nclearly, our legislation had a beneficial impact on the hundreds of \nsmall and disadvantaged businesses that now have the opportunity to \ncompete and win Defense contracts under this program.\n  Then, in 1994, we passed Public Law 103-355, otherwise known as the \nFederal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, which, among other \nprovisions, amended Section 15 of the Small Business Act to establish a \n5% annual goal for women-owned business enterprise participation in \nfederal prime contracts and subcontracts. The Act also amended Section \n8 of the Small Business Act to give women-owned businesses equal \nstanding with small and small disadvantaged businesses in the \nsubcontracting plans of federal prime contractors.\n  And, again, the results were significant. In Fiscal Year 1997 the \ngovernment reported that women-owned businesses received 2.5% ($5.6 \nbillion) of the $225 billion prime and subcontract dollars spent, up \nfrom 1.3% in Fiscal Year 1991 when data by gender was first collected. \nAnd in the latest data from Fiscal Year 1999, women-owned businesses \naccounted for 2.42% or $4.6 billion of the total $190 billion federal \ncontract dollars. The percentage of Federal agencies that awarded at \nleast 5% of their prime contract dollars to women-owned businesses was \n37.9% in Fiscal Year 1997, up from 20.4% in Fiscal Year 1987.\n  In Fiscal Year 1997 some 5,722 women-owned businesses were involved \nin 446,332 federal prime contract actions amounting to $3.3 billion \nwhile another $2.3 billion was awarded to women-owned businesses in \nsubcontract actions. At that time, women-owned businesses comprised \n8.3% of Federal prime contractors, were involved in 4.1% of the prime \ncontract actions and received 2.1% of Federal prime contract awards.\n\n  Why is this important? Women-owned federal contractors own much more \nsubstantial enterprises than the typical woman-owned firm. The average \nnumber of employees in women-owned federal contractor firms was 52.2 \ncompared to just 2.3 among all full-time women-owned firms. Women-owned \nfirms involved in Federal procurement have, on average, 1,742% higher \nsales and employ 23 times more employees than the average woman-owned \nfirm.\n\n[[Page S3028]]\n\n  Despite the resounding success of these initiatives, I must ask the \nquestion, ``Are we there yet?'' Not quite. Although all Executive \nBranch departments operate Mentor-Protege programs, the three agencies, \nDefense, Energy, and GSA, that account for the most contract dollars \nhave never met the 5 percent goal. While Defense, the largest federal \npurchaser, provided $2.3 billion or 50% of all federal contracts going \nto women-owned businesses in Fiscal Year 1999, that amount represented \nonly 1.92% of total Defense contracts.\n  The other two agencies together provided 16.4% of all federal \ncontracts to women-owned businesses in fiscal year 1999 but, again, \nthat funding only represented 3.1% of their combined contract funding. \nOf the three agencies, the GSA came closest to meeting the 5% goal with \n4.75% of its contract dollars going to women-owned firms.\n  Some agencies, however, are doing very well at meeting the 5% goal. \nHousing and Urban Development sent 14.95% of its 1999 contracts to \nwomen-owned businesses, Veteran's Affairs sent 5.59%, and \nappropriately, the Small Business Administration spent 15.29% of their \ncontract dollars at women-owned firms.\n  Mr. President, women-owned businesses are capable of doing more and \nthey want to do more. Surveys indicate that when asked if the \navailability of mentor-protege programs would make them more interested \nin entering the government procurement market, 33% of women business \nowners responded favorably. Similarly, 30% of women with businesses \nmore than 20 years old were among those most interested in taking part \nin a mentor-protege program.\n  When Section 831 of Public Law 101-510 establishing the DoD Mentor-\nProtege Pilot Program to provide incentives for major defense \ncontractors to furnish disadvantaged small business concerns with \nassistance was drafted, it defined disadvantaged small business \nconcerns as those owned and controlled by socially and economically \ndisadvantaged individuals, Indian tribes, Hawaiians and those that \nemploy the severely disabled. It did not specifically provide for the \nparticipation by women-owned businesses, those firms that are at least \n51% owned and whose management and daily business operations are \ncontrolled by one or more women.\n  Mr. President, very simply, this bill will correct that, and I, \ntherefore, urge my colleagues in the Senate to support the passage of \nthe Snowe-Warner bill that allows us to forge two pieces good \nlegislation into one better piece of legislation that benefits American \nbusiness women and, by extension, America.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nMaine as a sponsor of this very important piece of legislation that \nwould allow women-owned businesses to participate in the Department of \nDefense (DOD) mentor protege program.\n  Since 1990, the mentor protege program has provided small \ndisadvantaged businesses increased opportunity to compete for federal \ncontracts. The program accomplishes this by providing incentives to \nmajor defense contractors to assist qualified small business to enhance \ntheir abilities to compete as contractors on DOD contracts. The mentor-\nprotege program does not guarantee contracts to anyone. Instead, it is \ndesigned to equip participants with the knowledge and expertise that \nthey need to win such contracts on their own, in the competitive market \nplace.\n  The mentor protege program has been an important tool to help achieve \nthe goal--established by Congress in 1987--that DOD increase to five \npercent the total value of contracts and subcontracts awarded to small \ndisadvantaged businesses. This has been a remarkable success story. For \nthe past six years, the DOD has exceeded this 5% goal.\n  In 1994, a similar goal was set for the DOD to award five percent of \nits annual contracts to women-owned businesses. While women-owned \nbusiness participation in defense contracting has increased since 1994, \nwe are still, however, well below the 5% goal. It seems appropriate to \nprovide DOD with additional tools to assist in meeting this goal. \nProviding women-owned businesses the opportunity to participate in the \nmentor protege program will be a big step forward in expanding federal \ncontracting opportunities for these businesses.\n  I want to thank Senator Snowe for her leadership on this issue and \nher work on behalf of women-owned businesses around the country. I urge \nswift passage of this legislation to enhance the opportunity for women-\nowned businesses to compete for, and win, DOD contracts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself, and Mr. Coverdell):\n  S. 2484. A bill to ensure that immigrant students and their families \nreceive the services that the students and families need to \nsuccessfully participated in elementary schools, secondary schools, and \ncommunities, in the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  THE IMMIGRANTS TO NEW AMERICANS ACT\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, there are an estimated 2.3 million \nforeign-born school children living in the U.S. today and more are \narriving daily. This is placing increasing demands on our nation's \nschools and community organizations to help these newly arrived \nchildren and their families with becoming successful in America's \nschools and communities.\n  These children began arriving here in large numbers in the 1990s in a \nwave of immigration that is rivaling the first and second waves of \nGerman, Irish, Polish and Scandinavian immigrants who arrived here in \nthe late 1800s and early 1900s. Like those who have preceded them, our \nnation's newest immigrants have a strong desire to succeed in their new \nfound homeland. Our challenge is to provide them with the support and \nservices they need to achieve to high standards in our schools--and \nbeyond--and in so doing we will all be the beneficiaries.\n  The wave of immigrants settling into communities all across America \nis resulting in a significant increase in children with diverse \nlinguistic and cultural backgrounds enrolling in our schools. For \nexample, the Waterloo, Iowa school system is being challenged to teach \n400 Bosnian refugee children who came here without knowing our \nlanguage, culture or customs. Schools in Wausau, Wisconsin are filled \nwith Asian children wanting to achieve success in the United States. In \nDalton, Georgia, 47% of the student population in the public schools \nare Mexican children eager to participate in their new schools and \ncommunity. In Turner, Maine, the school-aged children of hundreds of \nrecently arrived Mexican immigrant families are pouring into this rural \ntown's schools.\n  As these examples illustrate, the foreign-born, school-aged children \nliving in our nation today constitute an increasingly significant \nportion of the population, not just in communities accustomed to large \nimmigrant populations like New York, Los Angeles and Miami, but also \nnon-traditional immigrant communities like Gainesville, Georgia and \nFremont County, Idaho. According to recently released estimates, this \ntrend will continue. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the recently \narrived immigrant and refugee populations living here today will \naccount for 75% of the total U.S. population growth over the next 50 \nyears. U.S. schools from Florida to Washington State are being \nincreasingly challenged by these changing demographics. As Secretary of \nEducation Richard Riley recently said, ``dealing with this kind of \nchange requires creative thinking and an eagerness to adopt and to \nincorporate cultural and linguistic differences into the learning \nprocess.''\n  We need to make sure that these children are served appropriately--\nand that their families are as well. Studies have shown that where \nquality educational programs are joined with community-based services, \nimmigrants have an increased opportunity to become an integral part of \ntheir community and their children are better prepared to achieve \nsuccess in school.\n  The recent influx of immigrants into U.S. communities calls for \ninnovative and comprehensive solutions. Today, I am joined by my \ndistinguished colleague from Georgia, Senator Paul Coverdell, in \nintroducing the Immigrants to New Americans Act. This legislation would \nestablish a competitive grant program within the Department\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\nof Education to assist these school systems and communities that are \nexperiencing a high number of immigrant families. Specifically, this \nnew grant program would provide funding to partnerships of local \nschool districts and community-based organizations for the development \nof model programs that assist immigrant children to achieve in U.S. \nschools and that provide services like parenting skills to their \nfamilies as well as access to comprehensive community services, \nincluding health care, child care, job training and transportation.\n\n  Senator Coverdell and I have both seen first hand the benefits of one \ncommunity's program that brings togther teachers, community leaders and \nbusinesses in an innovative partnership to aid their linguistically and \nculturally diverse population. It is the Georgia Project and its \nmission is to assist immigrant children from Mexico achieve to higher \nstandards in Dalton, Georgia's public schools.\n  In recent years, the carpet and poultry industries in Dalton and \nsurrounding Whitfield County experienced the need for a larger \nworkforce. The city's visionary leaders encouraged Mexican immigrants \nto settle into their community to fill that need. The challenge has \nbeen in Dalton's public school system where Hispanic enrollment went \nfrom being just 4 percent ten years ago to over 47 percent today.\n  To deal with this sizable increase, Dalton and Whitfield County \npublic school administrators and business leaders formed a public-\nprivate consortium. This consortium, known as The Georgia Project, \ninitiated a teacher exchange program in 1996 with the University of \nMonterrey in Mexico. Today, seventeen Mexican teachers are helping to \nbridge the language and culture gap by serving as instructors, \ncounselors and role models and providing Spanish language training to \nEnglish-speaking students. In addition, Dalton Public School teachers \nspend a month in Monterrey, Mexico, each year learning first hand the \nculture, language and customs of the Mexican students they serve.\n  There are other programs across the United States that address \nsimilar challenges experienced by the City of Dalton and Whitfield \nCounty. One such example is the Lao Family Project. This is a \ncommunity-based refugee assistance organization that provides a wide \nrange of parent-student services to Hmong and Vietnamese refugees in \nSt. Paul, Minnesota in an effort to help parents become economically \nself-sufficient and their children succeed in school. The Lao Family \nProject's staff are bilingual/bicultural paraprofessionals who provide \nservices that include adult English as a second language instruction \nand preschool literacy activities for children.\n  In the rural communities of Healdsburg and Windsor, California, the \nEven Start program provides a variety of instructional and support \nservices to low-income, recently arrived Mexican immigrant families and \ntheir preschool and elementary school children. The program focuses on \nincreasing family involvement in their children's education, helping \nparents and children with their literacy skills, and offering English \nas a second language course. Many of the instructional activities for \nthe parent's classes are coordinated with the classroom teachers to \nensure consistency with what is being taught to both the parent and \ntheir children. One focus of these classes is to communicate what the \nchildren are learning in their regular classes so that parents can help \ntheir children at home.\n  The Exemplary Multicultural Practices in Rural Education Program, or \nEMPIRE, operates in the Yakima region of rural Central Washington \nState, an area with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, including \nCaucasians, Hispanics, Native Americans, African Americans, and Asian \nAmericans. The program promotes positive race relations and an \nappreciation for ethnic and cultural differences. It encourages schools \nto develop learning environments where children of all backgrounds can \nbe successful in school and the community. With support from EMPIRE's \nboard of advisors, each school designs and carries out its own projects \nbased on local resources and needs. Schools in which EMPIRE is active \nplan a wide variety of programs and activities with emphasis on staff \ndevelopment, student awareness, parent involvement and improvement of \ncurriculum and instruction.\n  The Immigrants to New Americans Act is endorsed by the National \nAssociation for Bilingual Education, The National Council of La Raza, \nthe League of United Latin American Citizens, the India Abroad Center \nfor Political Awareness, and the National Korean American Service and \nEducation Consortium.\n  I would like to close with the words of Education Secretary Richard \nRiley: ``Regardless of the cultural diversity of our nation's students, \nthere is one unifying factor in their lives, education, the primary and \nshared source of hope, opportunity and success. It is our duty as a \nnation to ensure that every ethnically diverse community has the \nopportunity to achieve a quality education and the success that \naccompanies it--just as we have done for generations of Americans \nbefore them.''\n  Our nation's communities are being transformed by the diverse culture \nof their citizens. Successfully addressing this change will require \nleadership, creative thinking and an eagerness to encourage and promote \nthe promise that these new challenges bring. By doing so, we as a \nnation will better serve all our children--the best guarantee we have \nof ensuring America's strength, well into the 21st century and beyond.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print their letters of \nsupport in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          National Association for\n\n\n                                          Bilingual Education,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 19, 2000.\n     Hon. Max Cleland,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cleland: On behalf of the National Association \n     for Bilingual Education, I wish to commend you on your \n     introduction of legislation to help ensure that immigrant \n     students and their families will receive the services that \n     they require in our schools and communities.\n       America's rapidly changing demographics make it imperative \n     that adequate services be available to our nation's \n     newcomers, so that they too will attain the American dream \n     and help make our country stronger. Your bill clearly \n     recognizes the contributions that immigrants have made to the \n     United States over its history, and takes a definitive step \n     forward in the spirit of empowerment through education and \n     community-based collaboration.\n       NABE strongly believes that given the appropriate tools and \n     support students will rise to the highest of levels of \n     achievement. Our endorsement of this forward-thinking \n     legislation is a reaffirmation of this philosophy, and we \n     hope your colleagues in Congress will grant it prompt \n     approval.\n       Once again, I commend you on the introduction of this \n     important piece of legislation, and I ask that you not \n     hesitate to contact me at (202) 898-1829 if there is anything \n     NABE can do to help your efforts in this respect.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Delia Pompa,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Council of La Raza,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2000.\n     Senator Max Cleland,\n     Senate Dirksen Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cleland: The National Council of La Raza \n     (NCLR) thanks you for your effort to facilitate and enhance \n     the participation of immigrants in American society. In \n     particular, we would like to express our support for your \n     legislation, the ``Immigrants to New Americans Act,'' which \n     would provide education, adult English as a Second Language \n     (ESL), job training, and other important services to \n     immigrants in ``emerging'' communities.\n       Over the past decade, dramatic shifts have occurred in the \n     immigrant population in the United States, particularly among \n     Hispanic immigrants. Many Hispanic immigrants have settled in \n     areas where their presence had previously been virtually \n     invisible. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau determined \n     that the South (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, \n     Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee) \n     experienced a 93% increase in its Hispanic population from \n     1990 to 1998, far outpacing growth in ``traditional'' \n     Hispanic states like California, New York, and Texas, where \n     increases hovered around 32%. While the U.S. Census Bureau \n     estimated the total Hispanic population in the South in 1998 \n     to be 640,870, unofficial estimates place the Hispanic \n     population of both Georgia and North Carolina at close to \n     500,000 in each state. Midwestern states have also \n     experienced significant increases in their Hispanic \n     populations during this period, such as Iowa (74%), Minnesota \n     (61%), and Nebraska (96%). Many of these Hispanics are \n     immigrants in search of employment.\n       The emergence of new immigrant populations has created a \n     significant need for\n\n[[Page S3030]]\n\n     educational and social services. The search for employment \n     opportunities has historically been the primary impetus for \n     the migration of immigrants. An ever-increasing availability \n     of permanent employment has provided the opportunity for many \n     immigrants to settle with their spouses and children, often \n     in areas where previously there had been seasonal \n     agricultural work available. However, these opportunities \n     have largely been in unskilled or low-skilled, low-paying \n     jobs, such as the textile, poultry, and construction \n     industries in the South; meat- and vegetable-packing in the \n     Midwest; and light manufacturing and service-sector work in \n     major cities like New York City, Los Angeles, and Houston. As \n     these new immigrant populations form permanent settlements, \n     they often face social isolation and disconnection from \n     mainstream society.\n       Emerging immigrant communities face a multitude of issues \n     in adapting to their new environment. Among the needs \n     identified in these communities are access to rigorous \n     standards-based curriculum in the public schools, effective \n     parental involvement in their children's education, adult \n     English-language acquisition programs, quality child care, \n     and employment and training. Your legislation would help \n     local communities to provide services in each of these \n     critical areas.\n       NCLR believes that the ``Immigrants to New Americans Act'' \n     can have a significant, positive impact on the lives of many \n     immigrant children and families, and on the communities in \n     which they are settling. That is why we strongly support your \n     legislation and encourage the entire Congress to do the same.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Raul Yzaguirre,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            League of United Latin\n\n\n                                            American Citizens,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2000.\n     Hon.

We would like to strongly support your \n     legislation, ``The Immigrants to New Americans Act.''\n       We believe that this act will greatly enhance the ability \n     for schools and community-based services to develop model \n     programs aimed at helping immigrant students and their \n     families to receive the tools that they need to succeed.\n       We find that this closely supports our mission and beliefs \n     that immigrants should be supported in any way possible. \n     LULAC is the oldest and largest Latino civil rights \n     organization in the United States. LULAC advances the \n     economic condition, educational attainment, political \n     influence, health and civil rights of Hispanic Americans \n     through community-based programs operating at more than 700 \n     LULAC Councils nationwide.\n       Once again, thank you for putting forth this effort to help \n     those who need a little help getting started in this country. \n     Your legislation will help to carry this country in a \n     positive way well into the 21st century.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Brent Wilkes,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The India Abroad Center\n\n\n                                      for Political Awareness,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 2000.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I rise to offer a Senate resolution \ndesignating May each year as the Month for Children. Children are our \nnation's future, and it is important that we recognize the significant \ncontributions that children make to their homes, schools and \ncommunities. Unfortunately, we continue to be plagued by school \nviolence that is devastating our communities. Furthermore, parents who \nare struggling to make ends meet find themselves with less time to \ncommit to their children. It is imperative that we as a society \nrededicate ourselves to exalting our children--supporting their efforts \nto succeed and providing positive role-models for them today and in the \nfuture. We must show that we care for them, and in their honor, I \nsubmit this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3032-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 299--TO MAKE TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO THE STANDING \n                          RULES OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 300\n\n       Whereas the month of April has been designated National \n     Child Abuse Prevention Month, an annual tradition initiated \n     by former President Jimmy Carter in 1979;\n       Whereas the most recent government figures show that over \n     1,000,000 children were victims of abuse and neglect in 1997, \n     causing unspeakable pain and suffering to our most vulnerable \n     citizens;\n       Whereas among the children who are victims of abuse and \n     neglect, more than 3 children die each day in this country;\n       Whereas the rate of child fatalities has risen by 37 \n     percent between 1985 and 1997, with children aged 3 and \n     younger accounting for 77 percent of the fatalities;\n       Whereas head trauma is the leading cause of death of abused \n     children, including the trauma known as Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome, which results from a \n     caregiver losing control and shaking a baby usually less than \n     1 year of age, and can cause loss of vision, brain damage, \n     paralysis, seizures, or death, is a totally preventable form \n     of child abuse;\n       Whereas an estimated 3,000 children are diagnosed with \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome every year, with thousands more \n     misdiagnosed and undetected;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome often results in permanent, \n     irreparable brain damage or death to an infant, and more than \n     $1,000,000 in medical costs in just the first few years of \n     life to care for a single, disabled child;\n       Whereas the most effective solution to ending Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome is to prevent such abuse, and it is clear that the \n     minimal costs of educational and prevention programs may \n     prevent the enormous medical and disability costs and untold \n     grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have been shown to raise \n     awareness and provide critically important information about \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome to parents, caregivers, day-care \n     workers, child protection employees, law enforcement \n     personnel, health care professionals, and legal \n     representatives;\n       Whereas prevention of Shaken Baby Syndrome is supported by \n     groups such as the Shaken Baby Alliance, an organization \n     which began with 3 mothers of children who had been diagnosed \n     with Shaken Baby Syndrome, and whose mission is to educate \n     the general public and professionals about Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome and to increase support for victims and victim \n     families in the health care and criminal justice systems;\n       Whereas child abuse prevention programs and ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' are supported by the \n     Shaken Baby Alliance, Children's Defense Fund, American \n     Academy of Pediatrics, Child Welfare League of America, \n     Prevent Child Abuse America, Brain Injury Association, \n     National Child Abuse Coalition, National Exchange Club \n     Foundation, and many other organizations including the \n     National Basketball Association which is sponsoring a series \n     of ``NBA Child Abuse Prevention Awareness Night 2000'' events \n     to generate public awareness about the issue of child abuse \n     and neglect during National Child Abuse Prevention Month \n     2000;\n       Whereas a year 2000 survey by Prevent Child Abuse America \n     shows that \\1/2\\ of all Americans believe child abuse and \n     neglect is the most important issue facing this country \n     compared to other public health issues; and\n       Whereas Congress strongly supports efforts to protect \n     children from abuse and neglect: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates the week of April 23-\n     30, 2000, as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness \n     Week''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3032-4", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 512, S. Res. \n287.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 287) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the United States policy toward Libya, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to approve this \nresolution, which Senator Helms, Senator Lautenberg and I submitted on \nthe travel ban and other U.S. restrictions on contacts with Libya. The \nresolution was approved on April 13 by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  At the end of March, a team of State Department officials visited \nLibya as part of a review of the ban that has been in effect since 1981 \non U.S. travel to that nation. State Department officials were in Libya \nfor 26 hours, visiting hotels and other sites. Based on the findings of \nthis delegation, the State Department is preparing a recommendation for \nthe Secretary of State to help her determine whether there is still \n``imminent danger to . . . the physical safety of United States \ntravelers,'' as the law requires in order to maintain the ban.\n  Under the provisions of the travel ban, American citizens can travel \nto Libya only if they first obtain a license from the Department of the \nTreasury. In addition, the State Department must first validate a \npassport for travel to Libya.\n  The travel ban was imposed originally for safety reasons and predates \nthe terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. But lifting the ban now, \njust as the two Libyan suspects are about to go on trial in The \nNetherlands for their role in that atrocity, will undoubtedly be viewed \nas a gesture of good will to Colonel Qadhafi.\n  After the State Department announced that it would send this consular \nteam to Libya, a Saudi-owned daily paper quoted a senior Libyan \nofficial as saying the one-day visit by the U.S. team was a ``step in \nthe right direction.'' The official said the visit was a sign that \n``the international community was convinced that Libya's foreign policy \nposition was not wrong and there is a noticeable improvement in Libya's \nrelations with the world.''\n  Libya's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and International \nCooperation said the visit demonstrated that the Administration ``has \nrealized the importance of Libya'' and that Libya feels ``the negative \nchapter in our relations is over.''\n  Libya's Secretary for African Unity told reporters that the visit to \nLibya by U.S. officials was a welcome step and that ''. . . we welcome \nthe normalization between the two countries.''\n  The good will gesture was certainly not lost on Colonel Qadhafi, who \nsaid on April 4, when asked about a possible warming of relations with \nthe United States: ``I think America has reviewed its policy toward \nLibya and discovered that it is wrong . . . it is a good time for \nAmerica to change its policy toward Libya.''\n  I have been in contact with many of the families of the victims of \nPan Am Flight 103, and they are extremely upset by the timing of this \ndecision. They are united in their belief that the U.S. delegation \nshould not have been sent to Libya and that it would be a serious \nmistake to lift the travel ban before justice is served. The families \nwant to know why the Secretary of State made this friendly overture to \nColonel Qadhafi just six weeks before the trial in the Netherlands \nbegins. They question how much information the State Department was \nable to obtain by spending only 26 hours in\n\n[[Page S3034]]\n\nLibya. They wonder why the State Department could not continue to use \nthe same sources of information it has been using for many years to \nmake a determination about the travel ban.\n  There is no reason to believe that the situation in Libya has changed \nsince November 1999, when the travel ban was last extended on the basis \nof imminent danger to American citizens. Indeed, in January 2000, \nPresident Clinton cited Libya's support for terrorist activities and \nits non-compliance with UN Security Council Resolutions 731, 748, and \n863 as actions and policies that ``pose a continuing unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and vital foreign policy \ninterest of the United States.''\n  These American families have waited for justice for eleven long \nyears. They felt betrayed by the decision to send the consular \ndelegation to Libya. They have watched with dismay as our close ally, \nGreat Britain, has moved to reestablish diplomatic relations with \nLibya, before justice is served for the British citizens killed in the \nterrorist bombing. The State Department denies it, but the families are \nconcerned that the visit signals a change in U.S. policy, undermines \nU.S. sanctions, and calls into question the Administration's commitment \nto vigorously enforce the Iran Libya Sanctions Act. That Act requires \nthe United States to impose sanctions on foreign companies which invest \nmore than $40 million in the Libyan petroleum industry, until Libya \ncomplies with the conditions specified by the UN Security Council in \nits resolutions.\n  The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, in which 188 Americans were killed, \nwas one of the worst terrorist atrocities in American history. Other \nAmerican citizens are waiting for justice in other cases against Libya \nas well. Libya is also accused in the 1986 La Belle discotheque bombing \nin Germany, which resulted in the deaths of two United States \nservicemen. The trial of five individuals implicated in that attack \nbegan in December 1997 and is ongoing. In March 1999, six Libyan \nintelligence agents, including Colonel Qadhafi's brother-in-law, were \nconvicted in absentia by a French court for the bombing of UTA Flight \n772, which resulted in the deaths of 171 people, including seven \nAmericans. A civil suit against Colonel Qadhafi based on that bombing \nis pending in France.\n  The State Department should not have sent a delegation to Libya now \nand it should not lift the travel ban on Libya at this time. The \nDepartment's long-standing case-by-case consideration of passport \nrequests for visits to Libya by U.S. citizens has worked well. It can \ncontinue to do so for the foreseeable future.\n  The resolution the Senate is now considering states the Sense of the \nSenate that Libya's refusal to accept responsibility for its role in \nterrorist attacks against United States citizens suggests that the \nimminent danger to the physical safety of United States travelers \ncontinues. It calls on the Administration to consult fully with the \nU.S. Congress in considering policy toward Libya. It states that the \ntravel ban and all other U.S. restrictions on Libya should not be eased \nuntil all cases of American victims of Libyan terrorism have been \nresolved and the government of Libya has cooperated fully in bringing \nthe perpetrators to justice.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record, without intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 287) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 287\n\n       Whereas 270 people, including 189 Americans, were killed in \n     the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, \n     Scotland on December 21, 1988;\n       Whereas this bombing was one of the worst terrorist \n     atrocities in American history;\n       Whereas 2 Libyan suspects in the attack are scheduled to go \n     on trial in The Netherlands on May 3, 2000;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council has required \n     Libya to cooperate throughout the trial, pay compensation to \n     the families if the suspects are found guilty, and end \n     support for international terrorism before multilateral \n     sanctions can be permanently lifted;\n       Whereas Libya is accused in the 1986 La Belle discotheque \n     bombing in Germany which resulted in the death of 2 United \n     States servicemen;\n       Whereas in March 1999, 6 Libyan intelligence agents \n     including Muammar Qadhafi's brother-in-law, were convicted in \n     absentia by French courts for the bombing of UTA Flight 772 \n     that resulted in the death of 171 people, including 7 \n     Americans;\n       Whereas restrictions on United States citizens' travel to \n     Libya, known informally as a travel ban, have been in effect \n     since December 11, 1981, as a result of ``threats of hostile \n     acts against Americans'' according to the Department of \n     State;\n       Whereas on March 22, 4 United States State Department \n     officials departed for Libya as part of a review of the \n     travel ban; and\n       Whereas Libyan officials have interpreted the review as a \n     positive signal from the United States, and according to a \n     senior Libyan official ``the international community was \n     convinced that Libya's foreign policy position was not wrong \n     and there is a noticeable improvement in Libya's relations \n     with the world'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Libya's refusal to accept responsibility for its role \n     in terrorist attacks against United States citizens suggests \n     that the imminent danger to the physical safety of United \n     States travelers continues;\n       (2) the President should consult fully with Congress in \n     considering policy toward Libya, including disclosure of any \n     assurances received by the Qadhafi regime relative to the \n     judicial proceedings in The Hague; and\n       (3) the travel ban and all other United States restrictions \n     on Libya should not be eased until all cases of American \n     victims of Libyan terrorism have been resolved and the \n     Government of Libya has cooperated fully in bringing the \n     perpetrators to justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3034-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3034-S3036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           JOHN H.

Mr. President, I am delighted to be here, along with \nthe Senator from California, who I believe is one of the most \ndetermined and effective Members of the Senate, to talk about a very \nimportant matter.\n  Last year, when this Senate was debating the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act, Senator Feinstein and I offered an amendment to that \nlegislation, which was accepted by the bill's managers Senators Roth \nand Moynihan, to address to critically important issue--an issue \nrelating to Africa's devastating AIDS crisis; an issue that has cast a \ndark shadow on US-African relations in the past.\n  Our amendment was simple--and I want to clarify this point, because\n\n[[Page S3038]]\n\nthere has been some misleading characterizations of it in print \nrecently. It prohibited any agent of the United States Government from \npressuring African countries to revoke or change laws aimed at \nincreasing access to HIV/AIDS drugs, so long as the laws in question \nadhered to existing international regulations governing trade. Quite \nsimply, our amendment told the executive branch to stop twisting the \narms of African countries that are using legal means to improve access \nto HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals for their people.\n  The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \nRights, or TRIPS, allows for compulsory licensing in cases of national \nemergency. HIV/AIDS kills 5,500 Africans every day. Approximately 13 \nmillion African lives have been lost since the onset of the crisis. \nAccording to the Rockefeller Foundation's recent report, ``on \nstatistics alone, young people from the most affected countries in \nAfrica are more likely than not to perish of AIDS.''\n  In contrast to this incredible crisis, is a very modest amendment. \nThis year a number of our colleagues have offered very ambitious \nproposals--many of which I support--aimed at addressing the AIDS crisis \nin Africa because they have been moved by the severity of the crisis, \nby the scope of the devastation, by the human tragedy of millions lost \nto disease and a generation of orphans left in their wake. The Senate \nForeign Relations Committee recently reported out legislation combining \nmany of these efforts in one integrated plan to get serious about this \ncrisis. Time and again, Members of this Senate on a bipartisan basis \nhave stepped forward to implore their colleagues to do more to help.\n  What is ironic is that this amendment was far less ambitious. It \nsimply took a step toward requiring the United States to do no harm. \nYet the conferees working on the African Growth and Opportunity Act are \nresisting this measure every step of the way. I find the resistance to \nthis measure baffling. They try to skirt the issue, pointing out that \nprevention programs, not access to drugs, are the most important \nelement in the fight against AIDS.\n  I couldn't agree more. But why does the fact that the Feinstein-\nFeingold amendment addresses only one small piece of the puzzle prevent \nus from making it law? Why on earth should we forgo an opportunity to \ndo no harm even as we strive to form a broader plan of action to do \nsome good? How can anyone justify pressuring these countries, where in \nsome cases life expectancies have dropped by more than fifteen years, \nnot to use all legal means at their disposal to care for their \ncitizens? I simply cannot understand it; I cannot imagine that ordinary \nAmericans are urging their representatives to oppose the Feinstein-\nFeingold amendment. I cannot imagine that anyone would prevail upon my \ncolleagues to oppose this measure--except perhaps for pharmaceutical \ncompanies, companies that know they would not lose customers in Africa, \nas Africans simply cannot afford their prices, but fear that this \nmeasure would somehow, somewhere down the road, affect their bottom \nline.\n  The bottom line in Africa is that AIDS represents that worst \ninfectious disease catastrophe since the bubonic plague. The bottom \nline is that this is a modest measure and it is the right thing to do. \nI along with the Senator from California, urge the conferees to support \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank my cosponsor, the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin, for those words. I want him to \nknow, I want the Senate to know, and I want the House to know how \nimportant this amendment is. It is so important that both of us are \nwilling to filibuster a conference report. I think it is only fair to \nsend that signal loudly and clearly.\n  The reason I do so is because I was the mayor of the first city with \nAIDS. I spent 9 years as mayor understanding what AIDS can do and how \nit can spread and understanding the importance not only of prevention \nof AIDS, which is all important, but also of being able to treat an \nAIDS-infected population adequately.\n  Let me say something about the AIDS pandemic now sweeping across sub-\nSaharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely effected \nby AIDS than any other part of the world. The bottom line of all of \nthis is, there will not be an Africa left for an African trade \ninitiative unless this amendment is part of that initiative.\n  The United Nations reports that 23.3 million--not thousand, million--\nadults and children are infected with the HIV virus in Africa. Africa \nhas about 10 percent of the world's population, but it has 70 percent \nof the total number of infected people in the world.\n  Worldwide, about 5.6 million new infections will occur this year, \nwith an estimated 3.8 million in sub-Saharan Africa alone. Every single \nday, 11,000 people are infected in sub-Saharan Africa. That is 1 every \n8 seconds.\n  All told, over 34 million people in Africa--the population of \nCalifornia--have been infected with HIV since the pandemic began. An \nestimated 13.7 million Africans have lost their lives to AIDS, \nincluding 2.2 million who died in 1998. It is enormous, and it is \nhidden because of the cultural taboos that surround it.\n  Each day, AIDS buries 5,500 men, women, and children. By 2005, if \npolicies do not change, the daily death toll will reach 13,000--double \nwhat it is now--with nearly 5 million AIDS deaths in 2005 alone, in \nsub-Saharan Africa.\n  The overall rate of infection among adults in sub-Saharan Africa is 8 \npercent, compared with a 1.1-percent infection rate worldwide. In some \ncountries of southern Africa, 20 percent to 30 percent of the entire \nadult population is infected. AIDS has cut life expectancy by 4 years \nin Nigeria, 18 years in Kenya, and 26 years in Zimbabwe. Imagine, AIDS \ncutting life expectancy by 26 years. That is the case in Zimbabwe \ntoday.\n\n  AIDS is devastating Africa. It is affecting infant and child \nmortality rates, reversing the declines that have been occurring in \nmany countries during the 1970s and 1980s. Over 30 percent of all \nchildren born to HIV-infected mothers in sub-Saharan Africa will \nthemselves become HIV infected.\n  There are many explanations why this pandemic is sweeping across sub-\nSaharan Africa. Certainly, the region's poverty, which has deprived \nAfricans of access to health information, health education, and health \ncare. Cultural and behavioral patterns have led to sub-Saharan Africa \nbeing the only region in which women are infected with HIV at a higher \nrate than men. Clearly, there needs to be considerable emphasis \naddressing the health care infrastructure of Africa. There must also be \nadditional resources for education.\n  If the international community is to be successful, we must also make \nevery effort to get appropriate medicine into the hands of those in \nneed. For too many years, there were no effective drugs that could be \nused to combat HIV/AIDS. Now, thanks to recent medical research, we do \nhave effective medicine. For example, some recent pilot projects have \nhad success in reducing mother-to-child transmission by administering \nthe anti-HIV drug AZT, or a less expensive medicine, Nevirapne, NVP, \nduring birth and early childhood. As a matter of fact, four pills can \nprevent, in many cases, the transmission of HIV from a mother to an \nunborn child.\n  Unfortunately, and inexplicably in my view, access for poor Africans \nto costly combinations of AIDS medications, including antiretrovirals, \nis perhaps the most contentious issue surrounding the response to the \nAfrican pandemic. I happen to believe we have a very strong moral \nobligation to try to save lives when the medications for doing so \nactually exist. There are several things the United States could do to \nincrease access to life-saving drugs.\n  First, we can work with others in the international community to \nprovide support to make these drugs affordable and to strengthen \nAfrican health care systems so that drug therapies can be administered.\n  Second, we should not prevent African Governments and donor agencies \nfrom achieving reductions in the cost of antiretrovirals through \nnegotiated agreements with drug manufacturers. The British \npharmaceutical firm, Glaxo Wellcome, a major producer of \nantiretrovirals, has already stated it is committed to differential \npricing which would lower the cost of AIDS drugs in Africa.\n\n[[Page S3039]]\n\n  Third, I strongly believe the United States must not oppose parallel \nimporting and compulsory licensing by African Governments, to lower the \nprice of patented medications so that HIV/AIDS drugs are more \naffordable and more people in Africa will have access to them. That is \nwhat the amendment that Senator Feingold and I offered would do.\n  Through parallel importing, patented pharmaceuticals could be \npurchased from the cheapest source, rather than from the manufacturer. \nUnder compulsory licensing, an African Government could order a local \nfirm to produce a drug and pay a negotiated royalty to the patent \nholder. Both parallel imports and compulsory licensing are permitted \nunder the World Trade Organization agreement for countries facing \nhealth emergencies. This is a health emergency. Without compulsory \nlicensing and parallel importing, which would allow access to cheaper \ngeneric drugs, more people in sub-Saharan Africa will suffer and die \nneedlessly.\n  For my colleagues who may be concerned that this amendment may \nundermine wider intellectual property rights, an accusation that those \nopposed to this amendment--and let me be frank, the pharmaceutical \nindustry--is making, they are incorrect. This amendment reaffirms the \nWorld Trade Organization's TRIPS agreements which is the legal standard \nfor intellectual property rights. TRIPS does not prohibit parallel \nimporting and compulsory licensing during health emergencies. That is \nfully consistent with current U.S. policy on intellectual property \nrights. In other words, despite what some pharmaceutical companies have \nbeen saying behind closed doors about this amendment, the amendment \ndoes not weaken intellectual property rights protection one iota. It \nkeeps the bar exactly where it is now.\n\n  The World Trade Organization and U.S. commitments on intellectual \nproperty protection allows countries flexibility in addressing public \nhealth concerns. The compulsory licensing process under this amendment \nis fully consistent with the WTO's approach to balancing the protection \nof intellectual property, with a moral obligation to meet public health \nemergencies such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa. In other words, \nthis amendment is consistent with international trade law.\n  The amendment does not create new policy or a new approach on \nintellectual property rights under TRIPS, nor does it require \nintellectual property rights to be rolled back or weakened. All it asks \nis that in approaching HIV/AIDS in Africa, U.S. policy on compulsory \nlicensing and parallel importing remain consistent with what is \naccepted under international trade law. By doing so, the amendment will \nallow countries of sub-Saharan Africa to continue to determine the \navailability of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals in their countries and provide \ntheir people with affordable HIV drugs.\n  By itself, the amendment is not going to solve the problems of AIDS \nin Africa. Opponents of the amendment suggest that because it doesn't \naddress the entire HIV/AIDS problem, it should be removed from the \nbill. They argue that because the health care infrastructure is weak, \nallowing parallel importing and compulsory licensing will not get the \ndrugs to the people who need them.\n  That misses the point. Although it is true we need to strengthen \ninfrastructure, and my amendment contains language urging additional \nefforts in this area, that was never the purpose or intent of the \namendment. Its purpose and intent was to address this one specific \nissue, this one small piece of the puzzle, and in so doing, provide \nsome measure of relief to the millions and millions of people now \nsuffering from AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  Let me provide one example of why the approach adopted by this \namendment, admittedly one small part of a larger effort, is necessary. \nOn March 14 of this year, Doctors Without Borders, the medical relief \ngroup that won the Nobel Prize last year, sent a letter to Pfizer \ncalling on Pfizer to lower the price of fluconazole, a drug needed to \ntreat cryptococcal meningitis, the most common systematic functional \ninfection in HIV-positive people in developing countries. As the \nDoctors Without Borders letter notes, in Thailand, fluconazole is \navailable for just $1.20 for a daily dose. Yet in Kenya and South \nAfrica, the daily dose costs $17.84. It is 15 times higher in Africa \nthan in Thailand. That is unconscionable. So, what accounts for the \ndifference? In Thailand, a generic version is available. In Kenya and \nSouth Africa, the only supplier is Pfizer.\n\n  As Bernard Pecoul, director of Doctors Without Borders Access to \nEssential Medicines Campaigns, has noted:\n\n       People are dying because the price of the drug that can \n     save them is too high.\n\n  As the March 14 Doctors Without Borders letter notes:\n\n       While we appreciate that patents can be an important motor \n     of research and development funding, there must be a balance \n     to ensure that people in developing countries have access to \n     lifesaving medicines.\n\n  That is the purpose of my amendment, and I am deadly serious about \nit.\n  I am pleased to note that, under pressure from Doctors Without \nBorders, Pfizer has now agreed to lower the prices of fluconazole. This \nsituation never should have existed to begin with. Ironically, the \npharmaceutical companies would profit more from this amendment than \nthey do right now. Presently, most sub-Saharan African countries are \nnot buying these drugs because they can't afford the price tag. So the \npharmaceutical companies are not earning any money at all on these \ndrugs. But if sub-Saharan African countries produced HIV/AIDS drugs \nthrough compulsory licensing or purchased them through parallel \nimporting, the pharmaceutical companies holding the patents on these \ndrugs would receive royalties.\n  I was very pleased to work with the managers of this bill, when the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act was on the floor of the Senate last \nNovember, to modify my amendments to meet some of their concerns and to \nhave their support in seeing it included in the final Senate-passed \nversion of this bill.\n  I have been happy to work with them. My staff has worked with their \nstaff over the past several months to try to meet some additional \nconcerns which have subsequently been voiced. But, frankly, my patience \nis wearing very thin. The pharmaceutical companies that are opposed to \nthis amendment, opposed because they want to squeeze every last drop of \nprofit from the suffering of the millions of HIV/AIDS victims in sub-\nSarahan Africa. They have shown no willingness to compromise, no \nwillingness to enter into good-faith negotiations.\n  I am more than willing to see additional clarifying language added to \nthis amendment in conference. I believe strongly that the core of the \namendment must remain and that efforts to either remove this amendment \nor to gut it are both inexplicable and reprehensible, and I am \ndetermined not to let this happen.\n  It is clearly in the interests of the United States to prevent the \nfurther spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 300, introduced earlier today by \nmyself.\n\n[[Page S3040]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 300) designating the week of April \n     23-30, 2000, as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness \n     Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nthat I will soon send to the desk to proclaim April 23-30, 2000, as \n``Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'', and to recognize the many \ngroups, particularly the Shaken Baby Alliance, who support this effort \nto increase awareness of one of the most unspeakable forms of child \nabuse, one that results in the death or lifelong disability of \nthousands of children each year.\n  For the past twenty years, the current President of the United States \nhas designated one month each year as National Child Abuse Prevention \nMonth to increase awareness of the devastating harm done to our \nchildren by abuse and neglect. This year, April, 2000, is National \nChild Abuse Prevention Month, and it began with the release of a \nnational survey conducted by the group, Prevent Child Abuse America. \nThe survey showed that more than 50% of all Americans believe child \nabuse and neglect is the most important public health issue facing this \ncountry. The survey also showed that a vast majority of Americans--83 \npercent--believe that child abuse prevention efforts can be most \nsuccessful before such behavior has begun, rather than waiting until \nthe abuse has occurred. These results point to the need to recognize \nchild abuse and neglect as the public health problem it is, one that is \nlinked with a host of other problems facing our country, including \npoverty and drug and alcohol addiction, and one that needs the \ncomprehensive approach of our entire public health system to solve.\n  The need for this widespread and high level concern is well-\ndocumented. The most recent government figures show that over 1 million \nchildren were victims of abuse in 1997. Each day, three of these \nchildren die as a result of this abuse. The U.S. Advisory Board on \nChild Abuse and Neglect reported in ``A Nation's Shame: Fatal Child \nAbuse and Neglect in the United States,'' that a more realistic \nestimate of annual child deaths as a result of abuse and neglect, both \nknown and unknown to Child Protective Service agencies, is closer to \n2,000, or approximately five children per day. The rate of child \nfatalities caused by abuse has risen by 37 percent between 1985 and \n1997, with children aged 3 and younger accounting for 77 percent of \nthese fatalities. Because of the problems of under-reporting and errors \nin diagnoses, the National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse \nbelieves that the number of child deaths from maltreatment per year may \nbe as high as 5,000. In most cases, the child's death is the result of \nhead trauma, including the trauma known as Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS).\n  Shaken Baby Syndrome results from a caregiver losing control and \nshaking a baby, usually an infant who is less than 1 year old. This \nsevere shaking can kill the baby, or it can cause loss of vision, brain \ndamage, paralysis, and seizures, resulting in lifelong disabilities. \nThis totally preventable form of child abuse causes untold grief for \nmany families whose child dies, or is left with permanent, irreparable \nbrain damage. The care for the child's resulting disability is \nestimated at more than $1 million in medical costs during just the \nfirst few years of the baby's life.\n  The most effective solution to ending Shaken Baby Syndrome is to \nprevent such abuse, and it is clear that the minimal costs of \neducational and prevention programs may help to protect our young \nchildren and stop this tragedy from occurring. In 1995, the U.S. \nAdvisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect recommended a universal \napproach to the prevention of child fatalities that would reach out to \nall families through the implementation of several key strategies. Such \nefforts began by providing services such as home visitation by trained \nprofessionals or paraprofessionals, hospital-linked outreach to parents \nof infants and toddlers, community-based programs designed for the \nspecific needs of neighborhoods, and effective public education \ncampaigns.\n  Child abuse prevention programs have been shown to raise awareness \nand provide critically important information about Shaken Baby Syndrome \nand other forms of abuse to parents, caregivers, day care workers, \nchild protection employees, law enforcement personnel, health care \nprofessionals, and legal representatives. Many prevention programs now \ninclude not only information about the dangers of shaking babies and \nhow to cope with crying, but also address issues of anger management, \nstress reduction, appropriate expectations of children, and specific \ninformation on why shaking or impact can interrupt early brain \ndevelopment. Education programs for judges and others in the judicial \nsystem are also beneficial for SBS criminal cases. Ultimately, the \neducation of all will help us reach a critical goal of zero tolerance \ntoward shaking, a goal that will help to save children's lives.\n  The prevention of Shaken Baby Syndrome is supported by groups such as \nthe Shaken Baby Alliance, an organization which began with 3 mothers of \nchildren who had been diagnosed with Shaken Baby Syndrome, and whose \nmission is to educate the general public and professionals about Shaken \nBaby Syndrome, and to increase support for victims and victim families \nin the health care and criminal justice systems. In my own state of \nMinnesota, the Shaken Baby Alliance is represented by the outstanding \nefforts of Kim Kang, whose daughter Rachel was diagnosed in 1995 with \nShaken Baby Syndrome, after being violently shaken by a day care \nprovider. My heart goes out to her family, and to all of the families \nwho deal with the results of Shaken Baby Syndrome and all other forms \nof child abuse and neglect. Child abuse and neglect is a scourge on our \ncountry, and we must do more to prevent the damage done to our \nchildren, our families, and our society as a result of child abuse, and \nto help those who suffer its consequences.\n  Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week is supported by the Shaken Baby \nAlliance, Children's Defense Fund, American Academy of Pediatrics, \nChild Welfare League of America, Prevent Child Abuse America, Brain \nInjury Association, National Child Abuse Coalition, National Exchange \nClub Foundation, and many other organizations including the National \nBasketball Association, which is sponsoring a series of ``NBA Child \nAbuse Prevention Awareness Nights 2000'' events to generate public \nawareness about the issue of child abuse and neglect during National \nChild Abuse Prevention Month 2000.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution designating the week of \nApril 23-30, 2000, as ``Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'', and to \ntake part in the many local and national activities and events \nrecognizing the month of April as National Child Abuse Prevention \nMonth.\n  This resolution has the support of a number of organizations: Shaken \nBaby Alliance, Children's Defense Fund, American Academy of Pediatrics, \nChild Welfare League of America, Prevent Child Abuse America, Brain \nInjury Association, National Child Abuse Coalition, National Exchange \nClub Foundation Child Abuse Prevention Program, and many other \norganizations, including the National Basketball Association, which is \nsponsoring a series of NBA Child Abuse Prevention Awareness Nights 2000 \nto generate public awareness of this.\n  I will not read the whole resolution, but I do want to just quickly \nsummarize this. With this designation, we are designating this week, \nApril 23 to 30, 2000, as National Shaken Baby Awareness Week. I do just \nwant to read a few whereas clauses, which are chilling.\n\n       Whereas head trauma is the leading cause of death of abused \n     children, including the trauma known as Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome, which results from the care-\n     giver losing control and shaking a baby usually less than 1 \n     year of age, and can cause loss of vision, brain damage, \n     paralysis, seizures, or death, is a totally preventable form \n     of child abuse;\n       Whereas an estimated 3,000 children are diagnosed with \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome every year, with thousands more \n     misdiagnosed and undetected;\n       Whereas the most effective solution to ending Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome is to prevent such abuse--what we are doing is we \n     are designating this week:\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates the week of April 23-\n     30 as National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week.\n\n\n[[Page S3041]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, I wish I did not have to introduce this resolution. I \nthank my colleagues for supporting it, but I think all the \norganizations that are working on this are doing extremely important \nwork. It is hard to believe this happens to infants. It is hard to \nbelieve this happens to small children. I certainly cannot say on the \nfloor of the Senate that agreeing to a resolution, ipso facto, ends \nthis practice. But our agreeing to this resolution means a lot to \npeople who have experienced this horror and to people who care deeply \nabout this issue.\n  I thank colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution and preamble be \nagreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nany statements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 300) was agreed to. The preamble were agreed \nto.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, briefly, in morning business, I want to \ntake 2 minutes to speak to a related topic. I thank, again, the Senate \nSergeant at Arms for his leadership, Jim Ziegler.\n  I thank Senator Bennett for the key appropriations role he plays in \nhis position as chairman. I thank Senator Harry Reid, who I think is \nthe only Senator who has served on the Capitol Hill police force, and \nthere are a good many others as well.\n  I want to, one final time, speak to the issue before us. We lost two \nfine police officers, Officer Chestnut and Agent Gibson. All of us were \naffected by this tragedy but, first and foremost, their families. We \nmade a commitment to do everything we could to make sure this never \nhappens again.\n  It is not possible to have any 100-percent guarantee, but we made \nthat commitment, and we certainly need to, therefore, make the \ncommitment by way of spending the money to make sure we have the \nnecessary personnel to have two officers at each one of these posts. \nOtherwise, if we only have one officer, that officer is in real \njeopardy.\n  I say to my colleagues--I will speak on it week after week--I believe \nwe are going to get this done. I know the Capitol Police Union is very \nactive. It is true sometimes two policemen will be on one door, and \nthere will not be that many people entering. The point is, at other \ntimes in the day, many people are entering. Even if it is only a few, \nall it takes--unfortunately, we know this; we have been through this \nnightmare--is one deranged individual to show up at one of these posts \nwhere there is only one officer, or that one deranged individual comes \nin as 30 or 40 other people are streaming in, and that police officer \nmay not only not be able to defend the public and defend us but may not \nbe able to defend himself or herself.\n  This is no small issue. The request has been made, and it is crystal \nclear what we need to do. We better live up to our commitment, and we \nbetter provide the funding to support the Capitol Hill police. I cannot \nthink of anything more important for us to do internally.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/27/senate-section/article/S3042-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M., MONDAY, MAY 1, 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
