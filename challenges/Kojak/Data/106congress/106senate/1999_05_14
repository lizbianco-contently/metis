Also, under the previous order, the Senate \nwill now resume consideration of S. 254, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 254) to reduce violent juvenile crime, promote \n     accountability and rehabilitation of juvenile criminals, \n     punish and deter violent gang crime, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Hatch/Craig amendment No. 344, to provide for effective gun \n     law enforcement, enhanced penalties, and facilitation of \n     background checks at gun shows.\n       Schumer amendment No. 350, to amend title 18, United States \n     Code, to regulate the transfer of firearms over the Internet.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 344\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 5 \nminutes of debate on the Hatch-Craig amendment No. 344, the time to be \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Hatch-Craig amendment is an amendment \nthat corrects a number of problems in this particular bill that people \nhave complained about that we believe need to be corrected, but we also \ndo a number of other things as well. We have more aggressive \nprosecution of violent minors who are going to continue to do violence \nunless we pass the accountability and the prevention efforts in this \nbill. It has enhanced penalties for the use of firearms, something that \nwe need. It is probably the only thing that is going to make a real \ndifference with regard to firearms. That is important. The amendment \nhas increased maximum penalties for the use of firearms, and that is \nimportant as well. It has expanded protection for children.\n\n  For instance, we have the juvenile Brady bill within the underlying \nbill, but we are passing it again so everybody will know that all of \nthis complaining by those who have tried to defeat this bill is just \npolitical posturing. The fact is we are going to prevent any juvenile \nwho has used a gun in the commission of a crime from ever having a gun \nhenceforth. That is the juvenile Brady bill.\n  Last, but not least, we are expanding the background checks. A couple \nof days ago Senator Craig tried to do a voluntary background check with \nincentives, which was a step forward in resolving this issue. However, \nthe Democrats wanted a very bureaucratic, very Government-oriented bill \nto do these background checks. The Hatch-Craig amendment provides for \nmandatory background checks and provides for more background checks \nthan the Democratic alternative. We have a more stringent amendment \nthan what the Democrats came up with, and we have offered this \namendment in order to try to resolve the animosities and the problems \nthat have existed on this gun show issue.\n  Last, but not least, I may get a little uptight with people who try \nto make the whole juvenile justice issue an issue about guns. Guns may \nbe a part of it, and there is no question they are, and we are doing \nthe things that are right with regard to guns. However,\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\nanyone who tries to reduce all of these juvenile justice problems in \nour society to guns is not only exaggerating but they are misreading \nthe American people. The people realize that juvenile justice \nencompasses a lot more than just gun issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Unfortunately, much of this has become about guns. As the \ndistinguished chairman knows, one of the things in this amendment is a \nsection that dismisses pending State and Federal lawsuits, overrides \nall the State legislatures, all the State courts, just dismisses them \non behalf of gun sellers and manufacturers.\n  I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from New York and the \nremaining time to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  This proposal is as riddled with loopholes as the previous Craig \nproposal. No. 1, you can buy guns at gun shows without any background \ncheck through the new provision of special licensees. No. 2, criminals \ncan buy guns at pawnshops without any background check--a step \nbackward. No. 3, there is still immunity in lawsuits. But most \nimportantly, anyone who thinks that we close the gun show loophole with \nthis amendment is mistaken, because special licensees neither have to \nmake a background check nor file any reports.\n  Please do not think that we are closing the gun show loophole with \nthis amendment. I urge my colleagues in strong terms to oppose it. We \nshould pass the Lautenberg amendment. That does close the gun show \nloophole. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say you are closing \nit and leave a huge, wide open loophole. This is a Swiss cheese \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I oppose the Hatch-Craig loophole \namendment. I am calling it that deliberately. Unfortunately, this \namendment goes exactly in the wrong direction. Instead of closing the \ngun show loophole, it creates several new loopholes that will help \ncriminals get even more guns.\n  We look here on this chart at a licensed dealer: Background check? \nVoluntarily. Special license: They don't even have to ask whether or \nnot there is any evidence that this individual shouldn't have any \npermit for a gun.\n  The first choice was my amendment to really close the gun show \nloopholes, and that is what the public wants. We see it all the time. \nWe heard it all over TV, and last night on a show called ``Extra,'' \nthey showed how penetrable the rules are in a gun show where a 15-year-\nold and 17-year-old were able to buy guns under the table. I hope they \nwill respond here today to the American people, 87 percent of whom said \nclose the gun show loopholes. I hope we will do that and have the \ncourage to stand up to the NRA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given an \nadditional 2 minutes and also if the other side needs an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. For both sides?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, that just plain is not true. The language \ndoes correct those loopholes he is talking about, but just to guarantee \nit, I send a modification to the desk that certainly clarifies and \ncorrects those loopholes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HATCH. Do we want to get this done or don't we?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Let's let the Senate run this and not the gun lobbies run \nthis Senate Chamber.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is not the gun lobby, this is Senator Hatch sending a \nmodification to the desk.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I object.\n  Mr. HATCH. You object to doing what is right here?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I object until I have a chance to read it.\n  Mr. HATCH. You object to closing the so-called loophole?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I withdraw it. It is amazing to me----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We object.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No one has seen it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor at this \npoint. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I do not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. There will be 2 minutes on the other side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Utah be \ngiven time to read what his modification is, and whatever time that \ntakes, this side be given equal time. Does that help the chairman?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me tell you, I am so tired of this unnecessary \nargument. I want a juvenile justice bill. I have insisted on making \nthese changes so we can get rid of these political arguments made on \nthe other side, and I am tired of it.\n  What we are trying to do this morning is make it absolutely clear--\neven though we think it is clear in the bill as it is--with this \nmodification. I hate to say this, but I really believe there is an \neffort by some in this body to never have a juvenile justice bill. I am \ngoing to do everything in my power to get it.\n  Under current law, anyone who engages in the business of selling \nfirearms at a gun show must have a license. The loophole of current law \nlets gunsmiths and other individuals go to gun shows as nonlicensed \nindividuals to sell guns with no instant check. That is current law. We \nare trying to solve that. Others are trying to exploit this issue, and \nI think very unfairly so.\n  As long as the gunsmiths do not sell so many firearms as to be \nengaged in the business of firearms dealing, they are not classified as \nfirearms dealers. Thus, they can sell a limited number of firearms at a \ngun show without a license. This is also a loophole in existing law.\n\n  The Craig amendment which the Senate adopted on Wednesday provided \nthat the gunsmiths who wanted to engage in the business of selling \nfirearms, but just at gun shows, could do so, but have to be licensed \nto do so--a step in the right direction. It was not enough, apparently, \nand so we have been willing to change that.\n  The Craig amendment provided for a special license that would last \nfor only 3 days. By becoming, in effect, a temporary dealer, the \ngunsmith was subject to all the provisions of the Gun Control Act to \nwhich dealers are subject, including the recordkeeping requirements, \nthe requirement to be subject to inspection by Federal officials, and \nthe requirement to perform background checks--a step in the right \ndirection.\n  While the Craig amendment exempted special registrants who only \nconducted background checks and did not engage in the business of \nselling firearms from the dealer recordkeeping requirements, it \nexpressly provided that the special licensee would be subject to the \nrecordkeeping requirements of the Gun Control Act.\n  The Hatch-Craig amendment, which we are going to vote on in a few \nminutes, which we offered yesterday, simply changed the voluntary \nbackground check for individual sellers at gun shows to a mandatory \nbackground check. It did not affect the special licensing requirements. \nThus, after the Hatch-Craig amendment, an individual who desires to \nobtain a firearm at a gun show must submit to a background check \nwhether he purchases the firearm from a regular dealer, a special \nlicensee, or another individual.\n  It is my desire to ensure that any gun sale that takes place at any \ngun show has a background check. That is what we are doing here, and we \nare doing it because of the complaining on both sides of the aisle, and \nI have insisted on it.\n  My colleague, Senator Craig, and I now agree on this. I believe the \ncurrent language clearly, clearly accomplishes\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\nthis, without this modification I have sent to the desk. However, if my \ncolleagues want to make the language to the special licensee even more \nexpress, that is why I expressed a desire to work with them. I am glad \nto work with them. I sent a modification to the desk to make it \nabsolutely superabundantly clear. Since we have the same goals here, \nthere is no reason to play politics on this issue. Let's get the job \ndone.\n  Last but not least, we have asked the Justice Department and others \nto cooperate with us and help to know what they want here. Not one word \nin 2 years, other than political crticism. The President bad-mouthed \nthis all day yesterday for political purposes, and I am tired of that \nbecause I am one of those who is insisting on making these changes. I \nam one of those who wants to accommodate my colleagues on the other \nside. If they have any substantive problems, bring them to us, but \ntheir amendment certainly does not do as much as ours does. I cannot \nsolve every problem here, but this I think we can solve.\n  The modification basically says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, section \n     923 of title 18, United States Code, as amended by this Act, \n     shall be applied by amending in subsection (m) the following: \n     In subsection (m), amend paragraph 1 by adding the new \n     subparagraph as follows: Subparagraph (f), except as provided \n     in subparagraph (d) a special licensee shall--\n\n  Not may, shall--\n\n     be subject to all the provisions of this chapter applicable \n     to dealers, including, but not limited to, the performance of \n     an instant background check.\n\n  I do not think that is necessary, but my colleagues do, and I want to \naccommodate my colleagues on the other side. I cannot accommodate----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what was the unanimous-consent \nagreement?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sufficient time to explain this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We will get equal time.\n  Mr. HATCH. They have equal time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has used 4 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right. Our colleagues have been complaining here for 2 \ndays. We are doing what I think they and others on our side would like \nto have done. And the National Rifle Association has not had a thing to \ndo with it. I don't care whether they accept it or don't accept it. \nThese things are done by us. Frankly, to try to make them the terrible \norganization that some on the other side try to do bothers me. They \nrepresent millions of decent, law-abiding, honest sports people.\n  I think it is time to start talking about these things in earnest \nwith clarity and with decency. I think, more important, this is not all \nabout guns. Guns are a part of the juvenile justice bill, but it is not \nall about guns. There are so many other things this bill does that will \nhelp us in this society to resolve the problems of violent juveniles \nthat it is a crying shame we have had to play around with this bill \nover the last number of days like we have. I have tried to move these \namendments forward and will continue to do so, but there is only so \nmuch time this bill can be given.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Let's stay somewhat within the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true that it has been brought to the attention \nof all that there is a loophole that needs to be closed and this is a \ngood-faith effort to do that?\n  Mr. HATCH. This is a good-faith effort to accommodate our colleagues \non the other side who I believe have raised legitimate objections. They \nhave tried to make it look like our side is in frantic shape about \ndoing it. I just want to get it done.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it also true----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Regular order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed 3 minutes to \nquestion the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Do you object or not object?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let the Senator from Arizona----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I repeat my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not object if, following the earlier \nunanimous consent agreement to accommodate the Senator from Utah----\n  Mr. HATCH. He did.\n  Mr. LEAHY. At which time the Senator from Arizona was not on the \nfloor and does not realize that we have equal time over here.\n  Mr. HATCH. He did.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I withdraw my unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just end with this. I believe my colleagues are \nsincere on the other side. I know the distinguished ranking member on \nthe Judiciary Committee has been working diligently with me to get this \nbill passed. I compliment him and I honor him for that.\n  I believe the distinguished Senator from New Jersey is doing his best \nto try to make sure that loopholes are closed. I appreciate that. I \nhave tried to accommodate him. I did not like his amendment because I \nthought it was too bureaucratic and too heavyhanded. On the other hand, \nhe was sincere in presenting it. If he had not presented it, we \nprobably would not be here today trying to accommodate him.\n  With regard to my friend from New York, there are very few people in \nthis body who understand this issue any better than he does. And I \nrespect him.\n  But I am serving notice, I am getting tired of the spurious arguments \nthat have been made by some against what we are trying to do. And I am \na little impatient because I think they are trying to artificially \npaint this gun show amendment like a National Rifle Association \namendment. I can tell you right now, I did not talk to the National \nRifle Association about this amendment; and I had a lot to do with \nchanging the previous voluntary background check to a mandatory \nbackground check for sales at gun shows. And to his credit, Senator \nCraig has cooperated every step of the way.\n  Now, this mandatory gun show check is to accommodate our colleagues. \nThis is to solve this gun show problem. We cannot solve every problem \nin this bill, but we are certainly trying to solve as many as we can. \nAnd this is a very small part of this total juvenile justice bill that \nwe need to pass. We will never get it passed unless we get some \ncooperation from both sides of the aisle. I am asking for that.\n  We have been debating this juvenile justice bill for 3 days. This is \na bill that should have been passed in 1 day. Every one of us should \nhave been very, very happy to get this bill passed. Most everybody on \nthis floor knows that this bill is a very, very well-thought-out bill. \nIt is bipartisan, and it is time for us to get it passed. But we have \nto quit playing political games around here. Let's start worrying about \nthe young people in this society, the families and our society as a \nwhole.\n  That is all I need to say about it. I apologize if I have offended \nany of my colleagues on the other side, but I am tired of having \narguments made that are not constructive when I am trying to meet the \nneeds of the very people who have made these arguments.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair at this point will----\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I yield----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Very briefly, as a cosponsor of the bill, half a minute?\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that he be given a half a minute.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And that be added to the time over here.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from New York has pointed out consistently \nthrough the bill where there might be corrections or where in some \ninstances there were deletions that were not intended. Last night he \nexpressed there was a loophole.\n  I pointed out in the law that we had placed this new category \ndirectly into the law to comply with all of the law which included \nbackground checks. They were apprehensive. We went back and reviewed it \nand confirmed with many attorneys exactly what we believe to be true.\n  But this morning, in good faith, we have offered this. You can accept \nit or reject it at your will. But it is very clear what we intend. I \nthink the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has made that intention \nclear: Temporary\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nlicensees, for the purpose of convenience and also security at gun \nshows, will do background checks.\n\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will now explain the parliamentary \nsituation based on the unanimous consent.\n  Based on the previous unanimous consent, the Senator from Utah has 1 \nminute 5 seconds; the Senator from Vermont has 12 minutes 53 seconds. \nThat is arrived at by the 2 minutes the Senator from Vermont had \npreviously from a previous unanimous consent, plus the 10 minutes 53 \nseconds the Senator from Utah consumed in explaining his position.\n  So to restate, the Senator from Utah has 1 minute 5 seconds; the \nSenator from Vermont has 12 minutes 53 seconds.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the modification I have sent to the desk does \nclose the loophole in a way that hopefully will please my colleagues on \nthe other side. I hope they will grant unanimous consent to do that. If \nthey do not grant unanimous consent, then I will try to do that by \namendment later, which we will have to vote on, I suppose.\n  But all I am trying to do is to accommodate them. I sometimes wonder \nif unfair political advantage isn't what is being sought here, instead \nof a bill. Everybody ought to be happy to have this additional \nlanguage. The Hatch-Craig amendment closes the gun show background \ncheck loophole. This additional language makes it even more express \nthan the bill makes it express at this time.\n  I hope my colleagues will permit the unanimous consent request to \nmodify the amendment. To the degree we can work on other problems that \nthey are concerned about, we will be happy to try to do that during the \ncourse of the debate on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I commend the distinguished \nPresiding Officer for his usual fairness, something I have expressed \nbefore. I say to my good friend from Utah that nobody would ever accuse \nyou of being uptight. I don't know where you ever got that idea. The \nSenator from Utah and I have worked very closely on this and will \ncontinue to do so.\n  But on this particular amendment, I do have some grave concerns. When \nit was first brought up, I said on this floor that there were serious \nproblems with it, as did the Senator from New York. The proponents \nbasically told us we didn't know what we were talking about, and it was \nrammed through on basically a party-line vote.\n  The next day they came back and said: Oh, by the way, you were right. \nWe're really sorry about that. We want to do it over again.\n  Well, in my religion we believe in redemption, and I assume that is \nat least partial redemption. But it shows what can happen if they could \nget away with it. It was going to go through, but it was discovered. \nThe objections that the Senators from New York and New Jersey and I \nraised were heard, and so they came back.\n  Now, at the eleventh hour, the last minute, they come out with \nanother amendment which still does not close loopholes and does nothing \nto stop what I have raised on this floor for several days now; and that \nis the question of doing away with State courts and Federal courts--\nbasically a court-stripping bill.\n  The Senator from Utah is right when he says there should be \nbipartisan concern on juvenile justice. And I believe there is. But if \nhe is worried about what is taking a lot of time--when we have all of \nthese provisions, and when presented by Democrats they are all voted \ndown on a party-line vote, and then the next day they are brought up in \na Republican amendment and now they are OK--maybe we would do it a \nlittle bit quicker if we would vote on them irrespective of which side \nbrought them up and be able to vote on them only once.\n\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey, and then 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  What we see here--and I apologize if we have exhausted the patience \nof the Senator from Utah, but we have been in this situation before \nwhere patience runs out. I heard the Senator from Utah, who is one of \nthe most concerned people about children and family that I know. But he \nsaid: This isn't about guns; it is not all guns. I agree. It is about \nlife. It is about saving people's lives. But we do not focus on that. \nThe argument against the Lautenberg amendment, as originally presented, \nwas: It is bureaucratic and we ought to do more law enforcement.\n  If we are going to do more law enforcement, I assume that means \nbigger government, I assume that means spending more money for the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms personnel. Unfortunately, what \nwe see is this persistent backpedaling, trying to make it up. Aha, the \npublic caught us. They caught us with a mistake, with another error \nthat protects those who want to avoid having background checks, so we \nhad better fix it.\n  They worked like the devil to keep people from voting for the \noriginal Lautenberg amendment, which said: Close all the loopholes in \nthe gun shows that permit people to buy guns without background checks.\n  I refer, just for 1 more minute, to the poll which says 87 percent of \nthe people in the country say that all people who buy guns at the gun \nshows should have background checks.\n  Sixty percent of Americans blame the tragedy in Littleton in \nsignificant measure on the availability of guns. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n  As mistakes were made in the presentation on the other side, \nnevertheless, before I leave the subject, six Republicans voted on the \nLautenberg amendment positively, but now we see the errors creep in.\n  First, the statement was made that only 2 percent of the guns bought \nat gun shows were bought without background checks. Then there was a \nrealization. The distinguished Senator from Idaho said, no, he was \nwrong. It was 40 percent. It is close--2 percent, 40 percent. How many \nguns is that? It is a lot when there are 4,000 gun shows a year.\n  Then we had another presentation yesterday that said we are closing \nthe loopholes. Well, we have attempted to close one of the loopholes, \nbut every time they get caught with an error or a decision not to close \nanother loophole, they come back again, because it gets exposed on \ntelevision. It gets exposed in the newspapers.\n  Last night, there was a program on ABC called ``Extra,'' and they \nshowed a film, a camera secreted in a hidden spot, of a 15-year-old \ngirl and a 17-year-old boy buying guns. He said, I am 17; she said, I \nam 15. They were able to buy those guns.\n  Why can't we shut it down once and for all?\n  I have a letter here. The Senator from Utah said there was no \nresponse from the administration. It is addressed to Senator Lott. It \nwas sent by Secretary Rubin and Attorney General Reno. It says:\n\n       This amendment would seriously impede the effectiveness of \n     the national instant criminal background check system. It \n     would reduce from 3 business days to just 24 hours the \n     period of time that law enforcement has to ensure that \n     firearms sold at gun shows are not being sold to felons \n     and other prohibited persons.\n\n  There is flaw after flaw, and the Senator from Utah said that is why \nwe are here; we are fixing them.\n  We will never fix it that way. Anyone who knows Senate procedure \nknows that you fix the flaws in the committee or you fix the flaws in a \nprivate discussion on the floor. You don't suddenly throw up an \namendment and say, I ask unanimous consent to modify my amendment. If \nyou are caught with your hand in the cookie jar, then, by goodness, \nstep back and say, OK, let's find out what we did wrong. Let's find out \nif we can agree on closing all the loopholes.\n  This may be an exhausting procedure, but it is more exhausting for\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\nthose people who are threatened by the casual presence of guns all \nover. We don't need to add to that quantity by not requiring background \nchecks. We close one loophole, but there are others. There is the \npawnshop loophole. There is the one that says all records have to be \ndestroyed after 24 hours. What kind of a database do we have that we \ncan refer to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I hope we will defeat this and have a \nchance to reconsider this proposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for \nthe balance of the time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair and thank the Senators from Vermont \nand New Jersey for their consideration and leadership on this issue.\n  Let me say, again, even with the new Hatch-Craig amendment, which I \nunderstand the Senator from Utah has offered in the best of faith, \nthere are three and possibly four major problems.\n  No. 1, it does not close the pawnshop loophole. Felons will flock to \npawnshops and get guns. Why are we taking a step backward less than a \nmonth after Littleton? Why are we telling criminals around the country, \nyou can go to a pawnshop, get a gun, no questions asked? How can this \nbody vote for that given what just happened in Littleton? What is the \njustification? What is the reason to allow pawn dealers to give guns to \ncriminals, no questions asked? There is absolutely none.\n  All of America is scratching its head and saying, what is going on in \nthis Chamber? Some say it is not the gun lobby. Well, I would like to \nknow what it is that is making us do the most irrational, ridiculous \nthings that make it easier for criminals to get guns after what we have \nseen happen.\n  No. 2, this modification puts a stranglehold on the Brady law. It \nsets a 24-hour time limit for gun show sale background checks, only 24 \nhours. Do you know what the FBI says they need? They say they need 3 \ndays. That is what Federal licensed dealers get. When the FBI says give \nus 3 days, they get it. But not at a gun show. So if they can't find \nthe records within 24 hours, the gun will go right to a criminal. What \nkind of loophole is that? Why do we need it? Again, if it is not the \ngun lobby that is pushing us to do this, then who is it?\n  Finally--this is not even about the modification that was mentioned--\nthe bill undermines the law by weakening prohibitions on interstate \nsales. Dealers would now be able to go to gun shows outside their \nStates and sell firearms directly to residents of other States, even \nthough they may not know the firearms law of that State. Why is that? \nWhy are we allowing gun dealers who have been previously limited to \ntheir own State on the grounds that they know the laws of the State, \nthat they know the people of the State, to go across the Nation to sell \ntheir guns? If it is not the gun lobby, my colleagues, then what is it?\n\n  So even with the modification that the Senator from Utah has so \ngraciously offered--and I will get to that in a minute--you have \npawnshops being able to sell guns to criminals with impunity. You have \nno kinds of checks when the FBI says it might be a criminal, give us \nthe time, the 72 hours. And you allow gun dealers to go from one end of \nthe country to the other and sell out of the State for the first time.\n  Then, finally, on the gun show loophole, if you really wanted to fix \nthis, you would pass the bill we had before us 2 days ago, the bill \nthat was sponsored by the Senator from New Jersey, cosponsored by me.\n  Let me say this: 2 days ago I brought up on the floor to the Senator \nfrom Idaho that there were mistakes in the bill. The next morning they \nsaid, yes, there were. They were corrected; some of them, not all. Last \nnight, I went quietly over to the Senator from Utah in the hallway and \nsaid that you have a major loophole in this called ``special \nlicensees.'' If I or the Senator from New Jersey or the Senator from \nVermont were trying to obfuscate, we would have just laid in wait, not \nbrought that up to you and not looked at the correction.\n  I say this: It is only fair to give us some time to look at the \nlanguage here, because twice what we were told was in the bill was not \nin the bill. I think something is going on here. We are trying to act \nas if we are being tough on gun control but then put so many loopholes \nin the bill that we can say to our friends on the other side, hey, see, \nwe really didn't mean it. It is sort of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\n  I am also told, in all fairness, by the Senator from Utah--and I \ndon't know, because the language hasn't been analyzed--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, each year half a million guns are stolen \nand thousands of violent crimes are committed with stolen guns. \nFurthermore, approximately half of the juvenile gun related crimes in \nthis country involve stolen guns.\n  To address this problem, I am pleased the amendment pending before \nthe Senate to S. 254, includes provisions to increase the maximum \nprison sentence for existing stolen gun laws. This provision is based \non S. 728, the Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1999, which I \nintroduced on March 25, 1999.\n  The extent of this problem was recently underscored by several news \nreports and studies. Reports indicate that almost half a million guns \nare stolen each year. Each year, the Federal Bureau of Investigations \nalone receives an average of over 274,000 official reports of stolen \nguns. A large number of stolen guns also go unreported. Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms studies note that convicted felons often \nchoose to steal firearms as a way to avoid mandatory background checks.\n  In my home State of Colorado, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation \nreceives over 500 reports of stolen guns each month. As of this March, \nthe Bureau had a total of 36,000 guns on its unrecovered stolen \nfirearms list, with about one-third of them being handguns.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the stolen gun problem is especially \nwidespread and alarming among young people. A Justice Department study \nof juvenile inmates shows that over 50 percent of them had stolen a \ngun.\n  Clearly, with half a million guns being stolen each year, those \ncriminals and juveniles stealing guns must not be very deterred by the \ncurrent penalties. A provision within the bill before us today would \naddress this problem by increasing prison sentences for violating \ncurrent stolen firearms law provisions from a maximum of 10 years to a \nmaximum of 15 years imprisonment.\n  Specifically, under current federal law, it is illegal to steal a \nfirearm from any person including licensed firearm collectors, dealers, \nimporters, and manufacturers. It is also illegal to knowingly \ntransport, ship, receive, possess, conceal, store, sell, or otherwise \ndispose of a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. Current sentencing \nguidelines cap the penalty for violating these stolen gun laws at a \nmaximum of 10 years imprisonment. My provision calls for increasing the \nmaximum prison sentence from 10 years to 15 years, and directs the \nUnited States Sentencing Commission to revise the Federal sentencing \nguidelines with respect to these firearms offenses.\n  While I am a strong supporter of the rights of law abiding gun \nowners, I also firmly believe we need tougher penalties for criminals \nwho steal guns or use stolen guns to commit crimes. This stolen gun \npenalty enhancement provision will send a clear signal to criminals \nthat stealing or using stolen guns is something we take very seriously.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this provision.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let us see if I can bring some order to \nthis. We did say last night we were going to try to come up with \nlanguage that would address Senators' concerns.\n  I hesitate to say this, but the distinguished Senator from New York \nhad the language before I did. It was only a matter of minutes, but he \ndid. It is only a one-paragraph thing. But rather than continue the \nheated debate, I will ask my colleague, the distinguished Senator from \nVermont, if he will work with me. Let us see if we can work out this \nlanguage so that we can solve this, so that your side is happy with it. \nI am personally happy with the Hatch-Craig amendment. But to the extent \nwe can do that, we will do that.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah and I have had a \nchance to discuss this during the debate. I think this is the wise way, \nto go ahead and vote on the amendment before us without the \nmodification. The Senator from Utah and I will work during the morning. \nWe are stuck here like everybody else this weekend so let us work on \nthis. It has come in at such a late time and this is such a technical \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Utah.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator Louisiana (Mr. Breaux), the \nSenator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), and the Senator from New York (Mr. \nMoynihan) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) is \nattending a funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Dodd) and the Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) \nwould each vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 118 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Breaux\n     Dodd\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Moynihan\n  The amendment (No. 344) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 350\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 5 \nminutes debate on the Schumer amendment, to be equally divided in the \nusual form. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will Senators please clear the aisle and take \ntheir conversations off the floor.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment is a very simple one. It \nrequires Internet web sites which offer at least 10 guns for sale to be \nfederally licensed firearm dealers--no more, no less. It closes the \nloophole which has allowed unlicensed, and only unlicensed, gun brokers \nto set up web sites offering thousands of guns for sale.\n  Right now, if you punch into the web you will see legitimate gun \ndealers who will continue just as they have been, and you will see lots \nof unlicensed gun dealers.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. The Senator \nfrom New York deserves to be heard on this issue, as will I.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Again, this bill has no effect on chat rooms, on \nnewspaper want ads, or on licensed dealers in any way. It does not \nrestrict advertising or the sale of guns on the Internet. It is a very \nsimple and modest measure which says that unlicensed dealers cannot--\ncannot--sell guns on the Internet. If they wish to become a dealer, \nwhich is relatively easy, then they will be able to.\n  The entire nature of the black market in guns will make a quantum \nleap if we do not deal with this problem. The Internet has already \nbecome for some, and will become for many, the method of choice by \nwhich children, criminals, and the mentally incompetent get guns. \nPresently the unlicensed dealers sell their guns completely on the \nhonor system. Let me quote one, GunSource.com:\n\n       Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, \n     we cannot confirm that each user is who they claim to be.\n\n  That is how a 17-year-old Alabama boy got a semiautomatic last month.\n  The Weapons Rack:\n\n       It is the sole responsibility of the seller and buyer to \n     conform to regulations.\n\n  My colleague from Idaho said last night there are laws on the books. \nYou can't enforce them on the Internet unless you have a dealer, \nbecause if somebody says on the Internet that he is 22 and gets a gun \nmailed to him and he is really 14, the post office is not going to open \nevery piece of mail that might have a gun. We wouldn't want them to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to finish my \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Just this morning we did not close the gun show \nloophole. Maybe we will, but we have not. Let us not say the same about \nthe Internet loophole. We can easily close it by simply requiring \neveryone who sells to be a licensed dealer.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Senators who just voted for the immediate \npast amendment have voted to clarify and limit advertising on the \nInternet, both for guns and explosive materials. Remember, the Internet \nis an advertising medium. Guns do not materialize through the screen of \nthe computer if you order them. In fact, if you order a gun on the \nInternet, here is what American Guns says:\n\n       Please note, a buyer must first call the seller of the gun, \n     confirm the price available, arrange for a Federal-firearms-\n     licensed dealer in your State to receive shipment. Your FFL \n     dealer must send a copy of their license to the seller.\n\n  The Senator from New York mentioned the 17-year-old Alabama boy. If \nthat happened--and I am not saying it did not happen; he has the news \nstory--three laws were broken. Three laws were broken. The teenager \nattempting to buy the gun broke a law. The person who trafficked the \ngun, transported it, broke a law--you cannot transport a gun through \nthe mail service, through a common carrier. There has to be contact in \nthese relationships or laws are broken.\n  I must also tell you, although I am not a constitutional attorney, he \nwalks all over commercial speech. This is advertising. We have \ncorrected those kinds of things in our bill to make sure we keep the \nInternet clean, but we went one step further, we went after the \nexplosive materials and the kinds of devices that were used in \nLittleton. I think all of us want that corrected. That is what you \nvoted for. Let's not trample on the marketing that goes on, advertising \non the Internet. Let's keep this bill and the Internet clean and \nprotect those kinds of rights.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, is all time yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds remain.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I do hope this amendment will be tabled. I \nintend\n\n[[Page S5327]]\n\nto move to table it. I know my colleague is very sincere about it, but \nI am concerned about decent, law-abiding people and having these \nonerous burdens placed upon them.\n  Mr. President, I move to table. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 350.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), \nthe Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), and the Senator from Florida (Mr. \nMack) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The distinguished majority \nleader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators--and I \nsee there are a few still interested in what the schedule may be; a few \nhave decided they will worry about it next week--I will propound a \nunanimous consent agreement now that would allow for a list of \namendments to be locked in and passage time of this vital piece of \nlegislation.\n  I know that Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy, Senator Biden, and \nSenator Sessions have spent a lot of time trying to craft this \nlegislation, and there are some good features in here. I am sure there \nare a lot of Senators who have agreed or disagreed with certain parts \nof it, but there are a lot of good things that have been included. If \nthis agreement can be entered into, then this vote that would be coming \nup would be the last vote until Tuesday morning. If the agreement \ncannot be reached, then we have no other alternative but to keep going \nforward today and have votes to try to dispense with this legislation.\n  I think it is important that we get the list locked in and find a way \nto bring it to a reasonable conclusion, with Senators being able to \noffer amendments and have debate during the day today and on Monday, \nand then we would have votes on Tuesday and Tuesday night.\n  It is very hard for the leadership to try to honor all Senators' \nrequests. First of all, all Senators knew that we would be having votes \ntoday, and yet a lot of them have complained about it and have now \nleft. It is very hard to get amendments accommodated and voted on when \nSenators say: I do not want to vote Thursday night. Or when we have \nSenators that say: I have to be gone Friday. Or when we have Senators \nsay: I have amendments I want to offer, but I don't want to do it \nThursday night, Monday or Friday. I want to do it Tuesday afternoon \nwhen it is convenient for me, even though it may inconvenience 99 other \nSenators.\n  I am asking Senators, please, be reasonable. I know on both sides \nthere has been an effort to narrow down the list and get a way that we \ncould have votes on key amendments and bring it to a conclusion. But it \nis very hard when you have that kind of attitude with Senators saying: \nI don't want to do it on Thursday night or I don't want to do it on \nFriday or I don't want to do it on Monday. I would like to do it at my \npleasure, Wednesday afternoon.\n  I hope we can at least lock in amendments where they won't continue \nto grow. We have had a lot of good debate and a lot of good amendments.\n  I now ask consent the following amendments be the only remaining \nfirst-degree amendments in order, with relevant second-degree \namendments in order only after a vote on or in relation to the \namendment and the amendments limited to time agreements where noted, \nall to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  I further ask that all first-degree amendments be offered and debated \non Friday and Monday's session of the Senate, with votes stacked to \noccur in the order offered beginning at 9:45 a.m. on Tuesday, with 5 \nminutes for debate equally divided prior to each vote.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the listed first-\ndegree amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage to \noccur, all without any intervening action or debate.\n\n  I do have a list of amendments and I need to, I believe, read and \nsubmit them. I will just send it to the desk.\n  I believe Senators Reid and Daschle have a list of amendments on \ntheir side they would like--are you going to submit those to the desk \nnow?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the majority leader has propounded a \nunanimous consent request, reserving the right to object, let me just \nrespond first by sympathizing with his lament about scheduling votes. \nIt is extraordinarily difficult, and both of us are confronted daily \nwith requests for certain prerequisites with regard to votes that make \nit increasingly difficult for us to schedule legislative debate. There \nare people who are objecting to votes now even on Friday mornings. I \nremember Senator Mitchell once lamenting to me personally that the only \ntime he could absolutely schedule a vote without any criticism was \nWednesday afternoon. I think there is a lot of truth to that. Now I \nknow fully what he meant. And that is before 7:00.\n  We have been on this bill for 3 days. We have had 15 amendments \noffered, and there have been good debates. There have been time limits \nassociated, as I understand it, with each one of the amendments. There \nhave been 14 rollcall votes. Our side alone began with a list of 89 \namendments, and I do not in any way diminish the importance of any one \nof those amendments. I think that they are all worthy amendments. Not \none of them was dilatory, not one of them was irrelevant to this bill. \nThe problem, however, is that with the extraordinary work of Senator \nReid and Senator Dorgan, we have now been able to persuade our \ncolleagues to reduce that list. Many of them have waited patiently with \nthe expectation that if they waited patiently, they would get their \nturn. In many cases, they have waited now 3 or 4 days to be able to \noffer their amendment.\n  Now what we are telling them is that we want you to offer them today \nor Monday, even though we have spent 3 days and we have only been able \nto get through 15 amendments. We have been able to get our list down to \naround 30 amendments, as I understand it. So it would be very \ndifficult, without further cooperation on both sides, to accommodate \nthe unanimous consent request that the majority leader has \nunderstandably propounded.\n\n[[Page S5328]]\n\n  So we will have to object to his request. We would be more than \nwilling to enter into an agreement that would require a complete \nlisting of all the amendments to be offered with time limits. We will \noffer amendments today and Monday, filling the day today, and then on \nMonday, in an effort to move this legislation along, and then stack \nvotes on Tuesday, as the majority leader has requested.\n  What we can't agree to, given where we are right now, is any time \ncertain for final passage--recognizing the majority leader's desire to \nwork through a number of other bills yet next week. At least right now, \nthat is not something that we can agree to. I hope, at the very least, \nas the majority leader suggested, we can submit the list, work on that \nlist, and we can even tighten up the time limits. I think that is all \ndoable.\n  So I have to object to the request as it was propounded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will have another suggestion on what we \nmight be able to do in a moment. I want to remind Senators that next \nweek we have the Y2K liability issue that we need to have concluded. \nThe House has voted on that. The clock is running. This is not an issue \nwe can leave unclarified any longer, because we are fast approaching \nthe time when this liability question has to be known and dealt with in \none way or the other because we are fast approaching the turn of the \nclock into the next millennium. We also have, after a lot of \ndifficulty, the supplemental appropriations bill, which we have waiting \nin the wings. We need to bring that up. We also have the bankruptcy \nbill that is scheduled for next week--a bill that has overwhelming \nbipartisan support on both sides. That bill is beginning now to be \nsqueezed out of the picture because of other bills.\n  I want to complete this bill. Two years of effort has been put into \njuvenile justice, and we need to have some decision made in that area. \nWe have had amendments, and more will be offered, on violence in the \nschools and how we deal with it, and violence in the movies, and the \ngun issue. So we need to try to find a way to conclude it.\n  I will then propound another UC, the same as the earlier one, with \nvotes occurring on Tuesday morning, stacked. Those amendments that had \nbeen debated on Friday and Monday, beginning at 9:45, with 5 minutes of \ndebate; and instead of asking that following disposition of the listed \nfirst-degree amendments the bill be advanced to third reading and \npassage occur all without any intervening action or debate, I will \nmodify that to say we will go to third reading and final passage at 5 \no'clock on Tuesday. That way, we would have the debate on amendments \nthe rest of today, on Monday, votes on Tuesday morning, more amendments \nand debate with time limits, and final passage to occur no later than 5 \no'clock on Tuesday afternoon.\n  Then we would be prepared to have a vote on the Y2K liability issue \nand go to the supplemental on Thursday, hopefully completing it. \nAlthough the supplemental can't be completed probably in just a couple \nof hours; it will take a little longer. Then we would go to bankruptcy \nafter that. I will make that request. The Senator suggested that we go \nahead and use the bulk of Tuesday. I think that is fair, and I hope we \ncan get this agreed to.\n  Remember, I made a commitment to call up this bill so we could have \nthis debate, and I made a commitment to bring it up on last Tuesday, I \nguess. Actually, we started on Monday. We agreed we would work to try \nto complete it on Thursday. That effort has been made by Senator \nDaschle, along with Senator Reid, and I appreciate that. We haven't \nbeen able to achieve that. So we will have other amendments and debate \non Friday, Monday, votes on Tuesday morning, more debate, amendments \nand votes Tuesday afternoon, but finish it up Tuesday. That will have \nbeen a full week. That will have been 7 days we will have spent on it. \nI believe that we will have been able to craft, hopefully, a good bill, \nand we have all been able to make our case and get to a conclusion. I \nmake that request.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first of \nall, I failed to mention my admiration for our two managers and the \nexcellent job they have done in getting us to this point. This has not \nbeen easy. They have worked diligently on both sides to bring us to \nthis point. I want to reiterate my gratitude for the effort they have \nmade to get us here.\n  In the 103rd Congress, we spent 11 days on a bill of this kind. It \nwas a very important piece of legislation--I guess it was 12 days. So \nit is difficult to bring up a bill of this complexity and controversy \nwithout having the opportunity to spend some time on it. As the \nmajority leader noted, he has brought this up, as he promised he would, \nopen to amendment. I have indicated that if we were to do that, I would \nwork as hard as I could to ensure that we stayed on the bill and worked \ndiligently to ensure that it is completed in a reasonable time. My hope \nwas that we could do it this week. I think we will get it done in a \nreasonable time early next week.\n\n  I am unable to agree to that time limit just because, again, we don't \nknow what the circumstances will be Tuesday. But I will promise this: \nWe will continue to make the effort we have made over the last few \nhours to lock in time limits on all of the amendments and to make sure \nthere is no quorum call, or any other intervening time that would be \ndilatory. We want to back these up, one after the other. So we will \nagree to a list and time limits, but I will have to object to a time \ncertain for final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the minority \nleader, and I appreciate his usual courtesy. But just stop and think \nabout this. There has been all this time on this bill. If we were to \nvote on it today, it would pass overwhelmingly. It would make a \ntremendous amount of difference to this country at a time when that \ntremendous amount of difference needs to be made.\n  We all know how this game works around here. If we don't put a \nfinality to it--and our leader has tried to do that--in this very tight \ntime-constrained situation, with Y2K and all the other bills that have \nto come up, defense bills, the supplemental appropriations bills, and \nother types of appropriations bills, we will wind up spending another 4 \nor 5 days, or maybe even 2 weeks, on this bill. I know the majority \nleader does not have that much time and neither do we on this side.\n  If we wind up without a juvenile justice bill this year after we have \ncome this far, I think it would be catastrophic for this Nation. The \nnext time we have another situation like the Columbine massacre, I \nwonder what kind of excuse we are going to use at that time if we \ndidn't do the very best we could.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side will think this through. We \nare seeing a situation that could bring this bill down because we don't \nhave the time to play politics with it. To have everybody bring up \ntheir amendments--we could go on for years with amendments on juvenile \njustice. We have done that for 2 years now. I know the distinguished \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee has worked closely with me to \nget this to a conclusion.\n  I think this is a pretty fair offer. I understand the minority leader \nmay not be able to get his people together on this at this particular \ntime. But let me tell you, I can't blame our majority leader if he has \nto pull this down and get the other bills done under these \ncircumstances. I am very concerned.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in view of the objection, I will get the \namendments locked in.\n  I ask unanimous consent, then, that the following amendments be the \nonly first-degree amendments in order, with relevant second-degree \namendments in order, only after a vote on or in relation to the \namendment and the amendments limited to time agreements, where noted, \nall to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  I have sent to the desk my list of amendments.\n  The list is as follows:\n\n                      Juvenile Justice Amendments\n\n       B. Smith--relevant.\n       B. Smith--relevant.\n       B. Smith--judges/felons\n\n[[Page S5329]]\n\n       B.

Mr. President, do we have Senator Daschle's list of \namendments?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes. We submitted it.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Reserving the right to object, is there a list of \namendments?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes. Senator Ashcroft's amendment is on the list.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I have no objection.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure I \nknow what is on the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request by the \nmajority leader?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, very much, Mr. President. At least we have \nlocked in the amendments where they will not continue to multiply. But \nI don't view this as a positive development. It is unfortunate. If \nSenators are waiting to see if there are any now, there will not be any \nfurther rollcall votes today. The next rollcall vote will occur \nprobably at 9:30 Tuesday morning. But we will need to make sure, and we \nwill make the Democratic leader aware of the exact time and the vote. I \npresume that vote will be on Y2K.\n  I yield to Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the distinguished majority leader \nis saying it is not a positive development. Of course it is. We have \ncut back very substantially on the number of amendments. On this side, \nwe cut out two-thirds of our amendments. We have worked very closely. I \nhave not had a single Senator on the Democratic side who failed to \nagree to a time agreement every time the distinguished majority \nmanaging Senator wanted it. They have agreed, in fact, to each and \nevery single one. In fact, we have had Senators who brought up \namendments who took less time to debate the amendments than some of the \nrollcalls have taken while we have waited to see who had to leave.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could respond, just to show you what I am talking \nabout, at least this stops them from multiplying. But this is a \npathetic accomplishment. There are 100 Senators, and we have about 75 \namendments left. Please, let's get serious. Every Senator doesn't have \nto offer an amendment. We can make our case about what we think is \npositive juvenile justice and what is causing the violence in our \ncountry and the violence in our schools. I think it is a societal and a \ncultural problem. I don't think it is as a result of guns in this \ncountry. It is why these things are happening, not what and who.\n  This is very minimal. It is a very, very disappointing \naccomplishment. We will have to evaluate now how to proceed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator could respond on that, he \nsaid there are 100 Senators, and they don't all have to put them in.\n  In 1994 we had the crime bill. It was on the floor for 12 days--over \n3 weeks. There were 99 amendments. Maybe there was one Senator who did \nnot have one. I mention that only because of what the Senator from \nMississippi said. But there were 99 amendments, a great bulk of them \ncoming from the other side. And in no way did the then Democrat \nmajority seek to cut them down. It took 12 days--over 3 weeks. The \npredecessor to this is S. 10. The Judiciary Committee, under the \ndistinguished leadership of the Senator from Utah, met in the \nsummertime for over 6 weeks to work on 55 amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I might respond.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We can clip through these things.\n  Mr. LOTT. If we have to spend a month on a bill, or 6 weeks on a \nbill, how many bills are we going to be able to take up that are \nimportant to our country? The defense authorization bill is one that we \nhave to take up next week. It is extraordinarily important, because \nhere we are with our troops engaged in combat at this very moment. We \nhave to get that work done.\n  It is a very interesting crossfire you get into when we are saying, \nwait a minute, we have to have 99 amendments, we have to have 6 weeks, \nor 11 days, on this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am not suggesting that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Then the argument is, why aren't we doing more bills? You \ncan't have it both ways.\n  Give it a reasonable time, give it full debate, have reasonable \namendments, and then vote.\n  I, frankly, feel used and put upon. I thought we were going to have a \ngood debate, have amendments, and complete this by Thursday night. I \nunderstood there was good effort being made. We said, OK, we will be in \non Friday, debate all day on Friday, and debate all day on Monday, with \nvotes Tuesday, and all day Tuesday. There has to be an end to this. \nThere has to be some reasonableness.\n  But look, we made our point, and now that we have the amendments \nlocked in, hopefully the managers and others can find a way to figure \nout how to end this. When they do, give me a call.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I just want to say to the majority leader how much I \nappreciate his leadership, and that of Senator Hatch. One reason we \nought not to have so many amendments is that Senator Hatch, in managing \nthis bill, has worked to accomplish and accommodate as many amendments \nas there could possibly be. I am just concerned that we don't have a \nfinal time agreement. I think that reflects and suggests there are some \nin this body who do not want a bill passed. I think it would not be \nhelpful. We need to pass\n\n[[Page S5330]]\n\nthis legislation. And we have accommodated greatly those who have \ndiffering views. I think it is a good bill, and it will be a tragedy if \nwe do not complete it. I know you have to have at some point a time \nlimit or we cannot continue with it. I hope the Members of the other \nparty will agree to a time limit.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, as the majority leader \nknows, there are some of us who have waited patiently. We have \namendments that are right on point with this legislation. We are \nconcerned about things like disproportionate minority confinement, some \nof the sort of sentencing that has to do with race, some of what is \nvery weak in this bill in addressing that. My colleague from Alabama \nsays it would be a tragedy if this bill didn't pass. Some of us think \nit would be a tragedy--let me finish if I could.\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to make it clear that I didn't yield the floor but I \nwould be glad to yield to the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you.\n  Some of us think it would be a tragedy if this bill passed in its \npresent form without an opportunity to try to make this a much better \nbill. I gave one example. I can talk about the amendments that deal \nwith juvenile justice and mental health. There has been very little \nfocus on that. I think there has to be a full-scale debate and \ndiscussion about what it means when so many kids of color are \ndisproportionately incarcerated. What does that mean in America? And \nwhat kind of legislation is this that does not allow States to do the \nkind of investigation they need to do, or that really doesn't give the \nStates the encouragement to do that kind of investigation so we can \nunderstand it better?\n  There are a lot of key issues here that are directly relevant to this \npiece of legislation. Nobody is talking about 6 weeks. Nobody is \ntalking about 1 month. But in all due respect, you brought the bill \nout. It is called the juvenile justice legislation.\n  I would like to have an opportunity to vote on this on the justice \npart. There are a lot of serious human rights abuses in some of these \nfacilities. I have visited some of these facilities in this country, \nsome of which are snake pits. I would like to make sure that these \nkids, even if incarcerated, are treated in such a way that it is \ncorrectional.\n  Don't tell me that the kinds of amendments I have in mind aren't on \npoint. I think we would be willing to move forward on this legislation. \nI want the majority leader to know that it is not a question of 6 \nweeks, it is just a question of some of us refusing to essentially be \nsqueezed and jammed, to be told: All right, now we don't focus on a lot \nof the substance of this legislation.\n\n  We have amendments. We are ready to debate these amendments. I will \nbet that if we even went another day, Tuesday, and we could offer \namendments Tuesday as well when people are here and then we finish as \nsoon as possible, that we would move forward--if I could just finish.\n  Mr. LOTT. Just one point.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I could finish my statement; I have been patiently \nwaiting here.\n  Let me just be crystal clear that when I hear colleagues from Utah \nand Alabama, both of my friends, say it is a great piece of \nlegislation, it would be a tragedy if it didn't pass right now, that \nthey have presupposed what is in doubt about a good piece of \nlegislation. Aren't there places where it could be corrected? Aren't \nthere things we could do better?\n  I give one example: the amendment I introduced with Senator Kennedy \nwhich deals with the whole problem of disproportionate minority \nconfinement. We need time to do that.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator would, perhaps I could go ahead and do my \nwork, and he could continue after that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I said what I needed to say.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator from Minnesota suggested that if they could \noffer amendments on Tuesday and get votes, that would be positive and \nwe could complete this bill. As a matter of fact, that is what I \nsuggested and it was objected to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. What I thought I heard was no debate, and that all \ndebate would be over.\n  Mr. LOTT. No. What I suggested was we have Senators--I realize it is \nhard for Senators to work on Fridays and Mondays. It is a real \ninconvenience. But what I suggested was the amendments be offered on \nMonday, on Friday, and debated, that amendments be offered all day \nMonday--the Senator could surely get his amendment offered on Monday, \nand I think it is one that ought to be offered and debated--have the \ndebate, and then on Tuesday we would vote on all those amendments that \nhad been offered up to that point, and have votes. Then we would go on \nto other amendments with time limits agreed to during Tuesday \nafternoon, and then have those voted on, and final passage by Tuesday \nafternoon.\n  That was objected to.\n  The problem is, Senators don't want to offer their amendments on \nMondays or Fridays or Tuesday afternoons. It really makes me question \nwhether they are serious about getting to a conclusion.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I could respond to the majority leader, I have \namendments that are on point. I am more than ready, willing and able to \ndebate these amendments, but I believe what Senator Daschle was saying, \nand this was the point I was trying to make, in all due respect, the \nsubstance of this legislation, the juvenile justice legislation, you \ncan't artificially say by the end of Tuesday that is it; surely, \nSenators don't have anymore amendments that deal with this topic; \nsurely, we don't have anymore time to spend on this.\n  We are talking about kids. We are talking about how to prevent kids \nfrom getting into trouble. We are talking about the best kind of \ncorrections for kids that get into trouble. We are talking about a lot \nof issues here.\n  I think Senator Daschle was saying you just can't simply say if it is \nnot done by Tuesday, it is all over, period.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 351\n\n (Purpose: To allow the erecting of an appropriate and constitutional \npermanent memorial on the campus of any public school to honor students \n    and teachers who have been murdered at the school and to allow \n students, faculty and administrative staff of a public school to hold \n an appropriate and constitutional memorial service on their campus to \n  honor students and teachers who have been murdered at their school)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, No. 351. I \nam pleased to join Senator Allard from Colorado in offering this \namendment.\n  It would allow the erecting of an appropriate and constitutional \npermanent memorial on the campus of any public school to honor students \nand teachers who have been murdered at the school and allow students, \nfaculty, and administrative staff of the public school to hold an \nappropriate service on their campus to honor these students and \nteachers.\n  I am horrified to find, and I think the American people would be \nhorrified to find, that there are those in this country who object to \nhaving appropriate memorial services on the school campuses for \nteachers and students who are murdered. This should clearly be included \nin this legislation.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Allard in that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott), for Mr. Allard, \n     for himself and Mr. Lott, proposes an amendment numbered 351.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . CONSTITUTIONALITY OF MEMORIAL SERVICES AND MEMORIALS \n                   AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress of the United States finds that \n     the saying of a prayer, the reading of a scripture, or the \n     performance of religious music as part of a memorial service \n     that is held on the campus of a public school in order to \n     honor the memory of any person slain on that campus does not \n     violate the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, and that the design and construction of any memorial \n     that is placed on\n\n[[Page S5331]]\n\n     the campus of a public school in order to honor the memory of \n     any person slain on that campus a part of which includes \n     religious symbols, motifs, or sayings does not violate the \n     First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (b) Lawsuits.--In any lawsuit claiming that the type of \n     memorial or memorial service described in subsection (a) \n     violates the Constitution of the United States--\n       (1) each party shall pay its own attorney's fees and costs, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, and\n       (2) the Attorney General of the United States is authorized \n     to provide legal assistance to the school district or other \n     governmental entity that is defending the legality of such \n     memorial service.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the majority leader \nfor giving me an opportunity to participate more fully in this \nlegislative process and for his profound concern for the people of \nColorado. The majority leader has been especially sensitive to this \ntragedy as it affected the students, parents, teachers, administrators \nand the support staff at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. I \nappreciate his willingness, along with the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, to work with me on possible solutions in the youth violence \nbill. There will be proposals to try and prevent future tragedies of \nthis nature in our Nation's schools. There will be those who will try \nand take advantage of this tragedy for their own personal gain. Sadly, \nin some cases, some people have already sought to gain from this \nhorror.\n  There will be those who will want to completely ignore the problem \nbelieving that it will go away on its own. There will be those who \nshare the views of many editorial writers in Colorado that this is a \nvery complicated issue and that no simple solutions are going to be \nforth coming. These writers echo my views that only a comprehensive \nexamination of all the contributing factors will yield smart, effective \npolicy.\n  The natural reaction is to seek simple solutions by laying blame. Was \nit inadequate laws? Inadequate enforcement? Do we blame parents, \nteachers, students themselves, administrators, politicians, \norganizations, the entertainment industry, churches, or the whole of \nsociety? Do we blame the Constitution of the United States?\n  We need to put all this finger pointing aside and realize that we \ndidn't come to this point overnight, that no one-thing is culpable, and \nthat finding sensible solutions will take some time. Now is the time to \nconcentrate and focus on what can be done about the emerging violence \nwe are seeing in our schools. This is the time for us to look for \nresponsible solutions. Now is the time to try and come up with common \nsense solutions that will make schools more safe.\n  The Constitution of the United States is one of civilization's \ngreatest documents. It has served magnificently as the basic governor \nof this nation, the world's greatest nation, as it has developed and \nthrived for over 200 years. The Constitution continues to serve us well \nand will serve us well as we go through dramatic change in the future.\n  It is the bedrock and the foundation that moves us through national \ncrises while preserving individual freedom. It empowers and checks the \ngovernment in thoughtful, humble, and timeless language. I would like \nto take this opportunity to briefly examine the Bill of Rights in the \ncontext of today's world and in light of the recent shootings in our \nschools.\n  During the most recent violent school crisis in Colorado and \npreviously in Oregon, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Mississippi, we are \nsuffered the sense of loss, pain, anger, and frustration from each \nevent. We collectively witnessed the anguish of students, teachers, \nparents, administrators, and law enforcement through an intense and at \ntime intrusive news media invasion. The wide and dramatic coverage of \nthese events often inspires copycat crimes. But we do not throw out the \nfirst amendment.\n  We have seen what happens in societies where there is no freedom of \nthe press. We have witnessed the danger of censorship and government \ncontrol of the media most recently in Iraq and Yugoslavia; ruthless \ndictators shut off the free flow of information to strengthen their \ngrip on people who don't enjoy the benefits of a free press! Yes, some \nwho report the news can be insensitive, irritating and down-right rude, \nbut the alternative is far worse. Most news reporting is responsible.\n  It seems as though we re flooded in today's world with acts of \nviolence from guns, knives, and bombs. Anger wells-up inside us as we \nread and witness such senseless acts of violence, especially in our \nschools which are supposed to be safe havens for learning. There are \nmany responsible, law-abiding Americans who own and use firearms today.\n  We have witnessed many cases where ruthless dictators have moved \nearly in their reign to disarm their soon-to-be victims. Yes, of the \n270 million people in this country there are a few who are a menace to \nsociety with the guns that they own, but we cannot forget the many \nresponsible gun owners in the United States. Guns have sporting uses, \nbut they also save lives. Let us not forget that guns have been used to \nprotect people, and they will continue to do so in the future.\n\n  The third amendment to the Constitution talks about the excesses of \nthe military in terms of the home. It recognizes the right of the \ncitizen to have his own home and to have it as his sanctuary free from \nany soldier claiming a greater right than the citizen. In times of \ncivil crisis we occasionally see the military used to ensure safety.\n  Most soldiers are dedicated and trustworthy servants of this country \nand it is only on the rare occasion that one is not. Throughout these \ncrises in our schools we have seen a highly charged and emotional \npolice force move to secure the area and conduct an investigation. \nPeople are calling for quick action, looking for people to blame, and \nbeing critical of every move. The fourth amendment protects students, \nteachers, administrators, and parents from unfounded accusations and \nunwarranted seizures. It protects them from the crafty criminal who may \nwant to shift the focus and action to an innocent party. One does not \nhave to look far to see that people in parts of Central America, Iraq, \nand Yugoslavia do not have this right. During these times of crisis in \nour schools, people in and around these institutions are protected by \ndue process of law.\n  They cannot be deprived of their life, liberty, and property without \ndue process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use \nwithout just compensation. Some Americans want to disregard these \nprovisions in a time of crisis. There are those who demand immediate \nresolution regardless of cost, but here we see the grandeur of the \nfifth amendment as it protects people from whims and the heat of a \ncrisis.\n  In any time of urgent need or catastrophe, the innocent may fall \nvictim to false accusations. This is particularly obvious when elected \nofficials are trying to show the electorate that they can produce \nresults. We have seen the innocent accused and then exonerated by the \njustice system in cases of violence in our schools, and for this we owe \nthe sixth amendment to our Constitution.\n  During these troubling times in our schools there are claims of \ninjury placed against those who have had a public responsibility. The \nvast majority of our public servants are good decent Americans who work \nto serve other people. There are a few, for one reason or another, who \nfail to carry out their responsibilities. The method for redress in \nthese sad circumstances is provided in the seventh amendment.\n  In responding to the horrific events in our schools the justice \nsystem is required to balance bail and punishment with the crime \ncommitted. The eighth amendment provides for this process to be fair \nand judicious.\n  And what of rights not clearly enumerated in the Constitution? The \nninth amendment expressly states that as sweeping and dedicated to \nliberty as the document is, it cannot provide for all freedoms. The \nninth amendment allows for the protection of rights not clearly defined \nby the Constitution indicating a wisdom that we embrace as we approach \nany crisis.\n  The 10th amendment prevents the Federal Government in times of crisis \nfrom ignoring the role of the States. Our forefathers feared most of \nall not the military but a national police force.  The individual \nstates were given the basic responsibilities of law enforcement, and in \ntimes of school crisis we have witnessed the effectiveness of this \nprovision. We have also witnessed\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\nthrough our history many nations terrorized by a national police force. \nIn these cases isn't an armed citizenry capable of defending itself the \npreferred but not perfect solution?\n\n  My purpose for reviewing these vital amendments to our Constitution, \nthis grand Bill of Rights, is to illustrate that in times of crisis, \nthese rights are the layers of a foundation of liberty on which we \nlive. This bedrock is the sacred strength of our nation. It is the \nbedrock that supports our churches, our homes, our businesses, and our \nschools. A natural tendency in times of crisis is to drive wedges into \nthis bedrock in search of a solution. It is my hope that we conduct \nthis debate upon the bedrock, and not within it.\n  I hope during this debate we keep in mind that we do not have the \npower to eliminate all violence in all schools. We must strive to \nrestore a safe environment for learning within the bounds of individual \nfreedom. A few must not be allowed to destroy that which the American \npeople have prospered and come to appreciate over several centuries. \nCommon sense and sensitivity must prevail.\n  In that light I believe there are things we can do to address school \nviolence. There are no simple solutions and it will not happen \novernight but I believe we can begin to move down that road by \nimproving the safety in our schools. Even though schools will be our \nfocus, the problems we face go far beyond the walls of any school, any \ncommunity, any state, or for that matter any country. The laws we pass \nwill have far reaching effects on numerous aspects of our society. I \nlook forward to proceeding through this legislative agenda in a \nthoughtful manner, mindful of our sacred responsibility to the bedrock \nof our nation--the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  I was recently given the honor and privilege of chairing a task force \non Youth Violence. This task force, composed of twelve Senators, has \nthoughtfully deliberated over the problem of youth violence for the \npast two weeks. Our efforts are, in part, a response to the recent \ntragedies seen in our nation's schools. We support S. 254, the Juvenile \nJustice bill, and the efforts of Chairman Hatch and his committee who \nhave labored for the past several years to draft careful reforms that \nwill positively impact our juvenile justice system. In addition, we \nhave come to a consensus on several themes which affect juvenile crime, \neducation and our culture. This package of legislative proposals \napplies reasonable reforms which we hope will enhance the work of \nSenator Hatch and his committee.\n  The consensus of themes our task force will be working toward this \nweek are:\n  Stengthening prevention and enforcement assistance to State and local \ngovernment. This is the first step in a plan which infuses funds to \nState and local authorities to combat juvenile crime. The Federal \ngovernment will assist states best by providing flexible block grants. \nOur plan includes juvenile crime grants; improving our management of \njuvenile crime records; targeted prevention funding; a plan for \ngraduated sanctions which begin early--when the first signs of \ndelinquent or antisocial behavior appear, and alternative education \nopportunities for at-risk or problem juveniles.\n  Another point is pushing back the influence of cultural violence by \nempowering parents and encouraging the public to be socially \nresponsible. Our second step is to help our culture do more to limit \nthe exposure of America's children to harmful and violent \nentertainment. Following the recent tragedy in my state, it seems clear \nthat our culture's fascination with violence played some role in the \nthoughts and motivations of the cruel perpetrators of the crimes in \nLittleton. This includes enacting an entertainment industry code of \nconduct that allows for further development and enforcement of rating \nsystems to limit exposure to children of material that the industry \nitself has deemed inappropriate for children. We include a plan to \ninvestigate the marketing practices of the entertainment industry where \nchildren are concerned. This plan also includes empowering Internet \nservice providers to offer screening and filtering software that is \ndesigned to empower parents to limit access to material unsuitable for \nchildren. Our package also includes a plan to prohibit the posting of \nbomb making instructions on the Internet.\n\n  Last, I am offering two amendments which liberate students and \nfaculty to hold memorial services or to construct a memorial on school \nproperty in the aftermath of a tragedy.\n  I will conclude my statement today with remarks on these amendments. \nThe final theme of our package reinforces the theme that it is time to \nget tough on violent juveniles and firearms used by criminals. The \nRepublican plan makes it more difficult for a juvenile to gain access \nto a firearm and insures that violent juveniles--teenagers who commit \nviolent crimes--will be held accountable for their actions. We do this \nby ensuring the prosecution of those who abuse existing firearms laws. \nThis means directing the Department of Justice to make firearms \nprosecutions a priority--something they have not been so far. We \naddress gun show safety and firearms background checks, juvenile \nfirearms possession, and penalties for firearms offenses across the \nboard. We increase the penalty for theft of a firearm and we increase \nthe mandatory minimum sentences for those who corrupt youth by selling \nthem or encouraging them to sell drugs.\n  We also address safe and secure schools. Republicans want all \nchildren to receive a quality education. This experience should be a \nsafe one. We propose numerous options for schools to use federal funds \nfor better teacher training regarding violent students and school \nsecurity. We provide for mandatory school discipline records disclosure \nfor transferring students; we allow for all schools the opportunity to \ninstitute address code or school uniform policy; and we free up \nteachers and school administrators to adequately discipline students \nwhile at the same time giving them limited liability protection. Our \nbill establishes a national center to boost school security efforts and \ncreates a national award for children with character.\n  In proposing this package, we do not pretend to believe our \nlegislative actions will erase the harm already inflicted on too many \nAmericans. Nor do we believe these laws will guard against all future \nthreats of youth violence. But I do believe that the Congress has an \nopportunity today to strengthen and enhance our existing laws to \nempower families and communities to take action against this cultural \nvirus seen in our youth.\n  Our responsibility is to apply reason and temperance to the decisions \nwe make this week, holding close the dearly held principles of life and \nliberty which are expressed in our Bill of Rights. I am hopeful that \nthe Senate will work together to accomplish this objective.\n  I would like to say a few words regarding my proposed amendments that \nwill be before the Senate the first part of this next week. In the \naftermath of the Littleton tragedy, I propose these amendments which \nwill allow Congress to go on record with respect to the \nconstitutionality of a permanent memorial or a memorial service that \ncontains religious speech. Of course, the Allard amendments do not put \nCongress on record with respect to the kind of memorial that would be \nappropriate--that decision is for local schools and communities. The \nAllard amendments do, however, declare that a fitting memorial may \ncontain religious speech without violating the Constitution.\n  As you approach Arlington National Cemetery, signs are posted which \nsay:\n\n       Welcome to Arlington National Cemetery, Our Nation's Most \n     Sacred Shrine. Please Conduct Yourselves with Dignity and \n     Respect at All Times. Please Remember these are Hallowed \n     Grounds.\n\n  Similarly, Congress appropriates the funds to pay for chaplains who \nconduct memorial services not only at Arlington Cemetery but wherever \nthey are needed to serve our departed men and women of the Armed Forces \nand their families. We recognize that paying for chaplains to conduct \nmemorial services is not an establishment of religion by the \nGovernment, but a dignified and proper Government function. The Supreme \nCourt has noted that the chaplaincies of the various branches of the \nservice are constitutional. Likewise, no one could seriously contend \nthat the signs identifying Arlington Cemetery as a sacred shrine and \nhallowed ground are establishments of religion.\n  So today I am offering an amendment which states that it is fitting \nand\n\n[[Page S5333]]\n\nproper for a school to hold a memorial service when a student or \nteacher is killed on school grounds. And it is fitting and proper to \ninclude religious references, songs, and readings in such a \nservice. Memorial services help the grieving process of students and \nfaculty, bring a school together in the face of tragedy, and meet a \nneed deeply felt by so many to see their friend given recognition in a \ndignified and solemn manner. My amendment allows students and faculty \nof a public school to hold a memorial service that includes prayer, \nreading of scripture, or the performance of religious music at a \nmemorial service that is held on the campus of a public school in order \nto honor the memory of any person slain on that campus.\n\n  As a part of my proposed amendment there is a section that allows for \nthe construction of a memorial that includes religious symbols or \nreference to God on school property. In either case, if a lawsuit is \nbrought forth, parties are required to pay their own fees and costs and \nthe Attorney General is authorized to provide legal assistance to \ndefenders.\n  This is not the equivalent of a daily school prayer. A memorial \nservice is a very specific response to an unusual circumstance, a \ncircumstance I hope we will not have to revisit again. The amendments \nspecifically mention that religious songs may be sung at such memorials \nwithout violating the Constitution. The two federal appeals courts that \nhave taken up this issue both have ruled that school choirs may sing \nreligious music. And the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that it \nwas constitutional for a public high school choir to have ``The Lord \nBless You and Keep You'' as its signature song.\n  In the same way, erecting a memorial that contained religious \nreferences, such as a quote from scripture, or a religious symbol from \nthe deceased's religious tradition, would not violate the establishment \nclause of the Constitution.\n  In any community visited by such a tragedy, a person who views such a \nmemorial with religious symbols or references that were important to \nthe deceased would certainly not see some sort of covert attempt to \nestablish an official religion. Rather, they would see a fitting and \nproper memorial to a departed friend.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my modest proposal. This legislation \ndoes two things. It requires that if a school holds memorial services \nor puts up a memorial in response to a killing on school grounds, and \nthe school is sued, then all parties will bear their own costs and \nattorneys fees. A school that has experienced a tragedy of this kind \nshould not have to worry about someone bringing a suit and winning \nthousands and thousands of dollars in attorney fee awards just because \nthe school decides to hold a memorial service or put up a memorial. \nSecond, this legislation permits--but does not require--the Attorney \nGeneral to aid a school in defending against these suits.\n  This is one small thing we can do to help our schools respond in a \nhumane, compassionate, and constitutional way to the violence that has \nbecome far too common in our schools. If the people of Colorado believe \nthat religious speech is necessary to memorialize the heroism and \ntragedy at Columbine High School, then let them express themselves with \nthe most profound and durable expressions of the human heart. Let us \nadopt this amendment today, hoping an occasion for its use may never \nhappen again.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/14/senate-section/article/S5333-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5333-S5335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       Y2K ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The question before the Senate is a motion to \nproceed to S. 96, the Y2K legislation.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I really think that is unfortunate. We have \nworked all week trying to resolve this issue. I have worked personally \nwith Senator Dorgan trying to whittle down these amendments. I have \nworked many hours these last couple of days.\n  We have now on our side and on the majority side worked to bring down \nthe amendments to a fairly good number. For the life of me, I cannot \nunderstand why we cannot proceed working all day today offering \namendments. We have people who are waiting to offer amendments. I have \nan amendment I will be happy to offer.\n  We have Senators who will talk into the night offering amendments. \nThere is no effort on behalf of the minority to delay this matter. We \nhave worked very hard to even get time limits on our amendments. We can \ncomplete this legislation very quickly. I have had the opportunity to \nlook through some of the amendments the majority has locked in under a \nprevious unanimous consent agreement. We can work today, all day \nMonday, and then Tuesday there would not be much left to do.\n  It is tremendously unfortunate that we are unable to proceed on this. \nI will tell you why, for a couple of reasons.\n  When I came home last night--I worked late on the emergency \nsupplemental. I got home around 9:30 or 10 o'clock last night and \nlooked through my mail. I was surprised to get a letter from a longtime \nfriend.\n  As some of my friends know, I was born and raised in Searchlight, NV, \na very small town. There are not a lot of people from Searchlight. But \nI received a letter from someone who was raised in Searchlight just \nlike me, someone older than I am but someone I have known literally all \nmy life.\n  I can remember when I was a 13-year-old boy. I moved from Searchlight \nto Henderson, NV, where there was a high school and I was living with \nan aunt.\n  Early one morning, we were all awakened because one of my uncles from \nSearchlight came to give us the very bad news that his stepdaughter had \nbeen shot while working at one of the hotels in Las Vegas by this \ncrazed man who shot her for no reason. He did not know her. She was \nvery, very attractive, and this man who should not have had a pistol \nshot her.\n  Much of what is in the letter is personal in nature--and not that \nthis isn't personal in nature--but the other relates to my family. But, \nlet me read the last paragraph. She closed this letter with:\n\n       Hope you can feel free to support all legislation knocking \n     down the strong gun lobby. I would like to personally shoot \n     the crotch out of Moses, also known as Charlton Heston. I \n     have 46 years of anger built up on this issue.\n\n  She is a paraplegic.\n\n       I know it can be political suicide to go up against them, \n     but they are rotten to the core\n\n[[Page S5334]]\n\n     and selfish in their interests. While I have the best of \n     friends and have managed to live (have not really had a life) \n     I dare them to follow me in my wheelchair tracks.\n\n  She closes by saying:\n\n       Stay well, sweet boy [talking to me].\n\n  This legislation we are attempting to resolve needs to be resolved. \nPeople may disagree with my friend from Searchlight now living in Las \nVegas, Jean McColl, who has spent 46 years in a wheelchair as a result \nof being shot by somebody that shouldn't have had a gun. But that is \nwhat we are debating in this Chamber.\n  We should have the opportunity to offer amendments. There is no \nreason in the world that we should not be able to offer the amendments. \nWe have 30-plus amendments on this side. By Tuesday I bet we could get \nrid of 25 of them, leaving on Tuesday just a handful of amendments to \nwork on.\n  I also not only indicate what was written by my friend, Jeannie \nMcColl, a beautiful, wonderful woman, who shortly after she was injured \nby this crazed man, was divorced and has raised this little boy by \nherself; in addition to the letter from Jeannie, I received another \nletter from a man who was complaining about something he felt was \nsomewhat improper. He lives in Reno.\n\n       Dear Senator Reid:\n       I am writing in regards to the enclosed National Rifle \n     Association membership that was mailed to my 13 year-old \n     daughter. I am not a gun advocate and have never voiced an \n     opinion and I certainly believe in our constitution and the \n     right to bear arms but I am rather astonished that the \n     membership application is addressed to my 13 year-old \n     daughter.\n       As we strive in our community to ensure that our schools \n     are safe for our children, one of the biggest fears that \n     parents have is a gun at school. We have been able to turn \n     her particular school around from a very violent and non-\n     academic oriented institution to one that we are all very \n     proud and where the students are doing extremely well.\n       I am absolutely amazed that the National Rifle Association \n     would have the audacity to mail membership applications to \n     children. At some point, I believe this must be part of our \n     government regulations. Will my youngest 11-year-old daughter \n     be contacted next with another outrageous suggestion that is \n     only supporting violence?\n\n  It is signed: ``David L. Brody, Registered Voter''--that is how he \nlists his signature--Reno, NV.\n  Mr. President, Jeannie McColl, David Brody--we need to move forward \nwith this legislation.\n  I see the majority leader. I certainly want to yield the floor to the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. Leader, what I have said here is that we have some amendments. We \nhave people standing by to offer amendments. We really would like to do \nthat. One of the Senators on the majority side objected to the offering \nof amendments.\n  I will be very brief. As I said, we want to work our way through \nthese, as I indicated before the leader got here. We have 30-plus \namendments. I think we could get rid of 20 of these amendments by \nTuesday morning if we had the opportunity to offer these amendments \ntoday and Monday.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. First of all, Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy, the managers \nof the bill, are not on the floor at this time. I assume they are still \nin the area. And I have a call in to Senator Hatch so he will come \nback. And we can discuss how we might proceed and see what amendments \nwe are talking about. Because you can certainly understand, it is hard \nto have the debate go forward without the managers knowing what \namendments we are talking about, and that they are sort of in an order.\n  I understand the Kohl amendment, for instance, was next in order, and \nmaybe even pretty much has been worked out. But I need to make sure \nthat that is the case. And then, secondly, there may still be somebody \nopposed to it and have indicated they want to be able to be heard on \nthe other side. So we have to make sure that Senators both for and \nagainst bills are protected in their desire to speak on an amendment. \nAnd that is basically it.\n  Senator Kohl is here. If there is no particular problem, then maybe \nwe could go to that one and have him present it and make his statement. \nIf there is a Senator opposed to it, he or she could come over. If not, \nwe could go on. But there is a need to make sure that everybody knows \nwhat is happening. And both sides are aware that they should come to \nthe floor and express themselves if they desire to.\n  The problem is, it is 12:15; it is Friday afternoon. As you know, it \nis very hard to work down this list of amendments when--once Senators \nrealize basically the votes are over, they have commitments, and they \nare gone. But I will talk with Senator Hatch as soon as we get in touch \nwith him and see if there is any problem with going forward with \nSenator Kohl. Then, of course, we need to go back and see if there is \nanother amendment on this side. We will work through that. But we have \nto make sure everybody is notified we are going to be trying to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished \nassistant Democratic leader for his efforts, again, and for comments he \nhas just made. I am puzzled. I thought we were going to proceed today \nwith additional amendments. We have submitted our list with that \nintention. We had indicated we were prepared to work this afternoon; we \nare prepared to work on Monday. But not having our managers here, it \nmakes it difficult.\n  Senator Leahy is here. And Senator Leahy has indicated a willingness \nto come back and work through these amendments. You know, this points \nup the very problem our colleagues have raised with us when we talk to \nthem about having the need to offer amendments on Fridays and Mondays.\n  If the Republican manager leaves, it is awfully hard for us to offer \nthese amendments. We want to make the most of Friday and Monday. The \nonly way we are going to do that is to have the Republican manager here \nso we can accommodate those Senators who want to cooperate. It is hard \nto ask for their cooperation if we do not have somebody on the other \nside to cooperate with.\n  So I am troubled by that and I hope we can make the most of this \nafternoon and make the most of Monday. I must say, Mr. President, I am \nalso surprised at the motion to file cloture on the motion to proceed. \nThat is tantamount to pulling this bill. That is what it means. If we \nget the motion to proceed we are on the Y2K bill. And I thought the \nmajority leader said he wanted to finish this bill on Tuesday.\n  Mr. LOTT. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. On that particular point, I do not know what the vote would \nbe on the cloture on the motion to proceed on Y2K. I suspect it may \npass, maybe even pass unanimously. At that point we are on that unless \nwe can get an agreement to come back to the juvenile justice bill, \nwhich I assume we could do, but with the understanding we get something \nworked out as to how we proceed.\n  I have been signaling all week that we wanted to go back to Y2K \nespecially, and we need to get started early since we had to file a \ncloture motion on even the motion to proceed. But you know, if we can \nget a solid, overwhelming vote on that, rather than spending 30 hours \non it, hopefully something could be worked out on that as to how we \nwould proceed to that, maybe right after the juvenile justice bill, and \nthat we could get agreement to come back to juvenile justice at that \npoint.\n  It is just that I had to get that ball rolling. And I assume and I \nhope maybe that is just one vote in what could be a series of votes. \nBut hopefully we will get something worked out on that. But I wanted to \nmake sure that--I am certainly amenable to trying to work out an \nagreement to go back to juvenile justice after we have that vote \nTuesday morning.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate that clarification and assurance from the \nmajority leader. As he knows, of course, that takes unanimous consent. \nThere may be people who oppose going back to the juvenile justice bill, \nand so then we are, under regular order, on the Y2K bill. So a vote for \ncloture on the motion to proceed would be a vote to table, to put back \non the calendar the juvenile justice bill.\n\n[[Page S5335]]\n\n  I have indicated to the majority leader that we would be prepared, \nbased upon the negotiations that have been going on all week, to maybe \nwork some arrangement out with regard to the Y2K bill. We hadn't had \nany discussion about this. The motion was filed, and so there was no \ncommunication at all on that matter--this, ironically, at the same time \nwe were trying to work with the majority leader to try to accommodate \nhis need to move this juvenile justice bill along.\n  Surprises are never welcomed, and this was a surprise that was \ndisappointing. Nonetheless, we will work through that. We will work to \naccommodate whatever other legislative schedule there may be this next \nweek.\n  I will say this: At this point I am very concerned about voting on \nthe motion to proceed under these circumstances. I think we could \nfinish this bill and then perhaps go on to the Y2K bill. I might even \nbe prepared to move to the motion to proceed and support it myself if \nwe can get this juvenile justice bill done. But to put it back on the \ncalendar and then ask unanimous consent to take it back off the \ncalendar, if we vote for cloture on the motion to proceed--and that is \nwhat we would have to do--is a matter that is disturbing.\n  We have a circumstance here that is confusing, to say the least. The \nmajority leader, for good reason, admonished all of us to make the most \nof Friday, to make the most of Monday, on the juvenile justice bill. \nThen he files cloture, effectively taking the bill off the calendar and \ndenying the right to offer amendments and to work through these \namendments on Friday and Monday. I am hopeful that we can make the \nmost. Let us work on these bills today. Let us work on them Monday. Let \nus see if we can't work through the rest of the amendments before we \ndivert our attention to other amendments and other bills.\n  This isn't a very orderly process we find ourselves in right now, \nunfortunately, because of some of these decisions. I am hopeful that we \ncan figure out a way to accommodate the needs of the schedule but also \naccommodate the needs of Senators who are very hopeful to have their \nday in court and their opportunity to offer amendments on the juvenile \njustice bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator yields the floor, may I ask a question \nof the leader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to entertain a question from the \ndistinguished Democratic assistant leader.\n  Mr. REID. The Y2K legislation that has been talked about here today, \nis it not a fact that there has been significant progress made trying \nto arrive at a resolution of that issue?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There has. Many people on both sides of the aisle have \nbeen involved in very intense and, I would say, productive negotiations \nthis week. I am encouraged by the reports I have been receiving \nthroughout the week on their discussions. I am hopeful that----\n  Mr. LOTT. Are you referring to the Y2K issue?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wasn't sure what you were talking about.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is certainly correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wonder if the Senator would yield. Is there a possibility \nwe could work out some agreement where we wouldn't have to have the \nvote on the motion to proceed? It is pretty hard to explain to people, \nwhen you are facing the threat of a filibuster even to take up a bill. \nSo I wonder if we could maybe get some agreement to skip over that and \nthen go on, if we had to have a cloture vote on the bill itself. I hope \nyou will think about that or talk to the people who are involved to see \nif that would be a possibility. That would perhaps then vitiate the \nnecessity of having to get this started next Tuesday in order to get it \ncompleted within a week's time. If we could get around that vote, that \nwould help.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to consult with our colleagues and \nreport back to the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, may I ask the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator is informed that we \nare on a motion to proceed on S. 96, the Y2K bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kohl \nbe permitted to present the Hatch-Kohl trigger lock amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I can't hear.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am asking that Senator Kohl be able to present the \nHatch-Kohl trigger lock amendment, and we will proceed. We will have \nthat, followed by the Hatch-Feinstein amendment on gangs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/14/senate-section/article/S5335-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5335-S5350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nVIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION \n                              ACT OF 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 352\n\n   (Purpose: To amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, to \n   require the provision of a secure gun storage or safety device in \n               connection with the transfer of a handgun)\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we have good news. We seem to have reached a \nbipartisan consensus on child safety locks, one which will result, we \nbelieve, in a lock being sold with every handgun. So I rise now, with \nmy colleague, Senator Hatch, to offer the Safe Handgun Storage and \nChild Handgun Safety Act of 1999.\n  This measure is closely modeled on the Child Safety Lock Act which I \nintroduced earlier this year, with Senators Chafee, Feinstein, Durbin, \nand Boxer. Senator Chafee is also a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Briefly, our amendment will bring the entire industry up to the level \nof those responsible manufacturers who have already started including \nchild safety locks with their handguns. It is a commonsense idea, not \nan extreme one, that will reduce gun-related accidents, suicides, and \nhomicides by young people.\n  Don't take my word for it. Ask your own constituents. According to a \nrecent Newsweek poll, 85 percent of the American people support this \nproposal.\n  Our amendment is simple, effective, and straightforward. While we \nwant people to use child safety locks, our amendment doesn't mandate \nit. Instead, our measure simply requires that whenever a handgun is \nsold, a child safety device must also be sold.\n  These devices vary in form, and effective ones are available for less \nthan $10. We have added a new section that gives limited liability to \ngun owners, but only if they store their handguns properly. This \nactually creates an incentive for more people to use safety locks.\n  Let me tell you briefly why this amendment is so much needed. Nearly \n2,000 young people are killed each year in firearm accidents and \nsuicides. This is not only wrong, it is unacceptable. While our \nproposal is certainly not a panacea, it will help prevent many of these \ntragedies.\n  Mr. President, safety locks will also reduce violent crime. Juveniles \ncommit nearly 7,000 crimes each year with guns taken from their own \nhomes. That doesn't include incidents like last year's school shooting \nin Jonesboro, AR, which involved guns taken from the home of one \nchild's grandfather because most of the father's guns actually were \nlocked up.\n  A few extremists on both sides may not agree, but this is clearly a \nstep forward. It will help make children safer. It will help make \nmothers and fathers feel more secure leaving their children at a \nneighbor's home. Senator Craig, who worked with me in 1994 to author \nthe ban on juvenile possession of handguns, deserves much credit today. \nWhen passed, this law will be a huge victory for our children and a \nvictory for bipartisanship as well. I hope my colleagues can all \nsupport this bill.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I send the Kohl-Hatch-Chafee amendment \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for himself, Mr. \n     Hatch and Mr. Chafee, proposes an amendment numbered 352.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, in Title--, General \n     Provisions, insert the following new sections:\n\n[[Page S5336]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Can we put this over for a vote until next Tuesday?\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote be \npostponed until the time set in an agreement of the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, our understanding is that the next \namendment will be the Hatch-Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. REID. May I ask the manager of the bill a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. We have people who are ready to come and offer amendments. \nCould you give an indication as to how long your presentation will \ntake?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think very little time. I feel badly that Senator \nFeinstein is not here. She may want to say a few words right before the \namendment comes up for a vote. We will offer some time there.\n  Mr. REID. What is ``very little time'' in Senate hours?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think I can explain the Feinstein amendment in probably \nless than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We want to make sure we have somebody ready when that is \nfinished.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 353\n\n       (Purpose: To combat gang violence and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Feinstein and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] for himself and Mrs. \n     Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 353.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand we will have time to debate \nthis more at a future time.\n  This amendment, which I am pleased to offer with the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, is a much refined version of legislation \nwe offered last Congress to address the serious and troubling issue of \ninterstate and juvenile gangs. I want to commend Senator Feinstein for \nher hard work and dedication on this issue.\n  Our amendment includes improvement to the current federal gangs \nstatute, to cover conduct such as alien smuggling, money laundering, \nand high-value burglary, to the predicate offenses under the penalty \nenhancement for engaging in gang-related crimes, and enhances penalties \nfor such crimes.\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\n  It criminalizes recruiting persons into a gang, with tough penalties, \nincluding a four year mandatory minimum if the person recruited is a \nminor.\n  It amends the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. 1952, to include typical gang \noffenses in its predicate acts.\n  It includes the James Guelff Body Armor Act, which provides penalty \nenhancements for the use of body armor in the commission of a federal \ncrime. This provision also prohibits the purchase, possession or use of \nbody armor by anyone convicted of a violent felony, but provides an \naffirmative defense for bona fide business uses, and enhances the \navailability of body armor and other bullet-proof technology to law \nenforcement.\n  It includes penalties for teaching, even over the Internet, how to \nmake or use a bomb, with the knowledge or intent that the information \nwill be used to commit a federal crime.\n  Finally, our amendment enhances penalties under the Animal Enterprise \nTerrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. 43, to address the growing problem of attacks \non businesses and research facilities, as well as establishes a \nclearinghouse to track such offenses. These crimes are increasingly \nbeing committed by some juvenile gangs, particularly in my state of \nUtah.\n  Gangs are an increasingly serious and interstate problem, affecting \nour crime rates and our youth. A 1997 survey of eighth graders in 11 \ncities found in 1997 that 9 percent were currently gang members, and \nthat 17 percent said they had belonged to a gang at some point in their \nlives. These gangs and their members are responsible for as many as 68 \npercent of all violent crimes in some cities.\n\n  My home state of Utah continues to have a serious gang problem. In \n1997, there were over 7,000 gang offenses reported to the police in \nUtah. Although we have seen some improvement from the unprecedented \nhigh levels of gang crime a couple of years ago, gang membership in the \nSalt Lake area has increased 209 percent since 1992. There are now \nabout 4,500 gang members in the Salt Lake City area. Seven hundred and \nseventy of these, or 17 percent, are juveniles.\n  During 1998, there were at least 99 drive-by shootings in the Salt \nLake City area. Also, drug offenses, liquor offenses, and sexual \nassaults were all up significantly over the same period in 1997. And in \nthe first 2 months of 1999, there were 14 drive-by shootings in the \nSalt Lake City area.\n  An emerging gang in Utah is the Straight Edge. These are juveniles \nwho embrace a strict code of no sex, drugs, alcohol, or tobacco, and \nusually no meat or animal products. Normally, of course, these are \ntraits most parents would applaud. But these juveniles take these fine \nhabits to a dangerous extreme, frequently violently attacking those who \ndo not share their purist outlook.\n  There are 204 documented Straight Edgers in Salt Lake City, with an \naverage age of 19 years old. Like most gangs, they adopt distinctive \nclothing and tattoos to identify themselves. Although not all Straight \nEdgers engage in criminal activities, many have become very violent \nprone. They have engaged in coordinated attacks on college \nfraternities, and a murder outside the Federal Building in downtown \nSalt Lake City last Halloween night was Straight Edge related. This \ncrime, in which a 15-year-old youth named ``Bernardo Repreza'' occurred \nduring a gang-related fight against the Straight-Edgers. Three Straight \nEdge gang members, have been charged with the murder.\n  Straight Edgers are also being recruited into, and more frequently \nlinked to, the radical animal rights movement. For instance, in 1996, \nJacob Kenison, then 16 and a Straight Edger, became so obsessed with \nanimal rights that he set fire to a leather store and \nreleased thousands of animals from two Salt Lake County mink farms. In \n1997, Kenison was charged in federal court for buying an assault rifle \nwithout disclosing he had been charged in state court. In December \n1998, Kenison, now 20 years old, was sentenced to 9 months in jail for \nthe mink release. The juveniles who committed the firebombing of a \nMurray breeders' co-op may have been Straight Edge, and have been \nlinked to the Animal Liberation Front, a loose network of animal rights \nactivists which advocates terrorist-like tactics.\n\n  And these gangs are learning some of their tactics on the Internet, \nwhich is why our amendment includes a provision making illegal to teach \nanother how to make or use an explosive device intending or knowing \nthat the instructions will be used to commit a federal crime, has \npassed the Senate on at least three separate occasions. It is time for \nCongress to pass it and make the law.\n  Sites with detailed instructions on how to make a wide variety of \ndestructive devices have proliferated on the Internet. As many of my \ncolleagues know, these sites were a prominent part of the recent \ntragedy in Littleton, Colorado.\n  Let me give my colleagues an example of one of these sites. The self-\nstyled Animal Liberation Front has been linked to numerous bombings and \narsons across the country, including several in my home State of Utah. \nPosted on their Internet site is the cyber-publication, The Final Nail \n#2. It is a detailed guide to terrorist activities. This chart shows \njust one example of the instructions to be found here--in this case, \ninstructions to build an electronically timed incendiary igniter--the \ntimer for a time bomb.\n  And how do the publishers intend that this information will be used? \nThe suggestion is clear from threats and warnings in the guide. One \npage in the site shows a picture of an industry spokeswoman, warning \nher to ``take our advice while you still have some time: quit your job \nand cash in your frequent flier points for a permanent vacation.'' Now, \non this chart, which comes from The Final Nail #2, we have redacted the \nspokeswoman's address and phone number to protect her privacy. The \npublishers weren't so considerate. And this is just the beginning. This \nsame document has a 59 page list of targets, complete with names and \naddresses from nearly every U.S. State and Canadian province.\n\n  Let there be no mistake--the publishers know what they're doing. For \ninstance, the instructions on how to make milk jug firebombs comes with \nthis caution: ``Arson is a big time felony so wear gloves and old \nclothes you can throw away throughout the entire process and be very \ncareful not to leave a single shred of evidence.''\n  It is unfortunate that people feel the need to disseminate \ninformation and instructions on bombmaking and explosives. Now perhaps \nwe can't stop people from putting out that information. But if they are \ndoing so with the intent that the information be used to commit a \nviolent federal crime--or if they know that the information will be \nused for that purpose, then this amendment will serve to hold such \npersons accountable.\n  Unfortunately, kids today have unfettered access to a universe of \nharmful material. By merely clicking a mouse, kids can access \npornography, violent video games, and even instructions for making \nbombs with ingredients that can be found in any household. Why someone \nfeels the need to put such harmful material on the Internet is beyond \nme--there certainly is no legitimate need for our kids to know how to \nmake a bomb. But if that person crosses the line to advocate the use of \nthat knowledge for violent criminal purposes, or gives it our knowing \nit will be used for such purposes, then the law needs to cover that \nconduct.\n  Mr. President, the Hatch-Feinstein Federal Gang Violence Act \nincorporated in this amendment is a modest but important in stemming \nthe spread of gangs and violence across the country and among our \njuveniles. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise today in \nsupport of the Hatch-Feinstein amendment, a comprehensive package which \ncontains no less than three different bills which I have introduced, \nwhich all seek to stem the steady tide of criminal violence in this \ncountry.\n  Specifically, it includes the following bills which I have \nintroduced:\n  The Federal Gang Violence Act, a comprehensive package of measures \nwhich were recommended by law enforcement to increase their ability to \ncombat the increasingly-violent criminal gangs which are spreading \nacross the country. Senator Hatch and I introduced this legislation in \nthe past two congresses, and some of its provisions have already been \nincluded in the\n\n[[Page S5338]]\n\nbill before us today, as Title II of the bill.\n  The James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999, which is designed to \nincrease police and public safety by taking body armor out of the hands \nof criminals and putting it in the hands of police. I introduced this \nearlier this year as S. 783, and it has been co-sponsored by Senators \nSessions, Boxer, Reid, Bryan, and Kerry. We also have incorporated S. \n726, the Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective \nEquipment Act of 1999, which was introduced by Senators Campbell and \nTorricelli.\n  Anti-bombmaking legislation, which is designed to do everything \npossible under the Constitution to take information about how to make a \nbomb off the Internet by criminalizing the distribution of such \ninformation for a criminal purpose. I have introduced it in the past as \nan amendment to other bills, with the support of Senator Biden, and \nintroduced it earlier this year as part of S. 606, with Senators \nNickles, Hatch, and Mack.\n  This amendment also includes provisions drafted by Senator Hatch to \naddress animal enterprise terrorism, which he introduced earlier this \nyear as part of his omnibus crime bill, S. 899.\n  I want to express my great thanks to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee for working with me to put this package \ntogether, which is obviously of the highest priority to me.\n  Let me now describe what it does, in more detail:\n\n\n                                 gangs\n\n  Gangs are no longer a local problem involving small groups of wayward \nyouths. Rather, gang violence has truly become a problem of national \nscope.\n  The U.S. Justice Department issued a report which details the \ndramatic scope of this problem: there are over 23,000 youth gangs, in \nall 50 states; it will come as no surprise to you to learn that \nCalifornia is the number one gang state, with almost 5,000 gangs, and \nmore than three times as many gang members as the next-most gang-\nplagued state; and overall, there are almost 665,000 gang members in \nthe country, more than a ten-fold increase since 1975. [Source: U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, 1995 National Youth Gang Survey, released in \nAugust, 1997.]\n  In Los Angeles alone, nearly 7,300 of its citizens were murdered in \nthe last 16 years from gang warfare, more people than have been killed \nin all the terrorist fighting in northern Ireland.\n  Today's gangs are organized and sophisticated traveling crime \nsyndicates--much like the Mafia. They spread out and franchise across \nthe country, many from California.\n  The Los Angeles-based 18th Street gang now deals directly with the \nMexican and Colombian drug cartels, and has expanded its operations to \nOregon, Utah, El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico.\n  Local police and the FBI have traced factions of the Bloods and Crips \nto more than 119 cities in the West and Midwest with more than 60,000 \nmembers.\n  The Gangster Disciples, according to local authorities, is a Chicago-\nbased 30,000 member multi-million dollar gang operation spanning 35 \nstates, which traffics in narcotics and weapons, with income estimated \nat $300,000 daily.\n\n  A 1995 study of gang members by the National Gang Crime Research \nCenter found: three-quarters of the gangs exist in multiple geographic \nareas; half of the gang members belonged to gangs which did not arise \nlocally, but arose with contact from a gang from outside the area; and \n61 percent indicated their gang was an official branch of a larger \nnational gang.\n  Sgt. Jerry Flowers with the gang crime unit in Oklahoma City captured \nthe migration instinct of these gangs when he said: ``the gang leaders \nrealized that the same ounce of crack cocaine they sold for $300 in Los \nAngeles was worth nearly $2,000 in Oklahoma City.''\n  Gangs also steer at-risk youth into crime. A recently released study \nby the National Institute of Justice went about answering the question: \n``Are gangs really responsible for increases in crime or are youths who \ngrow up in very difficult circumstances but do not join gangs \ncommitting just as many crimes?'' To answer this, the Institute \nscientifically compared gang members with demographically similar at-\nrisk youth in four cities.\n  The results were very revealing, and I think it's important to share \nthese with the Senate:\n\n       The research revealed that criminal behavior committed by \n     gang members is extensive and significantly exceeds that \n     committed by comparably at-risk but nongang youth.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Youths who join gangs tend to begin as `wannabes' at about \n     age 13, join about 6 months later, and get arrested within 6 \n     months after joining the gang. By age 14 they already have an \n     arrest record.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       An important positive correlation exists between when these \n     individuals joined gangs and when their arrest histories \n     accelerated.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       [D]ata indicate that gang involvement significantly \n     increases one's chances of being arrested, incarcerated, \n     seriously injured, or killed.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       [G]ang members are far more likely to commit certain \n     crimes, such as auto theft; theft; assaulting rivals; \n     carrying concealed weapons in school; using, selling, and \n     stealing drugs; intimidating or assaulting victims and \n     witnesses; and participating in drive-by shootings and \n     homicides than nongang youths.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Gang members . . . are better connected to nonlocal sources \n     than nongang drug traffickers.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       [N]early 75 percent of gang members acknowledged that \n     nearly all of their fellow gang members own guns. Even more \n     alarming, 90 percent of gang interviewees reported that gang \n     members favor powerful, lethal weapons over small caliber \n     handguns.\n\n  Finally, the study noted, ``By all accounts, the number of youth \ngangs and their members continues to grow.''\n  To help stem this tide, my staff met for months with prosecutors, law \nenforcement officers, and community leaders to search for solutions to \nthe problem of gang violence.\n  The Federal Gang Violence Act makes the federal government a more \nactive partner in the war against violent and deadly organized gangs. \nProvisions which are already in the bill include:\n  Making it a federal crime to recruit someone to join a criminal gang, \nsubject to a one year mandatory minimum if an adult is recruited, and a \nfour year mandatory minimum if a minor is recruited.\n  One of the most insidious tactics of today's gangs is the way they \ntarget children to do their dirty work, and indoctrinate them into a \nlife of crime.\n  For example, the 18th street gang which I described earlier, \naccording to the Los Angeles Times, ``resembles a kind of children's \narmy,'' with recruiters who scout middle schools for 11- to 13-year-old \nchildren to join the gang. The gang's real leaders, however, are \nmiddle-aged veteranos, long-time gang members who direct its criminal \nactivities from the background.\n  The establishment of a High Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Area \nprogram.\n  Efforts to combat gang violence have been hampered by jurisdictional \nboundaries. The Los Angeles Times has opined that,\n\n       To date, that sort of `in it for the long haul' anti-gang \n     effort has not occurred among law enforcement authorities \n     here. Local police agencies fail to share information and are \n     unwilling to commit resources outside their boundaries; this \n     is always a problem in multi-jurisdictional Southern \n     California. Federal law enforcement agencies have come in, \n     but only for limited times. Meanwhile, the outlaw force gets \n     nothing more than a bloody nose.\n       The growth, greed and brutality of the 18th Street gang \n     demand a coordinated local, state and federal response, one \n     prepared to continue for months and even years if necessary.\n\n  To remedy this situation, I crafted a program modeled after the \npopular High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, or HIDTA, program. The \nHIIGAA program:\n  Adds $100 million per year for prosecutors and prevention programs, \ntargeted to areas that are particularly involved in interstate criminal \ngang activity, for: Joint federal-state-local law enforcement task \nforces, ``for the coordinated investigation, disruption, apprehension, \nand prosecution of criminal activities of gangs and gang members'' in \nthe areas; and community-based gang prevention programs in the areas.\n  These areas are designated by the Attorney General, who in so doing \nmust\n\n[[Page S5339]]\n\nconsider: The extent to which gangs from the area are involved in \ninterstate or international criminal activity; the extent to which the \narea is affected by the criminal activity of gang members who are \nlocated in or have relocated from other states or foreign countries; \nand the extent to which the area is affected by the criminal activity \nof gangs that originated in other states or foreign countries (e.g., by \nmigration of Crips and Bloods).\n  I believe that this program could be tremendously helpful to the L.A. \narea in particular, as it is the leading source of interstate gang \nactivity in the country, and could help bring together Los Angeles, \nRiverside, San Bernardino and other counties with the state and federal \ngovernments, in a coordinated, focused effort, balanced between \nenforcement and prevention, to beat back the gangs.\n  The amendment Senator Hatch and I are offering today would increase \nthe emphasis upon prevention in this program by boosting that share \nfrom 25 to 40 percent, consistent with the committee's action last \nCongress. The recent NIJ study which I mentioned earlier concluded: \n``It is also important to address the brief window of opportunity for \nintervention that occurs in the year between the ``wannabe'' stage and \nthe age at first arrest. It is vital that intervention programs that \ntarget gang members and successfully divert them from the gang are \nfunded, developed, evaluated, improved, and sustained.'' This program, \nand the change we propose today, will help to do that.\n  This amendment also would add the following anti-gang provisions to \nthe bill:\n  1. Increases sentences for gang members who commit federal crimes to \nfurther the gang's activities, by directing the Sentencing Commission \nto make an appropriate increase under the Sentencing Guidelines.\n  2. Makes is easier to prove criminal gang activity, by:\n  Reducing the number of members prosecutors have to prove are in a \ngang from five to three;\n  Changing the definition of a criminal gang from a group ``that has as \none of its primary purposes the commission of'' certain criminal \noffenses to a group ``that has as one of its primary activities the \ncommission of'' certain criminal offenses;\n  Adding the following federal offenses to the list of gang crimes: \nextortion, gambling, obstruction of justice (includes jury tampering \nand witness intimidation), money laundering, alien smuggling, an \nattempt or solicitation to commit any of these offenses, or federal \nviolent felonies or drug crimes, which are already included in the \ncurrent law), and gang recruitment;\n  Adding asset forfeiture\n  3. Amends the Travel Act, which passed in 1961 to address Mafia-type \ncrime, to deal with modern gangs, by adding gang crimes such as: \nassault with a deadly weapon, drive-by shootings, and witness \nintimidation to its provisions. It also increases penalties under the \nAct, and helps prosecutors by adding a conspiracy provision to the Act.\n  4. Adds serious juvenile drug offenses to the Armed Career Criminal \nAct, which provides for a 15 year mandatory minimum sentence if a felon \nwith three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug \noffenses is caught with a firearm.\n  5. Further targets gangsters who exploit children by adding a three-\nyear mandatory minimum sentence to the existing law against knowingly \ntransferring a firearm for use in a violent crime or drug trafficking \ncrime, where the gun is transferred to a minor.\n  6. Provision addressing clone pagers, which Sen. DeWine has worked \non, which would make it easier to investigate gang members by allowing \nlaw enforcement to obtain pagers which are clones of those possessed by \ngang members, under the lower standard which applies to pen registers, \nrather than the more difficult wiretap standard, which currently \napplies.\n  I want to note that we did not include the provision of last year's \nbill which was criticized for federalizing much gang crime.\n  Altogether, this anti-gang package gives federal law enforcement a \nset of powerful new tools with which to team up with state and local \nlaw enforcement and crack down on criminal gangs.\n\n\n                               body armor\n\n  The next piece of this comprehensive amendment is the James Guelff \nBody Armor Act of 1999, which is designed to increase police and public \nsafety by taking body armor out of the hands of criminals and putting \nit in the hands of police. As I mentioned previously, I introduced this \nearlier this year as S. 783, and it has been cosponsored by Senators \nSessions, Boxer, Reid, Bryan, and Kerry.\n  Currently, Federal law does not limit access to body armor for \nindividuals with even the grimmest history of criminal violence. \nHowever, it is unquestionable that criminals with violent intentions \nare more dangerous when they are wearing body armor.\n  Many will recall the violent and horrific shootout in North \nHollywood, California, just 2 years ago. In that incident, two suspects \nwearing body armor and armed to the teeth, terrorized a community. \nPolice officers on the scene had to borrow rifles from a nearby gunshop \nto counteract the firepower and protective equipment of these suspects.\n\n  Another tragic incident involved San Francisco Police Officer James \nGuelff. On November 13, 1994, Officer Guelff responded to a distress \ncall. Upon reaching the crime scene, he was fired upon by a heavily \narmed suspect who was shielded by a kevlar vest and bulletproof helmet. \nOfficer Guelff died in the ensuing gun-fight.\n  Lee Guelff, James Guelff's brother, recently wrote a letter to me \nabout the need to revise the laws relating to body armor. He wrote:\n\n       It's bad enough when officers have to face gunmen in \n     possession of superior firepower . . . But to have to \n     confront suspects shielded by equal or better defensive \n     protection as well goes beyond the bounds of acceptable risk \n     for officers and citizens alike. No officer should have to \n     face the same set of deadly circumstances again.\n\n  I couldn't agree with Lee more. Our laws need to recognize that body \narmor in the possession of a criminal is an offensive weapon. Our \npolice officers on the streets are adequately supplied with body armor, \nand that hardened-criminals are deterred from using body armor.\n  This body armor amendment has three key provisions. First, it \nincreases the penalties criminals receive if they commit a crime \nwearing body armor. Specifically, a violation will lead to an increase \nof two levels under the Federal sentencing guidelines.\n  Second, it makes it unlawful for violent felons to purchase, use, or \npossess body armor. Third, this bill enables Federal law enforcement \nagencies to directly donate surplus body armor to local police.\n  I will address each of these three provisions.\n  First, criminals who wear body armor during the commission of a crime \nshould face enhanced penalties because they pose an enhanced threat to \npolice and civilians alike. Assailants shielded by body armor can shoot \nat the police and civilians with less fear than individuals not so well \nprotected.\n  In the North Hollywood shoot-out, for example, the gunmen were able \nto hold dozens of officers at bay because of their body armor. This \nprovision will deter the criminal use of body armor, and thus deter the \nescalation of violence in our communities.\n  Second, this amendment would make it a crime for individuals with a \nviolent criminal record to wear body armor. It is unconscionable that \ncriminals can obtain and wear body armor without restriction when so \nmany of our police lack comparable protection.\n  The bill recognizes that there may be exceptional circumstances where \nan individual with a brutal history legitimately needs body armor to \nprotect himself or herself. Therefore, it provides an affirmative \ndefense for individuals who require body armor for lawful job-related \nactivities.\n  Another crucial part of this body armor amendment is that it speeds \nup the procedures by which Federal agencies can donate surplus body \narmor to local police.\n  Far too many of our local police officers do not have access to \nbullet-proof vests. The United States Department of Justice estimates \nthat 25 percent of State, local, and tribal law enforcement officers, \napproximately 150,000 officers, are not issued body armor.\n  Getting our officers more body armor will save lives. According to \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, greater\n\n[[Page S5340]]\n\nthan 30 percent of the 1,182 officers willed by guns in the line of \nduty since 1980 could have been saved by body armor, and the risk of \ndying from gunfire is 14 times higher for an officer without a \nbulletproof vest.\n  Last year, Congress made some inroads into this shortage of body \narmor by enacting the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of \n1998.'' This act established a $25 million annual fund to help local \nand State police purchase body armor. This amendment will further boost \nthe body armor resources of local and State police departments.\n  These body armor amendments have the support of over 500,000 law \nenforcement personnel nationwide. The Fraternal Order of Police, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation, the National Troopers Coalition, the International \nAssociation of Police Chiefs, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation (FLEOA), the Police Executive Research Forum, the \nInternational Brother of Police Officers, the Major City Chiefs, and \nthe National Association of Black Law Enforcement Executives, have all \nendorsed the legislation.\n  An additional piece of this body armor package is S. 726, the Officer \nDale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 1999 \nintroduced by Senator Campbell and cosponsored by Senator Torricelli.\n  Senator Campbell's proposals are dedicated to the memory of Dale \nClaxton, a Colorado police officer who was fatally shot through the \nwindshield of his police car. These proposals include:\n  Authorizing continued funding for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Act program at $25 million per year;\n  Second, creating a $40 million matching grant program to help State \nand local jurisdictions and Indian tribes purchase bullet resistant \nglass, armored panels for patrol cars, hand-held bullet resistant \nshield and other life saving bullet resistant equipment;\n  Third, authorizing a $25 million matching grant program for the \npurchase of video cameras for use in law enforcement vehicles; and\n  Finally, the amendment directs the National Institute of Justice to \npromote bullet-resistant technologies.\n  I am pleased that we were able to include these measures in our \namendment as well. They strengthen the amendment's purpose to protect \npolice and the public.\n\n\n                               bombmaking\n\n  Let me turn now to the bombmaking piece of this package.\n  According to authorities, the killers in Littleton learned how to \nmake their 30-plus bombs form bombmaking instructions posted on the \nInternet.\n  Hundreds and hundreds of Web sites contain instructions on how to \nbuild bombs, such as this Terrorists' Handbook, which my staff \ndownloaded from the Internet a week after the tragedy. This bombmaking \nmanual contains detailed, step-by-step instructions for building \ndevices such as pipe bombs, lightbulb bombs, and letter bombs, which \nhave no legitimate, lawful purpose. It also tells the reader how to \nbreak into college labs to obtain useful chemicals, how to pick locks, \nand even contains a checklist for raids on laboratories.\n\n\n        internet bombmaking incidents continuing after littleton\n\n  Unfortunately, in the short time since the tragedy in Littleton, \nColorado, there has been a steady stream of incidents of youths using \nthe Internet to build bombs and threaten their use at school:\n  Police arrested five students at McKinley Junior High School in \nBrooklyn for possessing a bomb-making manual, a day after the eighth-\ngraders were caught allegedly plotting to set off a bomb at graduation. \nThe arrested students, all 13, were charged with second-degree \nconspiracy after allegedly bringing bomb-making information found on \nthe Internet to class, police and school officials said.\n\n  Salt Lake City School District has received about 10 reports of \nthreats to kill or blow up schools, said Nancy Woodward, district \ndirector of student and family services. Many of the students making \nsuch threats have a history of violent threats and have written about \nsuch violence in notebooks or downloaded Internet information. [4/28/99 \nDeseret News]\n  Three Cobb County, Georgia boys arrested for possession of a pipe \nbomb on school property learned how to make the explosive by browsing \nthe Internet, according to testimony at a court hearing.\n  One week after the high school killings in Colorado, authorities \nacross Texas are reporting a spate of incidents that involve violent \nthreats by students and crude efforts to manufacture bombs.\n  In Port Aransas, Texas, a 15-year-old boy who allegedly downloaded \nfrom the Internet information on bomb making and killing faced criminal \ncharges after the was turned in to police by his father. The boy had \nthreatened teachers and classmates.\n  At least seven teen-agers are being held in Wimberley and Wichita \nFalls alone, all of them on suspicion of making explosives, some of \nwhich officials say were to be used to attack a school.\n  A judge ordered four Wimberley, Texas junior high school students to \nremain in a juvenile detention center, accused of planning an attack on \ntheir own school. Sheriff's deputies questioned the four eighth-graders \nover the weekend and searched their homes, turning up gunpowder, \ncrudely built explosives and instructions on making bombs on computer \ndisks and downloanded from the Internet.\n  More than 50 threats of bombings and other acts of violence against \nschools have been reported across Pennsylvania over the last four days, \nwhich state officials attributed partly to last week's bombing in \nLittleton, Colo.\n  Elsewhere on the Web, the Columbine tragedy has triggered a kind of \nelectronic turf warfare, as individuals snap up site addresses \ncontaining words reflecting the tragedy, such as the killers' names or \nthe name of their clique, the Trench Coat Mafia. At least one such \nsite, filled with images of guns and bomb-making instructions, was \noffered for sale to the highest bidder on eBay, an online auction. \n``When we became aware of it, we took it down immediately,'' an eBay \nspokesman said. ``It is totally inappropriate.''\n  And just 28 miles away from where we stand today, three students at \nGlen Burnie High School, in Maryland, were arrested for issuing bomb \nthreats and possessing bomb-making components. One of those arrested \nhad told another student, ``You're on my hit list.'' A police search of \nthe boys' homes found match heads, suitcases, wires, chemicals, and \nprintouts from the Internet showing how to put it all together to make \nbombs. Graffiti at the school read, ``if you think Littleton was bad, \nwait until you see what happens here.''\n\n\n                     Description of the Legislation\n\n  I have been trying to do as much as I can under the First Amendment \nto get rid of this sort of filth for four years now. This amendment:\n  Makes it a federal crime to teach or distribute information on how to \nmake a bomb or other weapon of mass destruction if the teacher: Intends \nthat the information be used to commit a federal violent crime or knows \nthat the recipient of the information intends to use it to commit a \nfederal violent crime; and sets a maximum sentence of 20 years.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by both the explosives industry \n(Institute for Makers of Explosives) and the Anti-Defamation League.\n\n\n                        Hitory of the Amendment\n\n  The substance of this amendment has passed the Senate or the \nJudiciary Committee in each of the past four years, without a single \nvote in opposition: in 1995, as an amendment to the anti-terrorism \nbill, by unanimous consent; in 1996, as an amendment to the Department \nof Defense authorization bill, again by unanimous consent; in 1997, \nagain as an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill, \nthis time by a vote of 94-0; and last year, in the Judiciary Committee, \nas an amendment to a private relief bill for Kerr-McGee Corporation, by \nunanimous consent.\n  Unfortunately, despite the unanimous support of the Senate, the House \nhas killed the amendment in conference each time it has passed the \nSenate: On the terrorism bill, it was replaced by a directive to the \nAttorney General to study and report to Congress on six different \nissues related to the amendment; on the FY 97 Defense bill, it was \neliminated because the Attorney General's study was then ongoing, and \nshe had not yet issued her report; on the FY 98 Defense bill, it was\n\n[[Page S5341]]\n\neliminated because it falls within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary \nCommittees, and the House objected to its not taking this usual course.\n\n\n                       Justice Department Support\n\n  I mentioned the Justice Department report earlier; that report found \nthat the amendment was justified on each of the six factors the \nDepartment was asked to consider, and recommended that Congress finally \npass this legislation:\n  Factor: ``(1) the extent to which there is available to the public \nmaterial in any medium (including print, electronic or film) that \nprovides instruction on how to make bombs, destructive devices, or \nweapons of mass destruction.''\n  DOJ Report: ``It is readily apparent from our cursory examination \nthat anyone interested in manufacturing a bomb, dangerous weapon or \nweapon of mass destruction can easily obtain detailed instructions for \nfabricating and using such a device.''\n  Factor: ``(2) the extent to which information gained from such \nmaterials has been used in incidents of domestic or international \nterrorism.''\n  DOJ Report: ``Recent law enforcement experience demonstrates that \npersons who attempt or plan acts of terrorism often possess literature \nthat describes the construction of explosive devices and other weapons \nof mass destruction (including biological weapons).''\n  ``[R]eported federal cases involving murder, bombing, arson, and \nrelated crimes, reflect the use of bombmaking manuals by defendants and \nthe frequent seizure of such texts during the criminal investigation of \nsuch activities.''\n  ``Finally, information furnished by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms reveals that such literature is frequently used by \nindividuals bent upon making bombs for criminal purposes.''\n  The report connected ``mayhem manuals'' to numerous terrorist and \ncriminal actions, including: The World Trade Center bombing; the Omega \n7 group, who conducted terrorist bombings in the New York area; an \nindividual attempting to bring enough ricin--one of the most toxic \nsubstances known--into the U.S. to kill over 32,000 people; and the \n``Patriots Council'' began developing ricin to attack federal or local \nlaw enforcement officials.\n  Factor: ``(3) the likelihood that such information may be used in \nfuture incidents of terrorism.''\n  DOJ Report: ``both the FBI and ATF expect that because the \navailability of such information is becoming increasingly widespread, \nsuch bombmaking instructions will continue to play a significant role \nin aiding those intent upon committing future acts of terrorism and \nviolence.''\n  Factor: ``(4) the application of Federal laws in effect on the date \nof enactment of this Act to such material.''\n  DOJ Report: while there are several existing federal laws which could \nbe applied to bombmaking instructions in some circumstances, ``current \nfederal law does not specifically address certain classes of cases.''\n  Factor: ``(5) the need and utility, if any, for additional laws \nrelating to such material.''\n  DOJ Report: ``the Department of Justice agrees with [Senators \nFeinstein and Biden] that it would be appropriate and beneficial to \nadopt further legislation to address this problem directly, in a manner \nthat does not impermissibly restrict the wholly legitimate publication \nand teaching of such information, or otherwise violate the First \nAmendment.''\n  Factor: ``(6) an assessment of the extent to which the first \namendment protects such material and its private and commercial \ndistribution.''\n  DOJ Report: ``where such a purpose [to aid or cause a criminal \nresult] is proved beyond a reasonable doubt, as it would have to be in \na criminal case, the First Amendment should be no bar to culpability.''\n  ``we think these First Amendment concerns can be overcome, and that \nsuch a facilitation prohibition could be constitutional, if drafted \nnarrowly.''\n  I ask that the Justice Department's report be incorporated by \nreference as part of the Record.\n  The Justice Department proposed a slight re-draft of the original \nversion of the Feinstein amendment. It is this re-draft which we have \nincluded in this amendment with one further modification, removing \nstate crimes from its scope, made at the request of Representative \nMcCollum.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  This is a powerful set of amendments, which I am convinced can do a \ngreat deal to reduce criminal violence in America. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is the bill open for my amendment now?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending legislation is the Hatch-Feinstein \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that measure be temporarily laid \naside so I may offer an amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Gladly.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am trying to work out the details to see if we can \nproceed with the Senator's amendment. If the Senator will give me a \nlittle bit more time, I will see if we can get that worked out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am told I could offer the amendment. I am glad to yield, \nhowever.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we want to do something on this bill. I have \nbeen asked personally by the majority leader and the minority leader to \nmove this legislation along. I have pled with Members from the minority \nto narrow the amendment. We have done that. There are time limits on \nmost every one.\n  We have spent 2 hours today trying to offer amendments. We want to \noffer amendments. We are being told we can't offer gun amendments, so \nwe bring in the second most senior Member of the Senate to offer an \namendment dealing with alcohol, and we are told we can't offer that.\n  What can we offer? I say to my friend from Utah, what can we offer? \nWe want to move this thing along. I have been here since early this \nmorning trying to move this bill along, and whatever we do we can't do \nit. You can't have it both ways. We can't be accused of trying to slow \ndown the legislation and when we want to offer amendments we can't \noffer anything.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. We understand that most Senators have left. We also \nunderstand some of these amendments are controversial and they need \ndebate on both sides. We also understand that some of us have to \nprotect ourselves on both sides or protect our Senators.\n  We are moving ahead. I just put in a very important amendment for \nSenator Feinstein and myself. We are submitting our statements for the \nRecord today rather than taking the time of the Senate. We are moving \nahead in a regular forum. We can move with some amendments today and \nsome we can't. We do want to move ahead and we will certainly try to do \nso and accommodate Members. When it comes to protecting Members of the \nSenate, we have to do that. It is just a common courtesy that has been \nused in this body ever since I have been here for 23 years. I don't \nwant to see that courtesy not extended at this time.\n  What I am hoping is that we can proceed with the Byrd amendment, \nwhich happens to be the bill that I filed on alcohol sales over the \nInternet. We know that the Senators from the States who are in \nopposition are not here today. We will try to work out an arrangement \nwhere this amendment can be filed and reserve time, an equivalent \namount of time, for those who may be in opposition.\n\n  We have asked for just a few minutes for one of our distinguished \nSenators who has a direct interest in this to be able to read the \namendment. It is not a long amendment. If we could just get a few more \nminutes of time.\n  As I now understand, the amendment is OK. Let's go ahead.\n  May I propose a unanimous consent request?\n\n[[Page S5342]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I speak for 1 minute?\n  This amendment has been printed in the Record. It is at the desk. So \nI have conformed with the request to get our amendments in. It was in \nyesterday's Congressional Record.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. It catches no one by surprise.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. Nobody is accusing anybody of surprise. The Senator has \nevery right to call up his amendment and we are glad he is.\n  I ask unanimous consent whatever time the Senator takes on this \namendment today, that those in opposition be permitted to take when \nthey return on Monday.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized under \nhis reservation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Do I still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia continues to \nhave the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from \nUtah, of course people in opposition to this amendment can come and \ntalk until the leader pulls the bill.\n  I don't understand why we can't move forward with amendments. If \nsomebody wants to make an objection to the amendment in the form of a \nspeech, they can come anytime they want. That is how we do business \naround here. When an amendment is offered, you don't have to have on \nthe floor somebody on the other side to oppose it.\n  We are being accused of slowing down this bill. We are doing \neverything we can to move the bill along. I hope everyone understands \nwho is slowing down this bill. It is not us.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder how this works. Does this mean if \nwe have other amendments on either side that come up, just because \nsomebody is not there to respond to it, does that mean this will now \nbecome the procedure to be followed? We will let the proponent speak, \nand then on Monday the opponents speak?\n  I ask that because we have to do something to move this on. It is \nfrustrating to the Senator from Vermont, who has canceled all other \nplans today to be here into the evening, if necessary, to move forward \non this bill, in keeping with what the majority leader said he wants \ndone, if he suddenly finds he will be picking and choosing whether \nanybody can bring up an amendment or not.\n\n  If Senators are serious about the amendments, they can come here and \noffer them. It is more of a question to the distinguished Senator from \nUtah: Is this going to be the practice, if another Senator brings up an \namendment and there is not somebody on the other side, will that \nSenator bring it up and speak about it, and the other Senator comes \nback and responds on Monday?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will try to protect Senators on our side \nwho may not be here. I presume the distinguished Senator from Vermont \nwill do the same for Senators on this side when we know they are in \nopposition or opposing a particular amendment.\n  I amend my unanimous consent request to request that, immediately \nfollowing Senator Byrd's presentation of his amendment, Senators Frist \nand Ashcroft be permitted to call up their amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, before I agree, I would like----\n  Mr. BYRD. May I say to the Chair, I am recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the distinguished Senator from California wishes to say \nsomething, I would be glad to yield for a statement.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I wish to oppose your amendment \nand so I wish to see that there is an opportunity for me to do so.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator from California will certainly \nhave an opportunity to oppose my amendment. Anybody else will certainly \nhave an opportunity to do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I have a ruling on my unanimous consent request to get \nthis order?\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator remind repeating his request?\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that there be given time to debate \nby opponents on Monday, if they are unable to be here at this time, to \namendments that are called up today, and we give them the time to \ndebate the equivalent used today--in the case of Senator Feinstein, she \nis here so she can reply regarding Senator Byrd's amendment--but that \nSenator Byrd's amendment proceed, and immediately following the Byrd \namendment, that Senators Frist and Ashcroft be permitted to call up \ntheir amendment, hopefully speaking for only 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President I wasn't here when the consent order was \nentered. But do I understand that no amendment in the second degree can \nbe offered today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). No second-degree amendment can be \noffered and voted on until there has been a vote on or in relationship \nto the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not seek any vote on my amendment \ntoday, but I have entered it earlier and I want to speak to it and \nofficially call it up today. And it will be up on Monday for further \ndebate and for amendment by other amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 339\n\n(Purpose: To provide for injunctive relief in Federal district court to \n    enforce State laws relating to the interstate transportation of \n                          intoxicating liquor)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want the clerk to report it in full.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 339:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have not asked for any action on this \namendment, but I did want to have it read for the information of the \nSenate, and I want to speak on it briefly, after which I shall return \nto my office.\n  Mr. President, over the past few days, many of my colleagues have \ncome to this Chamber and, with heartfelt passion, offered proposals \naimed at addressing the scourge of juvenile crime and violence. We have \nseen efforts to reduce the pervasiveness of violence and indecency on \ntelevision and in the movies. We have seen efforts to provide the tools \nparents need in order to make the Internet a safe and educational \nenvironment for their children. We have observed proposals to increase \ncriminal penalties for those who would seek to subvert our youth by \nintroducing them to gangs or the drug culture; and we have had attempts \nto limit children's access to guns.\n  Each of these has been, I believe, an honest effort toward seeking a \nmuch-needed solution to this national problem. And yet, despite these \nproposals, I am deeply concerned that we have overlooked an important \nelement of this crisis--the problem of teen alcohol use--the problem of \nteen, t-e-e-n, alcohol use--more appropriately, perhaps, alcohol abuse.\n  I have long been concerned about underage drinking.\n  As a matter of fact, I am not an advocate of drinking at any age, but \nI recognize that not everybody seeks to pattern their own viewpoints \nand lives after my viewpoints. But especially--especially--I speak with \nreference to underage drinking.\n  It takes an immense toll on our children and our society. The younger \na child starts drinking, the more likely that child is to run into bad, \nbad trouble down the road. Research has shown, for example, that \nchildren who begin drinking before age 15 are four times more likely to \ndevelop alcohol dependence than those who abstain from such activity \nuntil the legal drinking age of 21. We also know that too many kids are \ndrinking.\n  If one kid is drinking, that is too many. I am not saying that with \nreference to this legislation. Obviously, if one is drinking, that is \none too many. But for the purposes of this statement, let it stand as I \nsay. We also know that too many kids are drinking.\n  During the last month, approximately 34 percent of high school \nseniors, 22 percent of tenth graders, and 8 percent of eighth graders, \nhave been drunk.\n  That is hard to imagine. I started school in a two-room schoolhouse. \nI have said that many times, but I like to repeat it because there are \nstill some of us here who remember those times. When I was later in \nhigh school, that would not have been tolerated. The parents would not \nhave tolerated it. The community would not have tolerated it. The \nschool principal, the teachers would not have tolerated it.\n  Let me read that again.\n  During the last month, approximately 34 percent of high school \nseniors--now that is a third of high school seniors--22 percent of the \ntenth graders; in other words, one-fifth of the tenth graders, and 8 \npercent of the eighth graders--think of that, 8 percent of the eighth \ngraders--have been drunk!\n  What is going on here? Drunk. How can that happen if there is a \nparent who observes the responsibilities of a parent? How can a drunk \nchild avoid the observation of the parent?\n  Yes, I said drunk! And, in the most tragic of statistics, we know \nthat, in 1996, 5,233 young people ages 15 to 20 died in alcohol-related \ntraffic accidents--5,233 lives cut short for what? Mr. President, 5,233 \nyoung people ages 15 to 20 died, and that means for a long, long time--\ndied in alcohol-related traffic accidents. These statistics should be a \ncause for great concern not just among Senators, but for everyone \nthroughout this Nation. Everybody. The churches ought to be up in arms \nabout it. Legislators ought to be up in arms about it. The \nadministration ought to put forth a crusade, not just a word here and \nthere, tippy-toeing around. There ought to be a real crusade like the \ncrusade that has been effectively carried on against smoking. Why not \nhave a national crusade against drinking and especially concerning \nyoung people in school? Something is wrong.\n\n  Mr. President, we should also be concerned that, with direct-to-\nconsumer sale of alcohol, children can now get beer, wine, or liquor \nsent directly to their homes by ordering from catalogues or over the \nInternet.\n  What a shame. Again, I have to point my finger at the parents. What a \nshame. Children can now get beer, wine or liquor sent directly to their \nhomes by ordering from catalogs or over the Internet.\n  Unfortunately, these direct-to-consumer sales work to undermine the \nextremely important controls currently in place in many of our States.\n  Consequently, I am offering this amendment, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Kohl, in an effort to give States the opportunity to close that \nloophole and go after those who sell alcohol illegally to children. The \nWebb-Kenyon Act, a Federal statute dating back to the early part of \nthis century, makes clear that States have the authority to control the \nshipment of alcohol into the State. Unfortunately, recent court \ndecisions have maintained that the statute provides no enforcement \nmechanism. In the 1997 case of Florida Department of Business \nRegulation v. Zachy's Wine and Liquor, for example, the State of \nFlorida was prohibited from enjoining four out-of-State direct shippers \non the grounds that neither the 21st amendment to the Constitution, nor \nthe Webb-Kenyon Act, gave the State a Federal right of action for \nfailure to comply with State liquor laws. Thus, as a result of this and \nother court decisions, the ability of States to vigorously enforce \ntheir prerogatives under the 21st amendment and the Webb-Kenyon Act \nagainst out-of-State defendants is extremely limited at the very time \nwhen illegal alcohol shipments are burgeoning.\n  This amendment would remedy this problem by stating unequivocally--no \nands, ifs, or buts; unequivocally--that States have the right to seek \nan injunction in Federal court to prevent the illegal, interstate sale \nof alcohol in violation of State law.\n  I am not saying you cannot sell it. I am simply saying that we should \nobey State laws by not selling alcohol to children--or expect to pay \nthe consequences.\n  This amendment is based on legislation originally introduced earlier \nthis year by the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch. The \ndistinguished Senator from Utah has been at the forefront of this \nissue, and I thank him for his leadership on this important matter. In \naddition, Senator Kohl is a\n\n[[Page S5344]]\n\ncosponsor of my amendment and I sincerely thank him as well for his \nsteadfast support.\n  Beyond my colleagues here in the Senate, though, this legislation has \ngarnered diverse support. Organizations favoring this amendment include \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics, the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, the \nNational Beer Wholesalers Association, the National Licensed Beverage \nAssociation and the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear about what my amendment does. It \nsimply clarifies that States may use the Federal courts to obtain an \ninjunction to prevent the illegal shipment of alcohol. It does not \noverturn or interfere with any existing State law or regulation. It \nwould have no impact on those companies that are selling alcohol \nproducts in accordance with State laws. It would not impede legal \naccess to the marketplace. In fact, there are distributors who have \noffered to sell the products of any wine manufacturer, no matter how \nsmall that company might be. My amendment would have no impact on those \nwho are using the Internet to sell alcohol products legally.\n  In sum, companies would remain free to utilize any marketing or sales \nprocess currently permitted under State law. That is why companies that \nlegally sell alcohol over the Internet, such as Geerlings and Wade, \nhave endorsed this legislation. The legislation would only impede those \nwho use the Internet or other marketing techniques to avoid compliance \nwith State alcohol laws.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate addresses the pernicious problem of \nyouth crime and violence, I urge my colleagues to join me in addressing \nthis important facet. We should not--indeed, we cannot--turn a blind \neye to those who would, and do, violate State laws governing the sale \nof alcoholic beverages. The laws regulating alcoholic beverages are in \nplace because such products can be--can be--a dangerous product. It \nshould not be shipped to minors. It should not be shipped into States \nin violation of those States' laws. Congress should act now and ensure \nthat the laws regulating the interstate shipment of alcohol are not \nrendered meaningless.\n   Mr. President, that completes my statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if nothing else can be said about this \nissue, it is absolutely imperative that states have the means to \nprevent unlawful access to alcohol by our children.\n  If a 13-year-old is capable of ordering beer and having it delivered \nby merely ``borrowing'' a credit card and making a few clicks with her \nmouse, there is something wrong with the level of control that is being \nexercised over these sales and something must be done to address the \nproblem.\n  I am a strong supporter of electronic commerce. But the sale of \nalcohol cannot be equated with the sale of a sweater or shirt. We need \nto foster growth in electronic commerce, but we also need to make sure \nthat alcohol control laws are respected.\n  The growth of many of our nation's wineries is tied to their ability \nto achieve name recognition and generate sales nationwide--tasks the \nInternet is uniquely suited to accomplish. I do not want to preclude \nthem from using the Internet; I want to ensure that they use it \nresponsibly and in accordance with state laws.\n  If there is a problem with the system, we need to fix the system, not \nbreak the laws.\n  The 21st amendment gives states the right to regulate the importation \nof alcohol into their states. However, efforts to enforce laws relating \nto the importation of alcohol have run into significant legal hurdles \nin both state and Federal courts.\n  The scope of the 21st amendment is essentially a Federal question \nthat must be decided by the Federal courts--and ultimately the Supreme \nCourt. For that reason, among others, I believe a Federal court forum \nis appropriate for state enforcement efforts.\n  Most states do not permit direct shipping of alcohol to consumers. \nTherefore most Internet sales of alcohol are currently prohibited. If a \nstate wants to set up a system to allow for the direct shipment of \nalcohol to consumers, such as New Hampshire and Louisiana have already \ndone, then that is their right under the 21st amendment. But the \ndecision to permit direct shipping, and under what conditions, is up to \nthe states, not the purveyors of alcohol.\n  S. 577, the Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act was introduced by \nmyself and Senator DeWine on March 10, 1999. Senators Byrd and Conrad \nhave now cosponsored and Senator Kohl is to be added as a sponsor.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Byrd will offer the Twenty-First \nAmendment Enforcement Act as an amendment to S. 254, the Violent and \nRepeat Juvenile Offender Accountability Act of 1999. To my knowledge, \nonly three Senators have gone on record opposing the bill--Feinstein, \nDurbin, Rockefeller--and 57 Senators have given the bill tentative \napproval.\n  The bill is supported by a host of interests including, inter alia, \nUtah interests (Governor Leavitt, Attorney General Graham, Utah's \nDepartment of Alcoholic Beverage Control, the Utah Hospitality \nAssociation, numerous Utah Congressional Representatives and Senator \nBennett), SADD, the National Licensed Beverage Association, the \nNational Beer Wholesalers Association, the Wine and Spirits \nWholesalers, Geerlings and Wade (leading direct marketer of fine wines \nto 27 States and more than 81 percent of the wine consuming public) \nAmericans for Responsible Alcohol Access, the National Association of \nBeverage Retailers, the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association, \nand the National Conference of State Liquor Administrators.\n  I had intended to offer this amendment. Senator Feinstein asked that \nI withhold--and I was agreeable to working with her. I still wish to \nwork with her. But, given Senator Byrd's decision to offer the \namendment at this time I feel compelled to vote my conscience.\n  I have been working with Senator Feinstein and others to try to come \nto an agreement on legislation which will balance the legitimate \ncommercial interests involved with the rights of the states under the \n21st amendment. However, I haven't seen any proposed amendments at this \ntime which help alleviate the problems inherent in direct shipping \nwhile at the same time protecting the wineries' commercial interests.\n  I still want to work with the vineyards and those who have concerns. \nI hope we can keep working together.\n\n    Summary of Byrd Amendment (S. 577, the ``Twenty-First Amendment \n                           Enforcement Act'')\n\n       (1) Permits the chief law enforcement officer of a state to \n     seek an injunction in federal court to prevent the violation \n     of any of its laws regulating the importation or \n     transportation of alcohol;\n       (2) Allows for venue for the suit where the defendant \n     resides and where the violations occur;\n       (3) No injunctions issued without prior notice to the \n     opposing party;\n       (4) Requires that injunctions be specific as to the \n     parties, the conduct and the rationale underlying the \n     issuance of the injunction;\n       (5) Allows for quick consideration of the application for \n     an injunction; conserves court resources by avoiding \n     redundant proceedings;\n       (6) Mandates a bench trial.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent to send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I certainly have no objection to the Senator \nsending her amendment to the desk. Wait, Mr. President. Is this \namendment a second-degree amendment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. First degree.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is this an amendment to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from West Virginia or is this another amendment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I say to the Senator, this is another amendment on \nthe same subject. It is a first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If I may ask, as a point of procedure, I thought we \nwere operating under a unanimous consent that the next amendment to be \noffered was to be, according to the unanimous\n\n[[Page S5345]]\n\nconsent, an amendment sponsored by Senator Frist and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I do not mean to forestall other amendments, but it was \njust my understanding. I am happy to try to work out a unanimous \nconsent which allows for the other amendment. But I think it would be \nappropriate to do that rather than set aside the amendment in place, \nand as a result, until we work that out, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I ask the distinguished Senator what her amendment \nis?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. The amendment essentially would require that \nwhen one ships an alcoholic beverage, that there be a label on the \nshipping container that contains clearly and prominently an \nidentification of the contents of the package. It would then require \nthat upon delivery, an adult must show identification to receive it. It \nalso would provide that it is a criminal charge to violate that, and \nwith three violations, the BATF revokes the license.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask the distinguished sponsor of the amendment, is this \none of the amendments that has been approved by both sides under the \nunanimous consent agreement?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I do not believe it has been.\n  Mr. HATCH. If it has not been, the only way we can bring it up \nwithout objection would be to get one of the--I think there are nine \nreserved amendments that could be utilized for this purpose. If you can \ndo that, if I have interpreted this correctly, you would like your \namendment right after the Byrd amendment so there will be a contrast.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If possible, yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I support the Byrd amendment, but I do not think that is \nan unreasonable request. I ask my colleagues on this side to allow it, \nas long as there is not a lot of intervening debate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from California? Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah \nfor doing that. It was a request similar to what I wanted. I agree with \nhim. I happen to support the amendment by the distinguished Senator \nfrom California. I think it is a very reasonable and realistic one that \nshould be passed.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not know whether I was clear or not on my unanimous \nconsent request, but she should be entitled to do it if she can use one \nof those nine amendments which have been reserved for things like this. \nWe shouldn't have this if it is an additional amendment to all the ones \nwe have on the Record.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I did not understand that to be the unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is what I meant to say.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I did not understand that to be the unanimous consent \nrequest that was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me rephrase the unanimous consent request. There are \nnine reserved amendments, five by the distinguished ranking member and \nfour by the minority leader. The Senator should be allowed to call up \nthis amendment utilizing one of those nine amendments, if she wants to. \nI do not want to expand the amendment list.\n  I ask unanimous consent that she be permitted to do that, utilizing \none of the nine that aren't presently utilized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, I make a parliamentary \ninquiry. What is the unanimous consent request the Senate just agreed \nto prior to this, as propounded by the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Utah?\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator acknowledge----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Could I get an answer?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not know that I was clear. That is why I am trying to \nbe clear now.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Well, all of us are unclear at times. I just want to be \nclear so I can understand how the Chair understands it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I did mention the nine amendments. That is clearly the \nimport of what I wanted to do.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Well, except that that would not require, I would say to \nmy friend from Utah, unanimous consent in any event, because we could \njust simply take one of those----\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared, but I think we should use one of the nine \nopen amendments to be fair about it. But if you want to raise a \ntechnical objection and not use one, that is fine with me, because it \nis fair to the distinguished Senator from California, whom I oppose. \nThat is why you kept those amendments. I think it is fairer to use one \nof them. That way, we do not expand the list. That is what I would do \nfor you. If you won't, then I will accept whatever.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I tell my friend from Utah, I hope that I don't have to \nuse them all in any event. But again, the reason I didn't object or \nanything, my understanding was that the distinguished Senator from Utah \nproposed a unanimous consent agreement which basically paralleled the \nunanimous consent agreement that the distinguished senior Senator from \nCalifornia had already made, which was to move forward, to be allowed \nto introduce her amendment. Now, that is why I am asking the \ndistinguished occupant of the Chair, the Senator from Nebraska, just \nwhat it is we have agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me say--\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am getting old, and it is Friday afternoon, Mr. \nPresident. I want to make sure I understand.\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe I was inarticulate. I believe I did not make it \nclear that one of these nine amendments should be used. If the Senator \nwants to be technical about it and not utilize one of those nine \namendments, then let's quit debating and wasting time on it. We will \njust expand the amendment list by one in order to accommodate a Member \nof his side, but I would prefer, if he would, that he grant her the use \nof one of the nine which currently are not being used, as a courtesy to \nme and to her. And if he doesn't, we will do the other. I don't care, \nbut I don't want a big debate on it. I want to get to the Ashcroft \namendment, if we can.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have two amendments that have been agreed upon for \ncalling up. One of those I will not call up, if I may yield that slot \nto the distinguished Senator from California.\n  Mr. HATCH. If you will do that, that will be--\n  Mr. LEAHY. That takes care of everybody's problem, and it satisfies \nthe Senator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is modified and \nthe request is agreed to.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia whose intelligence is only exceeded by his gentility and \ncourtliness. Thank you very, very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 354\n\n    (Purpose: To modify the laws relating to interstate shipment of \n                         intoxicating liquors)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 354.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. INTERSTATE SHIPMENT AND DELIVERY OF INTOXICATING \n                   LIQUORS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 59 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in section 1263--\n       (A) by inserting ``a label on the shipping container that \n     clearly and prominently identifies the contents as alcoholic \n     beverages, and a'' after ``accompanied by''; and\n       (B) by inserting ``and requiring upon delivery the \n     signature of a person who has attained the age for the lawful \n     purchase of intoxicating liquor in the State in which the \n     delivery is made,'' after ``contained therein,''; and\n\n[[Page S5346]]\n\n       (2) in section 1264, by inserting ``or to any person other \n     than a person who has attained the age for the lawful \n     purchase of intoxicating liquor in the State in which the \n     delivery is made,'' after ``consignee,''.\n       (b) Revocation of Basic Permit.--The Director of the Bureau \n     of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms shall revoke the basic \n     permit of any person who has been convicted of 3 or more \n     violations of the provisions of title 18, United States Code, \n     added by this section.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, what I believe we are in, to some \nextent, is a kind of interindustry beef, if I might use that \nvernacular. And it all deals with the shipment of alcohol or alcoholic \nbeverages across State lines.\n  The amendment just submitted by the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia is of major concern to the California wine industry. It is of \nmajor concern to the California wine industry, which makes 90 percent \nof the wine of this country, because small boutique wineries, which \nhave wine tastings and then offer for sale a bottle of rather expensive \nwine over the Internet, are essentially affected by this amendment, \nwhich takes all State laws and essentially provides a Federal court \nvenue.\n  We have had discussions in the Judiciary Committee; we had a full \nhearing in the the Judiciary Committee. The California Wine Institute \ntestified as well as a vintner from Santa Cruz, CA. I thought there was \ngoing to be a delay. Senator Hatch had this amendment. He decided to \nlet it sit for awhile so that we could put together some agreement.\n  Mothers Against Drunk Driving has been an original supporter of what \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia proposes. However, at this \ntime I will read from the text of a letter, dated May 13, from Mothers \nAgainst Drunk Driving, signed by Karolyn Nannalee, the national \npresident.\n\n       At the time MADD provided testimony no legislation had been \n     drafted on the subject. The text of S. 577 has implications \n     far beyond our concerns and is, in fact, a battle between \n     various elements within the alcoholic beverages industry. It \n     does not surprise us that the competing parties would like to \n     have the support of the victims of drunk driving. It does, \n     however, dismay us that they would go to such lengths to \n     misrepresent our views on the subject.\n\n  I only say this because Mothers Against Drunk Driving does not, in \nfact support the legislation that has just been presented.\n  The allegation is, of course, that this legislation is directed \nagainst the wine industry, which is having increasing success in the \nUnited States as more and more Americans consume wine as opposed to \nother alcoholic beverages. For the small winery that may not have shelf \nspace in a supermarket, the Internet has emerged as a source of sales \nof their products.\n  Now, let's address the question of teenage drinking. In this respect, \nI agree entirely, 100 percent, with what the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia said. We ought to do everything we can to discourage \nteenage drinking. I do not have a problem with that. What I have a \nproblem with is throwing all complicated laws with respect to alcoholic \nbeverages into the Federal courts. I think that is unnecessary, and I \nthink it is unwanted by many of us at least.\n  The amendment I have submitted--actually as an alternative, although \nit is a first-degree amendment--as an alternative to the amendment of \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia, I believe, would solve \nthe problem, because it would require that any package containing an \nalcoholic beverage that is shipped across State lines must be labeled \nclearly and its contents must be identified as alcoholic beverages.\n  Second, it would require that upon delivery the recipient must be of \nan age to lawfully purchase the beverage and must sign and identify \nhimself or herself as such. It would require the invoice to state that \nan adult signature is required for delivery. It would require the \ndeliverer not to deliver unless an adult signature is attached. It \nprovides criminal penalties for violation, and with three violations \nthe BATF, on a mandatory basis, must revoke the basic permit of any \nperson who has been convicted of three or more violations of this \nsection.\n  I think this gets at the basic problem by setting up safeguards so \nthat particularly wine can be shipped across State lines by the \npurchaser.\n  This is complicated but is something that has arisen and has become a \nkind of folk art, if you will, and that is the wine tasting where \npeople go to wine areas, where they go directly to the winery where \nthere is a wine tasting, where they see a new bottle of wine, sometimes \nvery limited supply, and they say: Oh, how can I buy it? And the vendor \nwill say: You can buy it through my web site, and it is $90, $80, $70 a \nbottle. That is how this is done.\n  I believe my amendment, without throwing all of this into Federal \ncourt, essentially skins the cat without killing it. I would be hopeful \nthat the Senate would see it as worthy.\n  I very much thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I \nwould like to thank the ranking member and those who made it possible \nfor me to offer this amendment at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 355\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and \n    the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 to authorize schools to apply \nappropriate discipline measures in cases where students have firearms, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I call up the Frist-Ashcroft amendment as \nunder the previous unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Frist), for himself, Mr. \n     Ashcroft, Mr. Allard, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Helms, and Mr. \n     Nickles proposes an amendment numbered 355.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer on behalf of Senators Ashcroft, \nAllard, Coverdell, and Helms an amendment which addresses an issue \nwhich is fundamentally central to the issues we have been discussing \nover the last several days; that is, of guns and bombs in schools. This \namendment will address a problem that we in this body have created \nthrough good intent but created a loophole which allows students who \nhave brought a bomb or a gun into a school to be allowed to return to \nthe classroom.\n  The amendment very specifically ends what has become a mixed message \nthat the Federal Government has sent and is sending to American \nstudents on the issue of guns and bombs in our schools. Under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, a law that I have \nfought very hard for, supported and have worked hard to reform and \nimprove in past Congresses, a student with a disability who is in \npossession of a firearm is treated differently than a regular education \nstudent because of the disability. Students in special education are \ntreated differently than all other students, if both have brought a gun \nor a bomb into the school. That is wrong. It has to be fixed. It is a \nloophole that creates a huge danger, I believe, to the safety of our \nchildren and teachers in our schools.\n  How big a problem is it? Some people said it is a hypothetical \nproblem. It is hard to get this data. But I want to share with my \ncolleagues what I have been able to find.\n  If you look just last year, over the 1997-1998 school year, just in \nNashville, just one community in this country, there were eight firearm \ninfractions, where children have been found to have brought a gun or \nfirearm into the school. That isn't how many came in, but only how many \nwere actually discovered. Of those eight, six were special education \nstudents, protected under IDEA.\n  By the way, about 13 percent of all students, or one out of every \neight, are in special education. What happened to the six special \neducation students? Under the law as it is written, we basically \ndetermine whether or not bringing that gun into school was a \nmanifestation, meaning was it related in any way to the disability. Of \nthose six, three were found to have brought that firearm in for a \nreason that is unrelated to the disability, and were expelled but were \nstill allowed to receive educational services. The other three special \neducation students were found to have brought the firearm to the school \nbecause it was related to the disability.\n  The significance of this is that we take those three students and \nsay, You can go back into the school. The other two regualr education \nstudents not protected under IDEA were expelled and were not required \nto receive educational services. They can't come back to the school. \nBut because we created this special class, we are letting kids with \nbombs and firearms to come back into the school in as soon as 45 days \nlater. It is no more complicated than that.\n  Our amendment fixes this dangerous, dangerous loophole. To look at \njust over the last 8 months, of nine firearm violations in Nashville, \nfour have involved special education students. These statistics say \nthat in one city, Nashville, it is a problem. But it is a snapshot, a \nmicroscopic picture of what goes on all over the country. It is wrong. \nStudents should be subject to the exact same disciplinary action \nwhether or not they happen to be in special education. It is our fault. \nWe created this system which treats them differently.\n  We contend that when it comes to bombs and firearms, they should all \nbe treated exactly alike. The issue of possession of a gun or firearm, \nI don't believe the Federal Government should tie the hands of our \nlocal education authorities, our principals and teachers, when it comes \nto protecting students and teachers from guns and bombs in schools.\n  I believe there is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for any student to \nintentionally possess or bring to school a gun. What we have done is \ncreate by previous legislation, which this amendment fixes, a means by \nwhich a special group of students, students in special education to \nhide behind the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to avoid \nthe same punishment that a regular education student would receive.\n\n  Our amendment says that the possession must be intentional. This \nwould allow the principal to determine if the student with a disability \nunknowingly had the gun placed on him. This targets a student who comes \nto that schoolyard with a firearm or gun intentionally.\n  Again, it is a tight, focused amendment.\n  Since its inception in 1975, 24 years ago, IDEA has been gradually \nmodified with the times and has been improved.\n  I believe this is a marked improvement. I think this amendment is \nnecessary for the reasons that we have been discussing regarding this \nbill, with the catastrophes around my State and other States, and in \nColorado most recently, which reflect the decline in safety in our \nNation's schools.\n  Our amendment, very simply, ensures that school authorities at the \nlocal level have the ability to remove dangerous students, whoever they \nare, from the classroom regardless of their status. Today they can't. \nOur amendment fixes this problem.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nTennessee, first of all, for his sensitivity to what is happening in \nthe schools of America. His visiting the schools is something which I \nfind to be very important. You can sit here in Washington for a long \ntime and cook up all sorts of theories about how schools ought to be, \nbut until you talk to the people in the schools--and in his case \nNashville, Davidson County--until you talk to the principals and \nteachers and parents, you do not understand the problems created by our \ncurrent Federal IDEA law. The Senator from Tennessee has found out that \nin a 1-year snapshot there were eight detected possessions of weapons \nin the schools, six of which were from students covered by \nindividualized education plans, and three of which our law--the law \nthat we made--says schools can't expel those students the way they \nought to be able to expel them. He has pointed out we should fix the \nlaw.\n\n  What is interesting to me--and I commend the Senator from Tennessee. \nI have visited school districts all across the State of Missouri. I \nhave gone to district after district to try and assert exactly what it \nis we should be doing. I have had school superintendents mention to me \ntime after time this same problem. I talked to one small school \ndistrict superintendent who talked about the dangers of not being able \nto have discipline in these settings. He talked about a student who \nthreatened to kill other students seven times--threaten to shoot them.\n  Finally, the individual shot another student. Fortunately, the shot \ntook place off the school premises so that the legal authorities \nincarcerated the student. They didn't have to go through the painful \nprocedure of trying to discipline him within the confines of this law \nwhich makes it virtually impossible to exercise the kind of discipline \nnecessary.\n  This bill is very simple. This bill is not designed to hurt any group \nof students. This is designed to secure the classroom. There isn't any \nclass of students that is better off being favored and being able to \nbring guns or bombs to school. That is not in the interest of any group \nof students.\n  This bill basically takes off barriers that the Congress placed in \nthe path of good school administrators, parents, teachers and local \nschool boards. We erected barriers that kept from taking students who \nhad guns in their possession out of schools--merely because they were \ndetermined to be in some way disabled.\n  This amendment simply says in spite of the fact that you are a \nstudent--of\n\n[[Page S5348]]\n\ncourse, one out of every eight students nationally turns out to be \ndisabled; one in seven in the State of Missouri--the fact that you are \nin this category called IDEA, doesn't mean you can bring a gun or a \nbomb to school with impunity.\n  We simply take the barriers, the roadblocks out of the system. We say \nto school administrators and principals: You are free to discipline \nthese students uniformly, just like you would discipline other \nstudents.\n  I think that is a very important, profoundly simple point. It is the \nkind of correction which we only make when we get out and talk to \npeople out there who are running the schools. When they tell you they \ncan't discipline kids who are threatening over and over to kill other \nstudents, who eventually shoot other students, when they tell you they \ncan't keep kids who brought guns to school out of school or from \nbringing guns back into school, and because of Federal procedures that \nsay disciplines are more difficult the second time because we set up a \nFederal bureaucracy that keeps schools from being able to exercise \ndiscipline, it is time to say the most important thing for students--\nwhether disabled, conventional, mainstream or not--the most important \nthing for that classroom is safety.\n  When you keep guns and bombs out of the school, you promote the \nsafety of all students.\n  I am here to say how much I appreciate the opportunity to be able to \nsponsor this amendment that gives local schools, principals, teachers, \nparents and school boards the right to maintain gun-free, bomb-free \nschools, to have safe learning environments where students, without the \nfeeling of threat and insecurity, can actually learn.\n  It is a pleasure to be a cosponsor of this amendment with Senator \nFrist. I commend him. We all want to do everything we can for the \neducation of all of our students. Our students who are disabled deserve \nour special compassion and attention, and more than any others, they \ndeserve the protection that is afforded when we can have the ability to \nhave secure, safe learning environments. We can do that when we allow \nour administrators to make sure that those individuals who bring guns \nto school can be disciplined.\n  One last point: The law that provides for expulsion of students who \nbring guns to schools gives principals discretion to allow students to \nreenter the school. That same discretion would apply to these kinds of \nstudents as it applies to conventional students.\n  This is a field leveler. It puts people on the same level and it puts \nthe safety of our schoolchildren in first place--not part of our \nschoolchildren, all of them. Disabled children, other individuals, the \nentire school population must have the assurance that school officials \nhave the capacity to enforce safe schools.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee and others for joining in this. I \nam honored to be an original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am grateful to the able Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Ashcroft, and the able Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist, \nfor offering this amendment which corrects a glaring flaw in the \nFederal disabilities law and, in my judgment, is among the most \nimportant amendments to the juvenile justice legislation when, again, \nit is pending.\n  This past Thursday morning, I was aghast when I noted an op-ed piece \nin the Washington Times written by Kenneth Smith. It was entitled \n``Disabled Educators.'' The article detailed a number of disturbing \nincidents of students threatening their teachers and peers with \nviolence, bringing knives and guns to campus and even burning down \ntheir own schools. In the wake of the tragedy of Littleton, CO, these \nnews items, of course, are particularly chilling.\n  What is most alarming about the column is not the individual stories \nof violence, it is that a well-intentioned Federal law nevertheless \nprevents local school officials from expelling these dangerous students \nfrom their schools for all but a short period of time.\n  Let me admit up front that I bear my share of the responsibility for \nthis situation. Two years ago, I was one of 98 Senators who voted to \nreauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Act, the so-called IDEA \nlegislation.\n  Only the courageous and farsighted Senator from Washington, Mr. \nGorton, voted against final passage of IDEA shortly after his \ncommonsense amendment to address these discipline procedures failed by \njust three votes.\n  Two years later, Senator Gorton's warnings began to appear prophetic, \nand I certainly appreciate his crucial leadership on this issue, as \nwell as the many others Senator Gorton has helped the Senate to follow.\n  In any case, I voted for IDEA because I believed then, and I continue \nto believe, that it is appropriate for the Federal Government to help \nlocal school districts bear the financial burden of attending to the \nspecial needs of disabled children. But it is unfair and it is unwise \nfor the Federal Government to use these funds to mandate unreasonable \nand even dangerous discipline procedures on the local schools. I \nbelieve that the amendment which I hope will be pending shortly will be \nan important first step in correcting this flaw in the IDEA \nlegislation.\n  There are 165,402 children in North Carolina classified as learning \ndisabled. I believe that every one of these children is entitled to get \nan education. But under the IDEA legislation, if 1--even 1--of those \n165,402 children brings a weapon to school, he or she must be returned \nto the classroom within 45 days if the school district wants to keep \nits IDEA funding. If a disabled student threatens violence or poses any \nother kind of general discipline problem, the student can be suspended \nfor only 10 days. Worse, these limitations apply to disabled children \neven if their behavior is unrelated to the disability.\n  Clearly, this policy defies common sense. This amendment frees the \nhands of school administrators to use their discretion to discipline a \nlearning-disabled student who brings a weapon to school or threatens \nviolence. I believe the Senate should adopt this eminently reasonable \nposition.\n  Anybody who does not want to take my word for it should listen to the \nexperts. For example, North Carolina State University is home to a \nunique organization called the Center for the Prevention of School \nViolence. It is, as far as I know, one of the few public policy outlets \ndevoted solely to the issue of school violence. Its director, Pam \nRiley, works tirelessly to collect statistics, analyze legislation, and \nsuggest solutions to make our schools safer.\n  I called Dr. Riley and asked her to look over the amendment I am \ndiscussing and to let me know her opinion. With the Chair's permission, \nI shall read a paragraph from her reply to me, because she states the \nissue quite clearly and succinctly, as far as I am concerned. Let me \nquote her:\n\n       I believe it is entirely appropriate--indeed, entirely \n     necessary--for Congress to allow local schools the \n     flexibility to discipline students who bring weapons to \n     school or threaten violence on their teachers or peers, \n     regardless of whether the student is classified as disabled. \n     While I believe it is important to make sure disabled \n     students receive quality education, the safety of our \n     classrooms should be an overriding goal of federal education \n     policy.\n\n  That says it all, as far as I am concerned. I know that Senator \nAshcroft and Senator Frist share my appreciation for Dr. Riley's \nsupport of this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that her entire \nletter, dated May 11, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the North Carolina School Boards Association, in a \nletter dated May 13, 1999, echoed Dr. Riley's sentiments:\n\n       Being able to appropriately discipline all students is \n     essential to maintaining safe schools.\n\n  Dr. Bob Bowers, superintendent of the Buncombe County Schools, wrote:\n\n       [T]he Ashcroft amendment--\n\n  And it is now the Ashcroft-Frist-Helms amendment--\n\n     is a necessary and proper response to student threats of \n     violence in our schools made against teachers and [other \n     students]. Moreover, weapons have no place in our schools and \n     making exceptions erodes confidence regarding overall school \n     safety.\n\n  I certainly agree. I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the \nNorth Carolina School Boards Association and the Buncombe County Public \nSchools be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n[[Page S5349]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  I hope those listening to this discussion are not misled into \nthinking that school administrators are suddenly discovering this \nproblem as an aftermath of the Littleton tragedy. The fact is that \nschools have long been concerned about this aspect of IDEA.\n  This letter to my office dated April 2, 1998, from the Onslow County \nSchools in Jacksonville, NC, clearly indicates that discipline \nprocedures have long been a problem for our school districts. More than \na year ago, Superintendent Ronald Singletary wrote to me to say that \nunder the IDEA law, ``we convey [to students] that there are no real \nconsequences for the serious misbehavior of a disabled student.'' I \ncannot imagine a more inappropriate message to send to our students.\n  The problems we are discussing are more than just a quirk in the law \nor a technical matter. It is clearly an ill-conceived mistake by \nCongress, in which I participated. And I hope Senators will ask \nthemselves what possible reason the Federal Government would have to \nprevent local school officials from making sure that their students \nhave safe classrooms. This is the real problem.\n  Our school boards and our administrators are asking for our help in \ncorrecting a part of IDEA that does not work. And I sincerely hope the \nSenate will listen.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article ``Disabled \neducators'' to which I referred at the outset of my comments be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. HELMS.

I am certainly pleased to \n     offer my support for this proposal, and I hope it will be \n     swiftly adopted by the Senate.\n       I believe it is entirely appropriate--indeed, entirely \n     necessary--for Congress to allow local schools the \n     flexibility to discipline students who bring weapons to \n     school or threaten violence on their teachers or peers, \n     regardless of whether the student is classified as disabled. \n     While I believe it is important to make sure disabled \n     students receive quality education, the safety of our \n     classrooms should be an overriding goal of federal education \n     policy.\n       As Director of the Center for the Prevention of School \n     Violence at North Carolina State University, I know our local \n     officials are struggling to curb the worsening problem of \n     violence in our schools. The Center's vision that ``Every \n     student will attend a school that is safe and secure, one \n     that is free of fear and conductive to learning.'' I hope the \n     federal government will take all proper steps to assist in \n     obtaining this goal, and I believe the Ashcroft amendment is \n     a step in the right direction.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Dr. Pamela L.

Jesse A. Helms,\n     Dirkson Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: Thank you for sharing with me the \n     Ashcroft School Safety Act, which seeks to amend the IDEA and \n     the Guns Free Schools Act of 1994. The North Carolina School \n     Boards Association strongly supports this Act. As you know, \n     school safety is an issue of paramount concern for school \n     districts. If we cannot maintain safety, it is impossible for \n     us to teach children. Being able to appropriately discipline \n     all students is essential to maintaining safe schools. The \n     Ashcroft School Safety Act would give school systems more \n     ability to discipline special education students the same as \n     regular education students in specific situations. This would \n     allow the entire school's safety to not be impaired by one \n     individual student.\n       If I can be of further assistance to you, please let me \n     know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Leanne E. Winner,\n     Director of Governmental Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Buncombe County Public Schools,\n\n                                      Asheville, NC, May 12, 1999.\n     Re Ashcroft amendment to IDEA.\n\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: Thank you for making this Board of \n     Education aware of Senator Ashcroft's proposed amendment to \n     the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This Board \n     supports that law and is committed to providing an excellent \n     education to all students attending the public schools in \n     Buncombe County.\n       However, this Board is concerned about school violence and \n     the ability of educators and administrators to deal with \n     potential problems and protect the safety of everyone. To \n     that end, we believe that the Ashcroft Amendment is a \n     necessary and proper response to student threats of violence \n     in our schools made against teachers and peers. Moreover, \n     weapons have no place in our schools and making exceptions \n     erodes confidence regarding overall school safety.\n       We are pleased to offer our support of this measure.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Dr. Bob Bowens,\n\n                                   Superintendent, Buncombe County\n                                               Board of Education.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 3\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 6, 1999]\n\n                           Disabled Educators\n\n                           (By Kenneth Smith)\n\n       When Fairfax County school officials discovered that a \n     group of students had somehow managed to get a loaded .357 \n     magnum handgun on school property, they moved swiftly to deal \n     with the offenders. They expelled five of the students and \n     would have done so with the sixth, only to discover that \n     federal law prohibited them from doing so.\n       Why? He was considered ``learning disabled''--he had a \n     ``weakness in written language skills''--and according to \n     federal disabilities laws, Fairfax County had to continue \n     educating him. As Jane Timian, a county School Board official \n     who oversees student disciplinary cases, later explained the \n     matter, ``The student was not expelled, The student later \n     bragged to teachers and students at the school that he could \n     not be expelled.''\n       He wasn't alone. She reported that after five gang members \n     used a meat hook in an assault on another student, only three \n     of them were expelled; the other two were special-ed \n     students. When then-Virginia Gov. George Allen dared to \n     challenge the wisdom of using federal law to make schools \n     safer for violent offenders, the Clinton administration \n     responded by threatening to yank millions of dollars in \n     federal education dollars from the state.\n       That was 1994. Five years' worth of reform later, parents \n     shocked by the shootings at Columbine High School and \n     elsewhere may be interested to know that a law known as the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act still limits the \n     discretion of local school boards to provide children with \n     the safest schools possible. At a meeting in San Francisco \n     last month, the National School Boards Association urged \n     federal lawmakers to amend the law to provide greater \n     flexibility to suspend, expel, or reassign students whose \n     misconduct jeopardizes safety or unreasonably disrupts \n     classroom learning. In particular, it seeks the removal of \n     federal restrictions on withholding educational services \n     to disabled students ``when their behavior, unrelated to \n     their disability, endangers themselves or others.''\n       One would have thought it one of the more uncontroversial \n     requests ever made of Congress. But when Rep. Bob Livingston, \n     chairman of the House Appropriations Committee before he \n     unexpectedly left town, tried to tack an amendment onto an \n     appropriations measure that would accommodate the concerns of \n     school officials, the administration forced him to drop it. \n     Safer schools would have to wait.\n       How a model program like the IDEA turned out to be so \n     delinquent would keep a political science class at the \n     chalkboard for a week. The point of the act, first passed in \n     1975 and reauthorized most recently in 1997, was to ensure \n     that a disability, physical or otherwise, did not deny \n     someone access to education that everyone else got. Among \n     other things, it called for the least restrictive--most \n     permissive, one might say--educational setting possible for \n     the disabled student. The law also dictated that special \n     education was to take place within the school and not be \n     isolated in some outside annex.\n       In theory it sounded like a fine idea. If the handicapped \n     were to lead the kind of independent lives everyone wanted \n     for them, they would need at least as good an education as \n     everyone else. The last thing anyone worried about was that a \n     blind, retarded child in a wheelchair might bring a gun to \n     school.\n       Today, school officials still aren't very worried about \n     that particular child. What's changed is the definition of \n     disabled. When mere ``weakness in written language \n     skills'' or attention and learning disorders constitute a \n     handicap, not only do the numbers of disabled grow, there \n     is no physical impairment to limit the harm they could do. \n     ``No one thought,'' one school official says, ``the \n     disabled would be like us.''\n       Louisiana officials who sought help from Mr. Livingston \n     found out the hard way.\n\n[[Page S5350]]\n\n     Among the anecdotes they collected from across the state:\n       Two students, one of them a special-education student, \n     severely beat a third student who was subsequently \n     hospitalized. The non-special-ed attacker was expelled from \n     school. The special-ed attacker was suspended for 10 days, \n     then returned to an alternative school across the street from \n     the school where the girl was beaten.\n       A 14-year-old special-ed girl, who had been suspended for \n     threatening a class aide, attacked her school principal \n     twice, knocking her unconscious, damaging vertebrae in her \n     neck and causing permanent nerve damage. Police arrested the \n     student, and school officials kept her out of school for 45 \n     days, the maximum under the IDEA. The principal was out for \n     eight months.\n       A special-ed student, already under an in-school \n     suspension, threatened to burn his school down after being \n     told his suspension was being extended. Days later the school \n     did in fact burn down, and police arrested the student. His \n     brother, also a special-ed student under suspension, \n     subsequently threatened to shoot the principal. The school \n     was forced to lock its doors, keeping students inside, until \n     police could apprehend the student. The law permits the \n     students to return to school in 45 days, but the school \n     superintendent has vowed he will go to jail before he lets \n     them back in.\n       School administrators say they are more than willing to \n     educate disabled students, but not at the cost of the safety \n     of everyone else in the school. And they worry that the \n     federal government is teaching disabled students a terrible \n     lesson--that there is one standard for them, and another for \n     everyone else. What could be more disabling?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from North \nCarolina. In the recent debates, certainly in the passage of the Ed-\nFlex bill, the great State of North Carolina showed what a great \nexample it could be in its forward thinking and being able to look for \ninnovative solutions for our children's education.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my colleagues from \nTennessee and from Missouri for an outstanding amendment, one that I \nhope will be overwhelmingly supported by all of our colleagues. It is \nimportant we not discriminate, in a way we would say if this child \nhappens to be under the IDEA program, individuals with disabilities, \nthat the laws or the rules and regulations say we will not discipline \nyou if you happen to carry a gun or bomb to school.\n  Clearly, we want any student who is carrying a gun or a firearm or \nbomb to school to be disciplined--any student. We want safe schools. \nThis amendment would provide for that. It is a commonsense amendment. \nIt is an amendment that should be passed overwhelmingly.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that \nis critical to saving children's lives. That issue is guns in the hands \nof our children. The events of Columbine have been a wake up call for \nthe American people. Guns don't belong in the hands of kids. We must do \neverything we can to see to it that children cannot buy guns. We also \nneed tougher penalties for illegal possession and crimes committed with \nguns. This is about America's children and getting behind our kids. \nThis is about keeping our kids safer in their schools and safer on our \nstreets.\n  I respect the Constitution and the right of law-abiding citizens to \nown guns. I understand that many people own a gun for self-protection. \nThe fear of crime is a real issue for many Americans. I believe people \nshould be able to protect themselves. I also know people enjoy using \nguns for sport. Many Americans enjoy hunting, and I do not want to \ninterfere with lawful sport.\n  My support for reasonable steps to protect kids does not go against \nmy support for people's right to protect themselves or their right to \nhunt. We can take measures to save lives without infringing on the \nConstitution.\n  One of my biggest concerns is the safe storage of guns in the home. I \nthink it makes sense to require trigger locks for guns while children \nare in the home. There have been too many tragic accidents with \nchildren that could have been prevented.\n  Guns are too easily available to our young people. We must require \ngun show participants to comply with the same laws as gun shop owners. \nThis would cut off a deadly supply of firearms to our Nation's children \nand dangerous criminals. The guns used in the Columbine massacre were \npurchased from gun shows. I was very disappointed that the Lautenberg \namendment did not pass. This amendment would have closed the gun show \nloophole. What passed instead was an amendment giving a gun show \nparticipant the option of conducting a background check. Now, what gun \nshow participant is going to choose to take the time and effort when \nthe gun seller in the next booth is willing to sell a gun with no \nquestions asked?\n  I was happy to support an amendment which would toughen the penalties \nfor possession of semiautomatic assault weapons. The presence of \nsemiautomatic weapons on our streets is a deplorable situation. Assault \nweapons have one purpose--to kill the largest number of people as \nquickly and efficiently as possible. They have no legitimate hunting or \nsporting use. I want to see them taken off our streets.\n  We must get behind our kids and teach them that character counts. We \nhave to teach them respect for guns and respect for human life. We must \nlisten carefully to them and help them when they are in trouble. We \nneed to give them constructive goals to work toward. We must give them \nopportunities to live a rewarding life. Then they can respect \nthemselves and others and not resort to guns and violence to demand the \nattention they need. We want kids to turn toward each other--not \nagainst each other.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/14/senate-section/article/S5350-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5350-S5364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PRINTING OF RAMBOUILLET AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

All law enforcement agencies, organizations and \n     personnel of the Parties, which for purposes of this Chapter \n     will include customs and border police operating in Kosovo, \n     shall act in compliance with this Agreement and shall observe \n     internationally recognized standards of human rights and due \n     process. In exercising their functions, law enforcement \n     personnel shall not discriminate on any ground, such as sex, \n     race, color, language, religion, political or other opinion, \n     national or social origin, association with a national \n     community, property, birth or other status.\n       2. The Parties invite the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) through its Implementation \n     Mission (IM) to monitor and supervise implementation of this \n     Chapter and related provisions of this Agreement. The Chief \n     of the Implementation Mission (CIM) or his designee shall \n     have the authority to issue binding directives to the Parties \n     and subsidiary bodies on police and civil public security \n     matters to obtain compliance by the Parties with the terms of \n     this Chapter. The Parties agree to cooperate fully with the \n     IM and to comply with its directives. Personnel assigned to \n     police-related duties within the IM shall be permitted to \n     wear a uniform while serving in this part of the mission.\n       3.

The IM shall have the authority to:\n       (a) Monitor, observe, and inspect law enforcement \n     activities, personnel, and facilities, including border \n     police and customs units, as well as associated judicial \n     organizations, structures, and proceedings;\n       (b) Advise law enforcement personnel and forces, including \n     border police and customs units, and, when necessary to bring \n     them into compliance with this Agreement, including this \n     Chapter, issue appropriate binding directions in coordination \n     with KFOR;\n       (c) Participate in and guide the training of law \n     enforcement personnel;\n       (d) In coordination with KFOR, assess threats to public \n     order;\n       (e) Advise and provide guidance to governmental authorities \n     on how to deal with threats to public order and on the \n     organization of effective civilian law enforcement agencies;\n       (f) Accompany the Parties' law enforcement personnel as \n     they carry out their responsibilities, as the IM deems \n     appropriate;\n       (g) Dismiss or discipline public security personnel of the \n     Parties for cause; and\n       (h) Request appropriate law enforcement support from the \n     international community to enable IM to carry out the duties \n     assigned in this Chapter.\n       5. All Kosovo, Republic and Federal law enforcement and \n     Federal military authorities shall be obligated, in their \n     respective areas of authority, to ensure freedom of movement \n     and safe passage for all persons, vehicles and goods. This \n     obligation includes a duty to permit the unobstructed passage \n     into Kosovo of police equipment which has been approved by \n     the CIM and COMKFOR for use by Kosovo police, and of any \n     other support provided under subparagraph 4(h) above.\n       6. The Parties undertake to provide one another mutual \n     assistance, when requested, in the surrender of those accused \n     of committing criminal acts within a Party's jurisdiction, \n     and in the investigation and prosecution of offenses across \n     the boundary of Kosovo with other parts of the FRY. The \n     Parties shall develop agreed procedures and mechanisms for \n     responding to these requests. The CIM or his designee shall \n     resolve disputes on these matters.\n       7. The IM shall aim to transfer law enforcement \n     responsibilities described in Article II below to the law \n     enforcement officials and organizations described in Article \n     II at the earliest practical time consistent with civil \n     public security.\n\n                      Article II: Communal Police\n\n       1. As they build up, communal police units, organized and \n     stationed at the communal and municipal levels, shall assume \n     primary responsibility for law enforcement in Kosovo. The \n     specific responsibilities of the communal police will include \n     police patrols and crime prevention, criminal investigations, \n     arrest and detention of criminal suspects, crowd control, and \n     traffic control.\n       2. Number and Composition. The total number of communal \n     police established by this Agreement operating within Kosovo \n     shall not exceed 3,000 active duty law enforcement officers. \n     However, the CIM shall have the authority to increase or \n     decrease this personnel ceiling if he determines such action \n     is necessary to meet operational needs. Prior to taking any \n     such action, the CIM shall consult with the Criminal Justice \n     Administration and other officials as appropriate. The \n     national communities in each commune shall be fairly \n     represented in the communal police unit.\n       3. Criminal Justice Administration.\n       a. A Criminal Justice Administration (CJA) shall be \n     established. It shall be an Administrative Organ of Kosovo, \n     reporting to an appropriate member of the Government of\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\n     Kosovo as determined by the Government. The CJA shall provide \n     general coordination of law enforcement operations in Kosovo. \n     Specific functions of the CJA shall include general \n     supervision over, and providing guidance to, communal police \n     forces through their commanders, assisting in the \n     coordination between separate communal police forces, and \n     oversight of the operations of the police academy. In \n     carrying out these responsibilities, the CJA may issue \n     directives, which shall be binding on communal police \n     commanders and personnel. In the exercise of its functions, \n     the CJA shall be subject to any directions given by CIM.\n       b. Within twelve months of the establishment of the CJA, \n     the CJA shall submit for review by the CIM a plan for the \n     coordination and development of law enforcement bodies and \n     personnel in Kosovo within its jurisdiction. This plan shall \n     serve as the framework for law enforcement coordination and \n     development in Kosovo and be subject to modification by the \n     CIM.\n       c. The IM will endeavor to develop the capacities of the \n     CJA as quickly as possible. Prior to the point when the CJA \n     is able to properly carry out the functions described in the \n     preceding paragraph, as determined by the CIM, the IM shall \n     carry out these functions.\n       4. Communal Commanders. Subject to review by the CIM, each \n     commune will appoint, and may remove for cause, by majority \n     vote of the communal council, a communal police commander \n     with responsibility for police operations within the commune.\n       5. Service in Police.\n       (a) Recruitment for public security personnel will be \n     conducted primarily at the local level. Local and communal \n     governments, upon consultation with communal Criminal Justice \n     Commissions, will nominate officer candidates to attend the \n     Kosovo Police Academy. Offers of employment will be made by \n     communal police commanders, with the concurrence of the \n     academy director, only after the candidate has successfully \n     completed the academy basic recruit course.\n       (b) Recruitment, selection and training of communal police \n     officers shall be conducted under the direction of the IM \n     during the period of its operation.\n       (c) There shall be no bar to service in the communal police \n     based on prior political activities. Members of the police \n     shall not, however, be permitted while they hold this public \n     office to participate in party political activities other \n     than membership in such a party.\n       (d) Continued service in the police is dependent upon \n     behavior consistent with the terms of this Agreement, \n     including this Chapter. The IM shall supervise regular \n     reviews of officer performance, which shall be conducted in \n     accordance with international due process norms.\n       6. Uniforms and Equipment.\n       (a) All communal police officers, with the exception of \n     officers participating in crowd control functions, shall wear \n     a standard uniform. Uniforms shall include a badge, \n     picture identification, and name tag.\n       (b) Communal police officers may be equipped with a \n     sidearm, handcuffs, a baton, and a radio.\n       (c) Subject to authorization or modification by the CIM, \n     each commune may maintain, either at the communal \n     headquarters or at municipal stations, no more than one long-\n     barreled weapon not to exceed 7.62 mm for every fifteen \n     police officers assigned to the commune. Each such weapon \n     must be approved by and registered with the IM and KFOR \n     pursuant to procedures established by the CIM and COMKFOR. \n     When not in use, all such weapons will be securely stored and \n     each commune will keep a registry of these weapons.\n       (i) In the event of a serious law enforcement threat that \n     would justify the use of these weapons, the communal police \n     commander shall obtain IM approval before employing these \n     weapons.\n       (ii) The communal police commander may authorize the use of \n     these weapons without prior approval of the IM for the sole \n     purpose of self-defense. In such cases, he must report the \n     incident no later than one hour after it occurs to the IM and \n     KFOR.\n       (iii) If the CIM determines that a weapon has been used by \n     a member of a communal police force in a manner contrary to \n     this Chapter, he may take appropriate corrective measures; \n     such measures may include reducing the number of such weapons \n     that the communal police force is allowed to possess or \n     dismissing or disciplining the law enforcement personnel \n     involved.\n       (d) Communal police officers engaged in crowd control \n     functions will receive equipment appropriate to their task, \n     including batons, helmets and shields, subject to IM \n     approval.\n\n                  Article III: Interim Police Academy\n\n       1. under the supervision of the IM, the CJA shall establish \n     an interim Police Academy that will offer mandatory and \n     professional development training for all public security \n     personnel, including border police. Until the interim police \n     academy is established, IM will oversee a temporary training \n     program for public security personnel including border \n     police.\n       2. All public security personnel shall be required to \n     complete a course of police studies successfully before \n     serving as communal police officers.\n       3. The Academy shall be headed by a Director appointed and \n     removed by the CJA in consultation with the Kosovo Criminal \n     Justice Commission and the IM. The Director shall consult \n     closely with the IM and comply fully with its recommendations \n     and guidance.\n       4. All Republic and Federal police training facilities in \n     Kosovo, including the academy at Vucitrn, will cease \n     operations within 6 months of the entry into force of this \n     Agreement.\n\n                Article IV: Criminal Justice Commissions\n\n       1. The parties shall establish a Kosovo Criminal Justice \n     Commission and Communal Criminal Justice Commissions. The CIM \n     or his designee shall chair meetings of these Commissions. \n     They shall be forums for cooperation, coordination and the \n     resolution of disputes concerning law enforcement and civil \n     public security in Kosovo.\n       2. The functions of the Commissions shall include the \n     following:\n       (a) Monitor, review, and make recommendations regarding the \n     operation of law enforcement personnel and policies in \n     Kosovo, including communal police units;\n       (b) Review, and make recommendations regarding the \n     recruitment, selection and training of communal police \n     officers and commanders;\n       (c) Consider complaints regarding police practices filed by \n     individuals or national communities, and provided information \n     and recommendations to communal police commanders and the CIM \n     for consideration in their reviews of officer performance; \n     and\n       (d) In the Kosovo Criminal Justice Commission only: In \n     consultation with designated local, Republic and Federal \n     police liaisons, monitor jurisdiction sharing in cases of \n     overlapping criminal jurisdiction between Kosovo, Republic \n     and Federal authorities.\n       3. The membership of the Kosovo Criminal Justice Commission \n     and each Communal Criminal Justice Commission shall be \n     representative of the population and shall include:\n       (a) In the Kosovo Criminal Justice Commission:\n       (i) a representative of each commune;\n       (ii) the head of the Kosovo CJA;\n       (iii) a representative of each Republic and Federal law \n     enforcement component operating in Kosovo (for example, \n     Customs police and Border police);\n       (iv) a representative of each national community;\n       (v) a representative of the IM, during its period of \n     operation in Kosovo;\n       (vi) a representative of the VJ border guard, as \n     appropriate;\n       (vii) a representative of the MUP, as appropriate, while \n     present in Kosovo; and\n       (viii) a representative of KFOR, as appropriate.

The Parties agree to reallocate ownership and resources \n     in accordance insofar as possible with the distribution of \n     powers and responsibilities set forth in this Agreement, in \n     the following areas:\n       (a) government-owned assets (including educational \n     institutions, hospitals, natural resources, and production \n     facilities);\n       (b) pension and social insurance contributions;\n       (c) revenues to be distributed under Article 1.5; and\n       (d) any other matters relating to economic relations \n     between the Parties not covered by this Agreement.\n       2.

In parallel with the continuing full implementation of \n     this Agreement, urgent attention must be focused on meeting \n     the real humanitarian and economic needs of Kosovo in order \n     to help create the conditions for reconstruction and lasting \n     economic recovery. International assistance will be provided \n     without discrimination between national communities.\n       2. The Parties welcome the willingness of the European \n     Commission working with the international community to co-\n     ordinate international support for the parties' efforts. \n     Specifically, the European Commission will organize an \n     international donors' conference within one month of entry \n     into force of this Agreement.\n       3. The international community will provide immediate and \n     unconditional humanitarian assistance, focusing primarily on \n     refugees and internally displaced persons returning to their \n     former homes. The Parties welcome and endorse the UNHCR's \n     lead role in co-ordination of this effort, and endorse its \n     intention, in close co-operation with the Implementation \n     Mission, to plan an early, peaceful, orderly and phased \n     return of refugees and displaced persons in conditions of \n     safety and dignity.\n       4. The international community will provide the means for \n     the rapid improvement of living conditions for the population \n     of Kosovo through the reconstruction and rehabilitation of \n     housing and local infrastructure (including water, energy, \n     health and local education infrastructure) based on damage \n     assessment surveys.\n       5. Assistance will also be provided to support the \n     establishment and development of the institutional and \n     legislative framework laid down in this Agreement, including \n     local governance and tax settlement, and to reinforce civil \n     society, culture and education. Social welfare will also be \n     addressed, with priority given to the protection of \n     vulnerable social groups.\n       6. It will also be vital to lay the foundations for \n     sustained development, based on a revival of the local \n     economy. This must take account of the need to address \n     unemployment, and to stimulate the economy by a range of \n     mechanisms. The European Commission will be giving urgent \n     attention to this.\n       7. International assistance, with the exception of \n     humanitarian aid, will be subject to full compliance with \n     this Agreement as well as other conditions defined in advance \n     by the donors and the absorptive capacity of Kosovo.\n\n                               CHAPTER 5\n\n                            Implementation I\n\n                        Article I: Institutions\n\n\n                         Implementation Mission\n\n       1.

The CIM shall serve as the Chair of the Joint \n     Commission. The Chair shall coordinate and organize the work \n     of the Joint Commission and decide the time and place of its \n     meetings. The Parties shall abide by and fully implement the \n     decisions of the Joint Commission.

The CIM shall:\n       (a) supervise and direct the implementation of the civilian \n     aspects of this Agreement pursuant to a schedule that he \n     shall specify;\n       (b) maintain close contact with the Parties to promote full \n     compliance with those aspects of this Agreement;\n       (c) facilitate, as he deems necessary, the resolution of \n     difficulties arising in connection with such implementation;\n       (d) participate in meetings of donor organizations, \n     including on issues of rehabilitation and reconstruction, in \n     particular by putting forward proposals and identifying \n     priorities for their consideration as appropriate;\n       (e) coordinate the activities of civilian organizations and \n     agencies in Kosovo assisting in the implementation of the \n     civilian aspects of this Agreement, respecting fully their \n     specific organizational procedures;\n       (f) report periodically to the bodies responsible for \n     constituting the Mission on progress in the implementation of \n     the civilian aspects of this Agreement; and\n       (g) carry out the functions specified in this Agreement \n     pertaining to police and security forces.\n       2. The CIM shall also carry out other responsibilities set \n     forth in this Agreement or as may be later agreed.\n\n             Article III: Status of Implementation Mission\n\n       1.

The Implementation Mission shall enjoy such legal \n     capacity as may be necessary for the exercise of its \n     functions under the laws and regulations of Kosovo, the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the Republic of Serbia. \n     Such legal capacity shall include the capacity to contract, \n     and to acquire and dispose of real and personal property.\n       4.

The Parties acknowledge that complete implementation \n     will require political acts and measures, and the election \n     and establishment of institutions and bodies set forth in \n     this Agreement. The Parties agree to proceed expeditiously \n     with these tasks on a schedule set by the Joint Commission. \n     The Parties shall provide active support, cooperation, and \n     participation for the successful implementation of this \n     Agreement.\n\n\n                          election and census\n\n       2. Within nine months of the entry into force of this \n     Agreement, there shall be elections in accordance with and \n     pursuant to procedures specified in Chapter 3 of this \n     Agreement for authorities established herein, according to a \n     voter list prepared to international standards by the Central \n     Election Commission.

All laws and regulations applicable in Kosovo that are \n     incompatible with this Agreement shall be presumed to have \n     been harmonized with this Agreement. In particular, martial \n     law in Kosovo is hereby revoked.\n       5. Institutions currently in place in Kosovo shall remain \n     until superseded by bodies created by or in accordance with \n     this Agreement. The CIM may recommend to the appropriate \n     authorities the removal and appointment of officials and the \n     curtailment of operations of existing institutions in Kosovo \n     if he deems it necessary for the effective implementation of \n     this Agreement. If the action recommended is not taken in the \n     time requested, the Joint Commission may decide to take the \n     recommended action.\n       6. Prior to the election of Kosovo officials pursuant to \n     this Agreement, the CIM shall take the measures necessary to \n     ensure the development and functioning of independent media \n     in keeping with international standards, including allocation \n     of radio and television frequencies.\n\n                   Article V: Authority to Interpret\n\n       The CIM shall be the final authority in theater regarding \n     interpretation of the civilian aspects of this Agreement, and \n     the Parties agree to abide by his determinations as binding \n     on all Parties and persons.\n\n                               CHAPTER 6\n\n                             The Ombudsman\n\n                           Article I: General\n\n       1. There shall be an Ombudsman, who shall monitor the \n     realization of the rights of members of national communities \n     and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms \n     in Kosovo. The Ombudsman shall have unimpeded access to any \n     person or place and shall have the right to appear and \n     intervene before any domestic, Federal, or (consistent with \n     the rules of such bodies) international authority upon his or \n     her request. No person, institution, or entity of the Parties \n     may interfere with the functions of the Ombudsman.\n       2. The Ombudsman shall be an eminent person of high moral \n     standing who possesses a demonstrated commitment to human \n     rights and the rights of members of national communities. He \n     or she shall be nominated by the President of Kosovo and \n     shall be elected by the Assembly from a list of candidates \n     prepared by the President of the European Court of Human \n     Rights for a non-renewable three-year term. The Ombudsman \n     shall not be a citizen of any State or entity that was a part \n     of the former Yugoslavia, or of any neighboring State. \n     Pending the election of the President and the Assembly, the \n     CIM shall designate a person to serve as Ombudsman on an \n     interim basis who shall be succeeded by a person selected \n     pursuant to the procedure set forth in this paragraph.\n       3. The Ombudsman shall be independently responsible for \n     choosing his or her own staff. He or she shall have two \n     Deputies. The Deputies shall each be drawn from different \n     national communities.\n       (a) The salaries and expenses of the Ombudsman and his or \n     her staff shall be determined and paid the Kosovo Assembly. \n     The salaries and expenses shall be fully adequate to \n     implement the Ombudsman's mandate.\n       (b) The Ombudsman and members of his or her staff shall not \n     be held criminally or civilly liable for any acts carried out \n     within the scope of their duties.\n\n                        Article II: Jurisdiction\n\n       1. The Ombudsman shall consider:\n       (a) alleged or apparent violations of human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms in Kosovo, as provided in the \n     Constitutions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the \n     Republic of Serbia, and the European Convention for the \n     Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the \n     Protocols thereto; and\n       (b) alleged or apparent violations of the rights of members \n     of national communities specified in this Agreement.\n       2. All persons in Kosovo shall have the right to submit the \n     complaints to the Ombudsman. The Parties agree not to take \n     any measures to punish persons who intend to submit or who \n     have submitted such allegations, or in any other way to deter \n     the exercise of this right.\n\n                     Article III: Powers and Duties\n\n       1. The Ombudsman shall investigate alleged violations \n     falling within the jurisdiction set forth in Article II.1. He \n     or she may act either on his or her own initiative or in \n     response to an allegation presented by any Party or person, \n     non-governmental organization, or group of individuals \n     claiming to be the victim of a violation or acting on behalf \n     of alleged victims who are deceased or missing. The work of \n     the Ombudsman shall be free of charge to the person \n     concerned.\n       2. The Ombudsman shall have complete, unimpeded, and \n     immediate access to any person, place, or information upon \n     his or her request.\n       (a) The Ombudsman shall have access to and may examine all \n     official documents, and he or she can require any person, \n     including officials of Kosovo, to cooperate by providing \n     relevant information, documents, and files.\n       (b) The Ombudsman may attend administrative hearings and \n     meetings of other Kosovo institutions in order to gather \n     information.\n       (c) The Ombudsman may examine facilities and places where \n     persons deprived of their liberty are detained, work, or are \n     otherwise located.\n       (d) The Ombudsman and staff shall maintain the \n     confidentiality of all confidential information obtained by \n     them, unless the Ombudsman determines that such information \n     is evidence of a violation of rights falling within his or \n     her jurisdiction, in which case that information may be \n     revealed in public reports or appropriate legal proceedings.\n       (e) The Parties undertake to ensure cooperation with the \n     Ombudsman's investigations. Willful and knowing failure to \n     comply shall be criminal offense prosecutable in any \n     jurisdiction of the Parties. Where an official impedes an \n     investigation by refusing to provide necessary information, \n     the Ombudsman shall contact that official's superior or the \n     public prosecutor for appropriate penal action to be taken in \n     accordance with the law.\n       3. The Ombudsman shall issue findings and conclusions in \n     the form of a published report promptly after concluding an \n     investigation.\n       (a) A Party, institution, or official identified by the \n     Ombudsman as a violator shall, within a period specified by \n     the Ombudsman, explain in writing how it will comply with any \n     prescriptions the Ombudsman may put forth for remedial \n     measures.\n       (b) In the event that a person or entity does not comply \n     with the conclusions and recommendations of the Ombudsman, \n     the report shall be forwarded for further action to the Joint \n     Commission established by Chapter 5 of this Agreement, to the \n     President of the appropriate Party, and to any other \n     officials or institutions that the Ombudsman deems proper.\n\n                               CHAPTER 7\n\n                           Implementation II\n\n                     Article I: General Obligations\n\n       1. The Parties undertake to recreate, as quickly as \n     possible, normal conditions of life in Kosovo and to co-\n     operate fully with each other and with all international \n     organizations, agencies, and non-governmental organizations \n     involved in the implementation of this Agreement. They \n     welcome the willingness of the international community to \n     send to the region a force to assist in the implementation of \n     this Agreement.\n       a. The United Nations Security Council is invited to pass a \n     resolution under Chapter VII of the Charter endorsing and \n     adopting the arrangements set forth in this Chapter, \n     including the establishment of a multinational military \n     implementation force in Kosovo. The Parties invite NATO to \n     constitute and lead a military force to help ensure \n     compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. They also \n     reaffirm the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).\n       b. The Parties agree that NATO will establish and deploy a \n     force (hereinafter ``KFOR'') which may be composed of ground, \n     air, and maritime units from NATO and non-NATO nations, \n     operating under the authority and subject to the direction \n     and the political control of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) \n     through the NATO chain of command. The Parties agree to \n     facilitate the deployment and operations of this force and \n     agree also to comply fully with all the obligations of this \n     Chapter.\n       c. It is agreed that other States may assist in \n     implementing this Chapter. The Parties\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\n     agree that the modalities of those States' participation will \n     be the subject of Agreement between such participating States \n     and NATO.\n       2. The purposes of these obligations are as follows:\n       a. to establish a durable cessation of hostilities. Other \n     than those Forces provided for in this Chapter, under no \n     circumstances shall any armed Forces enter, reenter, or \n     remain within Kosovo without the prior express consent of the \n     KFOR Commander (COMKFOR). For the purposes of this Chapter, \n     the term ``Forces'' includes all personnel and organizations \n     with military capability, including regular army, armed \n     civilian groups, paramilitary groups, air forces, national \n     guards, border police, army reserves, military police, \n     intelligence services, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Local, \n     Special, Riot and Anti-Terrorist Police, and any other groups \n     or individuals so designated by COMKFOR. The only exception \n     to the provisions of this paragraph is for civilian police \n     engaged in hot pursuit of a person suspected of committing a \n     serious criminal offense, as provided for in Chapter 2;\n       b. to provide for the support and authorization of the KFOR \n     and in particular to authorize the KFOR to take such actions \n     as are required, including the use of necessary force, to \n     ensure compliance with this Chapter and the protection of the \n     KFOR, Implementation Mission (IM), and other international \n     organizations, agencies, and non-governmental organizations \n     involved in the implementation of this Agreement, and to \n     contribute to a secure environment;\n       c. to provide, at no cost, the use of all facilities and \n     services required for the deployment, operations and support \n     of the KFOR.\n       3. The Parties understand and agree that the obligations \n     undertaken in this Chapter shall apply equally to each Party. \n     Each Party shall be held individually responsible for \n     compliance with its obligations, and each agrees that delay \n     or failure to comply by one Party shall not constitute cause \n     for any other Party to fail to carry out its own obligations. \n     All Parties shall be equally subject to such enforcement \n     action by the KFOR as may be necessary to ensure \n     implementation of this Chapter in Kosovo and the protection \n     of the KFOR, IM, and other international organizations, \n     agencies, and non-governmental organizations involved in the \n     implementation of this Agreement.\n\n                  Article II: Cessation of Hostilities\n\n       1. The Parties shall, immediately upon entry into force of \n     this Agreement (EIF), refrain from committing any hostile or \n     provocative acts of any type against each other or against \n     any person in Kosovo. They shall not encourage or organize \n     hostile or provocative demonstrations.\n       2. In carrying out the obligations set forth in paragraph \n     1, the Parties undertake in particular to cease the firing of \n     all weapons and explosive devices except as authorized by \n     COMKFOR. They shall not place any mines, barriers, \n     unauthorized checkpoints, observation posts (with the \n     exception of COMKFOR-approved border observation posts and \n     crossing points), or protective obstacles. Except as provided \n     in Chapter 2, the Parties shall not engage in any military, \n     security, or training-related activities, including ground, \n     air, or air defense operations, in or over Kosovo, without \n     the prior express approval of COMKFOR.\n       3. Except for Border Guard forces (as provided for in \n     Article IV), no Party shall have Forces present within a 5 \n     kilometer zone inward from the international border of the \n     FRY that is also the border of Kosovo (hereinafter ``the \n     Border Zone''). The Border Zone will be marked on the ground \n     by EIF + 14 days by VJ Border Guard personnel in accordance \n     with direction from IM. COMKFOR may determine small scale \n     reconfigurations for operational reasons.\n       4. a. With the exception of civilian police performing \n     normal police duties as determined by the CIM, no Party shall \n     have Forces present within 5 kilometers of the Kosovo side of \n     the boundary of Kosovo with other parts of the FRY.\n       b. The presence of any Forces within 5 kilometers of the \n     other side of that boundary shall be notified to COMKFOR; if, \n     in the judgment of COMKFOR, such presence threatens or would \n     threaten implementation of this Chapter in Kosovo, he shall \n     contact the authorities responsible for the Forces in \n     question and may require those Forces to withdraw from or \n     remain outside the area.\n       5. No party shall conduct any reprisals, counter-attacks, \n     or any unilateral actions in response to violations of this \n     Chapter by another Party. The Parties shall respond to \n     alleged violations of this Chapter through the procedures \n     provided in Article XI.\n\n Article III: Redeployment, Withdrawal, and Demilitarization of Forces\n\n       In order to disengage their Forces and to avoid any further \n     conflict, the Parties shall immediately upon EIF begin to re-\n     deploy, withdraw, or demilitarize their Forces in accordance \n     with Articles IV, V, and VI.\n\n                         Article IV: VJ Forces\n\n\n                            I.

By K-Day + 5 days, all VJ Army units in Kosovo (with the \n     exception of those Forces specified in paragraph 2 of this \n     Article) shall have completed redeployment to the approved \n     cantonment sites listed at Appendix A to this Chapter. This \n     senior VJ commander in Kosovo shall confirm in writing to \n     COMKFOR by K-Day + 5 days that the VJ is in compliance and \n     provide the information required in Article VII below to take \n     account of withdrawals or other changes made during the \n     redeployment. This information shall be updated weekly.\n       b. By K-Day + 30 days, the Chief of the VJ General Staff, \n     through the senior VJ commander in Kosovo, shall provide for \n     approval by COMKFOR a detailed plan for the phased withdrawal \n     of VJ Forces from Kosovo to other locations in Serbia to \n     ensure the following timelines are met:\n       (1) By K-Day + 90 days, VJ authorities must, to the \n     satisfaction of COMKFOR, withdraw from Kosovo to other \n     locations in Serbia 50% of men and materiel and all \n     designated offensive assets. Such assets are taken to be: \n     main battle tanks; all other armored vehicles mounting \n     weapons greater than 12.7mm; and, all heavy weapons (vehicle \n     mounted or not) of over 82mm.\n       (2) By K-Day + 180 days, all VJ Army personnel and \n     equipment (with the exception of those Forces specified in \n     paragraph 2 of this Article) shall be withdrawn from Kosovo \n     to other locations in Serbia.\n\n\n                       2. VJ Border Guard Forces\n\n       a. VJ Border Guard forces shall be permitted but limited to \n     a structure of 1500 members at pre-February 1998 Border Guard \n     Battalion facilities located in Djakovica, Prizren, and \n     Urosevac and subordinate facilities within the 5 kilometer \n     Border Zone, or at a limited number of existing facilities in \n     the immediate proximity of the Border Zone subject to the \n     prior approval of COMKFOR, with that number to be reached by \n     K-Day + 14 days. An additional number of VJ personnel--\n     totaling no more than 1000 C2 and logistics forces--will be \n     permitted to remain in the approved cantonment sites listed \n     at Appendix A to fulfill brigade-level functions related only \n     to border security. After an initial 90 day period from K-\n     Day, COMKFOR may at any time review the deployments of VJ \n     personnel and may require further adjustments to force level, \n     with the objective of reaching the minimum force structure \n     required for legitimate border security, as the security \n     situation and the conduct of Parties warrant.\n       b. VJ elements in Kosovo shall be limited to weapons of \n     82mm and below. They shall possess neither armored vehicles \n     (other than wheeled vehicles mounting weapons of 12.7mm or \n     less) nor air defense weapons.\n       c. VJ Border Guard units shall be permitted to patrol in \n     Kosovo only within the Border Zone and solely for purpose of \n     defending the border against external attack and maintaining \n     its integrity by preventing illicit border crossings. \n     Geographic terrain considerations may require Border Guard \n     maneuver inward of the Border Zone; any such maneuver shall \n     be coordinated with and approved by COMKFOR.\n       d. With the exception of the Border Zone, VJ units may \n     travel through Kosovo only to reach duty stations and \n     garrisons in the Border Zone or approved cantonment sites. \n     Such travel may only be along routes and in accordance with \n     procedures that have been determined by COMKFOR after \n     consultation with the CIM, VJ unit commanders, communal \n     government authorities, and police commanders. These routes \n     and procedures will be determined by K-Day + 14 days, subject \n     to re-determination by COMKFOR at any time. VJ forces in \n     Kosovo but outside the Border Zone shall be permitted to act \n     only in self-defense in response to a hostile act pursuant to \n     Rules of Engagement (ROE) which will be approved by COMKFOR \n     in consultation with the CIM. When deployed in the Border \n     Zone, they will act in accordance with ROE established under \n     control of COMKFOR.\n       e. VJ Border Guard forces may conduct training activities \n     only within the 5 kilometer Border Zone, and only with the \n     prior express approved of COMKFOR.\n\n\n             3.

The authorities in the FRY shall facilitate, on a \n     priority basis and with all appropriate means, all movement \n     of personnel, vehicles, vessels, aircraft, equipment, or \n     supplies, through or in the airspace, ports, airports, or \n     roads used. No charges may be assessed against NATO for air \n     navigation, landing, or takeoff of aircraft, whether \n     government-owned or chartered. Similarly, no duties, dues, \n     tolls or charges may be assessed against NATO ships, whether \n     government-owned or chartered, for the mere entry and exit of \n     ports. Vehicles, vessels, and aircraft used in support of the \n     Operation shall not be subject to licensing or registration \n     requirements, nor commercial insurance.\n       11. NATO is granted the use of airports, roads, rails, and \n     ports without payment of fees, duties, dues, tolls, or \n     charges occasioned by mere use. NATO shall not, however, \n     claim exemption from reasonable charges for specific services \n     requested and received, but operations/movement and access \n     shall not be allowed to be impeded pending payment for such \n     services.\n       12. NATO personnel shall be exempt from taxation by the \n     Parties on the salaries and emoluments received from NATO and \n     on any income received from outside the FRY.\n       13. NATO personnel and their tangible moveable property \n     imported into, acquired in, or exported from the FRY shall be \n     exempt from all duties, taxes, and other charges and \n     inspections and custom regulations.\n       14. NATO shall be allowed to import and to export, free of \n     duty, taxes and other charges, such equipment, provisions, \n     and supplies as NATO shall require for the Operation, \n     provided such goods are for the official use of NATO or for \n     sale to NATO personnel. Goods sold shall be solely for the \n     use of NATO personnel and not transferable to unauthorized \n     persons.\n       15. The Parties recognize that the use of communications \n     channels is necessary for the Operation. NATO shall be \n     allowed to operate its own internal mail services. The \n     Parties shall, upon simple request, grant all \n     telecommunications services, including broadcast services, \n     needed for the Operation, as determined by NATO. This shall \n     include the right to utilize such means and services as \n     required to assure full ability to communicate, and the right \n     to use all of the electro-magnetic spectrum for this purpose, \n     free of cost. In implementing this right, NATO shall\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\n     make every reasonable effort to coordinate with and take into \n     account the needs and requirements of appropriate authorities \n     in the FRY.\n       16. The Parties shall provide, free of cost, such public \n     facilities as NATO shall require to prepare for and execute \n     the Operation. The Parties shall assist NATO in obtaining, at \n     the lowest rate, the necessary utilities, such as \n     electricity, water, gas and other resources, as NATO shall \n     require for the Operation.\n       17. NATO and NATO personnel shall be immune from claims of \n     any sort which arise out of activities in pursuance of the \n     Operation; however, NATO will entertain claims on an ex \n     gratia basis.\n       18. NATO shall be allowed to contract directly for the \n     acquisition of goods, services, and construction from any \n     source within and outside the FRY. Such contracts, goods, \n     services, and construction shall be subject to the payment of \n     duties, taxes, or other charges. NATO may also carry out \n     construction works with their own personnel.\n       19. Commercial undertakings operating in the FRY only in \n     the service of NATO shall be exempt from local laws and \n     regulations with respect to the terms and conditions of \n     their employment and licensing and registration of \n     employees, businesses, and corporations.\n       20. NATO may hire local personnel who on an individual \n     basis shall remain subject to local laws and regulations with \n     the exception of labor/employment laws. However, local \n     personnel hired by NATO shall:\n       a. be immune from legal process in respect of words spoken \n     or written and all acts performed by them in their official \n     capacity;\n       b. be immune from national services and/or national \n     military service obligations;\n       c. be subject only to employment terms and conditions \n     established by NATO; and\n       d. be exempt from taxation on the salaries and emoluments \n     paid to them by NATO.\n       21. In carrying out its authorities under this Chapter, \n     NATO is authorized to detain individuals and, as quickly as \n     possible, turn them over to appropriate officials.\n       22. NATO may, in the conduct of the Operation, have need to \n     make improvements or modifications to certain infrastructure \n     in the FRY, such as roads, bridges, tunnels, buildings, and \n     utility systems. Any such improvements or modifications of a \n     non-temporary nature shall become part of and in the same \n     ownership as that infrastructure. Temporary improvements or \n     modifications may be removed at the discretion of the NATO \n     Commander, and the infrastructure returned to as near its \n     original condition as possible, fair wear and tear excepted.\n       23. Failing any prior settlement, disputes with the regard \n     to the interpretation or application of this Appendix shall \n     be settled between NATO and the appropriate authorities in \n     the FRY.\n       24. Supplementary arrangements with any of the Parties may \n     be concluded to facilitate any details connected with the \n     Operation.\n       25. The provisions of this Appendix shall remain in force \n     until completion of the Operation or as the Parties and NATO \n     otherwise agree.\n\n                               CHAPTER 8\n\n         Amendment, Comprehensive Assessment, and Final Clauses\n\n           Article I: Amendment and Comprehensive Assessment\n\n       1. Amendments to this Agreement shall be adopted by \n     agreement of all the Parties, except as otherwise provided by \n     Article X of Chapter 1.\n       2. Each Party may propose amendments at any time and will \n     consider and consult with the other Parties with regard to \n     proposed amendments.\n       3. Three years after the entry into force of this \n     Agreement, an international meeting shall be convened to \n     determine a mechanism for a final settlement for Kosovo, on \n     the basis of the will of the people, opinions of relevant \n     authorities, each Party's efforts regarding the \n     implementation of this Agreement, and the Helsinki Final Act, \n     and to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the \n     implementation of this Agreement and to consider proposals by \n     any Party for additional measures.\n\n                       Article II: Final Clauses\n\n       1. This Agreement is signed in the English language. After \n     signature of this Agreement, translations will be made into \n     Serbian, Albanian, and other languages of the national \n     communities of Kosovo, and attached to the English text.\n       2. This Agreement shall enter into force upon signature.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I further ask unanimous consent that in the permanent \nCongressional Record, the text of the agreement be printed immediately \nfollowing my remarks of May 3, 1999.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Utah?\n  Mr. HATCH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 2 minutes ago the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah had made the suggestion, another unanimous consent request, \nthat Senators bring up things even if Senators were not available on \nthe other side of an issue to speak, and that that Senator be given \nequal time on Monday or sometime prior to the vote. I might ask the \nChair, is there such a unanimous consent pending? Am I perhaps stating \nit too broadly?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There were two amendments authorized to be \noffered with the understanding, the proviso, that they would have \nadequate time on Monday. There was, further, an additional granting of \nthe request of the Senator from California that her amendment to be \nconsidered. But it does take consent for further amendments to be \noffered at this time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. I note the Senator from New Jersey is \nwithin his rights to make such a request. The Senator from Utah is \nwithin his rights to object to it.\n  Mr. President, I note the distinguished majority leader was on the \nfloor earlier, urging we move forward on this legislation, that we try \nto get as much done as possible today and Monday, a position both the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah and I joined. I suspect the two of us \nhave probably worked more hours than anybody else in this body to bring \nthat about. But there are not an awful lot of Senators around here \nwaiting to be heard. I urge the majority, they may well allow Senators \nlike Senator Lautenberg or others who have amendments to bring them up, \ndiscuss them, have some debate on them, and then if there are those who \nwish to oppose those amendments, they would of course have an equal \namount of time on Monday to do that. Otherwise, of course, the Senator \nfrom New Jersey can bring it up Monday.\n  But you cannot keep holding it off with the idea that maybe it will \nonly come up at the time of the vote on Tuesday, because that would be, \nin effect, a debate cloture on the part of the Republican side that \nwould say even if it was a serious matter they would only get 2.5 \nminutes of debate.\n  I know the distinguished senior Senator from Utah is a fair person. I \nthink he would perhaps agree that 2.5 minutes debate is not quite \nenough on major amendments. I hope they will find in their heart to \nallow the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey to bring up his \namendment. Clearly, he is going to be allowed to bring it up sometime \nprior to the vote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, when I suggested equal time, it was on \nthose particular amendments because of the need for certain Senators to \nbe here on those particular amendments. Earlier this morning, Senator \nLautenberg desired to call up his amendment and I respectfully \nrequested that he reserve bringing it up until Monday because there are \npeople gone who will not have an opportunity, who have asked me--who \nbelieved these amendments would not be brought up, who asked me to \nprotect their right to be here when the amendments are brought up. As a \ncourtesy, I ask him not to bring up the amendment. So I have no \nalternative other than to object to it.\n  We have had six amendments brought up. It is our turn on our side to \npresent an amendment. I think we are making progress. But we should \nhonor, to the best of our abilities on each side--the request of some \nof our colleagues that they might be here on amendments they consider \nto be important to them, especially since this is a Friday and almost \neverybody left believing we would not do much more today.\n\n  Be that as it may, that is why I have to object. I have objected and \nI will object to certain amendments where I have to protect people on \nour side, as I would expect the distinguished Senator from Vermont to \nobject if we tried to bring up an amendment when Senators on his side \ncould not be here to respond.\n  I have another amendment for our side to bring up at this time. It is \nan amendment on the part of Senator Sessions and Senator Robb and \nSenator Allard. I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S5364]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/14/senate-section/article/S5364-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       Y2K ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while we were on the motion to \nproceed, taking a cue from earlier speeches--the distinguished Senator \nfrom Colorado spoke at some length earlier. I would just like to take a \nfew minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I just note two things. First is that even though the last \namendment brought up by the Republican side is vehemently opposed by a \nMember on this side who could not be present, we made no objection to \nthat, knowing he would have time to debate later on. Mr. President, we \ndid this to try to comply with the request of the majority leader and \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah, who said they wanted to move \nforward with this. We did it in good faith. Frankly, for one of the \nvery few times in my 25 years in the Senate, I find my faith shaken \nbecause it is very obvious nobody intended to go forward; they just \nwanted to go right back to Y2K and block anything else.\n  If their side wants to bring up something even if our side is not \nhere to debate it, that is fine. If our side wants something similar, \nthat is not fine. It is like the Democratic amendments being voted down \nover here so a day or so later they can be brought up as Republican \namendments and voted up over there. And in between we hear complaints \nabout this is taking too long.\n  I will repeat what I have said before: Every single Democrat wants a \njuvenile justice bill with everything from the prevention of crime to \neducation to helping our juveniles. I question whether the same thing \ncan be said for the other side of the aisle.\n  The Senator from New Jersey had the floor. I yield back to him.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. HATCH. He can't yield the floor to another person--or did he have \nthe floor? I don't know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can only yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just answer that and then I will be \nhappy to yield to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  Look, the games are over as far as I am concerned. When a Senator \nstands on the floor and says he is protecting Members of his side and \nextends the same courtesy to the other side to protect Members on their \nside, all they have to do is tell us. If the distinguished Senator \nbelieves somebody on his side has to be protected, all he has to do to \nbe protected is tell me and I will honor that. I asked for that same \ncourtesy on our side because there are Senators who cannot be here who \nwant to be here when Senator Lautenberg brings up his amendment. It is \na fair request, a fair statement; it is a fair position. I really do \nnot think people should try to make political points or political hay \nout of it.\n\n  I might also add, nobody wants this bill more than I do. I have been \nworking on it for 2 solid years. I have been working on it every day on \nthe floor. I am going to do everything in my power to get it passed. I \nhave to admit I have had a lot of cooperation from our distinguished \nranking minority leader on the Judiciary Committee, for which I am very \ngrateful. But there is no reason to play these games here. It is \nunreasonable for anybody to suggest that because somebody is protecting \nhis side, because I am protecting my side, there is something untoward \nabout that. I would not suggest it if the Senator wanted to protect his \nside.\n  Naturally, I am going to yield the floor to my friend from New \nJersey. I wish I could accommodate him, frankly, because I care for \nhim. I know he is sincere on this amendment. But it is not unreasonable \nto ask that Senators, on something they feel very deeply about, since \neverybody left here today other than a few of us, that they be \nprotected so they can be here when the amendment is brought up.\n  Also, I note the distinguished Senator from Arkansas is on the floor. \nShe wants to make a statement that is unrelated to the bill, as I \nunderstand it, or to either of the bills--the current bill that is on \nthe floor or the prior bill we were debating.\n  So I yield the floor for the distinguished Senator, and of course, \nhopefully the Senator from Arkansas will then make her statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah for his \nconsummate interest in issues that matter, even though at times we \ndiffer. He did request a courtesy that I would like to have yielded to, \nexcept for the fact that we have allowed some on that side to be \nprotected while not enabling this Senator to be able to obtain the same \nprotection. I am bound, at 3:30, for Albania, Macedonia, Hungary, and \nBulgaria.\n  I plan to visit with our people in Aviano, Italy, and Brussels \nheadquarters and be back here Monday night. This is not intended to be \na world endurance record. That is not why I am doing this. I am doing \nit because I have had a deep interest in what takes place there and am \nshocked by the horror of the deeds that the Serbian Government is \nperpetrating on these people.\n  I have had a chance to meet some of the refugees at Fort Dix. I was \nthere last week with the First Lady to greet the first of the refugees \nwho arrived in America. I did serve in World War II--not in this area, \nbut I was in Europe during the war. The horrors we are witnessing are \ntoo much for a civilized world to bear.\n  I salute the leadership of the President, the courage and the \ncommitment of our troops who are there for long hours each and every \nday working to the best of their ability, which ability is very good.\n  There have been mistakes made, and that happens in a wartime \nenvironment. Mistakes are made because we are trying to make sure our \ncasualties are few.\n  That is where I am going, and I will not be here then on Monday to \nbring up this amendment. I would have offered the amendment without \ndebate.\n  The fact of the matter is that everyone is pretty much aware of what \nmy amendment is. It helps to further close the loopholes, which I know \nthe Senator from Utah wanted to do. I do not think the amendment we \nvoted on this morning does it. It does not close the loopholes. That is \nmy judgment, and I am prepared to defend that judgment.\n  I want to correct it. I want to see all the loopholes closed, and so \ndo the vast majority of Americans. Eighty-seven percent, as a matter of \nfact, in a national poll said they want the loopholes at the gun shows \nclosed.\n  I take a second seat to no one in wanting to get a juvenile justice \nbill in place. I want to see if we can help our young people avoid the \nviolence that seems to permeate our society. But the fact of the matter \nis that each of us in this parliamentary structure that we operate \nunder is entitled to offer amendments.\n  I had hoped I would have been able to, as they say in the vernacular \nhere, lay it down, put it at the desk and have it saved for debate at a \nlater time. The Senator from Utah tried very hard to be cooperative, as \nhe always does with me--we have a good relationship, and I respect that \nenormously--to say: All right, we can have some time. We will arrange \nnot a lot of time on Tuesday for a discussion and a vote.\n  The inability to offer that amendment is decidedly a disadvantage, \nthough it will be offered by one of my colleagues. I had hoped, since I \nauthored it in the first place, to send it up. That may be a red flag \nto some over there, but the fact of the matter is that I know the \nSenator from Utah does not disagree with me in principle; in approach \nperhaps, in principle certainly not.\n\n[[Page S5365]]\n\n  I ask once again if it is possible just to send it up. It does need \nunanimous consent. I will not force any objections. I take the liberty \nof asking the distinguished manager whether it is possible just to send \nit up and lay it down.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are no longer on that bill. I really cannot do that \nbecause of the courtesies I must extend to people on both sides. I am \nsorry I cannot accommodate the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. \nWe are no longer on that bill. As I understand it, we are on the motion \nto proceed to the Y2K bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I see some colleagues who want to speak at \nthis time. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lincoln be recognized \nfor 10 minutes and then Senator Voinovich, who will be on the floor \nshortly, be recognized for another 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/14/senate-section/article/S5365-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5365-S5366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE JUVENILE JUSTICE BILL\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a bill that we \nhave been addressing and that I think we have made some good progress \non, the juvenile justice bill. But I rise today to encourage, to plead \nwith both sides of the aisle, with all of my colleagues in the Senate, \nthat we remember what it is we are here to address, and that is the \nwell-being of our children; that we put down and put aside all of the \nother things to really focus on what it is we are here to do, and that \nis to address the well-being of our children in this country.\n  I think it is so important that we do not lose sight of the tragedies \nwe have seen that have presented to us the agony which has brought us \nto this floor and to this debate to try to do something to correct \nthose tragedies and, more importantly, to prevent any others from \nhappening in the future.\n  It is so easy to lose sight of the forest for the trees. If we \ncontinue that in this debate on juvenile justice, we will have done a \ntrue disservice to the children of this Nation.\n  I will speak today on an amendment which will be offered, which I am \njoining two of my colleagues in offering, Senator Harkin and Senator \nWellstone. We think it will help to reduce crime and violence in our \nNation's schools by preventing it before it ever happens, and that is \nexactly what can be the most important tool in this Nation in providing \nsafety for our children.\n  It addresses the issues of the children's emotional well-being and \nproviding schools with the necessary resources to help our children \ndeal with the complicated problems that today society brings them.\n  Students bring more to school today than just backpacks and lunch \nboxes; they bring severe emotional problems. Our children in today's \nworld come to school with problems far more severe than we can imagine, \nand certainly far more severe than we may have experienced ourselves. \nAnd 71 percent of the children ages 7 to 10 are worried whether they \nwill be stabbed or shot while in their school. This is inexcusable in a \ncountry like ours, that that many children are frightened to go to \nschool and they are frightened of what they will be up against.\n  The Department of Education reported that in 1997 there were \napproximately 11,000 incidents nationally of physical attacks or fights \nin which weapons were used. We can no longer continue to look for a \nsolution which is only a Band-Aid. We must look at the source of the \nproblem. Preventative medicine rather than a haphazard Band-Aid \napproach is something that is absolutely essential to the emotional \nwell-being of our children today and the future of our \ncountry. Theodore Roosevelt said: To educate a man in mind and not in \nmorals is to educate a menace to society.\n\n  It is so absolutely essential, in today's society where we are \nblessed with so much advanced technology, that we remind our children \nthat their emotional well-being, that the friendships and the \nfellowships that they must build with their fellow students is \nessential to the safety of mankind and the future of this country. \nIsn't it great that my children and other people's children, one day \nwhen they are older, will be able to communicate on the Internet to \nchildren in France and other countries across the world?\n  But let us not forget that we must encourage them also to walk out \nthe back door of the house and to talk over the back fence again with \ntheir neighbors and their neighbor's children so they know who their \nfriends and their neighbors are and so they are less likely to violate \nthem.\n  It is absolutely essential that we do not lose sight of what it is we \nare here to do on behalf of our children. Improvements, changes in \naccountability, are absolutely essential in our children's education. \nMetal detectors and surveillance cameras in schools won't get rid of \nthe root of the problem. They will help us in dealing with what we have \nto deal with right now, but the most important thing we can do is \nprovide our children with the kind of counseling and background to deal \nwith the severity of problems they are coming to school with at a \nyounger and younger age. We must minimize access to guns that can \naddress the means to act out, but it doesn't address the illnesses that \nwe begin with in our children's minds.\n  I have traveled across our State of Arkansas, and in absolutely every \nschool I have visited, every teacher and administrator has said the \nsame thing to me--we do not have adequate counselors and trained \nprofessionals to deal with the severity of problems our children are \ncoming to school with today in K through 3. We do not have the \nappropriate resources to give to our teachers and our administrators to \nhelp them recognize the problem in these children.\n  It is absolutely essential that we give them that resource in \ncounselors and professionally trained individuals. The National \nInstitutes of Health estimates although 7.5 million children under the \nage of 18 require mental health services, fewer than one in five \nreceives it.\n  All of us have our own personal stories to tell of a relationship or \nsomething we have heard through the education process. One of my older \nsisters was a teacher in the public schools. She had a classroom of 31 \nstudents, 6 and younger. She said that wasn't the biggest challenge in \nher classroom. The biggest challenge in her classroom was that those \nstudents came to school hungry and sick and, most importantly, \nfrightened.\n  We have a severe crisis on our hands in the fact that we now, in our \nState of Arkansas and in other States, have no young people going into \nthe teaching profession. Less than 25 percent of the teachers in the \nState of Arkansas are under the age of 40. We will hit a brick wall \nsoon, because no one is going into the teaching profession. My sister \nis a great example. One of the reasons she got out of teaching was she \nsaid she couldn't handle bus duty when she had it, because there were \nstudents that clung to her leg and said, please, don't make me go home. \nIt is essential that we deal with the emotional well-being of our \nchildren.\n\n  I rise today in support, with two other colleagues, of an amendment \nwe will offer to this juvenile justice bill when we get beyond the \nforest and we start to recognize what it is we are here to do; that is, \nthe details of dealing with the well-being of our children.\n  The details of the Harkin-Lincoln-Wellstone amendment are basically \nto put $100 million in authorizing funds for fiscal year 2000. The \nfirst $60 million must be spent for counseling services in elementary \nschools where the illness and the problem begins, before it grows into \nthe problems that we deal with in terms of guns and violence in later \ngrades. Only qualified mental health professionals may be hired with \nthis funding. The funds are eligible to urban, suburban and rural local \nschool districts, knowing that every school is suffering from these \nproblems. Some more than others, but all of them equally in need.\n  It is absolutely essential. The benefits of what we are proposing are \nto treat the emotional problems before they are out of control, to work \nhand in hand with an advisory board of parents, teachers, \nadministrators and community leaders to design and implement counseling \nservices, because we know that the most important part of any child's \nwell-being is their parental and family involvement. It is essential in \nwhat we are doing.\n  We know that when we involve the parents in the child's life, it is \nfar more\n\n[[Page S5366]]\n\nproductive. But involve the parents of the children who receive \nservices so that the parents can be more involved in the development \nand the well-being of their children, so it is not just one shot at \ntrying to fix the problem, but a continuing of trying to fix the \nproblem both through the counseling services to the children and \nassistance with the parents.\n  Teachers focus more on a student's skills at writing and arithmetic, \nrather than their potential for violence, because they do not have the \nsupport that they need, because their classroom sizes are too large, \nand they don't have the time to devote to it. I plead with my \ncolleagues that we must get back to the business at hand, and that \nbusiness is the well-being of the children of this country who are our \nfuture.\n  I urge Congress to act quickly, and I certainly want to devote the \ntime to this important issue that we have begun to do and I hope we \nwill continue. I just plead with my colleagues to remember that what we \nare dealing with in this legislation is our Nation's greatest \nresource--our children.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week in the Senate, we are \ndiscussing legislation that is meant to address the seemingly ever-\ngrowing problem of juvenile crime. Before we despair, let us recognize \nthat the overwhelming majority of young people in America are good kids \nand don't get into trouble with the law and are making a substantial \ncontribution to our society. In fact, in my State of Ohio, the \nadjudications of young people are down as well as incarceration of \nyoung offenders.\n  However, most Americans cannot turn on television, read a newspaper, \nor pick up a magazine without being told about the crisis facing our \nsociety because of young people who have turned violent. The fact that \nthis problem exists at all is a sad commentary on our modern society. \nHowever, it is a reality, and we have got to deal with it. The question \nis, How do we deal with it? As we in Congress try to answer that \nquestion we have to make sure that we take the time to deal with \njuvenile crime from the proper perspective.\n  We cannot expect there to be a silver bullet or a quick fix that will \nsolve our problems, although the recent tragedy in Littleton, CO, has \nintensified the urgency and our search for answers.\n  Naturally, part of the solution to juvenile crimes is traditional \ncrime prevention, penalties and sentences. However, these remedies, \nwhile important, only treat the symptoms of the disease and not the \ndisease itself. I believe our focus should not only be on the symptoms \nof juvenile crime, but on the root causes as well.\n  Two or three years ago, Princeton University Professor John DiIulio \nlamented over the upcoming ``predator generation'' because projected \ndemographics showed a marked increase in the amount of young people who \nwere going to become violent in our society. Professor DiIulio \ncommented that we would have a real problem around 2010 to 2015 As \nProfessor DiIulio stated, we have a generation, it seems, growing up in \nmoral poverty. And that is the poverty of being without loving, \ncapable, responsible adults who teach kids right from wrong.\n  Concerned about his pronouncement, I convened a juvenile crime summit \nin 1997 in Ohio and again in 1998, as Governor. We found that it wasn't \nlonger sentences or boot camps or harsher penalties that were required. \nWhat we found we needed to do was to get into the lives of our children \nat an early age, including while they are in their mother's womb, to \ngive them the positive influences they need.\n  Within the next two weeks, I will be introducing legislation along \nwith Senator Bob Graham from Florida that will help us address the \nneeds of our children in the most critical times of their lives--pre-\nnatal to three.\n  When I was Governor, I often said that if I had a magic wand to solve \nOhio's problems, I would reconstitute the family.\n  It's the dysfunction of the family and the lack of moral and \nreligious values that causes so many problems in our nation today.\n  Too often our children are groundless--they have no honor nor fear of \nthe Lord, nor any understanding of the 10 Commandments.\n  I believe the best place to catch problems and prevent them from ever \noccurring is when children are at their youngest, when parents and \nyoung children are forming life-long attachments and when parents and \nother care-givers have an opportunity to construct lasting values.\n  Government is a lousy substitute for the family. Unfortunately, there \nare circumstances where the government is the only alternative because \nthere is no family in place.\n  In these situations, we must look for the most effective way to give \nthem our assistance.\n  I truly believe there is something we can do to help in that respect.\n  Today, thanks to decades of research on brain chemistry and through \nthe utilization of sophisticated new technologies, neuro-scientists are \ntelling us that the experiences that fill a baby's first days, months, \nand years have a decisive impact on the development of the brain and on \nthe nature and extent of one's adult capacities.\n  As a result of the research, we know that throughout the entire \nprocess of development, beginning before birth, the brain is affected \nby environmental conditions such as nourishment, nurturing and sensory \nstimulation; early childhood care has a decisive and long-lasting \nimpact on how people develop their ability to learn, and their capacity \nto regulate their own emotions; there are times when negative \nexperiences--or the absence of appropriate stimulation--are more likely \nto have serious and sustained effects, the period of prenatal to three \nis such a time in a child's development; the human brain has a \nremarkable capacity to change, but timing is crucial and the first \nthree years of life appear to be the most influential period for growth \nand change.\n  To ensure that children prenatal to three have the best possible \nstart in life, we must establish specific support mechanisms to help \nparents and other adult care-givers. We have to become better partners.\n  These include health care, nutrition programs, childcare, early \nintervention services, adoption assistance, education programs, and \nother support services.\n  We must also reach out to parents--our children's first teachers and \ncaregivers--to help them understand that the day-to-day interaction \nwith children helps them to develop cognitively, socially and \nemotionally.\n  A mother comforting her crying baby, a father holding and reading to \nhis toddler and a care-giver singing and playing with an infant are not \njust involved in ``feel-good'' interactions.\n  They are involved in biological activities that exert a powerful, \nenduring impact on the young child's physical, intellectual, emotional \nand social development.\n  Mr. President, you know, with your large family, that these positive \nearly childhood experiences give children a jump-start or a life-long \nlearning opportunity.\n  It is imperative that our nationwide education agenda be geared \ntoward ensuring that children enter school ready to learn. Otherwise, \nwe put our children at a grave disadvantage of not being well-rounded \nand productive members of society.\n  In 1991, in my first State of the State Address, I drew a line in the \nsand in Ohio and said that this was going to be the last generation of \nchildren to go on welfare, go to jail, to get pregnant while they are \nteenagers.\n  We make a commitment to Head Start, to enroll as many eligible \nchildren as possible and increasing the funding for that program from \n$18.4 million in fiscal year 1990 to $181.3 million in fiscal year \n1998.\n  And, the fact of the matter is that today in Ohio, we have a slot for \nevery child who is eligible for Head Start, public school, pre-school \nor special needs. Ohio leads the nation--and does so primarily with \nstate tax dollars.\n  In addition, we established Early Start, which was designed to \nprovide early intervention services for children from pre-natal to \nthree who are at significant risk of abuse, neglect or future \ndevelopmental delay. It's just a fantastic program.\n\n[[Page S5367]]\n\n  I believe a Federal investment in our children at the most critical \njuncture of their lives--pre-natal to three--will do more to end the \ncycle of crime and violence in America than anything else the Senate \ncould do.\n  Studies looking at resiliency in adolescents are finding that a \nstable beginning contributes significantly to the youth's ability to \ntake control and turn their life around.\n  During consideration of this juvenile justice legislation, we have \nconsidered, and may still consider, controversial proposals associated \nwith this bill that elicit either solid support of deep opposition.\n  Yet, when it comes time to consider our legislation to provide \nenhanced prenatal-to-3 services, I am hopeful that proposal will \nreceive support from both sides of the aisle.\n  I will speak again on this issue when I introduce our legislation in \nthe next 2 weeks.\n  However, with the context of the floor debate, I could not pass up \nthis opportunity to express my views on how best we can get to the root \nof juvenile crime in this country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. During the debate over juvenile crime, we \nhave heard a lot about the negative activities that juveniles \nparticipate in--playing violent video games, viewing unseemly sites on \nthe Internet, and watching objectionable movies. But little has been \nsaid about the constructive things that kids can be--and are--doing \nwith their time. It seems, sometimes, that there are few alternatives \nto the pollution that modern culture often feeds to our children.\n  However, in my home state of Utah there are many programs that help \nchildren to focus their attention away from destructive activities. For \nexample, the Police Athletic League in Ogden, Utah provides sports \nlessons and intramural teams for 325 kids. Police officers serve as \nmentors to children and supply much needed attention through athletic \nactivities.\n  The Hispanic Cultural Youth Program in Utah holds dances and social \nevents that present a safe place for youth to socialize. And the LDS \nchurch has an extensive youth program that provides social events, \neducational activities, mentoring and community service activities.\n  I want my colleagues to be aware of an excellent program in Arizona \nthat gives juveniles positive alternatives to the destructive \nactivities that contribute to juvenile crime. ``Kid-Star'' Radio 590 \nAM, in Phoenix, allows children to produce, broadcast, and promote \ntheir own radio shows. Perry Damone, son of my good friend Vic Damone, \nhas founded this program that places radio stations in the public \nschools and allows the children to control the broadcast. The kids run \nthe entire program and have had phenomenal success with it. Over 3,000 \nstudents throughout Arizona have participated in the program. \nIndividual schools report an almost immediate improvement in over-all \nstudent responsibility, and better written and oral skills.\n  Under this program, the students have conducted numerous interviews \nwith prominent individuals including country singer Garth Brooks, \ncomedian Jay Leno and our esteemed colleague Senator John McCain. \nChildren have emerged from this program with a better self-esteem, \ngreater maturity, and life skills.\n  In S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability \nand Rehabilitation Act of 1999, the Federal Government is required to \ndisseminate data on prevention programs that are successful. This bill \nprovides over $1 billion a year to the States to fight juvenile crime \nand prevent juvenile delinquency. This money will help the Department \nof Justice isolate and encourage successful prevention programs. \nPrograms like the Police Athletic League, the Hispanic Cultural Youth \nProgram, and ``Kid-Star'' should receive our special attention and be \nencouraged to continue the good work that they do.\n  As we continue to search for solutions to juvenile crime, let's \nremember the best solutions come from individuals working on a local \nlevel to make a difference. We can learn much from these initiatives on \nbehalf of our children. I am extremely enthusiastic about the programs \nI have mentioned and hope the positive benefits of programs such as \nthis can be extended to the entire Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/14/senate-section/article/S5367-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5367-S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA DMV DEMONSTRATES IMPORTANCE OF THE NATIONAL MOTOR \n                    VEHICLE TITLE INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to thank the Virginia Department of \nMotor Vehicles (DMV) and the American Association of Motor Vehicle \nAdministrators for hosting a demonstration of the National Motor \nVehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) today in Arlington, Virginia.\n  Staff representing Senators from both sides of the aisle were shown \nhow the national titling information system will allow participating \nstates to track a motor vehicle from essentially birth to death. NMVTIS \nwill let DMVs and consumers know where a vehicle was previously titled \nand which, if any, brands have been associated with the vehicle. It \nwill also let law enforcement know if a vehicle being registered or \ntitled is stolen. Again, this is crucial disclosure information for \nstates, car buyers, and police forces across the country.\n  It is a system that is consistent with advances in technology. One \nthat allows states to share information over the wire. NMVTIS makes a \ngreat deal of sense as state governments move to paperless systems and \ngreater use of the Internet to share information with their citizenry.\n  Mr. President, Congress directed the establishment of NMVTIS as part \nof the Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992. In part, to curtail motor vehicle \ntheft, but also to allow states to share ``real time'' up-to-date \nvehicle information.\n  It is clear though, that the effectiveness of a national titling \ninformation system depends on maximum state participation. Congress \nknew this when it authorized incentive grants to encourage states to \nuse the system. A minimum of $300,000 is available to a state to offset \nits implementation costs.\n  Virginia, often a technology leader, embraced NMVTIS early and agreed \nto be the first state to pilot test the system. It will have the system \nonline at all DMVs this June. Indiana, Massachusetts, Florida, and \nArizona are also in the process of implementing NMVTIS. Kentucky and \nNew Hampshire are not far behind. Both states submitted formal grant \napplications to the Department of Justice which oversees NMVTIS. \nAdditionally, a number of states have also sent letters of interest and \nare hopeful to obtain startup funding this year. These include: \nAlabama, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, \nLouisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New \nMexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, \nand West Virginia.\n  It is expected that 21 states will be full partners in the national \ntitling system by 2000 and that all states will choose to participate \nin the system by 2003.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Virginia and the other participating \nstates for leading the way. NMVTIS is one significant tool that will be \nused to combat title fraud and vehicle theft. With NMVTIS, and \nappropriate and workable uniform salvage vehicle titling definitions \nand standards, consumers across the country will have the kind of \ndisclosure detail they need to make informed purchase decisions.\n  Somewhere down the road, consumers will be able to conduct vehicle \nqueries and get ``real time'' vehicle history information from their \nhome computers.\n  Mr. President, the 106th Congress does not need to put roadblocks in \nthe way. My colleagues must reject any proposal that would jeopardize \nfull nationwide implementation of this much needed system. Instead, \nthis Congress must do everything it can to maintain the vitality of \nNMVTIS. For America's motorists, for car purchasers, and for all 50 \nstates.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan\n\n[[Page S5368]]\n\nAAMVA news release and other background information on NMVTIS.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                 Motor Vehicle Administrators,\n\n                                      Arlington, VA, May 14, 1999.\n\n  Salvage Legislation Kills Title Washing Rids Road of Unsafe Vehicles\n\n       Arlington, VA.--Senate staffers tomorrow at 10:30 a.m., get \n     a first hand, real-time look at what could signal the end of \n     automobile title theft and help rid our highways of unsafe \n     vehicles.\n       At the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), 4150 \n     South Four Mile Run Drive, Arlington, Virginia, members of \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation will \n     peek at the technology serving as the backbone for Senator \n     Lott's S. 655.\n       This bill encourages the standardization of title laws \n     combating the fraudulent resale of damaged and stolen \n     vehicles. Under Lott's bill, federal incentives would be \n     provided to those states enacting uniform state title \n     branding laws. An opposing bill circulating through committee \n     doesn't provide the federal incentives and increases the \n     paper trail with salvaged vehicles.\n       ``We support S. 655 and the standardization of title laws \n     to combat fraud,'' said Kenneth M. Beam, president, American \n     Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA). \n     ``Ridding our highways of unsafe vehicles and eliminating \n     `title washing' is of eminent importance to highway safety.''\n       The Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 required the U.S. Department \n     of Transportation (DOT) to implement a National Motor Vehicle \n     Title Information System (NMVTIS pronounced min-veet-us). The \n     American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) \n     undertook the responsibility of assisting states in complying \n     with the new legislation. And in 1996, Congress mandated \n     responsibility of the system to the U.S. Department of \n     Justice (DOJ).\n       Currently five states are online with NMVTIS including; \n     Virginia, Indiana, Massachusetts, Florida and Arizona.

Approximately \n     $800,000 was appropriated to the National Highway \n     Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) to develop a \n     prototype system for a national clearinghouse of vehicle \n     title information. The idea is to have a central file which, \n     when polled, would tell a state where the vehicle is \n     currently titled and verify the validity before a new title \n     is issued. NHTSA allocated the funds to the American \n     Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) for \n     AAMVAnet, the AAMVA non-profit entity that manages the \n     network, to coordinate the project and to run a pilot of the \n     program. Virginia developed a system design for the pilot \n     program and was the first state to place all NMVTIS \n     transactions into production. The other states participating \n     in the pilot are Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, \n     Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.\n       AAMVA has contracted with the Polk Company to provide the \n     Central File Operator (CFO) services for Manufacturer's \n     Statement of Origin (MSO), VIN and State of Title (SOT) \n     information. They have also contracted with NICB-Facta to \n     provide similar services for the Brand and Theft files (to \n     advise the inquiring state of any reported thefts and any \n     brands on the vehicle). Also, Congress provided an additional \n     $1,000,000 for the project to the Department of Justice, \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and moved the project \n     responsibility from NHTSA to the FBI.\n       This online, real-time system currently includes vehicle \n     information from both pilot and non-pilot states. Non-\n     repairable and salvage vehicle information from junkyards, \n     salvage yards, and insurance carriers is also included. \n     Manufacturers also enter Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin \n     (MCO) information into the system.\n       The following types of data are exchanged between states, \n     private sector service providers (i.e. salvage yards), and \n     users:\n       Title\n       Registration\n       Brand\n       Theft\n       Detailed vehicle information\n       Vehicle information is also provided to:\n       Other states\n       Federal, state, and local law enforcement\n       Insurance carriers\n       Prospective purchasers\n       States use the system to determine:\n       Validity and status of a Manufacturers Certificate of \n     Origin (MCO)\n       Validity and status of a title document\n       Current State of Title (SOT)\n       Title and registration history\n       If a vehicle is non-repairable, salvage, or otherwise \n     branded\n       A vehicle's last recorded odometer reading\n       If a vehicle has been reported stolen\n       Detailed vehicle data from manufacturer and/or SOT\n       States update the system when:\n       A vehicle has been titled from an MCO or issued from an MCO \n     in error\n       A vehicle has been re-titled from another state or re-\n     titled from another state in error\n       Title data has changed\n       A title record has been deleted from a state's files\n       A vehicle has been registered or registered in error\n       A brand has been recorded on a title or has been recorded \n     in error\n       The system notifies the states when another state has:\n       Titled a vehicle or titled a vehicle in error\n       Registered a vehicle or registered a vehicle in error\n       Examples of vehicle information maintained on NMVTIS are:\n       VIN\n       Make\n       Year\n       Model\n       Body type\n       Color\n       GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight)\n       The following information is not included in NMVTIS:\n       An individual's Social Security Number (SSN) or address\n       Non-electronic updates of brand data from junk yards, \n     salvage yard, or insurance carriers\n       Pointers to the State of Registration (SOR)\n       Any guarantee that brand history is complete at the time of \n     inquiry (Junkyards, salvage yards, and insurance carriers \n     report monthly.)\n       The following vehicles (based on body type) are currently \n     excluded from NMVTIS:\n       All trailers\n       Mopeds\n       Motor bikes\n       Manufactured homes\n       Equipment\n       NMVTIS will benefit states by allowing for:\n       A framework to promote uniformity in titling procedures \n     among U.S. jurisdictions.\n       Titling jurisdictions to verify the vehicle and title \n     information, obtain information on all brands ever applied to \n     a vehicle, and obtain information on whether the vehicle has \n     been reported stolen, prior to issuing a title.\n       The VIN to be checked against a national pointer file, \n     which provides the last jurisdiction that issued a title on a \n     vehicle and requests detail of the vehicle from the \n     jurisdiction.\n       Law enforcement to create lists of vehicles, by junkyard, \n     salvage yard, or insurance carrier that are reported as junk \n     or salvage.

The design of the \n     system was selected by the U.S. jurisdictions as one that \n     posed the least burden on the states for creating, \n     maintaining, and operating a system for the exchange of \n     vehicle titling and brand data. The purpose of the pilot is \n     to confirm the feasibility and benefits of the system's \n     technical design and operational procedures. The pilot will \n     allow for a fine-tuning of the technical and procedural \n     issues prior to the national rollout of NMVTIS.\n       Pilot participants are Kentucky, Massachusetts, Indiana, \n     Virginia, Florida, and Arizona.\n     The Anti Car Theft Improvements Act\n       To implement the National Motor Vehicle Title Information \n     System (NMVTIS) nationwide (i.e., post-pilot), the states \n     need Congressional authorization of funds for grants. The \n     Anti Car Theft Improvements Act of 1996 was signed into law \n     on July 2, 1996. It amends the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 to:\n       authorize funding for states' development of NMVTIS,\n       remove the cap previously placed on state grant funding,\n       give the Department of Justice the responsibility for the \n     information system, and\n       move the date of implementation of NMVTIS to December 1997.\n     Data available\n       Data supported by this system and available to its users \n     include:\n       registration and title data,\n       brand history data,\n       detailed vehicle data.\n     Benefits of the system\n       NMVTIS will allow for:\n       Titling jurisdictions to verify the vehicle and title \n     information, obtain information on all brands ever applied to \n     a vehicle, and obtain information on whether the vehicle has \n     been reported stolen. This information can be received prior \n     to issuing a title, which allows the title jurisdiction to \n     verify the data before creating the title.\n       The VIN is checked against a national pointer file, which \n     provides the last jurisdiction that issued a title on a \n     vehicle and requests details of the vehicle from that \n     jurisdiction. The details include the latest odometer reading \n     for the vehicle. This verification of title, brand, theft, \n     and odometer data will allow for a reduction in the issuance \n     of fraudulent titles and a reduction in odometer fraud. Once \n     the inquiring jurisdiction receives the information, it can \n     decide whether to issue a title; if so, NMVTIS notifies the \n     last titling jurisdiction that another jurisdiction has \n     issued a title. The old jurisdiction can then inactivate its \n     title record. This will allow jurisdictions to identify and \n     purge inactive titles on a regular basis.\n       Law enforcement to create lists of vehicles, by junk yard, \n     salvage yard, or insurance carrier, that are reported as junk \n     or salvage. The Act requires junk yards, salvage yards, and \n     insurance carriers to report monthly to NMVTIS on all junk \n     and salvage vehicles obtained. Law enforcement's inquiries \n     will allow it to use NMVTIS to further its investigations of \n     vehicle theft and fraud.\n       Manufacturers to dramatically reduce the use of paper \n     Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin. NMVTIS will incorporate \n     the functionality of the AAMVAnet Paperless MCO application, \n     which allows jurisdictions to inquire on an electronic MCO \n     file for data necessary to create the vehicle's first title. \n     The manufacturers reduce their use of the paper MCO, and the \n     jurisdictions build their initial title records from the \n     electronic data created by the manufacturers, which will \n     significantly reduce data entry errors.\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, last night, the Senator from Alaska and I \nintroduced the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Covenant \nImplementation Act, legislation to end immigration abuses in a U.S. \nterritory know as the CNMI. This is a bipartisan reform bill, and the \nchanges we propose were supported by the Clinton Administration during \nthe 105th Congress.\n  I commend my colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, for his \nleadership on CNMI reform. He traveled more than 10,000 miles to get a \nfirst-hand understanding of this issue. Our bill responds to the \nprofound problems that we witnessed while visiting the CNMI.\n  The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a group of \nislands located in the far western Pacific. Following World War II, the \nUnited States administered the islands under a U.N. Trusteeship.\n  In 1975, the people of the CNMI voted for political union with the \nUnited States. Today, the CNMI is a U.S. territory.\n  A 1976 covenant enacted by Congress gave U.S. citizenship to CNMI \nresidents. The covenant also exempted the Commonwealth from U.S. \nimmigration law. This exemption led to the immigration abuses that our \nbill will correct.\n  I don't represent the CNMI, but the Commonwealth is in Hawaii's \nbackyard. I speak as a friend and neighbor when I say that conditions \nin the CNMI must change. The CNMI system of indentured immigrant labor \nis morally wrong, and violates basic democratic principles.\n  The CNMI shares the American flag, but it does not share our \nimmigration system. When the Commonwealth became a territory of the \nUnited States, we allowed them to write their own immigration laws. \nAfter twenty years of experience, we know that the CNMI immigration \nexperiment has failed.\n  Conditions in the CNMI prompt the question whether the United States \nshould operate a unified system of immigration, or whether a U.S. \nterritory should be allowed to establish laws in conflict with national \nimmigration policy.\n  Common sense tells us that a unified system is the only answer. If \nPuerto Rico, or Hawaii, or Arizona, or Oklahoma could write their own \nimmigration laws--and give work visas to foreigners--our national \nimmigration system would be in chaos.\n  America is one country. We need a uniform immigration system, rather \nthan one system for the 50 states and another system for one of our \nterritories.\n  There is a mountain of evidence proving just how bad the CNMI \nsituation has become. Let me cite a few examples:\n  Twenty years ago, the CNMI had a population of 15,000 citizens and \n2,000 alien workers. Today, the citizen population has increased to \n28,000. Yet the alien worker population has mushroomed to 42,000--a \n2000 percent increase. Three to four thousand of these alien workers \nare illegal aliens.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service reports that the CNMI has \nno reliable records of aliens who have entered the Commonwealth, how \nlong they remain, and when, if ever, they depart. A CNMI official \ntestified that they have ``no effective control'' over immigration in \ntheir island.\n  The bipartisan Commission on Immigration studied immigration and \nindentured labor in the CNMI. The Commission called it ``antithetical \nto American values,'' and announced that no democratic society has an \nimmigration policy like the CNMI. ``The closest equivalent is Kuwait,'' \nthe Commission found.\n  The Department of Commerce found that the territory has become ``a \nChinese province'' for garment production. The CNMI garment industry \nemploys 15,000 Chinese workers, some of whom sign contracts that forbid \nparticipation in religious or political activities while on U.S. soil. \nChina is exporting their workers, and their human rights policies, to \nthe CNMI.\n  The CNMI is becoming an international embarrassment to the United \nStates. We have received complaints from the Philippines, Nepal, Sri \nLanka, and Bangladesh about immigration abuses and the treatment of \nworkers.\n\n[[Page S5370]]\n\n  Despite efforts by the Reagan, Bush and Clinton Administrations to \npersuade the CNMI to correct these problems, the situation has only \ndeteriorated.\n  My colleagues, the Senator from Alaska and I have been patient. After \nyears of waiting, the time for patience has ended. Conditions in the \nCNMI are a looming political embarrassment to our country. I urge the \nSenate to respond by enacting the reform legislation we have \nintroduced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/14/senate-section/article/S5370-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AGRICULTURAL BOND ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday, Senator Conrad, and \nRepresentatives Nussle and Boswell helped me stand up for American \nagriculture.\n  Agriculture is capital intensive. As a family farmer myself, I know \nyou can't put your love of the land to work if you don't have the \nresources to get started.\n  My colleagues and I introduced a bipartisan bicameral bill that will \nexpand opportunities for beginning farmers who are in need of low \ninterest loans for capital purchases of farmland and equipment. This \nlegislation is called the ``Agricultural Bond Enhancement Act.''\n  Back in the early 1980s, I realize the federal government needed to \ndo more to provide young farmers an opportunity to start farming. In \n1981, I pushed for pilot projects to establish the Aggie Bond program. \nAfter temporarily reauthorizing the program many times I succeeded in \nmaking the Beginning Farmer Loan Program permanent in the 103rd \nCongress.\n  Current law permits state authorities to issue tax exempt bonds and \nto loan the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to beginning farmers \nand ranchers to finance the cost of acquiring land, buildings and \nequipment used in a farm or ranch operation. The tax-exempt nature of \nthe Aggie Bonds provides a below-market interest rate on the loan made \nto the farmer or rancher.\n  The program has been very successful, especially in my home state of \nIowa. Since the beginning of the program in 1981, more than 2,600 \nIowans have taken advantage of this opportunity. Iowa's program has \nprovided over $260 million in qualified beginning loans and the default \nrate has only been 1.5% of the total number of loans. I believe most ag \nlenders would agree those are very good numbers.\n  We have an opportunity to make the Beginning Farmer Loan Program even \nbetter. Currently, Aggie Bonds are subjected to a volume cap. That puts \nthem in competition with industrial projects for bond allocation. This \nis the problem we would like to remedy.\n  Aggie Bonds share few similarities to Industrial Revenue Bonds and \nshould not be subjected to the same volume cap. Insufficient funding \ndue to the volume cap limits the effectiveness of this program.\n  The solution: amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt small \nissue bonds for agriculture from the State volume cap.\n  During the past three years the Iowa Agricultural Development \nAuthority has consistently used all of the $24 million bond allocation \nit was allowed. Some beginning farmers had to sit idle until the next \nyear to close their loan, or pay a higher interest rate if they closed \ntheir loan without the bond.\n  We cannot afford to stand by and allow the next generation of family \nfarmers to lose out on an opportunity to start farming. The average age \nof America's family farmers continues to climb.\n  Deserving young farmers should not be forced to compete against \nindustry for reduced interest loans.\n  The ``Agricultural Bond Enhancement Act'' will open the door to more \nyoung farmers and help cultivate the next crop of family farmers in the \n21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/14/senate-section/article/S5370-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      KOSOVO REFUGEE REGISTRATION\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we are all horrified by the human suffering \nthat we are seeing every day as ethnic Albanians are being forced to \nflee Kosovo. The scope of this tragedy is overwhelming. Many of the \nrefugees have not only lost their homes and other material \npossessions--they have been separated from their families and stripped \nof their identities, as documents were stolen and destroyed. While NATO \nand the United Nations are trying to manage the refugee crisis, there \nhave been glaring shortcomings in their capacity to help refugees to be \nreunited with loved ones.\n  I am pleased the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n(UNHCR) is looking to the private sector for assistance, and that the \nprivate sector is generously contributing equipment, funds, and \nexpertise to help ease this horrible situation. UNHCR currently does \nnot have the technological capability to furnish a registration system \nwhich could log and issue identification papers to over 400,000 \ndisplaced Kosovars who have taken refuge in Albania. So Microsoft, \nHewlett-Packard, Compaq, Securit World Ltd, and ScreenCheck B.V., have \noffered to provide a registration system that will facilitate the \ndistribution of relief supplies and assist in the reunification of \nfamily members. Clearly, this effort will make a substantial difference \nin helping the refugees in Albania to rebuild their lives. While we \nautomatically rely on government agencies to respond to such a crisis, \nit is encouraging to see companies step up to the plate and volunteer \nassistance they can provide faster and more efficiently than the public \nsector. This kind of private sector involvement should serve as an \nexample for other companies to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/14/senate-section/article/S5370-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5370-S5371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, yesterday, Israel marked 32 years since \nJerusalem was united under Israeli control in the 1967 Mideast war. I \nrise today to strongly urge the President of the United States not to \nemploy the waiver provision in the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, but \nrather to fulfill the intent of that law by moving our embassy in \nIsrael from Tel Aviv to Israel's capital city, Jerusalem.\n  The United States has diplomatic relations with 184 countries around \nthe world. With only one of those countries--Israel--do we neither \nrecognize the country's designated capital nor have our embassy located \nin the designated capital. That is as incredible as it is unacceptable. \nIt is not only that Israel is one of our closet and most important \nallies. Nor is it only the obvious principle that every country has the \nright to designate its own capital. It is also that there is no other \ncapital city anywhere whose history is more intimately associated than \nis Jerusalem's with the nation of Israel.\n  Jerusalem is the only city on earth that is the capital of the same \ncountry, inhabited by the same people who speak the same language and \nworship the same God as they did 3,000 years ago. No other city on \nearth can make that claim. Three thousand years ago, David, King of \nIsrael, made Jerusalem his capital city and brought the Ark of the \nCovenant into its gates. Ever since, Jerusalem has been the cultural, \nspiritual, and religious center of the Jewish people. Twenty-five \nhundred years ago an anonymous Jewish psalmist living in forced exile \nwrote the following words: ``By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat \ndown and wept when we remembered Zion . . . If I forget the O \nJerusalem, may my right hand lose its cunning; may my tongue cleave to \nthe roof of my mouth if I do not remember thee, If I do not set \nJerusalem above my chief joy.''\n  Jerusalem has been a capital city of an independent country only \nthree times in its history, and all three were under Jewish \nsovereignty: under the four hundred year rule of the House of Davids, \nunder the restored Jewish commonwealth following the period of \nBabylonian exile (586-536 BC), and now under the reborn State of \nIsrael. Jerusalem has been the capital of no other independent state, \nnor of any other people. It has had a continuous Jewish presence for \nthree thousand years, and for the last hundred and fifty years, Jews \nhave been the largest single part of its population.\n  In 1947, The United Nations General Assembly passed the Partition \nResolution for Palestine to partition what is today Israel, the West \nBank, and Gaza into what was supposed to become a Jewish state and a \nPalestinian Arab state. In the resolution, Jerusalem was to have been \nan international city under UN auspices. The Jewish community of \nPalestine accepted the partition\n\n[[Page S5371]]\n\nproposal but the Arab community, along with the rest of the Arab world, \nrefused. Instead, Arab armies invaded the nascent Jewish state intent \non destroying it--a de facto rendering the Partition Resolution null \nand void.\n  Nevertheless, the United States established its embassy in Tel Aviv, \nwhere it sits to this day. But Jerusalem is Israel's capital: it is the \nseat of its government, its parliament, its supreme court. The \nPresident and Prime Minister reside there. Our ambassador travels daily \nfrom Tel Aviv to meetings with Israeli government officials in \nJerusalem. All major political parties in Israel agree, moreover, that \nJerusalem will remain Israel's undivided capital.\n  The United States Congress also agrees. Congress overwhelmingly \npassed legislation in 1995 that contained an official statement of US \npolicy on Jerusalem: that it should remain united and be recognized as \nIsrael's capital, and that our embassy should be located there by the \nend of May, 1999. If the embassy were not located in Jerusalem by that \ndate, 50 percent of the State Department's budget for buildings and \nmaintenance abroad would be withheld unless the President issued a \nnational security waiver. That is the waiver which the President now \nconsiders issuing. I strongly believe that he should not do so, that \ninstead he should do what is right by recognizing that Jerusalem is \nIsrael's capital.\n  There are those who timidly argue that to do what is right will \ndamage the peace process. How can that be possible? Is it not more \nharmful to fuel unrealizable expectations by pretending that Jerusalem \nis not Israel's capital or that it might someday be redivided? Would it \nnot be better simply to finally do what we should have done fifty years \nago by recognizing the only city that could ever be. Israel's capital, \nthe one city that has always been Israel's capital, the eternal city of \nJerusalem?\n  President Clinton stated when he was running for office on June 30, \n1992 the following: ``Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, . . . \nJerusalem is still the capital of Israel, and must remain an undivided \ncity accessible to all.'' He was right then, and he has the chance to \ndo right now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/14/senate-section/article/S5371-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. BOND:\n       S. 1053.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to incorporate certain \nprovisions of the transportation conformity regulations, as in effect \non March 1, 1999; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                        clean air act amendments\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on March 2, 1999, the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia issued its decision in the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund versus Environmental Protection Agency \nlawsuit whereby the EDF filed suit challenging several provisions of \nthe EPA's air quality conformity rule. The court ruled in favor of the \nEDF.\n  This decision overturned a well-established EPA rule permitting \npreviously approved transportation projects being ``grandfathered'' \ninto transportation air quality conformity plans. The court decision \neliminates any flexibility for local authorities to proceed with \nprojects and protect them from disruptions caused by issues often \nbeyond their control--including changes in federal regulations and \nstandards. In addition, the court decision impacted use of submitted \nbudgets, non-federal project flexibility, grace periods before SIP \ndisapprovals, and SIP safety margins.\n  As of April 19, the Federal Highway Administration had identified ten \nareas in conformity lapse where transportation projects are impacted. \nThe areas are: Ashland, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Raleigh, North \nCarolina; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; Monterey, \nCalifornia; Santa Barbara, California; Knoxville, Tennessee; Paducah, \nKentucky; and South Bend, Indiana.\n  Many people probably thought that would be the end of the list. To \ngive another example of why this is such an important issue--one week \nago today the United States Department of Transportation determined \nthat the Kansas City metropolitan area's conformity plan had lapsed. \nThe Kansas and Missouri Divisions of the Federal Highway Administration \nhalted approval of transportation projects in the region. More and more \nareas could be faced with this situation.\n  If we do not address this issue, it could potentially bring to a halt \ntransportation improvement projects around the country--further \njeopardizing the safety of the traveling public, hindering economic \ngrowth, and in my opinion, doing nothing to improve the air quality \nsituation in any of these areas.\n  Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk.\n  Mr. President, the only thing this legislation does is amend the \nClean Air Act to reinstate those EPA rules which were struck down or \nremanded in the Environmental Defense Fund vs. Environmental Protection \nAgency lawsuit. No more. No less. This legislation has zero impact on \nthe Clean Air Act of EPA's rules.\n  In 1997, in the EPA's information on the final conformity rule that \nincorporated the 1997 changes, EPA reported the following:\n\n       The conformity rule changes promulgated today result from \n     the experience that EPA, the Department of Transportation, \n     and state and local air and transportation officials have had \n     with implementation of the rule since it was first published \n     in November of 1993. While these changes clarify the rule and \n     in some cases offer increased flexibility, they will not \n     result in any negative change in health and environmental \n     benefits.\n\n  So the EPA got together with the stakeholders, issued a rulemaking, \nprovided the public comment period, issued a final rule, practiced for \nseveral years, and defended the position in court. I want to take this \nposition and codify it.\n  Mr. President--there will be some who will argue for more or less \nrestrictive changes to the underlying conformity provision in the Clean \nAir Act. Should that discussion and debate occur? Yes. I might support \nsome of those changes. However, we have an immediate situation where \ntransportation projects around the country are or could be impacted by \nthe court's ruling. States and metropolitan areas across the country \nare needing assistance with this issue. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor and support this common sense legislation that simply takes \nEPA's own regulations on conformity that the court overturned and puts \nthem into law.\n  Mr. President, we must address the immediate situation and then \ncontinue the debate on conformity to address further needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 1054.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Savings for Scholars Act, to help families\n\n[[Page S5372]]\n\nsave for college expenses.

I want to thank Senator Roth and \nhis staff on the Finance Committee for working with me and my staff in \ndrafting this legislation. In the 3 years that he has chaired the \nFinance Committee, Senator Roth has been a true champion for all of us \nwho place a tremendous value on educating our nation's children and \nyoung adults.\n  When Congress created the education IRA 2 years ago, we took an \nimportant first step in the direction of encouraging families to save \nfor their children's education. But, the law contains a very \nsignificant limitation--families cannot contribute more than $500 a \nyear to these accounts. This restriction makes it difficult for a \nfamily to accumulate savings sufficient to pay the cost of a college \ndegree. Even if parents start saving from the time their child is born, \nan investment in an education IRA of $500 a year, assuming an average \nannual return of 8 percent, will only yield about $19,000 when that \nchild begins higher education. Today, the average cost of 4 years of \nhigher education is about $30,000 at a public institution and about \n$75,000 at a private school. In short, the current limits are not \nnearly high enough to finance even today's college costs, much less the \ncost 18 years from now.\n\n  Raising the maximum contribution to $2,000 will allow a family to \naccumulate at least as much as the current average cost of attending a \nprivate school. This is money that many middle-class families and their \nchildren otherwise would need to borrow; it is tens of thousands of \ndollars in student loans that would burden graduates with a mountain of \ndebt. Most important, raising the education IRA contribution limit \nwould make a 4-year college education more accessible and less of a \nfinancial challenge for middle-income families.\n  In addition to increasing the education IRA contribution limit, this \nbill would make a technical change to remove a confusing inconsistently \nbetween the education IRA and the traditional IRA. The last date on \nwhich a contribution to an education IRA can be made is December 31 of \nany year. Traditional IRAs may receive contributions until April 15 of \nthe year following the tax year. This bill changes the deadline for \ncontributions to education IRAs to coincide with that of the \ntraditional IRA. This modest change would eliminate a source of \nconfusion that might cause a family planning to contribute to a child's \nIRA to inadvertently miss the deadline.\n  The second part of my bill deals with qualified State tuition plans. \nThese are tax-deferred plans, administered by the individual states, \nthat allow families to prepay college tuition or to accumulate tax-\ndeferred savings for postsecondary education expenses. My bill makes \ntwo changes in the requirements of these plans that should make them \nmore flexible and useful to families. The first is to require that all \nqualified State tuition plans allow at least three rollovers without \nany change in beneficiary. This change would guarantee that \nparticipants in one state's plan can transfer their assets to another \nstate's plan. The need for this could be the result of a family moving \nfrom one state to another or of a change in a child's education plans. \nMy bill will give greater flexibility in the choice of postsecondary \neducation institutions to the beneficiaries of these plans.\n  The bill also proposes one additional change to the qualified tuition \nprograms--a change that will make the plans more attractive to \nfamilies. Under current law, the assets of a plan can be rolled over to \nspecified members of a beneficiary's family. This allows the plan's \nassets to be used by a sibling if the original beneficiary cannot or \ndoes not use the plan. However, the definition of a family member does \nnot include first cousins. Thus, a parent of a single child could not \ntransfer the benefits to a niece or nephew if his or her child did not \nuse the plan. Perhaps more significantly, this change would make the \nqualified state tuition plan more desirable for grandparents. They \ncould be assured that a plan established for the benefit of one \ngrandchild could be transferred to any of their grandchildren.\n  The final part of this bill corrects an unfair consequence of the \ninteraction between the HOPE tax credits and the education IRA. \nCurrently, a taxpayer is prohibited from claiming the HOPE tax credit \nin any year in which a withdrawal from an education IRA is made--\nregardless of the total amount the taxpayer spends on education. This \nbill allows the HOPE tax credit to be claimed to the extent that the \ncost of education exceeds the amount withdrawn from the IRA. It does \nnot allow a double benefit, but it does prevent one benefit--the IRA \nwithdrawal--from canceling another benefit. It also eliminates a \npotential trap for the unwary taxpayer who may accidentally claim both \nbenefits and, as a result, incur a penalty.\n  Mr. President, investing in education is the surest way for us to \nbuild our country's assets for the future. We need to ensure that \npostsecondary education is affordable and that graduates do not \naccumulate crippling debts while attending school. Adopting this bill \nwill help us to accomplish both of these goals. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport these efforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1055. A bill to amend title 36, United States Code, to designate \nthe day before Thanksgiving as ``National Day of Reconciliation''; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               National Day of Reconciliation Legislation\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I, along with Senator Akaka, \nintroduce the National Day of Reconciliation Bill. In this bill, the \nPresident will issue a yearly proclamation designating the day before \nThanksgiving as a ``National Day of Reconciliation.'' On this day, it \nis our hope that every person in the U.S. should seek out those \nindividuals who have been alienated and pursue forgiveness and \nreconciliation from them. Historically, Thanksgiving is a time when we \nput all of our differences aside and give thanks for all that we have \nachieved and shared. I cannot think of a better day in which to \nreconcile than the day before Thanksgiving.\n  When considering the need for this piece of legislation, I was \nreminded of times when our nation was at war with itself, and the very \nfabric of our Constitution was held together by a few threads. The \nCivil War placed our democracy and national sovereignty in great \njeopardy. However, Abraham Lincoln, one of our nation's greatest \nleaders, knew the importance of ``binding'' our nation together after \ncivil war had ravaged our nation. It was through his wisdom and ability \nto forgive that he helped heal our nation's wounds. Once again, there \nis the absence of peace in America.\n  We live in a society where there is too much alienation, from one \nanother and from God. We, in too many cases, have allowed our focus to \nshift from one another to ourselves. Lincoln recognized the need to \nreconcile with one another. He also knew that reconciliation efforts \nwould never be successful without looking first to the divine \nauthority.\n  In his second Inaugural speech, Lincoln said, ``with malice toward \nnone, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us \nto see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to \nbind up the nation's wounds * * * to do all which may achieve and \ncherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all \nnations.''\n  The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was yet another one of our \nnation's great leaders who knew the importance of focusing on a higher \nmoral power to achieve peaceful reconciliation. Dr. King, through \nwisdom and sacrificial love, reconciled an entire nation with \nindividuals who, through discrimination, were alienated from sections \nof our society. Dr. King said, ``It is time for all people of \nconscience to call upon America to return to her true home of \nbrotherhood and peaceful pursuits. * * * We must work unceasingly to \nlift this nation that we love to a higher destiny, to a new plateau of \ncompassion, to a more noble expression of humaneness.'' Mr. President, \nwe need to restore peace in our nation, we need to restore charity for \none another, and we need to return our focus to a higher moral \nauthority.\n  As we look at our culture today, we see images that influence not \nonly our\n\n[[Page S5373]]\n\nactions but the actions of young people as well. Our culture glorifies \nconflict, greed, and violence. It is no wonder that we see atrocities \nthat seem impossible to imagine. It is time for our country to \nreconcile, and the ``National Day of Reconciliation'' will remind us of \nthis solemn obligation.\n  If Americans hope to ``bind up [our] nation's wounds,'' as Lincoln \nsuggested, we must first make the commitment in the Congress. This bill \nmakes that commitment by calling for a ``National Day of \nRecognition''--a day that recognizes the need to move from alienation \nto reconciliation. In a ``Letter From A Birmingham Jail,'' Dr. King \nexpressed his hope for national reconciliation. I too hope ``that the \ndark clouds of [misconceptions] will soon pass away and the deep fog of \nmisunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched communities and \nin some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and \nbrotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their \nscintillating beauty.'' I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nmuch needed measure and begin to foster reconciliation throughout our \ncountry in order for us to once again be ``one nation under God.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE:\n  S. 1056. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \ntax equity for the Highway Trust Fund and to reduce the number of \nseparate taxes deposited into the Highway Trust fund, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           highway tax equity and simplification act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am introducing today, the Highway Tax \nEquity and Simplification Act of 1999. This bill improves the equity \namong taxpayers paying into the Highway Trust Fund. Under current law, \nsome users pay too much into the trust fund relative to the costs they \nimpose on the nation's highway system, while other pay too little. This \nproposal more fairly apportions the tax burden to those who impose the \ngreatest costs to our highway infrastructure.\n  In my statement today, I plan to briefly describe:\n  (1) Who pays too much and too little?\n  (2) Why the current tax structure fails?\n  (3) Why the current tax structure can't be just tinkered with and \ntherefore needs radical change?\n  (4) A description of the plan I am introducing today.\n  Who pays too much and who pays too little?\n  If we look at the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) latest \ncost allocation study of the highway system, it is clear that the \ncurrent system does not fairly apportion the relative burden of taxes \npaid compared to costs imposed. At this time, I will submit for the \nRecord a table which summarizes the relative burden among users based \non analysis provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n  As this table shows, some users are paying 150 percent of their share \nwhile some of the heaviest trucks are paying as low as 40 percent of \ntheir share. This is simply unfair and needs to be changed.\n  Another way to look at the unfairness of the current situation is to \nlook at the per vehicle subsidies for heavy trucks that the U.S. DOT \nprovided in their latest report to the Congress. In determining these \nsubsidies, DOT simply subtracted what these vehicles should have paid \nin taxes, based on the costs they impose, from the amount of taxes they \ndo pay. These subsidies are thousands of dollars per vehicle annually, \nwith several above $5,000 per vehicle. At the end of my statement, I \nwould like to enter into the Record a table showing a few examples of \nthe subsidies summarized in the DOT report.\n\n  One of the reasons that the current tax structure fails so miserably \nat properly allocated costs is because neither the Congress nor the \nU.S. DOT has looked seriously at this issue for a very long time. The \nlast significant cost allocation study was completed in 1982, more than \n17 years ago. Without up-to-date analysis, it has been virtually \nimpossible for the Congress to address this significant problem. I want \nto commend Secretary Slater for taking the initiative to have his \nDepartment provide an up-to-date analysis to the Congress. It is my \nunderstanding that DOT plans on keeping its analytical capability \ncurrent regarding cost allocation so that the Congress doesn't have to \nwait every 17 years to address this issue.\n  Lack of good information is one of the reasons we have this unfair \nsituation. The other reason deals more directly with basic engineering \nconcepts. Highway pavement wear and tear imposed by a vehicle is \nrelated to two primary factors: how much you drive on the road and the \nweight of the vehicle.\n  Now, why is the weight of a vehicle so important?\n  It is important because pavement damage increases dramatically \n(actually exponentially) with weight. At this time, I will submit for \nthe record information which shows the relationship between weight and \npavement damage.\n  This chart shows that on a rural Interstate Highway, a single 100,000 \npound standard tractor-trailer wears the equivalent of more than 1,700 \nautomobiles. But, that truck certainly does not pay 1,700 times the \namount of taxes.\n  On a rural arterial road, not built to Interstate standards, this \ndynamic is even worse, wearing the equivalent of 3,500 cars.\n  The problem with the current tax system is that it does not attempt \nto recover from trucks the dramatic pavement damage costs that are \nincurred as the weight of these vehicles increases. Until we address \nthis fundamental principle, we will not have an equitable tax system.\n  Now, let's briefly look at each of the current taxes and how well \nthey contribute to tax equity.\n  Excise Tax--Under current law, we impose a 12 percent excise tax on \nthe purchase of new trucks. This tax raises more than $2 billion \nannually. However, it has no relationship to either road usage or \npavement damage and therefore does not contribute to tax equity.\n  Tire Tax--the exist tax imposed on tires is moderately helpful for \nimproving tax equity because it varies by miles driven and, to some \nextend by weight. However, it raises a relatively small amount of money \n(about $400 million per year or less than 5 percent of truck taxes) and \ntherefore has a small effect on cost allocation.\n  Diesel Tax--currently, diesel fuel is taxed at 24 cents per gallon. \nAlthough diesel taxes paid do vary by mileage, diesel taxes do a poor \njob of recovering pavement damage related to the weight of the vehicle. \nWhen the weight of a truck is increased, fuel use increases only \nmarginally. However, the pavement damage imposed by that same vehicle \ngoes up exponentially. Increasing diesel tax rates does not resolve \nthis fundamental problem and actually exacerbates the unfairness of the \ncurrent system. I would submit for the Record information which \nillustrates the problem.\n\n  Heavy Vehicle Use Tax--this tax sounds like it might be the right \nplace to address concerns related to weight, but it also falls well \nshort of the mark. Even the name is deceiving. First, this tax does not \nvary by use. A truck that travels 10,000 miles annually and another \nthat travels 100,000 miles pay the same tax. Secondly, although the \nname implies it applies to Heavy Vehicles, this tax is capped at 75,000 \npounds, the point at which pavement damage goes up dramatically. I will \nalso submit information which compares pavement damage and the Heavy \nVehicle Use tax.\n  In summary, our review of the current taxes led me to conclude that \nthey do a poor job of aligning taxes paid with road damage. In other \nwords, they just can't get the job done. We need a new mechanism.\n  The bill I introduce today eliminates 3 of the separate taxes and \nreplaces them with a straightforward tax that more fairly distributes \nthe tax burden among highway users.\n  Specifically, the bill eliminates the tire tax, the 12 percent excise \ntax on new trucks, and the Heavy Vehicle Use Tax. It also eliminates \nthe so-called ``diesel differential,'' the additional 6 cents per \ngallon imposed on diesel fuel compared to gasoline, which is taxed at \n18.33 cents per gallon.\n  To replace the lost revenue from these repeals and tax reductions, \nand to improve the equity of the truck taxes paid, the bill establishes \na new user fee, an axle-weight distance tax. This new tax varies based \non the truck's axle-weight loads and the distance traveled, the exact \nsame concepts that affect pavement damage.\n\n[[Page S5374]]\n\n  The bill collects the same amount of tax revenue from trucks overall \nas current law, about $11 billion annually.\n  Overall, there are more winners than losers under this bill. The vast \nmajority of trucks--more than 5.9 million--will see a tax reduction. \nThis compares to roughly 1.5 million who will see an increase.\n  The bill also reduces double taxation on toll roads by allowing a \ncredit against the axle-weight distance tax for travel on a toll \nfacility such as the Oklahoma or Florida Turnpikes.\n  This new axle-weight tax has long been recognized in the \ntransportation community as the best way to tax trucks. As an example, \nthe American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials, the \nassociation representing State Transportation Departments, policy \nresolution on this matter finds:\n\n       . . . truck taxes based upon a combination of the weight of \n     vehicles and the distance they travel more equitably \n     distribute financing responsibility proportional to costs \n     imposed on the system than other tax alternatives.\n\n  In fact, AASHTO policy calls for substituting a weight-distance tax \nfor the heavy vehicle use tax and all other federal user fees on trucks \nexcept for a federal fuel tax--a perfect description of the proposal we \nare introducing today.\n  Now, I would like to briefly touch upon a few areas where I expect \nopponents of this effort may focus.\n  Some may argue that this is an anti-truck proposal and will impose \nnew costs on consumers. My response to this assertion is that overall \ntruck taxes are held constant and most of the trucking industry \nbenefits from this proposal. Unfortunately, this benefit is at the \nexpense of the portion of the industry that is doing damage to our \nnation's roadways without paying for it, and they will probably fight \nhard to keep their undeserved subsidies. The trick for the rest of the \nindustry and for all roadway users is to recognize that virtually all \nof these arguments are attempts to distract us from the real issue--\nshould heavy trucks pay their fair share?\n  Heavy truck operators will try to argue about all sorts of ancillary \nitems to distracts us from this fundamental issue. They will argue \nabout tax evasion, administrative burden, additional record keeping and \nthe like. Anything but the core issue of whether these trucks should \npay their fair share.\n\n  As the Congress considers, this issue, I hope we can remain focused \non this fundamental question and not be distracted by arguments that \nare not intended to squash efforts to address the unfair system we have \ntoday.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a \nsummary of the legislation, and the materials previously cited be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1056\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Highway Tax Equity and \n     Simplification Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress should enact legislation to correct the \n     distribution of the tax burden among the various classes of \n     persons using the Federal-aid highways, or otherwise deriving \n     benefits from such highways;\n       (2) the most recent highway cost allocation study by the \n     Department of Transportation found that owners of heavy \n     trucks significantly underpay Federal highway user fees \n     relative to the costs such vehicles impose on such highways, \n     while owners of lighter trucks and cars overpay such fees;\n       (3) pavement wear and tear is directly correlated with \n     axle-weight loads and distance traveled, and to the maximum \n     extent possible, Federal highway user fees should be \n     structured based on this fundamental fact of use and \n     resulting cost;\n       (4) the current Federal highway user fee structure is not \n     based on this fundamental fact of use and resulting cost; to \n     the contrary--\n       (A) the 12-percent excise tax applied to the sales of new \n     trucks has no significant relationship to pavement damage or \n     road use and does the poorest job of improving tax equity,\n       (B) the heavy vehicle use tax does not equitably apply to \n     heavy trucks (such tax is capped with respect to trucks \n     weighing over 75,000 pounds) and does not vary by annual \n     mileage, thus 2 heavy trucks traveling 10,000 miles and \n     100,000 miles, respectively, pay the same heavy vehicle use \n     tax, and\n       (C) diesel fuel taxes do a poor job recovering pavement \n     costs because such taxes only increase marginally with weight \n     increases while pavement damage increases exponentially with \n     weight, and increasing the rates for diesel fuel will not \n     resolve this fundamental flaw;\n       (5) truck taxes based on a combination of the weight of \n     vehicles and the distance such trucks travel provide greater \n     equity than a tax based on either of these 2 factors alone; \n     and\n       (6) the States generally have in place mechanisms for \n     verifying the registered weight of trucks and the miles such \n     trucks travel.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to replace the heavy vehicle use tax and all other \n     Federal highway user charges (except fuel taxes) with a \n     Federal weight-distance tax which is designed to yield at \n     least equal revenues for highway purposes and to provide \n     equity among highway users; and\n       (2) to provide that such a tax be administered in \n     cooperation with the States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

In doing so, it eliminates 3 of the \n     separate taxes paid into the Highway Trust Fund and replaces \n     them with a straightforward tax that more fairly distributes \n     the tax burden among highway users.\n       TEA 21 restructured the Highway Trust Fund's budgetary \n     treatment to ensure that transportation taxes would be spent \n     for transportation purposes. Congress did not, however, take \n     any steps to improve the allocation of transportation taxes \n     among highway users. Under current law, some users pay too \n     much into the trust fund relative to the costs they impose on \n     the nation's highway system while others pay too little. This \n     proposal more fairly apportions the tax burden to those who \n     impose the greatest costs to our highway infrastructure.\n\n\n                            specific points\n\n     Tax Simplification--3 Taxes Replaced with 1.\n       This bill eliminates three taxes (the 12% sales tax on new \n     trucks, the tire tax, and the Heavy Vehicle Use Tax) and \n     replaces it with a straightforward and fair axle-weight \n     distance tax. The taxes that are eliminated are either poor \n     surrogates for user impact or raise relatively small amounts \n     of money and are duplicative of the new axle-weight distance \n     tax.\n     Direct Correlation Between Taxes and Road Damage.\n       Pavement and bridge damage imposed by trucks is directly \n     correlated to axle-weight loads and distance traveled. This \n     bill recognizes this clear and direct relationship and \n     imposes user fees based on this principle.\n     No Tax Increase for Trucks Overall.\n       The bill collects the same amount of tax revenue from \n     trucks overall as current law. The U.S. Department of \n     Transportation estimates that transportation taxes paid by \n     trucks total $11 billion annually, the same as under the \n     bill.\n     Overwhelming More Winner than Losers.\n       Under the bill, the vast majority of trucks--more than 5.9 \n     million trucks--will see a tax reduction. This compares to \n     roughly 1.5 million who will see an increase.\n     Eliminates ``Corporate Welfare'' for Heavy Trucks.\n       By reforming the Highway Trust Fund taxes, this legislation \n     substantially reduces the subsidy provided to the heaviest \n     trucks using our nation's roadways. Most heavy trucks pay \n     less into the Highway Trust Fund than the costs they impose \n     on roads. The heaviest trucks pay less than half of the costs \n     of damage they inflict.\n     Eliminates Perverse Provisions in Current Law.\n       The Heavy Vehicle Use Tax (HVUT) under current law doesn't \n     apply to ``heavy trucks''. The HVUT is capped at 75,000 \n     pounds--meaning that ``heavy trucks'' don't pay any more in \n     taxes as their weight increases even though the extra weight \n     does exponentially more damage to the nation's roads and \n     bridges.\n       Secondly, the HVUT has no mileage component meaning that a \n     truck registered at 70,000 lbs traveling 10,000 miles per \n     year pays the same HVUT tax as an identical 70,000 pound \n     truck traveling 100,000 miles per year--not a fair or \n     sensible result.\n     Administrative Burden.\n       Under the bill, taxes are paid according to the distance \n     you traveled and your registered weight. The process is no \n     more complicated than reading your odometer and your truck \n     registration.\n     Current Mileage Filing Requirements for Interstate Carriers.\n       Under current law, all Interstate trucks are required to \n     file with their ``base state'' mileage logs that report \n     mileage driven in individual states. This existing \n     requirement of the International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) is \n     more detailed than what is required for the axle-weight tax \n     included in this bill, which only requires the aggregate \n     total of all mileage driven.\n     Reduces Double Taxation on Toll Roads.\n       This bill reduces double taxation on toll roads by allowing \n     a credit against the axle-weight distance tax for travel on a \n     toll facility. (e.g., the Oklahoma Turnpike, the Pennsylvania \n     Turnpike, Ohio Turnpike, Florida Turnpike, etc.).\n     Eliminates ``Diesel Differential''.\n       The bill also eliminates the so-called ``diesel \n     differential'', where diesel is taxed at a higher rate than \n     gasoline.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify certain provisions applicable to real estate investment \ntrusts; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         real estate investment trust modernization act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator Bob Graham and I, along with \n17 of our colleagues, are introducing legislation to modernize the tax \nrules that apply to real estate investment trusts (``REITs'').\n  This legislation is designed to remove barriers in the tax laws that \nimpose unnecessary administrative burdens and make it more difficult \nfor REITs to compete in an evolving marketplace. Our bill is similar to \na proposal included in the President's Fiscal Year 2000 budget that \npermits REITs to establish a new type of subsidiary called a ``taxable \nREIT subsidiary'' (``TRS''). As with the President's proposal, the \nlegislation we introduce today would permit REITs to establish a TRS to \nprovide non-customary services to their tenants and to provide services \nto third parties. In return for these new rules, the TRS would be \nsubject to a number of rules designed to prevent any income from being \nshifted out of the taxable subsidiary to the REIT.\n  Congress created REITs in 1960 to enable small investors to invest in \nreal estate. The REIT provisions were modeled after the rules that \napplied to mutual funds. If a number of requirements are met, a \ncorporation electing to be a REIT may deduct all dividends paid to its \nshareholders. One of the major requirements for REIT status is that \nREITs must distribute virtually all of their taxable income to their \nshareholders. Thus, unlike other C corporations that tend to retain \nmost of their earnings, the income tax burden for REITs is shifted to \nthe shareholder level. Unlike partnerships, REITs cannot pass losses \nthrough to their investors.\n  REITs are subject to a number of rules to ensure their primary focus \nis real estate activities. For example, at least 75% of a REIT's assets \nmust be comprised of rental real estate, mortgages, cash items and \ngovernment securities. A REIT also must satisfy two income tests. \nFirst, at least 75% of a REIT's annual gross income must consist of \nreal property rents, mortgage interest, gain from the sale of a real \nestate asset and certain other real estate-related sources. Second, at \nleast 95% of a REIT's annual gross income must be derived from the \nincome items from the above 75% test plus other ``passive income'' \nsources such as dividends and any type of interest. In addition, a REIT \ncannot own more than 10% of the voting securities of a non-REIT \ncorporation, and the securities of a single non-REIT corporation cannot \nbe worth more than 5% of the REIT's assets.\n  Although REITs were created in 1960, they did not really become a \nsignificant part of the real estate marketplace until the 1990s--partly \nbecause the original legislation did not permit REITs to manage their \nown property. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed this, by permitting \nREITs to manage their own properties through the provision of \n``customary services'' to tenants.\n  The market capitalization of REITs grew from about $13 billion at the \nend of 1991 to over $140 billion today. The taxes generated from REITs \nsimilarly have increased, with dividends from public REITs increasing \nfrom about $1 billion in 1991 to more than $8 billion today. While \nREITs remain a small portion of the entire real estate sector--in the \nrange of 10% nationally--they account for as much as half of some \nsectors that require immense amounts of capital, such as shopping \ncenters. While the REIT industry has come a long way in recent years, \nit continues to fulfill its original mission: permitting small \ninvestors access to attractive real estate investments. Almost 90% of \nREIT shareholders are individuals either investing directly or through \nmutual funds.\n  Although REITs have seen remarkable growth in the 1990s, their \nability to meet new competitive pressures in the real estate sector is \nin question as a result of tax law limitations on their activities. \nThese rules limit the ability of REITs to provide full services to \ntheir tenants and to third parties. In general, REITs may only provide \nservices to their tenants which the IRS has determined to be \n``customary'' in the business, meaning services already provided by the \ntypical real estate company in the market. REITs may only provide real \nestate-related services to third parties through preferred stock \nsubsidiaries which they can own but not control. REITs are thus \nprohibited from offering leading edge, full service options to their \ntenants and limited in the use of their expertise to serve third \nparties. This presents competitive problems for REITs as the real \nestate marketplace has evolved and property owners have sought to \nprovide a range of services to their tenants and other customers.\n  As a result, REITs increasingly have been unable to compete with \nprivately-held partnerships and other more exclusive forms of \nownership. Today, the rules prevent REITs from offering the same types \nof customer services as their competitors, even as such services are \nbecoming more central to marketing efforts. Examples abound: (1) \noffering concierge services to office and apartment tenants to pick up \ntickets or dry cleaning, to walk pets, etc.; (2) offering a branded \ncredit card at shopping malls, with rebates to be used as store credits \nat stores in the mall; (3) high speed Internet hook-ups, including \nenhanced telecommunications services (e.g., creating and maintaining a \nwebsite) offered by a landlord's partner; (4) partnering with an office \nsupply provider to offer reduced prices on office supplies; and (5) \npick-up and delivery services at self-storage rentals.\n  Without greater flexibility to provide competitive services to \ntenants and other customers, REITs will become less and less \ncompetitive with others in the real estate marketplace. REITs will have \nto wait for services to be deemed ``customary.'' As a practical matter, \nthat means a REIT must wait until the IRS concludes that almost \neverybody else has been providing the service. If a REIT is forced to \nlag the market, it can be neither competitive nor provide its investors \nwith a satisfactory return on their investment. Certainly, this is not \nconsistent with what Congress intended when it created REITs, and when \nit modified the REIT rules over the years. In keeping with the \nCongressional mandate to provide a sensible and effective way for the \naverage investor to benefit from ownership of income-producing real \nestate, REITs should be able to provide a range of services through \ntaxable subsidiaries.\n  The Administration's proposed Fiscal Year 2000 Budget acknowledges \nthis problem. The Administration proposes modernizing REIT rules to \npermit REITs, on a limited basis, to use taxable subsidiaries to \nprovide the services necessary to compete in the evolving real estate \nmarketplace. The Administration proposal is a good start, but I believe \nadditional refinements would further promote competitiveness. The \nlegislation that we are introducing today builds upon the \nAdministration proposal. Our bill addresses the\n\n[[Page S5378]]\n\nappropriate needs of the REIT industry and its investors in a manner \nconsistent with the underlying rationale for REITs and the requirements \nof the highly competitive, evolving real estate marketplace.\n  This legislation would give greater flexibility to REITs by \npermitting them to establish ``taxable REIT subsidiaries'' (``TRSs'') \nthat could provide non-customary services to tenants and services to \nthird parties. The 5% and 10% asset tests would not apply to the TRS. \nREITs would continue to be subject to the 75% asset tests so the value \nof their TRS, together with the value of other non-real estate assets, \ncould not exceed 25% of the total value of a REIT's assets. In \naddition, the REIT would have to continue to satisfy the 95% and 75% \nincome tests, with dividends or interest from a TRS to a REIT counting \ntowards the 95% test, but not the 75% test. Accordingly, at least 75% \nof a REIT's gross income would continue to consist of rents, mortgage \ninterest, real estate capital gains and the other miscellaneous real \nestate-related items already listed in the Code. The income a TRS would \nreceive from both third parties and REIT tenants would be fully subject \nto corporate tax.\n  To ensure that a TRS could not inappropriately reduce its corporate \ntax liability by shifting income to the REIT, the bill includes a \nnumber of stringent rules that limit the relationship between the REIT \nand the TRS. To prevent the TRS from making excessive intra-party \ninterest payments to its affiliated REIT, the proposal contains two \nsafeguards. One, it would apply the current anti-earnings stripping \nprovisions of Code section 163(j) to payments between a REIT and its \nTRS. This would prevent the TRS from deducting intra-party interest \nbeyond a modest amount regulated by objective criteria in the Code. \nTwo, a 100% excise tax would be imposed on any interest payments by a \nTRS to its affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate was above a \ncommercially-reasonable rate.\n  Also, to be certain that a TRS could not reduce its tax obligations \nby deducting rents to its affiliated REIT, our legislation would retain \nthe current rules under which any payments to a REIT by a related party \nwould not be considered qualified rents for purposes of the REIT gross \nincome tests. The only exception would be when a TRS rents less than \n10% of a REIT-owned property and pays rents to the REIT comparable to \nthe rents the REIT charges to its unrelated tenants at the same \nproperty. Under this exception, any rents paid to the REIT that turn \nout to be above comparable rents would be subject to a 100% excise tax.\n  Under our bill, a 100% excise tax is also imposed on any rents a REIT \ncharges its tenants that are inflated to disguise charges for services \nrendered to the tenant by its affiliated TRS. Limited exceptions would \nbe made when: (1) the TRS charges the same amounts for its services to \nboth REIT tenants and third parties; (2) rents for comparable space are \nthe same regardless of whether the TRS provides a service to the \ntenant; and (3) the TRS recognizes income for its services at least \nequal to 150% of its direct costs of providing the service to an \naffiliated REIT's tenants.\n  To discourage a REIT from allocating its expenses to its TRS (which \nwould reduce the TRS's corporate tax obligation), the proposal would \nimpose a 100% excise tax on any improper cost allocations between a \nREIT and its TRS. The Treasury Department would issue guidance on \nproper ways to allocate such costs.\n  Finally, the bill proposes to eliminate the use of preferred stock \nsubsidiaries by REITs. These subsidiaries, which have been established \npursuant to IRS letter rulings since 1988, allow a REIT to provide \nservices to third parties. While the asset test rules prevent a REIT \nfrom owning more than 10% of the voting securities of these \nsubsidiaries, they typically own more than 95% of the value of the \nsubsidiary. We propose to eliminate these subsidiaries by prohibiting \nREITs from owning more than 10% of the vote or the value in another \ncorporation other than a TRS. REITs would be given three years to \nconvert, tax-free, their preferred stock subsidiaries to taxable REIT \nsubsidiaries.\n  In addition, the bill includes some miscellaneous changes to the REIT \nrules that were under consideration when Congress approved a REIT \nsimplification package a few years ago. The first provision deals with \nhealth care property. Under current law, a REIT can conduct a trade or \nbusiness using property acquired through foreclosure for 90 days after \nit acquired such property, if it makes a ``foreclosure property'' \nelection. After this period, the REIT can only conduct the trade or \nbusiness through an independent contractor from whom the REIT does not \nderive any income. A health care REIT faces special challenges in using \nthese rules when its lease of a nursing home or other health care \nproperty expires.\n  To remedy these challenges and to ensure that care to patients \nremains uninterrupted, the proposal would make two technical changes to \nthe REIT foreclosure rules. First, the foreclosure property rules would \nbe extended to include leases that terminate (they already apply to \nleases that are breached). Second, for purposes of the foreclosure \nrules, a health care provider would not be disqualified as an \nindependent contractor solely because the REIT receives rental income \nfrom the provider with respect to one or more other properties. For \nthis purpose, other rules would be made to ensure that the terms of \nleases of other properties could not be manipulated to circumvent this \nrule.\n  Another provision deals with the 95% distribution rule. From 1960 \nthrough 1980, REITs and mutual funds shared a requirement to distribute \nat least 90% of their taxable income. Since 1980, REITs have had to \ndistribute 95% of their taxable income. The proposal would restore the \n90% distribution requirement.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a major improvement in the REIT \nrules that preserves the original intent of Congress when it first \ncreated REITs in 1960, while permitting the industry to adapt to a \nchanging marketplace. Most importantly, these REIT modernization rules \nwould not expand the activities that can be conducted within the REIT, \nthey simply give the REIT greater flexibility to establish fully-\ntaxable subsidiaries that will enable the REIT to better serve its \ncustomers.\n  This legislation is supported by the American Resort Development \nAssociation, the International Council of Shopping Centers, the \nNational Apartment Association, the National Association of Real Estate \nInvestment Trusts, the American Seniors Housing Association, the \nMortgage Bankers Association of America, the National Association of \nIndustrial and Office Properties, the National Association of Realtors, \nthe National Multi Housing Council, and the National Realty Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1057\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nMack, in the introduction of the REIT Modernization Act, legislation \nthat would modernize the tax rules that apply to real estate investment \ntrusts (``REITs'').\n  REITs were created in 1960 to give small investors the ability to \ninvest in income producing real estate. But it was not until the early \npart of this decade that REITs emerged as a significant factor in real \nestate finance. Their repid growth then contributed in a major way to \nthe development of real estate markets. The real estate industry is \nexperiencing change today as owners seek to maximize returns by taking \ngreater advantage of their employee expertise and tenant base. This \nbill will better enable REITS to expand their services to tenants and \ncustomers.\n  The Administration's Fiscal Year 2000 budget includes a proposal to \nchange the rules governing REITs. The legislation that we are \nintroducing today is largely based on that proposal. It would permit \nREITs to establish taxable subsidiaries to offer services that a REIT \ncannot offer directly to tenants and third parties. Stringent rules are \nincluded to ensure that the subsidiary would be fully subject to \ntaxation. Current rules designed to ensure that REIT income is \nprimarily earned from real estate activities would continue to apply. \nThe bill also modifies the tratment of health care facilities to ensure \nthat patients' lives are not disrupted in the event of an expired \nlease, and restores the 90% distribution rule that had previously \napplied to REITs.\n  REITs play a positive role in the real estate economy that has helped \nto stabilize property values and provide liquidity to the market. As \nlong as the basic limitations on REIT activities are preserved, those \ntax rules which impose restraints on REIT activities must be modified. \nIn my own state of Florida, REITs have invested more than $13 billion \nin the Florida economy, and are an important source of investment \ncapital that has reinvigorated real estate markets.\n  I want to thank Senator  Mack  for his leadership on this issue and I \nwelcome the bipartisan support this measure has received from members \nof the Senate Finance Committee, along with others, who have joined as \ncosponsors of the bill. I look forward to working with them in the \nmonths ahead.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President: I commend the efforts of my respected \ncolleagues from Florida, Senator Mack and Senator Graham, as they work \nto modernize the tax rules that apply to Real Estate Investment Trusts \n(REITs). I have worked with the REIT industry over the years and have \nseen it grow to be a major contributor to the strength of the real \nestate sector in New York and nationally.\n  Congress first authorized REITs in 1960 so that investors of modest \nmeans could invest in income producing real estate assets. During the \nlast four decades, REITs have provided not only real estate ownership \nopportunities for individual investors, but also an important source of \ncapital for real estate investment.\n  As tax policy makers we have the responsibility to make sure that tax \nlaws governing REITs are updated to reflect the realities of a dynamic \nmarket and to maintain a proper competitive balance between real estate \nowned through the REIT structure and through more traditional corporate \nand partnership structures. But because REITs are pass-through \nentities, we also have a responsibility to ensure that they are not \nused as vehicles for sheltering corporate taxes in a manner \ninconsistent with Congressional intent. In fact, twice in the last \nCongress the Finance Committee crafted legislation, later signed into \nlaw, to stop inappropriate use of the REIT structure in the case of so-\ncalled ``stapled entities'' and liquidating subsidiaries.\n  The Administration has included a proposal in its FY 2000 budget that \nwould, among other things, allow REITs to own a taxable REIT \nsubsidiary. The legislation introduced by Senators Mack and Graham \nbuilds on the Administration proposal, and would expand the permissible \nbusiness activities of REITs.\n  The approach taken in the proposals advanced by the Administration \nand by Senators Mack and Graham warrant consideration. I have asked my \nstaff to review the legislation and work with the authors of the bill. \nIt is my hope that Congress can enact REIT modernization legislation \nthis year.\n\n

Mr. President, on behalf of a bipartisan group of 30 \nSenators, this morning I sent a letter to President Clinton expressing \nour view that bilateral negotiations with China over accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization should be resumed immediately and finalized \nquickly. After completion of an agreement that clearly advances U.S. \neconomic interests, we are committed to granting China permanent Normal \nTrading Relations (NTR) status.\n  It is critical, especially after the events in Belgrade and Beijing \nover this past week, that we understand what is in America's national \ninterest. It is in our national interest to ensure that China is \nincorporated into the global trade community through membership in the \nWTO. It is in our national interest to make sure that China follows \ninternationally accepted trade rules. It is in our national interest to \nimprove market access and open China's markets to American agricultural \nproducts, services, and manufactured goods. And it is in our national \ninterest to do what we can to help anchor and sustain the economic \nreform process currently underway in China.\n  As I look at the Senators who signed this letter, I see a broad \nrepresentation of our country, our society, and our economy. The nature \nof this group, half Democrat and half Republican, demonstrates that \nthere is strong and broad support in the Senate for us to focus on \nAmerica's long-term national economic interests in developing our \ntrading relationship with China. We cannot, we must not, and we will \nnot, ignore the many problem areas in the broad U.S.-China \nrelationship, from human rights to espionage to weapons proliferation. \nBut the message is clear that we must look closely at every aspect of \nthis relationship in an objective way, determine what is best for us as \na nation, and act accordingly.\n  The agreements reached during Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's recent \nvisit to Washington are solid. We want no back-pedaling on those \nunderstandings. We want an early resumption of the trade negotiations \nand a rapid conclusion. We want to bring China into the global trade \ncommunity, and to do so it is necessary to grant China permanent normal \ntrading relations status. The broad bipartisan group of Senators who \nsigned today's letter firmly supports that.\n  Let me be clear about the intended recipients of the message in this \nletter. We want the administration to know that a core bipartisan group \nin the Senate is behind resumption of negotiations and conclusion of a \nWTO agreement, and that group will support permanent NTR status for \nChina. We want the most senior levels of the Chinese government to know \nthat a good WTO agreement with the United States will lead rapidly to \nWTO accession and to permanent NTR status. We want the American public \nto understand that we in the Senate are taking strong leadership in \npromoting the long-term economic interests of this country.\n  And we want the American business community to know that they have \nresponsibilities: first, to work ceaselessly to take advantage of the \nconcessions China will make as it enters the WTO, second, to expand \nexports to China that will grow jobs in the United States, and, third, \nto educate the public and policymakers about the importance of \nintegrating China into the global economy.\n  The terms negotiated by USTR, the Department of Agriculture, and \nothers are excellent. These are structural changes, market opening \nmeasures, and trade concessions made by China, not by the United \nStates. We, the United States, are giving up nothing and are obtaining \nimmeasurable possibilities for the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bipartisan letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1999.\n     President William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to encourage you to \n     finalize bilateral negotiations over Chinese accession to the \n     WTO. For our part, upon conclusion of a market access \n     agreement that clearly advances our economic interests in \n     China, we are committed to granting China permanent Normal \n     Trading Relations status.\n       Despite the events of this week in Belgrade and China, it \n     is critical that we focus on what is important to America's \n     national interest. Incorporating China into the global trade \n     community through WTO membership; encouraging China to follow \n     internationally accepted trade rules; opening Chinese markets \n     to our manufactured goods, agricultural products, and \n     services; and helping to anchor the economic reform process \n     underway in China, all serve our national interest. The \n     recent events in Belgrade and Beijing are reason neither to \n     weaken those commitments made during Premier Zhu Rongji's \n     visit last month nor to delay conclusion of the accession \n     process.\n       We look forward to working with you to ensure an early \n     conclusion of these negotiations and China's accession to the \n     WTO.\n           Sincerely,\n         Max Baucus, John H.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a very important \nevent.\n  All over the country, women and men alike are preparing for the \n``Race for the Cure,'' a 5-kilometer foot race to raise money in the \nfight against breast cancer. Each year, the number of participants in \nthe race has grown. Sixteen years after its inception, the Race\n\n[[Page S5390]]\n\nfor the Cure has become the largest 5-K in the world.\n  I believe this race is widely attended because breast cancer has \naffected so many people. One in 9 women and approximately 12,000 men \nare diagnosed with breast cancer every year. So, in some way, \neveryone--every man, woman, and child is affected by this disease. The \nRace for the Cure is important because it brings awareness to this \ndisease that is so prevalent today.\n  This cause and this race are important to me for many reasons. There \nare several women who are very important to me who are survivors of \nthis terrible disease. I have learned so much from these women; I have \nseen their courage and, believe me, I want to underscore that point--\nvery courageous. I have seen their willingness to fight. Through them, \nI have learned more about the value of life.\n  We often take for granted the gifts that we have been given. We catch \nourselves thinking about what will happen in an hour, or in a couple of \ndays, and we forget to live for right now. The precious time that we \nhave with our loved ones is invaluable. We take too little time with \nthem. Through their struggles to fight breast cancer, these women have \nshown me the importance of a life lived well. And for that, I thank \neach of them.\n  This race is being held in over 95 cities in the United States over \nthe next few weeks. I am proud to say that this weekend, on May 15, the \nRace for the Cure will be held in Helena, MT, my State's capital. \nApproximately 3,000 runners will participate. More important, over 300 \nbreast cancer survivors will participate this weekend in the race for \nlife.\n  Seventy-five percent of the race proceeds are used to provide \nmammography vouchers and grants for follow-up diagnostic tests for more \nthan 600 women in Montana. Thirty-two health care facilities in my \nState participate in this program.\n  I extend my special thanks to the Montana Race organizers Connie \nMalcom and Bobbie Pomroy and the hundreds of volunteers working \ntogether to make this important event occur. Women like Jan Paulsen, a \nseven-year survivor who will represent my State at the National Race \nfor the Cure here in Washington, DC, on June 5.\n  Congratulations to everyone involved in this important event and good \nluck to all!\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/14/senate-section/article/S5390-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5390-S5392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                Y2K ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares for a Tuesday \ncloture vote on the Y2K litigation reform legislation, I want to spend \njust a few minutes this afternoon trying to describe where I believe we \nare in the course of the Senate debate and all the bipartisan progress \nthat has been made in the last few weeks on this issue. I especially \nemphasize the bipartisan focus that has been taking place in the \nSenate.\n  The House had a vote, as the Presiding Officer knows, this week. \nRegrettably, it was pretty much along partisan lines. There is \ncertainly nothing partisan about this issue. If we have chaos early in \nthe next century as a result of Y2K frivolous lawsuits, folks are not \ngoing to be sitting around asking whether Democrats or Republicans \ncaused it. They are going to be saying: What was the problem? Why \ndidn't the Congress deal with it?\n  Fortunately, the Senate, unlike the House, has been working in a \nbipartisan way to deal with this. On the Republican side, Chairman \nMcCain and Chairman Hatch, Senator Gorton, Senator Bennett, and a \nvariety of Senators have worked with me and Senator Dodd, who is the \nDemocratic leader on this issue and has done such a good job on the Y2K \ncommittee. And Senator Feinstein has made enormous contributions. She \nrepresents California, of course, a State that has a great interest in \ntechnology issues.\n  The most important thing, as the Senate goes to the important Y2K \ndebate next week, is for all of us to recognize that we have taken a \ncompletely different approach from that of the House of \nRepresentatives. There was no evidence of bipartisanship in the House \nlast week. That has not been the case in the Senate.\n  I also want to make it clear, both Senate Democrats and Republicans \nare interested in working with the White House on this legislation. For \nthe White House to veto a responsible Y2K bill would be like throwing a \nmonkey wrench into the technology engine that is driving this Nation's \neconomic prosperity.\n  I cannot believe the White House would want to do that. I know there \nare many in the White House who have ideas and suggestions and are \ntalking to Senators of both parties. We are anxious to hear from them, \nbecause the Senate is going to move next week to this debate and now is \nthe time for them to come forward with their practical suggestions.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, this is a topic that cannot wait. \nThere are a variety of issues before the Senate where the immediacy may \nnot be all that crucial. This is an issue that cannot wait, because if \nwe do not deal with it now, I personally believe what will happen is, \nearly in the next century we really will have chaos as a result of this \nY2K situation. The Senate could find itself back in a special session \nat that time having to deal with it. It is much better to do it now and \nto do it in a bipartisan way.\n  I want to spend a few minutes talking about how this effort to make \nthis issue bipartisan and ensure that it is fair to both consumers and \nbusiness has evolved over the last few weeks.\n  The legislation that is coming before the Senate early next week is \nthe legislation that began in the Senate Commerce Committee, led in \nthat effort by Chairman McCain and Senator Gorton. Unfortunately, there \nwas a strict party-line vote in the Senate Commerce Committee. I and \nothers said there were a whole lot of features of that original Senate \nCommerce bill that were just unacceptable to us.\n  For example, it included language that would have provided what is \ncalled a ``reasonable effort'' sort of defense which just was not fair \nto the plaintiff and to the consumer, and I and others said that we \ncould not support the bill at that time.\n\n  But after it came out of the Senate Commerce Committee, Chairman \nMcCain, to his credit, with other leaders on the Republican side of the \naisle, made it clear that they wanted to work with Senator Dodd, \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Kerry, myself, and others to fashion a truly \nbipartisan bill. I believe that is what the Senate has before it now.\n  For example, the legislation which is coming before the Senate on \nTuesday, which we will vote on Tuesday morning, has a sunset provision \nin it. We have heard all this talk on the floor of the Senate about how \nY2K litigation legislation is going to be changing the tort laws and \nour legal system for all time, that it is going to be making these \nchanges that are just going to last for time immemorial.\n  The fact of the matter is, the Y2K legislation sunsets in 2003. It is \nfor a short period of time, and for a period of time to deal with what \nwe think will otherwise be a variety of frivolous lawsuits and \nunnecessary litigation.\n  Second, the legislation which will be before the Senate early next \nweek does absolutely nothing to change the tort remedies that consumers \nwould have if they were injured as a result of a Y2K-related problem.\n  For example, if an individual is in an elevator that falls as a \nresult of a computer failure, and tragically falls, say, 10 floors in \nan office building, and that individual is badly injured or killed, in \nthat instance all of the existing legal remedies, all of the existing \ntort remedies that are now on the books, would still apply. The \nlegislation before the Senate now would not touch in any way, not in \nany way, those remedies for personal injuries that would come about as \na result of a Y2K failure.\n  So those two consumer protections--the sunset provision and ensuring \nthat tort remedies are available to injured consumers--are in place and \nthere to protect the public, and it is important that the Senate know \nthat as we go to the upcoming Tuesday vote.\n\n[[Page S5391]]\n\n  Third, the legislation which is before the Senate now eliminates the \nnew and vague Federal defense, ``reasonable efforts,'' which was what \nwas in the original Commerce Committee legislation. We think that was \nsimply too mushy, too vague. It has been eliminated.\n  Fourth, after the legislation left the Commerce Committee, there were \nconcerns about a new preemptive Federal standard for establishing \npunitive damages. Now, under the legislation before the Senate, the \ncurrent standards as set out in our various States are going to \nprevail.\n  Fourth, after the legislation left the committee, we restored \npunitive damages in the most important cases. If a defendant is acting \nin bad faith, is engaged in egregious conduct that is offensive to \nconsumers, all of the opportunities for punitive damages will lie. \nAlso, if the defendant is insolvent, there will be a chance for the \nplaintiff to be made whole in those kinds of instances as well.\n  So the principle of joint liability for defendants in these key areas \nis in fact kept in place.\n  Next, we restore liability for directors and officers when they make \nmisleading statements and withhold information regarding any actual or \npotential Y2K problem.\n  So all of that was essentially in the changes which Senator McCain \nand I brought to the Senate several weeks ago. We thought that that \nshowed a good-faith effort to work with all sides, to work with the \ntechnology community, to work with consumer organizations. We consulted \nwith the organizations representing trial lawyers. We thought it \nreflected a good balance.\n\n  After that effort, Senator Dodd, the Democratic leader on the Y2K \nissue, presented a number of other very, very good suggestions, and \nthose have been added as well.\n  So the Senate now has a Y2K reform bill in front of it where there \nhave been 10 major changes made since this legislation left the \nCommerce Committee, changes that Senator McCain and I agreed to, that \nwe thought did the job. Senator Dodd came forward with some other \nadditional and excellent changes. And Senator McCain, to his credit and \neffort to be bipartisan, accepted those as well.\n  So we have now, I think, addressed what has been the original concern \nof a number of Senators. We keep in place, for example, the States' \nstandards with respect to evidence in these cases. There was a concern \nby some Senators that somehow this legislation had raised the bar in \nterms of the plaintiff having to meet higher standards of evidence in \norder to make their case. We kept the current State evidentiary \nstandards.\n  So now in fact our standards with respect to evidence track the \nlanguage in the securities litigation reform bill that was passed and \nsigned into law as well as the 1992 Y2K Information Readiness \nDisclosure Act. So it is clear that there is precedent for the \nevidentiary standards we are using in this legislation.\n  These are major changes. They were put together by a bipartisan group \nand together, I think, reflect the kind of legislation that the Senate \nought to pass and I think will pass when we get an opportunity to vote \non the legislation on the merits.\n  I will also tell you that this makes the Senate bill a very, very \ndifferent bill from the legislation the House of Representatives \nenacted a few days ago. The House legislation in fact had a vague \nreasonable-efforts defense. We got rid of that after it came out of the \nSenate Commerce Committee. Senator McCain and I and Senator Feinstein \nand others looked at the legislation. We got rid of that. We said it is \ntoo vague, it is not fair to the plaintiff or the consumer. The House \nkept it earlier in the week.\n  The House legislation did not have a sunset date in it. Our \nlegislation does. It says this is going to be for a short time window, \nuntil 2003.\n  A number of other changes which we think are not fair to the \nplaintiff or the consumer were areas that the House was unwilling to \ntouch. On the directors and officers, they do not take the position \nthat we take. They would limit liability for directors and officers. \nThey do not take the position that we take on proportionate liability. \nAnd in fact they do have a higher evidentiary standard for the \nplaintiff and the consumer than we do.\n  So the fact is, the Senate will be voting on a very, very different \nbill. I am hopeful that the Senate will strongly endorse our approach, \nwhich we think is fair to both plaintiffs and defendants.\n  There have been other ideas floated in the last couple of days. I \nwill wrap up just for a few minutes by talking about them, because I \nthink if you look at what is being floated now, our legislation again \nfalls right into the balanced, centrist kind of approach the Senate \nought to be taking. I am going to wrap up just by briefly discussing \nsome of these other ideas which have been circulated in the last couple \nof days.\n\n  There are some who would like to limit the legislation only to \ncommercial laws. This would deny the consumer the chance to get a Y2K \nproblem fixed in a timely manner. That is what we do in our \nlegislation. But some who would limit the legislation only to \ncommercial laws would force those who are least able to afford \nattorneys to go out and have to hire them. Under our bill, the consumer \ntells the manufacturer or the vendor how they want the problem fixed \nand they would be able to get the job done in 90 days or less.\n  I do not think the consumer wants to spend months and even years \nwaiting in line after all the other frivolous lawsuits go forward \nbefore theirs. I think people want to get their problems solved and \nwant to get them solved quickly. The fact is, under our legislation, if \nthe consumer, if the plaintiff, is not treated fairly, if the consumers \ndo not believe they get a fair shake, they can go out and file suit on \nthe very first day--the very first day--and be in a position to have \ntheir issue aired immediately.\n  Some of the other proposals that have been offered would offer no \nprotection for small business from punitive damages. Without some \nprotection, a small business could be facing an avalanche of lawsuits. \nPutting a small business out of business is, in my view, an odd way to \ntry to fix the Y2K problem. But what Senator Dodd did, with the \nvaluable additions that he made, was the kind of approach that I think \nreally does protect the small business and deal with the issue of small \nbusinesses and punitive damages responsibly. Unlimited joint liability, \nand we have heard some who have advocated that, would declare open \nseason on anybody in the wholesale or in the retail chain. You do that, \nand there is absolutely no protection for the small business mainstream \nretailer.\n  Now, what has been interesting is that some who have opposed the \nefforts that our bipartisan group has made on the Y2K issue have said \nthat we are against small business and that small business does not get \na fair shake under our legislation.\n  The fact of the matter is that hundreds of small business \norganizations have endorsed the bipartisan legislation that is before \nthe Senate. I think the idea of having unlimited joint liability really \nwould be inequitable to the small business. Certainly, we ought to make \nsure those small businesses that are most vulnerable get a fair shake.\n  Other approaches just do not offer the incentives to business that we \nthink are necessary to help fix the Y2K problem. They just force the \nconsumer into the courtroom, really give businesses no reason to help \nmitigate the Y2K situation.\n  This isn't a partisan issue. It affects every computer system that \nuses date information. Every piece of hardware, every piece of an \noperating support system, and every software program that uses date-\nrelated information may be affected. It is not a design flaw.\n\n  There has somehow been spread across the country the notion that all \nof this stems from design flaws in our computer systems. It was an \nengineering trade-off. To get more space on a disk and in memory, the \nprecision of century indicators was abandoned. It is hard for all of us \nto believe today that disk and memory space used to be at a premium, \nbut it was. In the early 1960s, for example, computer memory cost as \nmuch as $1 million for what today can be purchased for less than $100. \nNo computer programmer thought that the programs written then would \nstill be running in the year 2000, but they are.\n\n[[Page S5392]]\n\n  The trade-off became the industry standard, and computers cannot work \nat all without industry standards. Those standards are the means by \nwhich programs and systems exchange information.\n  I guess you could try to solve the Y2K problem by just dumping all \nthe old layers of computer code that have been accumulated in the last \nfew decades, but that is not a realistic way to proceed. Everybody \ninvolved, from CEOs to all of the people doing basic programming, need \nto continue the painstaking process of making sure that all systems are \nY2K compliant. Our goal ought to be to bring every information \ntechnology system into Y2K compliance as soon as possible. That ought \nto be our principal focus and, at the same time, we ought to make sure, \nas our legislation does, that there is a good safety net in place.\n  I am very hopeful that the Senate will pass this legislation. We all \nknow that the economic good times that we have seen recently are being \ndriven by technology. I have said repeatedly that if there is a veto of \na bipartisan, responsible Y2K bill, that really would be like throwing \na monkey wrench into the technology engine that is driving our Nation's \nprosperity. There is no other way to put it. We have to get a good \nbipartisan Y2K reform bill on the President's desk. We need to do it \nnow.\n  I am hopeful that the White House will work with us constructively in \nthe days ahead. I think the changes that have been made since this \nlegislation originally came out of the Senate Commerce Committee do the \njob. I can tell you, having heard from Senator McCain and Senator Hatch \nand Senator Dodd and Senator Feinstein, we are open to other ideas and \nsuggestions as well. But we have to get this legislation moving. We \nhave to get it signed. It is too important.\n  I hope our colleagues get a little bit of R over the weekend. This \nhas been a long week with the juvenile justice legislation. That bill \nand Y2K and other subjects are coming up next week, which will be \nhectic as well. I am very hopeful our colleagues will support the \nbipartisan Y2K bill that we will have before us Tuesday at 9:45.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                   RECESS UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 17, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
