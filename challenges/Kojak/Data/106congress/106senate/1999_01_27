You know that this is an important one of those days. In \na few moments, votes must be cast. Now in the quiet, the Senators wait \nto be counted. It is a lonely time. Beyond party loyalties, those on \nboth sides of the aisle long to do what ultimately is best for our \nNation. Debate has led to firm convictions. Give the Senators the \ncourage of these convictions and the assurance that, if they are true \nto whatever they now believe is best, You will bless them with peace. \nWe intercede for them and the heavy responsibility they must carry. \nImbue them with Your calming Spirit and strengthen them with Your gift \nof faith to trust You to maintain unity once the votes are tallied. We \ncommit the results to You. Our times are in Your hands. Through our \nLord and Saviour. Amen.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Sergeant at Arms will make the proclamation.\n  The Sergeant at Arms, James W. Ziglar, made proclamation as follows.\n\n       Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to \n     keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the Senate of the \n     United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of \n     impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States.\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE.

Mr. Chief Justice, in a moment we will begin two \nconsecutive votes. The first will be on the motion to dismiss. That \nwill be followed by an immediate vote on the motion to subpoena. \nFollowing those votes, there will be an opportunity to describe how we \nwould go forward from there with the depositions. I have discussed this \nwith Senator Daschle. It is likely that we would take a break at that \npoint so that we could have further discussions with our conferences to \nmake sure we understand how that subpoena and deposition process would \ngo forward. I have a resolution prepared. We have some simpler ones \nthat we can consider. But we would want to discuss those with each \nother during the vote, and perhaps even after the two votes occur, \ndepending on what the results are.\n\n  The idea is that we have now before us Senate Resolution 16, which \nhas brought us to the point to these two votes. We need to give some \nconsideration to making sure we understand how the process will go \nforward to a conclusion after that.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention. I believe we are ready for \nthe votes, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n\n                       Vote on Motion to Dismiss\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE.

The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, as I indicated earlier, we are \nattempting now to clarify exactly how this will proceed and to reach \nagreement with regard to the remaining procedure and the beginning of \nthe deposition process.\n  We are acting in good faith, but we want to make sure we are at least \ngoing to try to think about all contingencies, and we are exchanging \nresolutions and suggestions between Senator Daschle and myself at this \ntime. We may be asked to vote later on today on a procedure. We will \nlet you know if that is necessary today. It could happen tomorrow. But \nwe don't want it to go much longer than that because we need to make \nsure this procedure is going forward.\n  Of course, if we don't have a resolution, I presume we will begin to \ngo forward anyway, but we would like to have some orderly procedure as \nwe have had in the past. My thinking at this time is that we would just \nstand in recess subject to the call of the Chair while we talk this \nthrough. It may not be necessary to do anything further as far as a \nrecorded vote but it may be. So we just wanted Senators to be on notice \nof that.\n\n\n                Recess Subject to the Call of the Chair\n\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Chief Justice, that the \nSenate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.\n  There being no objection, at 1:33 p.m., the Senate recessed subject \nto the call of the Chair.\n  The Senate reassembled at 4:47 p.m. when called to order by the Chief \nJustice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  First, I thank all the Members, all concerned, for their patience \nthroughout this process. We have had a productive day, and I believe \nthis recess that we have been experiencing has been helpful in allowing \nfurther discussions to occur and to clarify what the procedures will be \nfrom here through the subpoena and deposition process and, hopefully, \neven to a conclusion.\n  Senator Daschle and I have traded proposals which outline those \nprocedures for the remainder of the trial, and although I won't go into \ndetail at this time, I will say that both proposals bring us to a final \nvote on the pending articles of impeachment in an expeditious manner. \nWe have been narrowing the questions that are involved, and we are now \nworking on what I hope will be the final draft. But it is not going to \nbe possible to complete that this afternoon. We hope to be able to do \nit when we reconvene at 1 p.m. on Thursday.\n  There will be conferences of the two parties in the morning so that \nwe can go over this with all the Senators. It is not enough just that \nthe leaders understand or agree; we have to make sure every Senator \nunderstands it and agrees with the procedure that we would go forward \nwith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/27/senate-section/article/S1017-4", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1 P.M.

A bill to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of \n1935, to enact the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1999, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n               public utility holding company act of 1999\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act of 1999. This bipartisan bill is \ndesigned to help America's energy consumers by repealing an antiquated \nlaw that is keeping the benefits of competition from reaching our \ncitizens. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Dodd, Senators Gramm and \nSarbanes, Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Banking, \nHousing and Urban Affairs, Senator Murkowski, Chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, Majority Leader Lott, and Senators \nMack, Craig, and Brownback in introducing this important legislation. \nOur bill, which is identical to legislation voted out of the Senate \nBanking Committee with bipartisan support in the 105th Congress, \nrepeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA).\n  The original PUHCA legislation passed over 60 years ago in 1935. At \nthat time, a few large holding companies controlled a great majority of \nthe electric utilities and gas pipelines. No longer is a majority of \nthe utility service offered by so few a provider. In fact, over 80 \npercent of the utility holding companies are currently exempt from \nPUHCA.\n  This legislation implements the recommendations of the Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC) made first in 1981 and then again in 1995 \nfollowing an extensive study of the effects of this antiquated law on \nour energy markets. In the 1995 report entitled, ``The Regulation of \nPublic-Utility Holding Companies,'' the Division of Investment \nManagement recommended that Congress conditionally repeal the Act since \n``the current regulatory system imposes significant costs, indirect \nadministrative charges and foregone economies of scale and scope . . \n.''\n  The regulatory restraints imposed by PUHCA on our electric and gas \nindustries are counterproductive in today's global competitive \nenvironment and are based on historical assumptions and industry models \nthat are no longer valid. Repeal will not create regulatory gaps; the \nability of the States to regulate holding company systems, together \nwith the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's powers under the \nFederal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act render PUHCA redundant\n  Our bill assures the FERC and the States access to the books and \nrecords\n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\nof holding company systems that are relevant to the costs incurred by \njurisdictional public utility companies. As a result, the regulatory \nframework to protect consumers is not only protected in this bill, but \nenhanced.\n  In the competitive environment that we now find ourselves, it is \nimperative to remove a major bottleneck that constrains the ability of \nAmerican gas and electric utilities to compete.\n  This bill has been reported out of the Senate Banking Committee in \nthe last two Congresses, but due to time constraints, was never voted \non in the full Senate. I am confident that we have the votes to pass \nthis legislation this session. While it is unclear that a sufficient \nconsensus exists to ensure legislative progress on comprehensive reform \nof the electric and gas industry, it is very clear that the first step \nto comprehensive reform is the repeal of PUHCA. I am pleased to \nannounce, Mr. President, that a broad consensus for PUHCA repeal does \nexist, and the Senate should act on this very important legislation as \nsoon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Dodd, Ms. \n        Snowe, and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 314. A bill to provide a loan guarantee program to address the \nYear 2000 computer problems of small business concerns, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n                 small business year 2000 readiness act\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Year 2000 Readiness Act along with my colleagues Senators \nBennett, Snowe, Dodd, Kerry, and Moynihan. This bill provides small \nbusinesses with the resources necessary to repair Year 2000 computer \nproblems. Last year I introduced a similar bill that the Committee on \nSmall Business adopted by an 18-0 vote and that the full Senate \napproved by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, the House of \nRepresentatives did not act on the legislation prior to adjournment. I \nam reintroducing this bill because the consequences of Congress not \ntaking action to assist small business with their Y2K problems are too \nsevere to ignore.\n  Given the effects a substantial number of small business failures \nwill have on our nation's economy, it is imperative that Congress \npromptly pass legislation that ensures that small businesses are aware \nof the Y2K problem and have access to capital to fix such problems. \nMoreover, it is imperative that Congress pass such legislation before \nthe problem occurs, not after it has already happened. It is, \ntherefore, with a sense of urgency that I am introducing the Small \nBusiness Year 2000 Readiness Act.\n  The problem is that certain computers and processors in automated \nsystems will fail because such systems will not recognize the Year \n2000. In fact, a small business is at risk if it uses any computers in \nits business, if it has customized software, if it is conducting e-\ncommerce, if it accepts credit card payments, if it uses a service \nbureau for its payroll, if it depends on a data bank for information, \nif it has automated equipment for communicating with its sales or \nservice force or if it has automated manufacturing equipment.\n  Last June, the Committee on Small Business, which I chair, held \nhearings on the effect the Y2K problem will have on small businesses. \nThe outlook is not good--in fact it is poor at best. The Committee \nreceived testimony that the entities most at risk from Y2K failures are \nsmall and medium-sized companies, not larger companies. The major \nreason for this anomaly is that many small companies have not begun to \nrealize how much of a problem Y2K failure will be, and many may not \nhave the access to capital to cure such problems before they cause \ndisastrous results.\n  A study on Small Business and the Y2K Problem sponsored by Wells \nFargo Bank and the NFIB found that an estimated 4.75 million small \nemployers are subject to the Y2K problem. This equals approximately 82 \npercent of all small businesses that have at least two employees. The \nCommittee has also received information indicating that approximately \n750,000 small businesses may either shut down due to the Y2K problem or \nbe severely crippled if they do not take action to cure their Y2K \nproblems. Such failures will affect not only the employees and owners \nor failed small businesses, but also their creditors, suppliers and \ncustomers. Lenders will face significant losses if their small business \nborrowers either go out of business or have a sustained period in which \nthey cannot operate. Most importantly, however, is the fact that up to \n7.5 million families may face the loss of paychecks for a sustained \nperiod of time if small businesses do not remedy their Y2K problems. \nGiven these facts, it is easy to forecast that there will be severe \neconomic consequences if small businesses do not become Y2K compliant \nin time and there are only 11 months to go. Indeed the countdown is on.\n  A good example of how small businesses are dramatically affected by \nthe Y2K problem is the experience of Lloyd Davis, the owner of Golden \nPlains Agricultural Technologies, Inc., a farm equipment manufacturer \nin Colby, Kansas. Like many small business owners, Mr. Davis' business \ndepends on trailing technology purchased over the years, including 386 \ncomputers running custom software. Mr. Davis uses his equipment to run \nhis entire business, including handling the company's payroll, \ninventory control, and maintenance of large databases on his customers \nand their specific needs. In addition, Golden Fields has a web site and \nsells the farm equipment it manufacturers over the internet.\n  Unlike many small business owners, however, Mr. Davis is aware of the \nY2K problem and tested his equipment to see if it could handle the Year \n2000. His tests confirmed his fear--the equipment and software could \nnot process the year 2000 date and would not work properly after \nDecember 31, 1999. That is when Mr. Davis's problem began. Golden \nFields had to purchase an upgraded software package. That cost $16,000. \nOf course, the upgraded software would not run on 386 computers, so \nGolden Fields had to upgrade to new hardware. Golden Fields had a \ncomputer on each of its 11 employees' desks, so that each employee \ncould access the program that essentially ran the company and assist \nfilling the internet orders the company received. Replacing all the \nhardware would have cost Golden Fields $55,000. Therefore, Golden \nFields needed to expend $71,000 just to put itself in the same position \nit was in before the Y2K problem.\n  Like many small business owners facing a large expenditure, Mr. Davis \nwent to his bank to obtain a loan to pay for the necessary upgrades. \nBecause Golden Fields was not already Y2K compliant, his bank refused \nhim a loan because it had rated his company's existing loans as ``high-\nrisk''. Golden Fields was clearly caught in a Catch-22 situation. \nNevertheless, Mr. Davis scrambled to save his company. He decided to \nlease the new hardware instead of purchasing it, but he will pay a \nprice that ultimately will be more expensive than conventional \nfinancing. Moreover, instead of replacing 11 computers, Golden Fields \nonly replaced six at a cost of approximately $23,000. Golden Fields \nwill be less efficient as a result. The experience of Mr. Davis and \nGolden Fields has been and will continue to be repeated across the \ncountry as small businesses realize the impact the Y2K problem will \nhave on their business.\n\n  A recent survey conducted by Arthur Andersen's Enterprise Group on \nbehalf of National Small Business United indicates that, like Golden \nFields, many small businesses will incur significant costs to become \nY2K compliant and are very concerned about it. The survey found that to \nbecome Y2K compliant, 29 percent of small- to medium-sized businesses \nwill purchase additional hardware, 24 percent will replace existing \nhardware and 17 percent will need to convert their entire computer \nsystem. When then asked their most difficult challenge relating to \ntheir information technology, more than 54% of the businesses surveyed \ncited ``affording the cost.'' Congress must ensure that these \nbusinesses do not have the same trouble obtaining financing for their \nY2K corrections as Mr. Davis and Golden Fields Agricultural \nTechnologies. Moreover, Congress must deal with the concerns that have \nrecently been raised that there may be a ``credit crunch'' this year \nwith businesses, especially small businesses, unable to obtain \nfinancing for any purposes if they are not Y2K compliant.\n  In addition to the costs involved, there is abundant evidence that \nsmall\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\nbusinesses are, to date, generally unprepared for, and in certain \ncircumstances, unaware of the Y2K problem. The NFIB's most recent \nsurvey indicates that 40 percent of small businesses don't plan on \ntaking action or do not believe the problem is serious enough to worry \nabout.\n  The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act that I am introducing \ntoday will serve the dual purpose of providing small businesses with \nthe means to continue operating successfully after January 1, 2000, and \nmaking lenders and small firms more aware of the dangers that lie \nahead. The Act requires the Small Business Administration to establish \na limited-term loan program whereby SBA guarantees the principal amount \nof a loan made by a private lender to assist small businesses in \ncorrecting Year 2000 computer problems.\n  Each lender that participates in the SBA's 7(a) business loan program \nis eligible to participate in the Y2K loan program. This includes more \nthan 6,000 lenders located across the country. To ensure that the SBA \ncan roll out the loan program promptly, the Act permits a lender to \nprocess Y2K loans pursuant to any of the procedures that the SBA has \nalready authorized for that lender. Moreover, to assist small \nbusinesses that may have difficulty sustaining sufficient cash flows \nwhile developing Y2K solutions, the loan program will permit flexible \nfinancing terms so small businesses are able to service the new debt \nwith available cash flow. For example, under certain circumstances, a \nborrower may defer principal payments for up to a year. Once the Y2K \nproblem is behind us, the Act provides that the loan program will \nsunset.\n  To assure that the loan program is made available to those small \nbusinesses that need it and to increase awareness of the Y2K problem, \nthe legislation requires SBA to market this program aggressively to all \neligible lenders. Awareness of this loan program's availability is of \nparamount importance. Financial institutions are currently required by \nFederal banking regulators to contact their customers to ensure that \nthey are Y2K compliant. The existence of a loan program designed to \nfinance Y2K corrections will give financial institutions a specific \nsolution to offer small companies that may not be eligible for \nadditional private capital and will focus the attention of financial \ninstitutions and, in turn, their small business customers to the Y2K \nproblem.\n  This loan program is of vital importance and we must ensure that \nthere are sufficient funds to pay for it. Because the Y2K loan program \nwould be part of the existing 7(a) business loan program, funds that \nhave already been appropriated for the 7(a) program for fiscal year \n1999 may be used for the Y2K loan program. Nevertheless, I intend to \nwatch the 7(a) loan program carefully to determine whether the Y2K loan \nprogram will cause the 7(a) loan program to run short of funds. If the \nappropriated amount will not support the expected loan volume of the \ngeneral 7(a) loan program and the new Y2K loan program, I intend to \nwork with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to attempt to \nsecure additional funds targeted specifically for the Y2K loan program.\n  The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act is a necessary step to \nensure that the economic health of this country is not marred by a \nsubstantial number of small business failures following January 1, \n2000, and that small businesses continue to be the fastest growing \nsegment of our economy in the Year 2000 and beyond.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 314\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Year 2000 \n     Readiness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the failure of many computer programs to recognize the \n     Year 2000 may have extreme negative financial consequences in \n     the Year 2000, and in subsequent years for both large and \n     small businesses;\n       (2) small businesses are well behind larger businesses in \n     implementing corrective changes to their automated systems;\n       (3) many small businesses do not have access to capital to \n     fix mission critical automated systems, which could result in \n     severe financial distress or failure for small businesses; \n     and\n       (4) the failure of a large number of small businesses due \n     to the Year 2000 computer problem would have a highly \n     detrimental effect on the economy in the Year 2000 and in \n     subsequent years.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today I join my colleagues--Chairman \nBond of the Small Business Committee and Senators Bennett and Dodd of \nthe Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem--to introduce \na bill that provides affordable loans to small businesses preparing for \nor responding to the Year 2000 computer problem.\n  As Ranking Member of the Committee on Small Business, I believe it is \nin our economic best interest to make sure that our small businesses, \nsome 20 million if we include the self-employed, are still up and \nrunning, creating jobs and providing services, on and after January 1, \n2000.\n  Will the new year bring national ``hiccups'' or ``worldwide \nrecession''? It depends on who you ask. Peter de Jager, considered one \nof the first Year-2000 crusaders, believes there will be problems, but \nnot devastation. As published in the December 31, 1998 issue of \n``ITAA's (Information Technology Association of America) Year 2000 \nOutlook'': De Jager says ``a blackout across North America is \n`inconceivable' and power brown-outs, should they occur, will be \nlocalized.''\n  However, if you ask a particular senior executive at Barclays about \nthe millennium computer bug, his advice would be to sell your home, \nstockpile cash and buy gold in case of a global economic collapse. He \nand other international bank managers fear a run on deposits.\n  Because our economy is inter-dependent and most of our technology is \ndate-dependent, either scenario concerns me, particularly for small \nbusinesses. National surveys and conversations with Y2K consultants and \ncommercial lenders in Massachusetts tell a story that varies from \nignorance to denial to paralysis to apathy.\n  That's serious when you consider a 1998 Arthur Andersen Enterprise \nGroup and National Small Business United survey that found 94 percent \nof all small and mid-sized businesses have computers, and only 62 \npercent of all small and mid-sized businesses, regardless of whether \nthey rely on computers or date-dependent equipment, have ``begun \naddressing'' Y2K issues. The good news is that a greater percentage of \nsmall and mid-sized businesses are preparing for Y2K than last summer; \nthe bad news is that they've only ``begun'' and a significant group is \ntaking a wait-and-see approach.\n  And what about those who have been slow to act or have no plans to \nact? How do we reach them and facilitate assessment and remediation of \ntheir businesses? By making the solution affordable.\n  The Andersen and NSBU study showed that 54 percent of all respondents \nsaid ``affording the cost [was the] most difficult challenge in dealing \nwith information technology.'' Cost is a legitimate, albeit risky, \nreason to delay addressing the Y2K problem--saving till you're a little \nahead or waiting until the last possible moment to take on new debt to \nfinance changes are strategies many small businesses are forced to \nadopt.\n  Most of the media attention has been on big business, the challenges \nthey face and the costs they are bearing to fix the problem. Small \nbusinesses face the same effects of the Y2K problem as big businesses, \nbut, as the study found, they often have little or no resources to \ndevote to detecting the extent of the problem or developing a workable \nand cost-effective solution. If you own your facility, is the HVAC \n(Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system in compliance and how \nmuch will it cost to fix a system that serves 5,000 square feet? Does \nthe security system need an upgrade or to be replaced? If you own a dry \ncleaner and you hire a consultant to assess your equipment in your \nfranchise, will remediation eat all your profits or set you back? These \nare questions to which some business owners can't afford to hear the \nanswers. It may come down to a choice between debt or dissolution.\n  The Year 2000 Readiness Act gives eligible business owners a viable \noption. To make it easy for lenders and timely for borrowers, this Act, \nlike the Y2K small business loan bill I introduced last Congress, \nexpands the 7(a) loan program, one of the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration's most popular and successful guaranteed lending \nprograms.\n  Currently, the 7(a) program is intended to give small businesses \ncredit and capital, including working capital to grow their companies. \nIf the Year 2000 Readiness Act is enacted, that program could be used \nuntil the end of the year 2000 to address Y2K problems through \nassessment, planning, remediation and testing computers and equipment, \nor to provide relief for substantial economic injury a small business \nsuffers as a direct result of Y2K problems, such as a brown-out or a \ntemporarily incapacitated supplier.\n  The terms of 7(a) loans are familiar to lenders and small-business \nowners alike and, therefore, the loans are easy to apply for and \nprocess. They are structured to be approved or denied, in most cases, \nin less than 48 hours. We expect the average Y2K 7(a) loan to be less \nthan $100,000.\n  To give lenders an incentive to make 7(a) loans to small businesses \nfor Y2K problems and related economic injury, this Act raises the \ngovernment guaranties of the existing 7(a) program by ten percent. \nUnder special circumstances, it also raises the dollar cap of loan \nguaranties from $750,000 to $1 million for these Y2K small business \nloans.\n  For Y2K 7(a) loans of more than $100,000, the government will \nguarantee 85 percent, and for such loans of $100,000 or less, the \ngovernment will guarantee 90 percent. For those lenders with special \nauthority to approve their loans, this Act allows them to use the SBA \nExpress Pilot Program--a pilot that makes it easy for lenders to \nprocess loans worth up to $150,000 using their own paperwork and making \nsame-day approval--for Y2K loans. SBA Express loans are guaranteed at \n50 percent.\n  This legislation encourages lenders to work with small businesses \naddressing Y2K-related problems by arranging for affordable financing. \nWhen quality of credit comes into question, lenders are directed to \nresolve reasonable doubts about the applicant's ability to repay the \ndebt in favor of the borrower. And when appropriate, to establish a \nmoratorium for up to one year on principal payments on Y2K 7(a) loans, \nbeginning when the loans are originated.\n  To protect against fraud, abuse or double compensation, this Act \nprohibits a business from qualifying for a Y2K 7(a) loan if it has \nalready received insurance proceeds for Y2K problems or economic injury \nrelated to Y2K problems.\n  As important as this Y2K loan program is, it must be available in \naddition to, and not in lieu of, the existing 7(a) program. The 7(a) \nprogram is a vital capital source for small businesses, providing more \nthan 42,000 loans in 1998, totaling $9 billion. Nine hundred sixty-six \nof those loans went to small businesses in Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S1025]]\n\n With defaults down, recoveries up and the government's true cost, \ncalled the subsidy rate, at 1.39 percent, we should not create burdens \nthat would slow or reverse this trend. To protect the existing 7(a) \nprogram, we need to make sure that it is adequately funded for fiscal \nyears 1999 and 2000. Because the Y2K loan program would be part of the \nexisting 7(a) business loan program, funds that have already been \nappropriated for the 7(a) program may be used for the Y2K loan program. \nAs of two weeks past the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 1999, \nSBA's records show that the program has already used $2.5 billion \n(roughly 23 percent) of the total $10 billion appropriated. Typically \nthe demand for these loans increases by as much as ten percent in the \nspring and summer. If this holds true for this fiscal year, it is an \nindication that the program will need nearly all of its funds to meet \nthe regular loan demand.\n  Under these circumstances, we must be diligent about monitoring the \n7(a) loan program to make sure the Y2K loans don't drain the program \nand cause it to run out of money. If we do find that the appropriated \namount is inadequate to support the general 7(a) loan program and the \nnew Y2K loan program, we will need to get more funding. Though it's \nnever easy to get more money, Chairman Bond, who also serves on the \nCommittee on Appropriations and is chairman of one of the Appropriation \nsubcommittees, has agreed to attempt to secure additional funds \ntargeted specifically for the Y2K loan program. I thank Chairman Bond \nfor his commitment, and offer my help if the need arises.\n  I am hopeful that this legislation can be passed in the Small \nBusiness Committee and the full Senate as quickly as possible to begin \nassisting small businesses in need of this important initiative. This \nis a good program, which with adequate funding, will help many small \nbusinesses get a strong start in 2000 and the new millennium.\n Mr. DODD, Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupporting this very important legislation. Together with Senators \nBond, Kerry, and Bennett, I recognize the necessity of strengthening \nthe ability of America's small businesses to negotiate the complex \nchallenges related to the Year 2000 computer problem. This legislation \nis designed to assist the 14.5 million small businesses that may have \nY2K concerns. According to various studies, almost half of all of the \nsmall businesses in America are not ready to respond to the possible \neffects of the Y2K computer problem.\n  I would like to take a moment and thank Chairman Bond and Ranking \nMember John Kerry of the Small Business Committee for their leadership \nand cooperation with the Special Committee on the Year 2000, on which I \nserve as Vice-Chair. The object of this cooperation between our two \nCommittees is to strengthen the economic backbone of America, small \nbusinesses, as they face a potentially devastating threat to their very \nexistence. This is not to alarm anyone, but merely to warn of a \npossible danger. As I have said on numerous occasions, I believe very \nstrongly that we must prepare and plan for any Y2K contingency. We must \nbe vigilant and provide assistance for small businesses. Unfortunately, \nmany small businesses do not consider themselves in danger from the \neffects of the Y2K problem and so have taken little, if any, steps to \naddress problems that may arise. This extends to reviewing whether all \nof their suppliers, customers and financial institutions are free from \nthe Y2K glitch. Even if our small enterprises were aware of all \nproblems that face them, not all of them have access to the necessary \nfunds to take corrective measures.\n  This legislation helps our nation's small enterprises in two ways. \nFirst, if a company wants to remediate or fix its own equipment that is \nnot Y2K compliant, this bill provides easier access to loans. \nHopefully, this will encourage the small business owners to learn of \ntheir companies deficiencies, and then correct them in a timely manner \nso that company does not stop working.\n  Second, if a company faces economic disruption due to outside Y2K \nrelated problems, then that company may apply for funds to assist it. \nThis is the area to which I am especially sensitive. We do not know \nexactly what will work and what will need immediate attention so that \nour lives, our jobs, our economic well being, can continue. To address \nthat lack of knowledge, this bill will allow small business owners \naccess to financial support guaranteed by the Small Business \nAdministration until December 31, 2000. This is very important. Our \nconcern is not just January 1, 2000, but the continual smooth operation \nof our nation and our nation's small businesses throughout this \nmomentous year.\n  Less than one-third of small businesses have checked the Y2K \npreparedness of the companies that they depend upon to continue to \nfunction everyday. Though only half of the small businesses in America \nclassify themselves as dependent upon computers, many of the small \nbusinesses in America are dependent on other businesses, which are \ndependent upon computers. Like a cog in the wheel of our nation's \neconomy, if one small business suddenly ceases to function, its effects \nmay be felt across the country. That is why I am glad to support this \nlegislation to assist the United States small business community.\n  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We must help our \nnation's small businesses regardless of when they become aware of the \nproblems facing them. This legislation is designed to do exactly \nthat.\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Chairman \nand Ranking Members of the Committee on Small Business and the Special \nCommittee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem--Christopher S. Bond, \nJohn F. Kerry, Robert F. Bennett, and Christopher J. Dodd,--and Senator \nOlympia Snowe--in introducing the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness \nAct. I began warning about the Y2K problem three years ago. Since that \ntime, people have begun to listen and progress has been made on the Y2K \nfront. The Federal Government and large corporations are expected to \nhave their computers functioning on January 1, 2000. Good news indeed. \nBut small businesses and state and local governments are lagging behind \nin fixing the millennium computer problem.\n  Last week, Chairman Bennett, Senator Dodd, and I introduced the Y2K \nState and Local Government Assistance Programs Act of 1999. This bill \nprovides a matching grant for states to work on the millennium computer \nproblem. Failure of state computers could have a devastating effect on \nthose individuals who rely on essential state-administered poverty \nprograms, such as Medicaid, food stamps, and child welfare and support. \nThese individuals cannot go a day, a week, or a month if these programs \nare not working properly. Similarly, the collapse of small businesses' \ncomputer systems could have the same paralyzing effect on society as a \ncollapse of state and local government's computer systems.\n  The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, which we are introducing \ntoday, will assist small businesses in preparing for the year 2000. It \nexpands the Small Business Administration's 7(a) loan program to \nprovide guaranteed loans to small businesses to address the Y2K \nproblem. This bill raises the government guaranties of the existing \n7(a) program by ten percent. For Y2K 7(a) loans of more than $100,000, \nthe government will guarantee 85 percent, and for such loans of \n$100,000 or less, the government will guarantee 90 percent. The \nincrease in the loan guarantee is to encourage lenders to make Y2K-\nrelated loans to small businesses. And the numbers show that small \nbusinesses need a great deal of assistance.\n  A Wells Fargo Bank survey in December of 1998 found that ``Y2K is not \na priority for most small business owners and for as many as one-third \nof all owners who are vulnerable to the millennium bug, it is not a \npriority.'' The report goes on to say that ``it is likely that over one \nmillion small employers, and perhaps as high as 1.5 million, exposed to \nthe Y2K problem will enter the next century having taken no preventive \nmeasures.'' The GartnerGroup found that as of the third quarter of \n1998, small companies have just five percent of their computers \nremediated, and only 30 percent of small businesses have begun testing. \nThe GartnerGroup expects that 50 percent to 60 percent of small \ncompanies will experience at least one mission critical system failure. \nWe must not let this happen.\n  Historically the fin de siecle has caused quite a stir. Prophets, \nprelates,\n\n[[Page S1026]]\n\nmonks, mathematicians, and soothsayers warn Anno Domini 2000 will draw \nthe world to its catastrophic conclusion. I am confident that the Y2K \nproblem will not play a part in this. But we must continue to work on \nthis problem with purpose and dedication. Benjamin Disraeli wrote: \n``Man is not the creature of circumstances. Circumstances are the \ncreatures of men.'' We created the Y2K problem and we must fix it. \n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bond, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Burns, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Grams, Mr. Hagel, and \n        Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 315. A bill to amend the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to require \nthe President to report to Congress on any selective embargo on \nagricultural commodities, to provide a termination date for the \nembargo, to provide greater assurances for contract sanctity, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-sponsor of a \nbill that I envision as just one piece in Congressional efforts to \ncorrect the inequitable treatment our Federal government forces on our \nnation's farmers. How many times do we need to impress upon this \nAdministration that agriculture is a foundation for our economy? \nAgriculture producers are at the beginning of the food chain--they \nprovide the food that feeds our nation and we, as American consumers of \nthese products, enjoy the world's best food distribution system in the \nworld.\n  This bill, the Selective Agriculture Embargoes Act of 1999, requires \nthe President to report to Congress on any selective embargo on \nagricultural commodities and also provides a termination date for the \nembargo. In the past, we've seen this Administration take steps to \nsanction a foreign country in an attempt to coerce that country's \npolicy or behavior. I question the effectiveness of these measures in \ntoday's global environment--what may have worked forty years ago may \nnot be today's solution.\n  The Administration's use of this negotiating tool has an economic \nimpact, not only on the country being sanctioned, but also on the rest \nof the global economy. And that is the important issue--not what we are \ntrying to accomplish with the sanction, but what impact such actions \nare having on other nations' exporters at the expense of America's \nexporters.\n  In Montana, and other states that rely on farmers and ranchers to \nfuel our nation's economy, the sanctioning process has a very \nsubstantial impact. Last year, Congress recognized an embargo on \nPakistan based on it's nuclear policies was a bad policy decision and \ncorrected the Administration's policy. Pakistan was recently ranked as \nthe fifth largest importer of United States wheat and in recent years \nhas emerged as the single largest buyer of soft wheat from the United \nStates.\n  Think about the impact on our producers when you reduce United States \nwheat exports by 1.7 million metric tons and that's just to Pakistan \nalone.\n  Let's back up a little bit and talk about what has happened to farm \nexports, and especially to farmers in the Northwest. We need to keep in \nmind the global economy has helped to bring U.S. agriculture to it's \nknees over the past couple of years and in very short period of time.\n  I am overwhelmed to think that the financial collapse of the \neconomies in Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea could \nput a farmer in Shelby, Montana out of business. But that's the reality \nof this situation--we are so tied into the global economy that every \nforeign policy decision made has an impact on our domestic economy. \nThat's a powerful notion, but again, it's a reality. If you don't \nbelieve me, go talk to my farming friends in Montana.\n  Prior to the plague of the Asian flu, I was very convinced that you \ncannot let the economies in four major importing countries of \nagricultural products cave in and it not affect this country. Sadly, I \nwas correct. So our exports to that part of the world have decreased \ndramatically. Then the President came along with sanctions.\n  Let me tell you a little about sanctions. I have never been convinced \nthat sanctions on agriculture commodities really work. I will tell you \nin an instant that if we unilaterally sanction a country on American \nagricultural exports, the following will occur: that country is still \ncapable of buying a supply from somebody else in the world. However, \nthe market is aware of these sanctions; therefore, the rest of the \nworld maybe increases the price per bushel of wheat by 1 or 2 cents. \nNow, 1 or 2 cents doesn't sound like a lot for a bushel of wheat that \nweighs 60 pounds, but when you're buying 300,000 metric tons, it is a \nlot of money. To the farmer, it is the difference between making the \nland payment and not making the land payment--that's the value of 2 \ncents a bushel.\n  Once that sale is made to the country that we have sanctioned, other \nwheat exporting nations pour the rest of their crop on the world \nmarket. So our farmers compete for fewer markets at a lesser price. \nThat is not right. Sanctions do not deny a country of a food supply for \nthe people who live there, but it has denied our farmers entry into the \nmarketplace a place to compete.\n  In the last 4 years the United States has imposed 61 unilateral \neconomic sanctions on 35 countries containing 40 percent of the world's \npopulation. Now, what action does that country take in reaction to the \nsanction? It retaliates: I am not going to buy American products at any \nprice.\n  So, in essence, we have denied our grain producers access to that \nmarket to even be considered to compete. We are talking about food \nhere--I realize that to some folks that is not very important--until it \ncomes suppertime. But to a farmer who only gets one or two paychecks a \nyear, that is how he makes his payment on his operation, his \nfertilizer, his machinery, his land payment. It contributes to his \ncommunity, his county, his state and his nation.\n  U.S. farmers have developed export markets because of two factors: \nquantity and reliability. We are a reliable trade partner. We approach \ntrade policy from a free market perspective--we compete against \nsubsidized grain from many of the world's major exporters. We don't \npool our wheat and we don't sell our wheat on the international market \nby a decision made by Government.\n  So I ask my colleagues to support this bill and support the American \nfarmer and, in turn, support the U.S. economy.\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President I rise today in support of this \nmeasure which will inject some much-needed common-sense into our \nnation's agricultural trade policy. This measure amends the \nAgricultural Trade Act of 1978 and restricts the President's ability to \nsingle out agriculture when foreign embargoes are imposed.\n  Food is basic humanitarian need and should not be included in \neconomic embargoes or sanctions imposed by the United States. Our \nrelationships with other nations must not be held captive to one issue. \nBut our relationships with other nations are complicated. They include \ntrade and commerce. They include U.S. interests abroad, national \ndefense, human rights, and humanitarian efforts. But we must not allow \none dynamic of our relationship with all other nations on this globe to \nbe held captive to just one issue.\n  Trade and U.S. agriculture are virtually indistinguishable. The \nSoviet grain embargo of 1976 cost the U.S. $2.3 billion in lost farm \nexports and USDA compensation to farmers. When the U.S. cut off sales \nof wheat to protest Soviet invasion of Afghanistan--France, Canada, \nAustralia, and Argentina stepped in to claim this market and the former \nSoviet states have been timid buyers of U.S. farm products ever since.\n  In recent months, Nebraska farmers, on many occasions, discussing the \nnegative effects of the Carter grain embargo and many fear that a \nsimilar action could happen again. With more focus on sanctions and \nforeign policy, an anti-agriculture embargo measure is timely.\n  History has shown, Mr. President, that trade and commerce engagement \nin reaching out does more to change attitudes and alter behavior than \nany one thing. Why? It improves diets; it improve standards of living; \nit opens society; it exposes people who have lived under totalitarian \nrule, who have had limited exposure to freedom, to liberty, to economic \nfreedom, products, choice, consumerism. That is what\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\ntrade does. Not one among us believes that just trade alone is all we \nneed. But it is an important, integral part of our relationships around \nthe world.\n  We live in a very dynamic time. The light of change today in the \nworld is unprecedented in modern history, and maybe all of history. \nFood, fiber, and trade are common denominators of mutual interests of \nall the peoples of the world.\n  We must not isolate ourselves. Trade embargoes isolate those who \nimpose trade embargoes. We need dynamic policies for dynamic times. The \nworld is not static.\n  This is a strong step forward. This is the beginning of the larger \ndebate that this Congress will have and must have about the role of the \nUnited States in the world and how we intend to engage the world, and \ntrade is a very important part of that.\n  Embargoes and sanctions without the support of our allies only hurt \nus. From a foreign policy perspective, embargoes rarely achieve their \ngoal. Their real harm is on U.S. agricultural producers. It's estimated \nthat sanctions and embargoes cost the U.S. economy more than $20 \nbillion each year. We have got to bring some common sense to our trade \npolicy.\n  American agriculture and the U.S. government must send a strong \nmessage to our many customers and our competitors. U.S. farmers, \nranchers, and agribusinesses are a consistent and reliable supplier of \nquality and plentiful agricultural products. Support of the \nAgriculture-Specific Embargo Act will send a strong message that U.S. \nagriculture will be once again considered a reliable supplier of food \nand fiber around the globe.\n   Mr. President, I am very proud to join my friends and colleagues who \nhave worked on these issues diligently, who will continue to provide \nleadership, not just to this body but to the country, to the world, and \nto our farmers and our ranchers, our producers, and our citizens.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this very important \nmeasure. Again, I say to my colleagues that this is an engagement we \nmust be a part of today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 316. A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to improve the availability of child care and development \nservices during periods outside normal school hours, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                        america after school act\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senators Mikulski, \nWellstone, Kerry, and I are introducing the America After School Act. \nWith this legislation, the nation can do much more to provide the care \nand activities that children need when they are not in school.\n  Over 17 million parents rely on others to care for their children \nbefore and after the school bell rings each day. Over 5 million \nchildren are left home alone after school. The need for responsible \nafter-school activities is urgent. Hundreds of thousands of families \nare on waiting lists across the country for such programs.\n  Today's students deserve the best and brightest future possible. \nAfter school programs provide a unique opportunity to help to meet this \nchallenge. Tutoring, mentoring, recreational, and cultural activities \nare all key components of strong, stimulating after school programs. \nThese activities can help young men and women strengthen their computer \nskills, explore prospective careers, learn about the arts, and develop \ntheir physical fitness. They are an investment in education, children, \nand our future.\n  After school programs help reduce crime. Police across the nation \nreport that juvenile delinquency peaks between 3 and 8 p.m. each day. \nWe know that unsupervised children are more likely to engage in \ndestructive behavior. Effective after school programs help keep young \npeople off the streets, away from gangs, and out of trouble. All \nchildren deserve a safe and productive environment in which to spend \ntheir time out of school.\n  Parents want safe, effective after school programs for their \nchildren, and this legislation helps meet that need. The legislation \nsignificantly expands after school care for low-income families by \nincreasing the Child Care and Development Block Grant. Title I of the \nbill, authorizes a $3 billion increase in such grants over the next 5 \nyears. With this higher level of investment, we can reduce waiting \nlists and provide after school care to hundreds of thousands of \nadditional children from low-income working families. Communities with \nhigh concentrations of poverty and at-risk youth will receive priority \nfor this funding, so that the help will be available where it is needed \nmost. The needs of children with disabilities are also specifically \naddressed.\n  After school programs should challenge children, stimulate their \ncuriosity, and enhance their creativity. We get what we pay for. On the \naverage, child care providers earn less than bus drivers and garbage \ncollectors. We need stronger incentives to develop and retain skilled \nchild care providers. Our bill designates 25 percent of the increase \nfor indirect services that include salary incentives for training care \ngivers.\n  Our bill also strengthens and expands the 21st Century Learning \nCenters program. In the last Congress, we provided $200 million to \nexpand this worthwhile program and increase after school programs to \nserve up to a half million more children. This action was an important \nstep forward--but even with this increase, a tremendous need remains.\n  To address this problem, President Clinton has proposed to triple the \nfederal investment in these centers: The additional funds will ensure \nthat one million more youths will be in safe, effective after school \ncare. Our America After School Act builds on this momentum. By \nstrengthening the 21st Century Learning Centers program, we will \nprovide greater opportunities for hundreds of thousands more children \nand their families. This additional funding will support mentoring \nprograms, academic assistance programs, and drug, alcohol, and gang \nprevention activities.\n  Title III of this bill provides $1.25 billion over the next five \nyears to expand grants by the Justice Department for after-school \nprograms to prevent juvenile delinquency. Both public and private \nagencies will be eligible to apply for these grants, and awards will be \nmade on a matching basis. To maximize its effectiveness, recipients \nmust coordinate their efforts with state and local law enforcement \nofficials. After school educational and recreational programs in high \ncrime neighborhoods will receive priority, since children in these \nneighborhoods face the highest risk.\n  We must do all we can to prepare students for the future. Providing \nsafe and worthwhile afterschool activities is an essential part of \nachieving this goal.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Stevens and \nSenator Dodd: George Santayana stated, ``Those who disregard the \nlessons of history are bound to repeat them.'' The United States Senate \nis too politically charged and it would be more so were it not for the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Robert C. Byrd. A couple of \nweeks ago the Senate was about to go over the precipice of \npartisanship. Fortunately, we agreed to have an off-the-record session \nof all Senators. That alone would not have prevented our reckless \ncourse, but it did give all Senators an opportunity to hear Senator \nByrd at his finest hour. He commenced by thanking Senator Daniel Akaka \nfor leading us in prayer, harkening the time Benjamin Franklin took to \nthe floor of the Continental Convention to call on divine guidance for \ncooperation and bipartisanship. Then Senator Byrd continued to calm \npartisan zeal and give us all a sense of historic perspective. We \nstarted talking sense instead of politics. It got us together. We could \nhave gone the way of the House, but Senator Byrd is the one who put us \non the right path. In appreciation for his leadership, we think the \ncountry could benefit by reading Senator Byrd's comments. I ask that \nthe full text of Senator Byrd's remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n  Remarks of Senator Robert C. Byrd--Bipartisan Conference in the Old \n                       Senate Chamber, January 8\n\n       My colleagues, I thank the Majority Leader and the Minority \n     Leader for bringing us together in this joint caucus. Mr. \n     Daschle asked me last evening to be prepared to speak this \n     morning following the remarks of the two leaders. I am \n     flattered and honored to do so. Having a proclivity to speak \n     at length on subjects that are close to my heart and about \n     which I feel deeply, I have taken the precaution this morning \n     to prepare some remarks in order that I might present them in \n     an organized fashion and thus avoid speaking as long as I \n     might otherwise be wont to do. I shall, however, add some \n     extemporaneous remarks as the spirit of the occasion leads \n     me.\n       Before proceeding with the thoughts that I have put in \n     writing, I wish to remind ourselves that we do, indeed, have \n     not only the standing rules of the Senate, but we also have \n     the standing rules for our guidance in impeachment trials. \n     This bound copy of rules governing impeachment trials that I \n     hold in my hand was published in 1986 as a result of a \n     resolution which former Senator Robert Dole and I offered for \n     referral to the Rules Committee, at which time we called on \n     that Committee to update and provide any proposed \n     modifications or revisions to the rules that had been in \n     existence from the year 1868 when the impeachment trial of \n     President Andrew Johnson took place.\n       The rules which the Senate approved in 1986 were followed \n     during the impeachment trials of the three Federal judges: \n     Claiborne, Hastings, and Walter Nixon. In listening to some \n     of the comments on television last evening, I noted that when \n     news reporters interviewed tourists, those visitors to this \n     city were under the impression that the Senate was proceeding \n     into a trial without any rules for guidance. Some of the \n     representatives of the news media were also under this \n     mistaken impression. I am concerned about the public \n     perception that we are proceeding to a trial without any \n     rules to guide us. Therefore, I trust that we will all make \n     it clear as we work with the press that the Senate, indeed, \n     has a set of standing rules to guide us in this trial.\n       Before I begin my prepared remarks, I wish to thank the \n     Majority Leader and the Minority Leader for calling on \n     Senator Akaka to deliver prayer. They chose the right Senator \n     to lead us in prayer, and I thank Danny. His prayer set just \n     the right tone and the right spirit for his occasion. In the \n     midst of Danny's prayer, I recalled that day which came \n     during the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, when \n     the Framers were encountering difficult problems, and their \n     spirits were at a low ebb. There was dissension and \n     divisiveness, and their hopes for success in achieving their \n     goal were fading. Things seemed to be falling apart. Their \n     dreams of fashioning a new Constitution--the Articles of \n     Confederation being our first national Constitution--appeared \n     to be growing dim. The new Ship of State which they hoped to \n     launch was floundering in troubled waters with rocks and \n     shoals upon every hand. Dark clouds of despair were closing \n     in upon them, and the Framers were brought face-to-face with \n     the stark possibility of failure.\n       It was then, at that fateful moment, that the oldest man at \n     the Convention, Benjamin Franklin, stood to his feet and \n     addressed the chair in which sat General George Washington: \n     ``Sir, I have lived a long time, and the longer I live the \n     more convincing proofs I see that God still governs in the \n     affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground \n     without our Father's notice, is it probable that we can build \n     an empire without our Father's aid? We have been assured, \n     sir, in the sacred writings, that, `Except the Lord build the \n     house, they labor in vain that build it; except the Lord keep \n     the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.' I firmly believe \n     this; and I also believe that without our Father's aid, we \n     shall succeed in this political building no better than did \n     the builders of Babel. I, therefore, beg leave, sir, to move \n     that, henceforth, prayers imploring the assistance of heaven \n     and its blessings on our deliberations be held in this \n     assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and \n     that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to \n     officiate in that service.''\n       Franklin's motion was seconded by Mr. Sherman.\n       My colleagues, let us proceed in these deliberations this \n     morning in a spirit of prayerfulness and cooperation and \n     bipartisanship, and see if we, too, in our generation may \n     produce something worthy of being remembered.\n       I speak from the viewpoint of having a long and varied \n     experience in legislative bodies. I was born during the \n     Woodrow Wilson Administration. I was sworn in as a new member \n     of the House of Representatives during the final days of the \n     Truman Administration. He is my favorite Democratic President \n     in my lifetime. I having been sworn in as a new member of \n     Congress in January 1953, I have served longer in Congress \n     than has any man or woman in either House of Congress today. \n     Dizzy Dean said that it is alright to brag if you've done it. \n     Well I have done it! No member of Congress in either House \n     today was here when I first became a member 46 years ago.\n       I also try to take the long view of the history that is yet \n     before us. This country has a long history ahead of it, and \n     the things we do here, the service we perform, our words and \n     our deeds will be long remembered and long recorded.\n       As we proceed to the unpleasant task that awaits us in the \n     days ahead, let us remember that this is not a trial in a \n     court of law. It is not a criminal trial. It is a political \n     trial. The Nation will be watching us, and I implore us all \n     to conduct ourselves in a way that will bring honor to this \n     body. I view the immediate future with considerable dread. \n     There is a poison in the air, and it is not the flu virus, \n     and there is no antibiotic that can be prescribed for it. \n     It is a bitter political partisanship, and if we let it \n     control us in the impeachment trial, we will find it to be \n     lethal, and we will die together.\n       From time to time there occur events which rise above the \n     everyday, and sorely test the leaders of men and the \n     institutions they create.\n       This is such a time. For it is not only William Jefferson \n     Clinton who is on trial. It is this August body and all of us \n     who carry the title of Senator.\n       The White House has sullied itself. The House of \n     Representatives has fallen into the black pit of partisan \n     self-indulgence. The Senate is teetering on the brink of that \n     same black pit.\n       Meanwhile, the American people look in vain for the order \n     and leadership promised to them by the Constitution. Of one \n     thing I am sure: the public trust in all of the institutions \n     of government has severely suffered.\n       Senators, this is the headline, I had so hoped we could \n     avoid. I have in my hand this morning's Washington Times \n     bearing the headline: ``Trial Opens Amid Pomp, \n     Partisanship.'' It is the word ``partisanship'' that is \n     troubling.\n       Any of you who have read your mail or the phoned-in \n     comments from your constituents knows that the anger and \n     disappointment is only growing in intensity with each day \n     that we prolong this painful ordeal.\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\n       I have always believed that whatever the crisis and \n     whatever the age, the Senate would always attract and produce \n     men and women of the quality and character needed to step up \n     and calm the angry and dangerous seas which might threaten \n     the Ship of State, and dash it on the rocks and shoals.\n       I still believe that. I still believe that the Senate can \n     restore some order to the anger which has overtaken this \n     country and the chaos which threatens this city. I believe in \n     all of you. I believe that all of the courage and conviction \n     needed to handle any crisis is present right in this room.\n       But, at this moment, we look very bad. We appear to be \n     dithering and posturing and slowly disintegrating into the \n     political quicksand. And it is no fault of our leaders. Our \n     two leaders have done their level best to get us started \n     toward lancing this inflamed boil in an honorable and orderly \n     way. Left alone, without all of us to contend with, they \n     would have worked these arrangements out long ago.\n       Of course, I am very fond and proud of my own Leader, Tom \n     Daschle. But, may I say to my Republican friends that I am \n     also very fond and proud of our Majority Leader, Mr. Lott. \n     However, I have been a Majority Leader in this body, and I \n     know too well who gets the blame when important matters \n     flounder in the Senate. It is the Majority Leader and, to a \n     lesser degree, the Minority Leader. And when that happens, \n     neither party looks good.\n       I feel it to be appropriate at this point to digress from \n     my prepared statement and bring to your recollection \n     Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales,'' and I shall refer to the \n     ``Pardoner's Tale,'' which most, if not all, of you will \n     remember having read in your school days. The setting took \n     place in Flanders, where, once, there sat drinking in a \n     tavern three young men who were given to folly. As they sat, \n     they heard a small bell clink before a corpse being carried \n     to the grave, whereupon, one of them called to his knave and \n     ordered him to go and find out the name of the corpse that \n     was passing by.\n       The boy answered that he already knew, and that it was an \n     old comrade of the roisterers who had been slain while drunk \n     by an unseen thief called Death, who had slain others in \n     recent days.\n       Out into the road the three young ruffians went in search \n     of this monster called death. They came upon an old man, and \n     seized him and with rough language demanded that he tell them \n     where they could find this cowardly adversary who was taking \n     the lives of their good friends in the countryside.\n       The old man pointed to a great oak tree on a nearby knoll, \n     saying, ``There, under that tree, you will find Death.'' In a \n     drunken rage, the three roisterers set off in a run 'til they \n     came to the tree, and there they found a pile of gold--eight \n     basketfuls, of florins, newly minted, round coins. Forgotten \n     was the monster called Death, as they pondered their good \n     fortune, and they decided that they should remain with the \n     gold until nightfall when they would divide it among \n     themselves and take it to their homes. It would be unsafe, \n     they thought, to attempt to do so in broad daylight, as they \n     might be fallen upon by thieves who would take their treasure \n     from them.\n       It was proposed that they draw straws, and the person who \n     drew the shortest cut would go into the nearby village and \n     purchase some bread and wine which they could enjoy as they \n     whiled away the daylight hours. Off towards the village the \n     young man went. When he was out of sight, the remaining two \n     decided that there was no good reason why this fortune \n     should be divided among three individuals, so one of them \n     said to the other: ``When he returns, you throw your arm \n     around him as if in jest, and I will rive him with my \n     dagger. And, with your dagger, you can do the same. Then, \n     all of this gold will be divided just between you and \n     me.''\n       Meanwhile, the youngest rouge, as he made its way into the \n     town, thought what a shame it was that the gold would be \n     divided among three, when it could so easily belong only to \n     the ownership of one. Therefore, in town, the young man went \n     directly to an apothecary and asked to be sold some poison \n     for large rats and for a polecat that had been killing his \n     chickens. The apothecary quickly provided some poison, saying \n     that as much as equalled only a grain of wheat would result \n     in sudden death for the creature that drank the mixture.\n       Having purchased the poison, the young villain crossed the \n     street to a winery where he purchased three bottles--two for \n     his friends, one for himself. After he left the village, he \n     sat down, opened two bottles and deposited an equal portion \n     in each, and then returned to the oak tree, where the two \n     older men did as they had planned. One threw his arm \n     playfully around the shoulders of the third, they buried \n     their daggers in him, and he fell dead on the pile of gold. \n     The other two then sat down, cut the bread and opened the \n     wine. Each took a good, deep swallow, and, suffering a most \n     excruciating pain, both fell upon the body of the third, \n     across the pile of gold. All three were dead.\n       Their avarice, their greed for gain had destroyed them. \n     There is a lesson here. The strong temptation for political \n     partisanship can tear the Senate apart, and can tear the \n     Nation apart, and confront all of us with destruction.\n       I ask everyone here who might be tempted, to step back from \n     the brink of political gamesmanship. I ask everyone here who \n     might harbor such feelings to abandon any thought of mean-\n     spirted, destructive, vengeful, partisan warfare. It is easy \n     to get caught up in the poison of bitter, self-consuming \n     partisanship when faced with such situations as the one which \n     confronts us now.\n       Witnesses are the main sticking point. I try to put myself \n     in the shoes of our GOP friends. At least 13 House members \n     are pushing you.\n       They had the opportunity to call witnesses but didn't. I \n     watched all House proceedings. It seems to me that with such \n     a mass of evidence, nothing new will be added. We must avoid \n     a repetition of what the House has just gone through.\n       I urge all of us to step back and think about it. What can \n     possibly be served in this unique court of impeachment by \n     having a repeat of what we have already seen?\n       I implore us all to endeavor to lift our eyes to higher \n     things. We can perform some much needed healing on the body \n     politic. We can start by disdaining any more of the salacious \n     muck which has already soiled the gowns of too many. If we \n     can come together in a dignified way to orderly and \n     expeditiously dispose of this matter, then perhaps we can yet \n     salvage a bit of respect and trust from the American people \n     for all of us, for the Senate, and for their institutions of \n     government.\n       There have been only 1,851 Senators from the beginning of \n     this Republic, and that includes all of us. We have a duty at \n     this critical time to rise above politics-as-usual, in which \n     we eat one another and, in so doing, eat ourselves. Let us \n     put the nation first. The American people want us to do that. \n     In the long run, that is how we will be judged, and, more \n     importantly, it is how the Senate will be judged. The \n     Constitution makes no reference to political party. The \n     constitutional provision concerning impeachment makes no \n     mention of political party. There were no political parties \n     at the time the Constitution was written.\n       When this is all over and this matter is behind us--and \n     that time will surely come--then we can be politically \n     partisan if we wish, as various legislative matters come \n     before us. That is all in the natural course of things. \n     Republicans and Democrats can go at each others throats \n     politically if that is what they desire. But this is not a \n     time for political partisanship. We will be sitting in \n     judgment of a President. And we should be guided by our oath \n     that, in all things appertaining to the trial of William \n     Jefferson Clinton, we shall do impartial justice according to \n     the Constitution and the laws.\n       Let us be guided by higher motives, by what is best for the \n     Republic, and by how future history will judge us. We need a \n     surer foundation than political partisanship, and that sure \n     foundation is the Constitution.\n       The Senate was the preeminent spark of genius by the \n     Framers. It was here that passions would be cooled. The \n     Senate would be the stabilizing element when confronted with \n     the storms of political frenzy and the silent arts of \n     corruption.\n       Let us be true to the faith of our fathers and to the \n     expectations of those who founded this Republic. The coming \n     days will test us. Let us go forward together, hoping that in \n     the end, the Senate will be perceived as having stood the \n     test. And may we--both Republicans and Democrats--when our \n     work is done, be judged by the American people and by the \n     pages of future history as having done our duty and done it \n     well. Our supreme duty is not to any particular person or \n     party, but to the people of the Nation and to the future of \n     this Republic.\n       It is in this spirit that we may do well to remember the \n     words of Benjamin Hill, a great United States Senator from \n     the State of Georgia, inscribed, as they are, upon his \n     monument:\n\n     Who saves his country\n     Saves all things,\n     Saves himself\n         and all things saved do bless him.\n\n     Who lets his country die\n     Let's all things die,\n     Dies himself ignobly,\n     And all things dying curse him.\n\n       Thank you, my friends, thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/27/senate-section/article/S1028-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1029-S1030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MOTION TO DISMISS ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST WILLIAM JEFFERSON \n                                CLINTON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the motion \noffered in the Court of Impeachment to dismiss the Articles of \nImpeachment against President Clinton. To support the motion would \nundermine the precedents and history of the impeachment process laid \nout in the Constitution. To my knowledge, the only instances in our \nhistory that the Senate has dismissed a Resolution of Impeachment \nwithout voting up or down on at least one of the Articles sent over by \nthe House was when the impeached officer resigned before the Senate had \nthe opportunity to act. I do not think we should deviate from our \nprecedents on this occasion.\n  In voting on the motion to dismiss, we are supposed to assume that \neven if the President did everything the House claims he did, we should \nstill dismiss the Articles. So for purposes of this motion, we have to \nassume that he committed every act of obstruction of justice and \nwitness tampering the House has claimed and every instance of perjury \nbefore the grand jury that the House claims.

Mr. President, each Member of the Senate is \nobligated today to render a judgment, a profound judgment, about the \nconduct of President William Jefferson Clinton and the call of the \nHouse of Representatives to remove him from office. A motion to dismiss \nthe two articles of impeachment lodged against the President has been \nput before us, and so we must now determine whether there are \nsufficient grounds to continue with the impeachment trial, or whether \nwe know enough to reach a conclusion and end these proceedings.\n  I know enough from the record the House forwarded to us and the \npublic record to reach certain conclusions about the President's \nconduct. President Clinton had an extramarital sexual relationship with \na young White House employee, which, though consensual, was reckless \nand immoral, and thus raised a series of questions about his judgment \nand his respect for the office. He then made false and misleading \nstatements about that relationship to the American people, to a Federal \ndistrict court judge in a civil deposition, and to a Federal grand \njury; in so doing, he betrayed not only his family but the public's \ntrust, and undermined his public credibility.\n  But the judgment we must now make is not about the rightness or \nwrongness of the President's relationship with Monica Lewinsky and his \nefforts to conceal it. Nor is that judgment about whether the President \nis guilty of committing a specific crime. That may be determined by a \ncriminal court, which the Senate clearly is not, after he leaves \noffice.\n  The question before us now is whether the President's wrongdoing--as \noutlined in the two articles of impeachment--was more than \nreprehensible, more than harmful, and in this case, more than strictly \ncriminal. We must now decide whether the President's wrongdoing makes \nhis continuance in office a threat to our government, our people, and \nthe national interest. That to me is the extraordinarily high bar the \nFramers set for removal of a duly-elected President, and it is that \nstandard we must apply to the facts to determine whether the President \nis guilty of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''\n  This trial has now proceeded for 10 session days. Each side has had \nample opportunity to present its case, illuminating the voluminous \nrecord from the House, and we Senators have been able to ask wide-\nranging questions of both parties. I have listened intently throughout, \nand both the House Managers and the counsel for the President have been \nvery impressive. The House Managers, for their part, have presented the \nfacts and argued the Constitution so effectively that they impelled me \nmore than once to seriously consider voting for removal.\n  But after much reflection and review of the extensive evidence before \nus, of the meaning of high crimes and misdemeanors, and, most \nimportantly, of what I believe to be in the best interests of the \nnation, I have concluded that the facts do not meet the high standard \nthe Founders established and do not justify removing this President \nfrom office.\n  It was for this reason that I decided today to vote in favor of \ndismissing the articles of impeachment against President Clinton, and \nagainst the motion to allow for the testimony of live witnesses. I plan \nto submit a more detailed statement explaining exactly how I arrived at \nthese decisions when the final votes are taken on the articles of \nimpeachment. But I do think it is important at this point to summarize \nmy arguments for voting to end the trial now.\n  I start from the indisputable premise that the Founders intended \nimpeachment to be a measure of extreme last resort, because it would \ndisrupt the democratic process they so carefully calibrated and would \nsupersede the right of the people to choose their leaders, which was at \nthe heart of their vision of the new democracy they were creating. That \nis why I believe that the Constitutional standard in question here--\n``high Crimes and Misdemeanors''--demands clear and convincing evidence \nthat the President committed offenses that, to borrow from the words of \nAlexander Hamilton and James Madison respectively, proceed from ``the \nabuse or violation of some public trust,'' and that demonstrate a \n``loss of capacity or corruption.'' A review of the constitutional \nhistory convinces me that impeachment was not meant to supplant the \ncriminal justice system but to provide a political remedy for offenses \nso egregious and damaging that the President can no longer be trusted \nto serve the national interest.\n\n  The House Managers therefore had the burden of proving in a clear and \nconvincing way that the behavior on which the articles of impeachment \nare based has irreparably compromised the President's capacity to \ngovern in the nation's best interest. I conclude that, as unsettling as \ntheir arguments have been, they have not met that burden.\n  I base that conclusion in part on the factual context of the \nPresident's actions. As the record makes abundantly clear, the \nPresident's false and misleading statements under oath and his broader \ndeception and cover-up stemmed directly from his private sexual \nmisconduct, something that no other sitting American president to my \nknowledge has ever been questioned about in a legal setting. On each \noccasion when I came close to the brink of deciding to vote for one of \nthe articles of impeachment, I invariably came back to this question of \ncontext and asked myself: does this sordid story justify, for the first \ntime in our nation's history, taking out of office the person the \nAmerican people chose to lead the country? Each time I answered, \n``no.''\n  The record shows that the President was not trying to conceal public \nmalfeasance or some heinous crime, like murder, and I believe that \ndistinction, while not determinative, does matter. The American people, \naccording to most public surveys, also think that distinction matters--\nwhich helps us to understand why the overwhelming majority of them can \nsimultaneously hold the views that the President has demeaned his \noffice and yet should not be evicted from it.\n  In noting this, I recognize that it would be a dereliction of our \nduty to substitute public opinion polls for our reasoned judgment in \nresolving this Constitutional crisis. But it would also be a serious \nerror to ignore the people's voice, because in exercising our authority \nas a court of impeachment we are standing in the place of the voters \nwho re-elected the President two years ago.\n  In this case, the prevailing public opposition to impeachment has \nparticular relevance, for it provides substantial evidence that the \nPresident's misconduct, while harmful to his moral authority and his \npersonal credibility, has not been so harmful as to shatter the \npublic's faith in his ability to fulfill his Presidential duties and \nact in their interest. Nearly two-thirds of them say repeatedly that \nthey approve of the job that President Clinton is doing and that they \noppose his removal, which means that, though they are deeply \ndisaffected by his personal behavior, they do not believe that he has \nlost his capacity to govern in the national interest.\n  In reaching my conclusion, I first had to determine that the request \nof the House Managers to bring witnesses to the floor would not add to \nthe record and the arguments that have been made, or change my \nconclusion or the outcome of this trial, which most Senators and \nobservers agree will not end in the President's removal. It is true \nthat witnesses may add demeanor evidence, but they will subtract from \nthe Senate's demeanor, and unnecessarily extend the trial for some \ntime, preventing the Senate from returning to the other pressing \nbusiness of the nation.\n  Am I content to have this trial end in the articles failing to \nreceive the required two-thirds vote of the Senate for removal? The \ntruth is that nothing\n\n[[Page S1031]]\n\nabout this terrible national experience leaves me comfortable. But an \nunequivocal, bipartisan statement of censure by Congress would, at \nleast, fulfill our responsibility to our children and our posterity to \nspeak to the common values the President has violated, and make clear \nwhat our expectations are for future Presidents. Such a censure would \nbring better closure to this demeaning and divisive episode, and help \nus begin to heal the injuries the President's misconduct and the \nimpeachment process's partisanship have done to the American body \npolitic, and to the soul of the nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/27/senate-section/article/S1030-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MOTION TO TAKE DEPOSITIONS OF WITNESSES IN COURT OF IMPEACHMENT OF \n                       WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, there is a lot about this \nimpeachment process that is new and unfamiliar to all of us. That is \nall the more reason why we should allow ourselves to be guided by the \nConstitution and historical precedents in deciding how we proceed. The \nConstitution's requirement that the Senate ``shall have the sole Power \nto try all Impeachments.'' certainly suggests that the Senate will \nordinarily do more than simply look at the record made by the House in \ndeciding whether to send us Articles of impeachment, and that has \ngenerally been the Senate's practice.\n  Moreover, the Senate sitting as a court of impeachment is charged \nwith seeking the truth in this trial. If any Senators reasonably \nbelieve that hearing witnesses would assist in finding the truth, then \nI believe both the President and the House should have the opportunity \nto call witnesses. Based on the record before us and the arguments we \nhave heard, it is clear that at least on some of the House's charges, \nthere are factual issues in dispute that the witnesses whom this motion \nproposes to subpoena for depositions could help us resolve.\n  It is for this reason, Mr. President, that I support the motion to \nallow both sides to depose these three witnesses. I do not see why this \nlimited discovery should in any way cause this matter to be drawn out \nfor any extended period of time. Rather, I believe it can be conducted \nvery expeditiously without in any way jeopardizing the Senate's ability \nto conduct other important legislative business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/27/senate-section/article/S1031-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1031-S1032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RCRA REFORM LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for years the Administration has \nexpressed a need for targeted legislation which will provide necessary, \nregulatory flexibility for successful clean up goals of the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) has unsuccessfully tried several times to address those \nneeds through regulatory reform. While those efforts have attempted to \nspeed cleanup and make more rational requirements, these attempts have \nrepeatedly been met with legal challenges. These challenges severely \nlimit the Agency's ability to effectively address this concern. \nFurthermore, a General Accounting Office (GAO) study concluded that EPA \ncannot achieve comprehensive reform through the regulatory process. GAO \nalso believes that such reform can best be achieved by revising the \nunderlying law.\n  Indeed, my colleagues and I have been working with the Administration \nand stakeholders for several years to try to give EPA the flexibility \nit needs. We recognize that Americans are fed up with ineffective \nenvironmental programs that do little for cleanup. Americans want their \nhard-earned dollars used wisely and effectively.\n  RCRA's goals are very important. RCRA involves cleanup of properties \ncontaminated with hazardous waste, at more than the 5000 sites. \nTherefore, the barriers to cleanup are a great concern. The GAO report \nechoes these concerns, noting that EPA believes that current RCRA \nrequirements can lead parties to select cleanup remedies that are \neither too stringent or not stringent enough--given the risks posed by \nthe wastes. Ultimately these requirements can discourage the cleanup of \nsites.\n  The current RCRA cleanup program potentially affects all state \ncleanups, including the cleanup of ``brownfield sites.'' Brownfields \nare abandoned, idled, or under-used industrial and commercial \nfacilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or \nperceived environmental contamination. As Brownfield redevelopment \nactivities have increased, it has come to our attention that the \nhazardous waste management and permitting requirements under RCRA \neither preclude the redevelopment of these properties all together or \nsignificantly add to the cost and time of their redevelopment.\n  Late last year, EPA attempted once more to address the need for \nregulatory flexibility to speed effective RCRA cleanups. This new rule, \ncalled the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule, addresses several of \nthe disincentives to clean up. We applaud the Agency for its efforts. \nNonetheless, EPA notes with certainty that additional reform is needed.\n  The Administration is sending a clear message. RCRA reforms are \ndesired. EPA will do what it can, and should be commended for their \nmost recent effort. However, legislative reforms are needed this year.\n  I commend Senators Chafee, Smith, Lautenberg, Baucus, and Breaux for \ntheir past efforts to address this problem. I have given them my full \nsupport in their plans to definitively fix the problem and given \ncertainty to recent agency actions. Thank you for your leadership in \nrecognizing the need for action. This effort addresses a real need, \nfocusing on expediting clean ups. This need can be readily met if we \ncontinue to work in a bipartisan manner.\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there are over 6000 contaminated \nsites across the country waiting to be cleaned up under the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). These sites include active \nindustrial facilities, unused urban lots well suited for redevelopment, \nand many other sites that have contaminated soil or groundwater. No one \ndisputes that these sites should be cleaned up. But RCRA itself, and \ncertain regulations implementing RCRA, are making it difficult--and \nunnecessarily costly--to get these sites cleaned up. As a result, \ncleanups at many sites are delayed for years and, in a number of cases, \nnot performed at all. The waste remains in place, untreated and \nuntouched.\n  This is an issue where legislative action can both improve the \nenvironment and save money. The Government Accounting Office (GAO) \nissued a report in late 1997 that identified three key requirements \nunder RCRA that pose barriers to cleanups. The GAO concluded EPA's land \ndisposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements for disposal \nfacilities, and permitting requirements, when applied to remediation \nwaste, can significantly increase the cost of a cleanup action and even \nact as an incentive for parties to abandon cleanups altogether. \nTailoring these requirements to address the specific characteristics of \nremediation waste would eliminate this incentive, facilitating the \nactual cleanup of thousands of sites, and, according to GAO's estimate, \nsave up $2 billion a year without negatively impacting human health or \nthe environment.\n  This is an environmental problem that we can and should address. And \nit is one that we can resolve in a bipartisan manner.\n  During the 105th Congress, the Majority Leader, Senator Bob Smith, \nand I worked with our colleagues on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, the Administration, and interested parties to reform RCRA to \nremove the major regulatory obstacles that currently impede the timely \nremediation of many contaminated sites. There was a broad consensus \nthat changes needed to be made to make RCRA work better to clean up \nsites in an environmentally protective manner more quickly and more \ncost effectively. Unfortunately, we ran out of time before we were able \nto reach agreement on specific legislation.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency has issued regulations, including \nthe recently finalized ``Hazardous Waste Identification Rule for \nContaminated Media,'' to address some of the regulatory burdens that we \nsought to eliminate through legislation. I applaud the Agency for its \nefforts. I believe, however, that there is still a need for legislation \nin this area to complete the reform the EPA has started. Therefore, I \nintend to make RCRA remediation waste legislation a priority for the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee this year. Building on the \nprogress\n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\nthat we made in the last Congress, I believe we can draft a bill early \nthis year that will address the remaining regulatory obstacles that \nexist to achieving environmentally protective and cost effective \nremediations.\n  I look forward to working, under Senator Lott's leadership, on a \nbipartisan basis, with all parties interested in RCRA reform. I know \nthat Senator Smith, Chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nSubcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control and Risk Assessment, shares my \ncommitment to reforming RCRA. This is an issue on which everyone \nagrees--reform is necessary, and it can be done in a way that will save \nmoney without posing a threat to human health or the \nenvironment.\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am here today to \njoin my colleagues, Majority Leader Trent Lott and Environment \nCommittee Chairman John Chafee, in expressing support for enacting \nlegislation this year to reform the remediation waste provisions of the \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).\n  As many of my colleagues know, since I assumed the chairmanship of \nthe Superfund, Waste Control and Risk Assessment Subcommittee, which \nhas jurisdiction over RCRA, I have worked to bring some rational \nreforms to this hazardous waste law. It is well known that hazardous \nwaste cleanups in this country take too long, are too costly, and \ninhibit the redevelopment of industrial brownfield sites.\n  Since I first introduced RCRA remediation legislation in the 104th \nCongress, I have worked with Senators Lott, Chafee, Breaux, Baucus, and \nLautenberg, with the Clinton Administration, state governments and \nmembers of the industrial and environmental communities to achieve a \nbipartisan fix to this confusing and burdensome law. Despite our best \nefforts, we were not able to come to an agreement before the close of \nthe 105th Congress.\n  However, I am eager to press forward and reach a bipartisan agreement \nthis year. There is simply too much time and money being wasted under \nthe current regulatory process for Congress not to take action on this \nimportant issue. In fact, according to a GAO report, as much as $2 \nbillion per year could be saved by making certain common sense \nlegislative fixes to RCRA. In addition to cost savings, cleanups would \nbe accelerated by removing bureaucratic roadblocks. Such reforms mean a \nwin for the economy and a win for the environment.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate my pledge to working with Senators \nLott, Chafee, Baucus, and Lautenberg to reach consensus on much needed \nreforms to the RCRA program this year. It will certainly be one of my \nsubcommittee's top priorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/27/senate-section/article/S1031-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW CONOR REPETA ON ACHIEVING THE RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Matthew Conor Repeta, of Bedford, New Hampshire, on achieving the \nrank of Eagle Scout. This first-rate young man was awarded the rank of \nEagle Scout on September 9, 1998, by the District Eagle Board.\n  Matthew began scouting at the age of seven in Eagan, Minnesota, as a \nTiger Cub. He advanced through the Cub Scout ranks of Bobcat, Wolf, \nBear and Webelos. Matthew joined Bedford Troop 414 in 1991. While in \nTroop 414, he was an Assistant Patrol Leader and a Patrol Leader.\n  I want to commend Matthew for receiving the highest award that is \nattainable in Scouting. For his Eagle Project, Matthew built a handicap \nramp for a local museum with other scouts from his troop. This example \nof service demonstrates the ideals for which scouting stands. Matthew \nexemplifies these qualities for which all Scouts strive: Honor, \nLoyalty, Courage, Cheerfulness and Service. For all of Matthew's hard \nwork and devotion to these ideals, he has earned this coveted \nrecognition. As the father of two former Scouts, I understand the time \nand effort that is involved in fulfilling the ideals of being a Scout.\n  I know that Matthew will continue to be a positive role model among \nhis peers, a leader in his community, a friend to those in need and an \ninspiration to all. I want to extend my sincerest congratulations and \nbest wishes to Matthew. His achievement of Eagle Scout and significant \ncontributions to the Bedford community are truly outstanding. It is an \nhonor to represent him in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/27/senate-section/article/S1032-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DEATH OF MR. VICTOR STELLO, JR.\n\n Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I have the sad duty to inform the \nSenate of the untimely death of Victor Stello, Jr., an honored civil \nservant who had a very great influence on the safe operation of \ncommercial nuclear power plants and Department of Energy nuclear \nfacilities.\n  Mr. Stello came from a family of coal miners in Pennsylvania. It was \nfrom seeing the terrible toll on the health of friends and relatives in \nthe mines that he became convinced that safe, clean nuclear power would \nbe a great boon to our country. He worked tirelessly throughout his \ncareer to make nuclear power plants safer and safer. At the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission he rose through the ranks because his singular \nability and forceful personality made it clear that he was a man who \ngot things done. In turn, he was Director of the Division of Reactor \nOperations, the Office of Safety and Enforcement, and the task force \nthat investigated the Three Mile Island reactor accident. Eventually he \nreached the highest civil service position at the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, becoming the Executive Director for Operations.\n  In 1989 because of his reputation for fixing problems, President Bush \nnominated him to be Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs at the \nDepartment of Energy. Despite the pleas of the Secretary of Energy, \nJames Watkins, a group of antinuclear activists delayed his \nconfirmation. Due to this delay and a subsequent serious leg injury, \nPresident Bush reluctantly acceded to Mr. Stello's request that the \nnomination be withdrawn.\n  Despite this set back, Secretary Watkins persuaded Mr. Stello to join \nthe Department of Energy as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary \nfor Safety and Quality, whose primary duty was to ferret out \npotentially unsafe practices in Department of Energy nuclear weapons \nfacilities. With his forceful personality, coupled with Secretary \nWatkins' support and the high responsibility delegated to him by a \nsuccession of Assistant Secretaries for Defense Programs, Mr. Stello \nwas able to break through previously impenetrable institutional \nbarriers to effect real and lasting change.\n  Mr. President, it is because of Mr. Stello's tireless efforts that \nthe Department of Energy reached a high level of safe operations, so \nthat the Nation's critical nuclear deterrent would not become unsafe or \nunreliable, and that the facilities needed to maintain that deterrent \ncould continue to operate safely.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in expressing to Mrs. \nStello and the children our heartfelt condolences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/27/senate-section/article/S1032-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1032-S1033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BOZEMAN HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND\n\n Mr. BURNS.

It's a celebration \nthat is more than a century old complete with flowers, music, and \nsports, unequaled anywhere in the world. This is why it is such an \nhonor to be chosen to perform on this festive day. I want to commend \nthe accomplishments of our young folks.\n  The Bozeman High School Band program has a history of success in \ncompetitions statewide and across the nation. This is to the credit of \nDirector Russ Newbury. In 1998, the band placed second overall at the \nMountain West Marching Band Competition in Idaho with the Color Guard \nwinning the show.\n\n[[Page S1033]]\n\nIn Spokane, Washington, Bozeman High placed second two years \nconsecutively at the Lilac Festival Marching Band competition. There \nare countless other victories for this organization, all of which tell \nvolumes about the quality of students we raise in good ole' Montana.\n  I stand in front of the nation today to say ``congratulations'' and \n``a job well done'' to each and every student that represented the \nState of Montana in this year's Rose Bowl Parade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/27/senate-section/article/S1032-3", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMISSIONER ROY C.

Most notably, Mr. Howes drew upon his experience as \na forest farmer and timber operator to institute proper forest \nmanagement techniques leading to increased county revenue.\n  In addition to his position as county commissioner, Mr. Howes served \non the Michigan Association of Township Supervisors for almost a \ndecade, as well as the state committee that drafted a new Michigan \nconstitution. It was his desire to help older citizens with social \nsecurity and income tax issues that prompted his initial interest in \npolitics. Mr. Howes continues his good work today by assisting disabled \nchildren and students in need of loans as chairman of the board of \ndirectors for the Michigan Rural Rehabilitation Corporation.\n  It is with great admiration that I salute Mr. Howes' contributions to \nManistee County and the entire state of Michigan.

In \n     the second part of this Report, the Board reviews \n     inapplicable provisions of the private-sector laws generally \n     made applicable by the CAA (the ``CAA laws''),1 \n     and reports on whether and to what degree these provisions \n     should be made applicable to the legislative branch. Finally, \n     the Board reviews and makes recommendations on whether to \n     make the CAA or another body of laws applicable to the \n     General Accounting Office (``GAO''), the Government Printing \n     Office (``GPO''), and the Library of Congress (``Library'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ This report uses the term ``CAA laws'' to refer to the \n     eleven laws, applicable in the federal and private sectors, \n     made applicable to the legislative branch by the CAA and \n     listed in section 102(a) of that Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Part I\n       After reviewing all federal laws and amendments relating to \n     terms and conditions of employment or access to public \n     accommodations and services passed since October, 1996, the \n     Board concludes that no new provisions of law should be made \n     applicable to the legislative branch. Two laws relating to \n     terms and conditions of employment were amended, but \n     substantial provisions of each law have already been made \n     applicable to the legislative branch. However, the provisions \n     of private-sector law which the Board identified in 1996 in \n     its first Section 102(b) Report as having little or no \n     application in the legislative branch have not yet been made \n     applicable, and the Board's experience in the administration \n     and enforcement of the Act in the two years since that first \n     report was submitted to Congress has raised several new \n     issues.\n       Based on the work of the 1996 Section 102(b) Report, the \n     Board makes the following two sets of recommendations.\n       (1) The Board resubmits the recommendations made in the \n     1996 Section 102(b) Report that the following provisions of \n     laws be applied to employing offices within the legislative \n     branch: Prohibition Against Discrimination on the Basis of \n     Bankruptcy (11 U.S.C. Sec. 525); Prohibition Against \n     Discharge from Employment by Reason of Garnishment (15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1674(a)); Prohibition Against Discrimination on the \n     Basis of Jury Duty (28 U.S.C. Sec. 1875); Titles II and III \n     of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2000(a) \n     to 2000a-6, 2000b to 2000b-3) (prohibiting discrimination on \n     the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin \n     regarding the goods, services, facilities, privileges, \n     advantages, and accommodations of any place of public \n     accommodation as defined in the Act).\n       (2) After further study of the whistleblower provisions of \n     the environmental laws (15\n\n[[Page S1034]]\n\n     U.S.C. Sec. 2622; 33 U.S.C. Sec. 1367; 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 300j-9(i), 5851, 6971, 7622, 9610) on which the \n     Board had previously deferred decision, the Board now \n     concludes that the better construction of these provisions is \n     that they cover the legislative branch. However, because \n     arguments could be made to the contrary, the Board recommends \n     that language should be added to make clear that all entities \n     within the legislative branch are covered by these \n     provisions.\n       Based on its experience in the administration and \n     enforcement of the Act and employee inquiry since the 1996 \n     Report was issued, the Board makes the following two \n     recommendations:\n       (1) Employee ``whistleblower'' protections, comparable to \n     those generally available to employees covered by 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2302(b)(8), should be made applicable to the legislative \n     branch 2 to further the institutional and public \n     policy interest in preventing reprisal or intimidation for \n     the disclosure of information which evidences fraud, waste, \n     or abuse or a violation of applicable statute or regulation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ Such protections are already generally available to \n     employees at GAO and GPO.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       (2) The Board has found that Congress has created a number \n     of special-purpose study commissions in which some or all \n     members are appointed by the Congress. These commissions are \n     not listed as employing offices under the CAA and, in some \n     cases, such commissions may not be covered by other, \n     comparable protections. The Board therefore believes that the \n     coverage of such special-purpose study commissions should be \n     clarified.\n     Part II\n       Having reviewed all the inapplicable provisions of the \n     private-sector CAA laws,3 the Board focuses its \n     recommendations on enforcement,4 the area in which \n     Congress made the most significant departures from the \n     private-sector provisions of the CAA laws.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ The table of the private-sector provisions of the CAA \n     laws not made applicable by the CAA, set forth in Appendix I \n     to this Report, details these exceptions.\n     \\4\\ The private-sector enforcement authority tables, set \n     forth in Appendix II to this Report, summarize the \n     enforcement authorities afforded to the implementing \n     executive-branch agencies under the private-sector laws made \n     applicable by the CAA in those areas in which the CAA does \n     not already grant enforcement authority to the Office.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Board makes the following specific recommendations of \n     changes to the CAA:\n       (1) grant the Office the authority to investigate and \n     prosecute violations of section 207 of the CAA, which \n     prohibits intimidation or reprisal for opposing any practice \n     made unlawful by the Act or for participation in any \n     proceeding under the Act;\n       (2) clarify that section 215(b) of the CAA, which makes \n     applicable the remedies set forth in section 13(a) of the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (``OSHAct''), \n     gives the General Counsel the authority to seek a restraining \n     order in district court in the case of imminent danger to \n     health or safety; and\n       (3) make the record-keeping and notice-posting requirements \n     of the private-sector laws applicable under the CAA.\n       The Board also makes the following general recommendations:\n       (4) extend the benefits of the model alternative dispute \n     resolution system created by the CAA to the private and \n     federal sectors to provide them with the same efficient and \n     effective method of resolving disputes that the legislative \n     branch now enjoys; and\n       (5) grant the Office the other enforcement authorities \n     exercised by the agencies which implement those CAA laws for \n     the private sector in order to ensure that the legislative \n     branch experiences the same burdens as the private sector.\n\n       The Board further suggests that, to realize fully the goals \n     of the CAA--to assure that ``congressional employees will \n     have the civil rights and social legislation that has ensured \n     fair treatment of workers in the private sector'' and to \n     ``ensure that Members of Congress will know firsthand the \n     burdens that the private sector lives with'' 5--\n     all inapplicable provisions of the CAA laws should, over \n     time, be made applicable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\5\\ 141 Cong. Rec. S441 (daily ed. Jan. 9, 1995) (statement \n     of Senator Grassley).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Part III\n       The Board identifies three principal options for coverage \n     of the three instrumentalities:\n       (1) CAA Option--Coverage under the CAA, including the \n     authority of the Office of Compliance as it administers and \n     enforces the CAA (as the CAA would be modified by enactment \n     of the recommendations made in Part II of this Report.)\n       (2) Federal-Sector Option--Coverage under the statutory and \n     regulatory regime that applies generally in the executive \n     branch of the federal sector, including the authority of \n     executive-branch agencies as they administer and enforce the \n     laws in the federal sector.\n       (3) Private-Sector Option--Coverage under the statutory and \n     regulatory regimes that apply generally in the private \n     sector, including the authority of the executive-branch \n     agencies as they administer and enforce the laws in the \n     private sector.6\n\n     \\6\\ The coverage described in each of the three options would \n     supersede only provisions of law which provide substantive \n     rights analogous to those provided under the CAA or which \n     establish analogous administrative, judicial, or rulemaking \n     processes to implement, remedy, or enforce such rights. \n     Substantive rights under federal-sector or other laws having \n     no analogue in the CAA, and processes used to implement, \n     remedy, or enforce such rights, would not be affected by the \n     coverage described in the three options.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     The Board compared these options with the current regimes at \n     GAO, GPO, and the Library, identifying the significant \n     effects of applying each option.7\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\7\\ The comparisons, which are presented in detail in tables \n     set forth in Appendix III to this Report, cover the CAA, the \n     laws made applicable by the CAA, analogous laws that apply in \n     the federal sector and the private sector, and mechanisms for \n     applying and enforcing them.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Board concludes that coverage under the private-sector \n     regime is not the best of the options it considered. Members \n     Adler and Seitz recommend that the three instrumentalities be \n     covered under the CAA, with certain modifications, and \n     Chairman Nager and Member Hunter recommend that the three \n     instrumentalities be made fully subject to the laws and \n     regulations generally applicable in the executive branch of \n     the federal sector.\n       The analysis and conclusions in this report are being made \n     solely for the purposes set forth in section 102(b) of the \n     Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. Nothing in this \n     report is intended or should be construed as a definitive \n     interpretation of any factual or legal question by the Office \n     of Compliance or its Board of Directors.\n       The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n     gratefully acknowledges the contributions of Lawrence B. \n     Novey and Eugenie N. Barton for their work on this report.\n\n                         Section 102(b) Report\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       Congress enacted the Congressional Accountability Act of \n     1995 (``CAA'') so that there would no longer be ``one set of \n     protections for people in the private sector whose employees \n     are protected by the employment, safety and civil rights \n     laws, but no protection, or very little protection, for \n     employees on Capitol Hill,'' 8 and to ``ensure \n     that Members of Congress will know firsthand the burdens that \n     the private sector lives with.'' 9 Thus, the CAA \n     provides employees of the Congress and certain congressional \n     instrumentalities with the protections of specified \n     provisions of eleven federal employment, labor, and public \n     access laws. (This Report refers to those laws as the ``CAA \n     laws'').10 Further, the Act generally applies the \n     same substantive provisions and judicial remedies of the CAA \n     laws as govern employment and public access in the private \n     sector to ensure that Congress would live under the same laws \n     as the rest of the nation's citizens.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\8\\ 141 Cong. Rec. S622 (daily ed. Jan. 9, 1995) (statement \n     of Senator Grassley).\n     \\9\\ Id. at S441.\n     \\10\\ The nine private-sector laws made applicable by the CAA \n     are: the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 201 \n     et seq.) (``FLSA''), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e et seq.) (``Title VII''), the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 \n     et seq.) (``ADA''), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act \n     of 1967 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 621 et seq.) (``ADEA''), the Family \n     and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2611 et seq.) \n     (``FMLA''), the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 \n     (29 U.S.C. Sec. 651 et seq.) (``OSHAct''), the Employee \n     Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2001 et \n     seq.) (``EPPA''), the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq.) (``WARN \n     Act''), and section 2 of the Uniformed Services Employment \n     and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (``USERRA''). The two \n     federal-sector laws made applicable by the CAA are: Chapter \n     71 of title 5, United States Code (relating to federal \n     service labor-management relations) (``Chapter 71''), and the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 701 et seq.).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       However, the Act departed from the private-sector model in \n     a number of significant respects. New institutional, \n     adjudicatory, and rulemaking models were created. Concerns \n     about subjecting itself to regulation, enforcement or \n     administrative adjudication by executive-branch agencies led \n     Congress to establish an independent administrative agency in \n     the legislative branch, the Office of Compliance (the ``OC'' \n     or the ``Office''), to administer and enforce the Act. The \n     Office's administrative and enforcement authorities differ \n     significantly from those in place at the executive-branch \n     agencies which administer and enforce the eleven CAA laws for \n     the private sector and/or the federal-sector. Most notably, \n     the Act did not grant the OC independent investigation and \n     prosecutorial authority comparable to that of analogous \n     executive-branch agencies. Instead, the Act created new, \n     confidential administrative dispute resolution procedures, \n     including compulsory mediation, as a prerequisite to access \n     to the courts. Finally, the Act granted the OC limited \n     substantive rulemaking authority. Substantive regulations \n     under the CAA are adopted by the Board of Directors (the \n     ``Board''). The House and Senate retained the right to \n     approve those regulations, but the CAA provides that, in the \n     absence of Board action and congressional approval, the \n     applicable private-sector regulations or federal-sector \n     regulations apply, with one exception involving labor-\n     management relations.11\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\11\\ With respect to the offices listed in Sec. 220(e)(2) of \n     the CAA, the application of rights under Chapter 71 shall \n     become effective only after regulations regarding those \n     offices are adopted by the Board and approved by the House \n     and Senate. See Sec. Sec. 220(f)(2), 411, of the CAA.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In terms of substantive law, the Act did not include some \n     potentially applicable laws and made applicable only certain \n     provisions of the CAA laws. Moreover, the Act applied the \n     Federal Labor-Management Relations Act, 5 U.S.C. chapter 71 \n     (``Chapter 71''), rather than the private-sector model, and \n     gave\n\n[[Page S1035]]\n\n     the Board authority to create further exclusions from labor-\n     management coverage if the Board found such exclusions \n     necessary because of conflict of interest or Congress's \n     constitutional responsibilities.12\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\12\\ See Sec. 220(e) of the CAA.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Finally, the CAA was not made applicable throughout the \n     legislative branch. The CAA only partially covered the three \n     largest instrumentalities of the Congress, the General \n     Accounting Office (``GAO''), the Government Printing Office \n     (``GPO''), and the Library of Congress (the ``Library''), \n     which were already covered in large part by a variety of \n     different provisions of federal-sector laws, administered by \n     the three instrumentalities themselves and/or executive-\n     branch agencies.\n       Congress left certain areas to be addressed later, after \n     further study and recommendation, as provided for by sections \n     102(b) and 230 of the Act. To promote the continuing \n     accountability of Congress, section 102(b) of the CAA \n     required the Board to review biennially all provisions of \n     federal law and regulations relating to the terms and \n     conditions of employment and access to public services and \n     accommodations; to report on whether or to what degree the \n     provisions reviewed are applicable or inapplicable to the \n     legislative branch; and to recommend whether those provisions \n     should be made applicable to the legislative branch. \n     Additionally, section 230 of the CAA mandated a study of the \n     status of the application of the eleven CAA laws to GAO, GPO, \n     and the Library, to ``evaluate whether the rights, \n     protections, and procedures, including administrative and \n     judicial relief, applicable to [these instrumentalities] . . \n     . are comprehensive and effective . . . includ[ing] \n     recommendations for any improvements in regulations or \n     legislation.'' 13 These reports were to review \n     aspects of legislative-branch coverage which required further \n     study and recommendation to the Congress once the OC and its \n     Board had gained experience in the administration of the Act \n     and Congress had gained experience in living under the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\13\\ 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1371(c). Originally, the Administrative \n     Conference of the United States was charged with carrying out \n     the study and making recommendations for improvements in the \n     laws and regulations governing the instrumentalities, but \n     when the Conference lost its funding, the responsibility for \n     the study was transferred to the Board.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       1996 Section 102(b) Report. In December of 1996, the Board \n     completed its first biennial report mandated under section \n     102(b) of the CAA (the ``1996 Section 102(b) Report''), which \n     reviewed and analyzed the universe of federal law relating to \n     labor, employment and public access, made the Board's initial \n     recommendations, and set priorities for future \n     reports.14 To conduct its analysis, the Board \n     organized the provisions of federal law in tabular form \n     according to the kinds of entities to which they applied, and \n     systematically analyzed whether and to what extent they were \n     already applicable to the legislative branch or whether the \n     legislative branch was already covered by other comparable \n     legislation. This generated four tables: the first listed and \n     reviewed those provisions of law generally applicable in the \n     private sector and/or in state and local government that also \n     are already applicable to entities in the legislative branch, \n     a category which included nine of the laws made applicable by \n     the CAA. The second table contained and reviewed those \n     provisions of law that apply only in the federal sector, a \n     category which included the two exclusively federal-sector \n     laws applied to the legislative branch by the CAA. The third \n     table listed and reviewed five private- sector and/or state- \n     and local-government provisions of law that do not apply in \n     the legislative branch, but govern areas in which Congress \n     has already applied to itself other, comparable provisions of \n     law. The last table listed and reviewed thirteen other \n     private-sector laws which do not apply or have only very \n     limited application in the legislative branch.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\14\\ Section 102(b) Report: Review and Report of the \n     Applicability to the Legislative Branch of Federal Law \n     Relating to Terms and Conditions of Employment and Access to \n     Public Services and Accommodations (Dec. 31, 1996).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Board then turned to its task of recommending which \n     statutes should be applied to the legislative branch. In \n     light of the large body of statutes that the Board had \n     identified and reviewed, the Board determined that it could \n     not make recommendations concerning every possible change in \n     legislative-branch coverage, for ``that would be the work of \n     many years and many hands.'' 15 The Board further \n     recognized that biennial nature of report, as well as the \n     history and structure of the CAA, argued ``for accomplishing \n     such statutory change on an incremental basis.'' \n     16\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\15\\ Id. at 3.\n     \\16\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In setting its priorities for making recommendations from \n     among the categories of statutes that the Board had \n     identified for analysis and review, the Board sought to \n     mirror the priorities of the CAA. Because legislative history \n     suggested that highest priority of the CAA was the \n     application of private-sector protections to congressional \n     employees where those employees had little or no protection, \n     the Board focused its recommendations in its first report on \n     applying the private-sector laws not currently applicable to \n     the legislative branch. The Board determined that, because of \n     the CAA's focus on coverage of the Congress under private-\n     sector laws, the Board's next priority should be to review \n     the inapplicable provisions of the private-sector laws \n     generally made applicable by the CAA.\n       The laws detailed in the other two tables were given a \n     lower priority. Because determining whether and to what \n     degree federal-sector provisions of law should be made \n     applicable to the legislative branch ``involve[s], in part, \n     weighing the merits of the protections afforded by the CAA \n     against those provided under other statutory schemes, the \n     Board determined that, in . . . its first year of \n     administering the CAA, [the Board determined that] it would \n     be premature for the Board to make such comparative \n     judgments.'' 17 Additionally, among the patchwork \n     of federal-sector laws, which had come to cover some of the \n     instrumentalities of the Congress, were laws the \n     effectiveness and efficiency of which were then (and remain) \n     under review by the Executive Branch. Similarly, the Board \n     deferred consideration of laws that were not applicable, but \n     where the Congress had applied a comparable provision, \n     because the Board concluded that ``as the Board gains \n     rulemaking and adjudicatory experience in the application of \n     the CAA to the legislative branch, the Board will be better \n     situated to formulate recommendations about appropriate \n     changes in those different statutory schemes.'' 18 \n     In sum, the Board determined to follow the apparent \n     priorities of the CAA itself, turning first to the \n     application of currently inapplicable private-sector laws, \n     and next in this, its second Section 102(b) Report, reviewing \n     the omissions in coverage of the laws made applicable by the \n     CAA and making recommendations for change.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\17\\ Id. at 4.\n     \\18\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Section 230 Study. At the same time as it completed its \n     first report under section 102(b), the Board in its study \n     mandated under section 230 of the CAA (the ``Section 230 \n     Study'') 19 analyzed the application of labor, \n     employment and public access laws to GAO, GPO, and the \n     Library, evaluating the statutory and regulatory regimes in \n     place at these instrumentalities to determine whether they \n     were ``comprehensive and effective.'' 20 To do so, \n     the Board had to establish a point of comparison, and \n     determined that the CAA itself was the benchmark intended by \n     Congress. Further, the Board gave content to the terms \n     ``comprehensive and effective,'' defining those terms \n     according to the Board's statutory charge to examine the \n     adequacy of ``rights, protections, and procedures, including \n     administrative and judicial relief.'' 21 Four \n     categories were examined--substantive law; administrative \n     processes and relief; judicial processes and relief; and \n     substantive regulations--to determine whether the regimes at \n     the instrumentalities were ``comprehensive and effective'' \n     according to: (1) the nature of the substantive rights and \n     protections afforded to employees, both as guaranteed by \n     statute and as applied by rules and regulations; (2) the \n     adequacy of administrative processes, including: (a) adequate \n     enforcement mechanisms for monitoring compliance and \n     detecting and correcting violations, and (b) a fair and \n     independent mechanism for informally resolving or, if \n     necessary, investigating, adjudicating, and appealing \n     disputes; (3) the availability and adequacy of judicial \n     processes and relief; and (4) the adequacy of any process for \n     issuing substantive regulations specific to an \n     instrumentality, including proposal and adoption by an \n     independent regulatory authority under appropriate statutory \n     criteria.22\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\19\\ Section 230 Study: Study of Laws, Regulations, and \n     Procedures at the General Accounting Office, the Government \n     Printing Office and the Library of Congress (Dec. 1996) at \n     iii.\n     \\20\\ 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1371(c).\n     \\21\\ Id. \n     \\22\\ Section 230 Study at ii.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Board concluded that ``overall, the rights, \n     protections, procedures and [judicial and administrative] \n     relief afforded to employees'' were ``comprehensive and \n     effective when compared to those afforded to other \n     legislative-branch employees under the CAA,'' but pointed out \n     several gaps and a number of significant differences in \n     coverage.23 However, the Board explained that it \n     was ``premature'' to make recommendations at that ``early \n     stage of its administration of the Act,''24 as to \n     whether changes were necessary in the coverage applicable in \n     these instrumentalities. The Board further stated that its \n     ongoing reporting requirement under section 102(b) argued for \n     accomplishing such statutory change on an incremental basis \n     as the Board gained experience in the administration of the \n     CAA. The conclusions in the Section 230 Study thus properly \n     would serve at the appropriate time as ``the foundation for \n     recommendations for change'' in a subsequent report under \n     section 102(b) of the CAA.25\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\23\\ Id.\n     \\24\\ Id.\n     \\25\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The time is now ripe for the Board to make recommendations \n     for change in the coverage of the three instrumentalities \n     which are appropriately included as part of this Report. The \n     Board has had over three years' experience in the \n     administration of the rights, protections and procedures made \n     applicable to the legislative branch by the CAA. This \n     experience in administering and enforcing the CAA and \n     assessing its strengths and weaknesses in making \n     recommendations respecting changes in the CAA to make the Act \n     comprehensive and effective with respect to those parts of \n     the legislative branch already covered under the CAA has \n     augmented the\n\n[[Page S1036]]\n\n     structural foundation set down in the Section 230 Study. \n     Thus, the Board has both the substantive and experiential \n     bricks and mortar to model the options for changes in the \n     regimes covering the three largest instrumentalities. \n     Moreover, procedural rulemaking to extend the Procedural \n     Rules of the Office of Compliance to cover proceedings \n     commenced by GAO and Library employees alleging violations of \n     sections 204-207 of the CAA raised questions as to the \n     current status of substantive and procedural coverage of the \n     instrumentalities under the Act, demonstrating an immediate \n     need for Congress to clarify the relationship between the CAA \n     and the instrumentalities.\n       Accordingly, this Report has three parts. In the first, the \n     Board fulfills its general responsibility under section \n     102(b), by presenting a review of laws enacted after the 1996 \n     Section 102(b) Report and recommendations as to which laws \n     should be made applicable to the legislative branch. The \n     second part analyzes which private-sector provisions of the \n     CAA laws do not apply to the legislative branch and which \n     should be made applicable. The third part reviews current \n     coverage of GAO, GPO, and the Library of Congress under the \n     laws made applicable by the CAA and presents the Board's \n     recommendations for change.\n\n\n  I. REVIEW OF LAWS ENACTED AFTER THE 1996 SECTION 102(b) REPORT, and \nREPORT RECOMMENDING THAT CERTAIN OTHER INAPPLICABLE LAWS SHOULD BE MADE \n                               APPLICABLE\n\n     A. Background\n       Section 102(b) of the CAA directs the Board of Directors of \n     the Office of Compliance to--review provisions of Federal law \n     (including regulations) relating to (A) the terms and \n     conditions of employment (including hiring, promotion, \n     demotion, termination, salary, wages, overtime compensation, \n     benefits, work assignments or reassignments, grievance and \n     disciplinary procedures, protection from discrimination in \n     personnel actions, occupational health and safety, and family \n     and medical and other leave) of employees, and (B) access to \n     public services and accommodations.\n     And, on the basis of this review--beginning on December 31, \n     1996, and every 2 years thereafter, the Board shall report on \n     (A) whether or to what degree the provisions described in \n     paragraph (1) are applicable or inapplicable to the \n     legislative branch, and (B) with respect to provisions \n     inapplicable to the legislative branch, whether such \n     provisions should be made applicable to the legislative \n     branch.\n       In preparing this part of the 1998 Section 102(b) Report, \n     all federal laws and amendments passed since October 1996 \n     were reviewed to identify any new laws and changes in \n     existing laws relating to terms and conditions of employment \n     or access to public accommodations and services. The results \n     of that review are reported here.26 Further, in \n     this part of the current Section 102(b) Report, the Board \n     addresses the question of coverage of the legislative branch \n     under the environmental whistleblower provisions which the \n     Board deferred in the previous, 1996 Report. The Board also \n     notes that the provisions of private-sector law which the \n     Board identified in that Section 102(b) Report as having \n     little or no application in the legislative branch have not \n     yet been made applicable, and the Board therefore also \n     resubmits its recommendations regarding those provisions \n     here. Based on experience in the administration and \n     enforcement of the Act in the two years since that first \n     report was submitted to Congress, the Board addresses two \n     other areas--whistleblower protection and coverage of special \n     study commissions--which, due to employee inquiry, the Board \n     believes merit attention now.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\26\\ As in the 1996 Section 102(b) Report, excluded from \n     consideration were those laws that, although employment-\n     related, (1) are specific to narrow or specialized industries \n     or types of employment not found in the legislative branch \n     (e.g., employment in maritime or mining industries, or the \n     armed forces, or employment in a project funded by federal \n     grants or contracts); or (2) establish government programs of \n     research, data-collection, advocacy, or training, but do not \n     establish correlative rights and responsibilities for \n     employees and employers (e.g., statutes authorizing the \n     Women's Bureau or the Bureau of Labor Statistics); or (3) \n     authorize, but do not require, that employers provide \n     benefits to employees, (e.g. so-called ``cafeteria plans'' \n     authorized by 26 U.S.C. Sec. 125).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     B. Review and Report on Laws Passed Since October 1996\n       With two exceptions, the Congress did not pass a new law or \n     significantly amend an existing law relating to terms and \n     conditions of employment or access to public accommodations \n     since the 1996 Section 102(b) Report. The first exception is \n     the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act, Pub. L. No. 105-\n     241, which amends the OSHAct to apply it to the United States \n     Postal Service. The second exception is the Veterans \n     Employment Opportunities Act of 1997 (``VEOA''), Pub. L. No. \n     105-339, which provides for expanded veterans' preference \n     eligibility and retention in the executive branch and for \n     those legislative-branch employees who are in the competitive \n     service.\n       Both the OSHAct and the VEOA already apply to a substantial \n     extent to the legislative branch. The OSHAct was made \n     generally applicable to the legislative branch by section 215 \n     of the CAA, and, in Parts II and III of this 1998 Section \n     102(b) Report, the Board has reviewed the extent to which \n     specific provisions of the OSHAct apply within the \n     legislative branch, and has made recommendations.\n       As to the VEOA, selected provisions of the Act apply to \n     employees meeting the definition of ``covered employee'' \n     under the CAA, excluding those employees whose appointment is \n     made by a Member or Committee of Congress, and the VEOA \n     assigns responsibility to the Board to implement veterans' \n     preference requirements as to these employees. It is \n     premature for the Board now, two months after enactment of \n     the VEOA, to express any views about the extent to which \n     veterans' preference rights do, or should, apply in the \n     legislative branch, but the Board may decide to do so in a \n     subsequent biennial report under section 102(b).\n     C. Report and Recommendations Respecting Laws Addressed in \n         the 1996 Section 102(b) Report\n       1. Resubmission of Earlier Recommendations\n       The Board of Directors resubmits the following \n     recommendations made in the 1996 Section 102(b) Report:\n       (a) Prohibition against discrimination on the basis of \n     bankruptcy (11 U.S.C. Sec. 525). Section 525(a) provides that \n     ``a governmental unit'' may not deny employment to, terminate \n     the employment of, or discriminate with respect to employment \n     against, a person that is or has been a debtor under the \n     bankruptcy statutes. This provision currently does not apply \n     to the legislative branch. For the reasons stated in the 1996 \n     Section 102(b) Report, the Board reports that the rights and \n     protections against discrimination on this basis should be \n     applied to employing offices within the legislative branch.\n       (b) Prohibition against discharge from employment by reason \n     of garnishment (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1674(a)). Section 1674(a) \n     prohibits discharge of any employee because his or her \n     earnings ``have been subject to garnishment for any one \n     indebtedness.'' This section is limited to private employers, \n     so it currently has no application to the legislative branch. \n     For the reason set forth in the 1996 Section 102(b) Report, \n     the Board has determined that the rights and protections \n     against discrimination on this basis should be applied to \n     employing offices within the legislative branch.\n       (c) Prohibition against discrimination on the basis of jury \n     duty (28 U.S.C. Sec. 1875). Section 1875 provides that no \n     employer shall discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate, \n     or coerce any permanent employee by reason of such employee's \n     jury service, or the attendance or scheduled attendance in \n     connection with such service, in any court of the United \n     States. This section currently does not cover legislative-\n     branch employment. For the reason set forth in the 1996 \n     Section 102(b) Report, the Board has determined that the \n     rights and protections against discrimination on this basis \n     should be applied to employing offices within the legislative \n     branch.\n       (d) Titles II and III of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2000a to 2000a-6, 2000b to 2000b-3). These \n     titles prohibit discrimination or segregation on the basis of \n     race, color, religion, or national origin regarding the \n     goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and \n     accommodations of ``any place of public accommodation'' as \n     defined in the Act. Although the CAA incorporated the \n     protections of titles II and III of the ADA, which prohibit \n     discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to \n     access to public services and accommodations, it does not \n     extend protection against discrimination based upon race, \n     color, religion, or national origin with respect to access to \n     public services and accommodations. For the reasons set forth \n     in the 1996 Section 102(b) Report, the Board has determined \n     that the rights and protections afforded by titles II and III \n     of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against discrimination with \n     respect to places of public accommodation should be applied \n     to employing offices within the legislative branch.\n       2. Employee Protection Provisions of Environmental Statutes\n       (a) Report. The Board adds a recommendation respecting \n     coverage under the employee protection provisions of the \n     environmental protection statutes. The employee protection \n     provisions in the environmental protection statutes (15 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2622; 33 U.S.C. Sec. 1367; 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 300j'9(i), 5851, 6971, 7622, 9610) generally \n     protect an employee from discrimination in employment because \n     the employee commences proceedings under the applicable \n     statutes, testifies in any such proceeding, or assists or \n     participates in any way in such a proceeding or in any other \n     action to carry out the purposes of the statutes. In the 1996 \n     Report the Board reviewed and analyzed these provisions but \n     ``reserve[d] judgement on whether or not these provision \n     should be made applicable to the legislative branch at this \n     time'' because, among other things, it was ``unclear to what \n     extent, if any, these provisions apply to entities in the \n     legislative branch.'' 27\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\27\\ 1996 Section 102(b) Report at 6.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Upon further review, applying the principles stated in the \n     1996 Report,28 the Board has now concluded that \n     there is sound reason to construe these provisions as \n     applicable to the legislative branch. However, because it is\n\n[[Page S1037]]\n\n     possible to construe certain of these provisions as \n     inapplicable, the Board recommends that Congress should adopt \n     legislation clarifying that the employee protection \n     provisions in the environmental protection statutes apply to \n     all entities within the legislative branch.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\28\\ The Board stated in the 1996 Section 102(b) Report: \n     ``The Board has generally followed the principle that \n     coverage must be clearly and unambiguously stated.'' Section \n     102(b) Report at 2. Furthermore, as to private-sector \n     provisions, the Board stated: ``Because a major goal of the \n     CAA was to achieve parity with the private sector, the Board \n     has determined that, if our review reveals no impediment to \n     applying the provision in question to the legislative branch, \n     it should be made applicable.'' Id. at 4-5.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       (b) Recommendation: Legislation should be adopted \n     clarifying that the employee protection provisions in the \n     environmental protection statutes apply to all entities \n     within the legislative branch.\n     D. Report and Recommendations in Areas Identified by \n         Experience\n       1. Employee ``Whistleblower'' Protection\n       (a) Report. Civil service law 29 provides broad \n     protection to ``whistleblowers'' in the executive branch and \n     at GAO and GPO, but these provisions do not apply otherwise \n     in the legislative branch. Employees subject to these \n     provisions are generally protected against retaliation for \n     having disclosed any information the employee reasonably \n     believes evidences a violation of law or regulation, gross \n     mismanagement or abuse of authority, or substantial danger to \n     public health or safety. (In the private sector, \n     whistleblowers are also often protected by provisions of \n     specific federal laws.30) The Office has received \n     a number of inquiries from congressional employees concerned \n     about protection against possible retaliation by an employing \n     office for the disclosure of what the employee perceives to \n     be such information. The absence of specific statutory \n     protection such as that provided under 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2302(b)(8) chills the disclosure of such information. \n     Granting ``whistleblower'' protection could significantly \n     improve the rights and protections afforded to legislative-\n     branch employees in an area fundamental to the institutional \n     integrity of the legislative branch.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\29\\ See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2302(b)(8).\n     \\30\\ See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2622; 33 U.S.C. Sec. 1367; 42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 300j-9(i), 5851, 6971, 7622, 9610 (the \n     employee protection provisions of various environmental \n     statutes), discussed on page 13 above. Other whistleblower \n     protection may be provided through state statute or state \n     common law, which are outside the scope of this Report.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       (b) Recommendation: Congress should provide whistleblower \n     protection to legislative-branch employees comparable to that \n     provided to executive-branch employees under 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2302(b)(8).\n       2. Coverage of Special-Purpose Study Commissions\n       (a) Report. The Office has been asked questions respecting \n     the coverage of certain special-purpose study commissions \n     that include members appointed by Congress or by officers of \n     Congressional instrumentalities. Such commissions are not \n     expressly listed in section 101(9) of the CAA in the \n     definition of ``employing offices'' covered under the CAA, \n     and in some cases it is unclear whether commission employees \n     are covered under rights and protections comparable to those \n     granted by the CAA. The Board believes that the coverage of \n     such special-purpose study commissions should be clarified.\n       (b) Recommendation: Congress should specifically designate \n     the coverage under employment, labor, and public access laws \n     that it intends, both when it creates special-purpose study \n     commissions that include members appointed by Congress or by \n     legislative-branch officials, and for such commissions \n     already in existence.\n\n\n II. REVIEW OF INAPPLICABLE PRIVATE-SECTOR PROVISIONS OF CAA LAWS AND \n      REPORT ON WHETHER THOSE PROVISIONS SHOULD BE MADE APPLICABLE\n\n     A. Background\n       In its first Section 102(b) Report,31 the Board \n     determined that it should, in future section 102(b) reports, \n     proceed incrementally to review and report on currently \n     inapplicable provisions of law, and recommend whether these \n     provisions should be made applicable, as experience was \n     gained in the administration and enforcement of the Act. The \n     next report to Congress would be an ``in depth study of the \n     specific exceptions created by Congress'' 32 from \n     the nine private-sector laws made applicable by the CAA \n     33 because the application of these private-sector \n     laws was the highest priority in enacting the \n     CAA.34\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\31\\ See 1996 section 102(b) report.\n     \\32\\ Id. at 4.\n     \\33\\ The private-sector laws made applicable by the CAA are \n     listed in note 10, at page 5, above.\n     \\34\\ See 1996 section 102(b) report at 3.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Part II of this second Section 102(b) Report considers \n     these specific exceptions,35 focusing on \n     enforcement, the area in which Congress made the most \n     significant departures from the private-sector provisions of \n     the CAA laws. In this part of the Report, the Board reviews \n     the remedial schemes provided under the CAA with respect to \n     the nine private-sector laws made applicable, evaluates their \n     efficacy in light of three years of experience in the \n     administration and enforcement of the Act, and compares these \n     CAA remedial schemes with those authorities provided for the \n     vindication of the CAA laws in the private \n     sector.36 Based on this review and analysis and \n     the Board's statutory charge to recommend whether \n     inapplicable provisions of law ``should be made applicable to \n     the legislative branch,'' 37 the Board makes a \n     number of recommendations respecting the application of these \n     currently inapplicable enforcement provisions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\35\\ The table of significant provisions of the private-\n     sector CAA laws not yet made applicable by the CAA, set forth \n     in Appendix I to this Report, details these exceptions.\n     \\36\\ The private-sector enforcement authority tables, set \n     forth in Appendix II to this Report, summarize the \n     enforcement authorities afforded to the implementing \n     executive-branch agencies under the private-sector laws made \n     applicable by the CAA in those areas in which the CAA does \n     not already grant enforcement authority to the Office.\n     \\37\\ Section 102(b)(2)(B) of the CAA.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The statute provides no direct guidance to the Board in \n     recommending whether a provision ``should be made \n     applicable.'' 38 The Board has therefore made \n     these recommendations in light of its experience and \n     expertise with respect to both the application of these laws \n     to the private sector 39 and the administration \n     and enforcement of the Act, as well as its understanding of \n     the general purposes and goals of the Act. In particular, the \n     Board intends that these recommendations should further a \n     central goal of the CAA to create parity with the private \n     sector so that employers and employees in the legislative \n     branch would experience the same benefits and burdens as the \n     rest of the nation's citizens.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\38\\ Section 102(b) directs the Board to: ``review provisions \n     of Federal law (including regulations) relating to (A) the \n     terms and conditions of employment (including hiring, \n     promotion, demotion, termination, salary, wages, overtime \n     compensation, benefits, work assignments or reassignments, \n     grievance and disciplinary procedures, protection from \n     discrimination in personnel actions, occupational health and \n     safety, and family and medical and other leave) of employees, \n     and (B) access to public services and accommodations.'' On \n     the basis of this review, section 102(b) requires the Board \n     biennially to: ``report on (A) whether or to what degree the \n     provisions described in paragraph (1) are applicable or \n     inapplicable to the legislative branch, and (B) with respect \n     to provisions inapplicable to the legislative branch, whether \n     such provisions should be made applicable to the legislative \n     branch.''\n     \\39\\ Section 301(d)(1) of the CAA requires that ``[m]embers \n     of the Board shall have training or experience in the \n     application of the rights, protections, and remedies under \n     one or more of the laws made applicable by [the CAA].''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     B. Recommendations\n       The Board makes the following three specific \n     recommendations of changes to the CAA respecting the \n     application of these currently inapplicable enforcement \n     provisions: 40\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\40\\ The Board also notes that several problems have been \n     encountered in the enforcement of settlements requiring on-\n     going or prospective action by a party. The Board does not, \n     at this time, recommend legislative change because the \n     Executive Director, as part of her plenary authority to \n     approve settlements, can require a self- enforcing provision \n     in certain cases and will now do so, as appropriate.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       1. Grant the Office the authority to investigate and \n           prosecute violations of Sec. 207 of the CAA, which \n           prohibits intimidation and reprisal\n       The Board recommends that the Office should be granted \n     enforcement authority with respect to section 207 of the CAA \n     because of the strong institutional interest in protecting \n     employees against intimidation or reprisal for the exercise \n     of the rights provided by the CAA or for participation in the \n     CAA's processes. Investigation and prosecution by the Office \n     would more effectively vindicate those rights, dispel the \n     chilling effect that intimidation and reprisal create, and \n     protect the integrity of the Act and its processes.\n       As the tables indicate, enforcement authority with respect \n     to intimidation or reprisal is provided to the agencies that \n     administer and enforce the CAA laws in the private \n     sector.41 In contrast, under the CAA, the rights \n     and protections provided by section 207 are vindicated only \n     if the employee, after counseling and mediation, pursues his \n     or her claim before a hearing officer or in district court. \n     Experience in the administration and enforcement of the CAA \n     argues that the Office should be granted comparable authority \n     to that exercised by the executive-branch agencies that \n     implement the CAA laws in the private sector. Covered \n     employees who have sought information from the Office \n     respecting their substantive rights under the Act and the \n     processes available for vindicating these rights have \n     expressed concern about their exposure in coming forward to \n     bring a claim, as well as a reluctance and an inability to \n     shoulder the entire litigation burden without the support of \n     agency investigation or prosecution. Moreover, employees who \n     have already brought their original dispute to the counseling \n     and mediation processes of the Office and then perceive a \n     reprisal for that action may be more reluctant to use once \n     again the very processes that led to the claimed reprisal.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\41\\ The only exception is the WARN Act, which has no \n     enforcement authorities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Whatever the reasons a particular employee does not bring a \n     claim of intimidation or reprisal, such unresolved claims \n     threaten to undermine the efficacy of the CAA. Particularly \n     detrimental is the chilling effect on other employees who may \n     wish to bring a claim or who are potential witnesses in other \n     actions under the CAA. Without effective enforcement against \n     intimidation and reprisal, the promise of the CAA that \n     ``congressional employees will have the civil rights and \n     social legislation that ensure fair treatment of workers in \n     the private sector'' 42 is rendered illusory.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\42\\ 141 Cong. Rec. S441 (daily ed. Jan. 9, 1995) (statement \n     of Senator Grassley).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page S1038]]\n\n       Therefore, in order to preserve confidence in the Act and \n     to avoid chilling legislative branch-employees from \n     exercising their rights or supporting others who do, the \n     Board has concluded that the Congress should grant the Office \n     the authority to investigate and prosecute allegations of \n     intimidation or reprisal as they would be investigated and \n     prosecuted in the private sector by the implementing agency. \n     Enforcement authority can be exercised in harmony with the \n     alternative dispute resolution process and the private right \n     of action provided by the CAA, and will further the purposes \n     of section 207 of the Act.\n       2. Clarify that Sec. 215(b) of the CAA, which makes \n           applicable the remedies set forth in Sec. 13(a) of the \n           OSHAct, gives the General Counsel the authority to seek \n           a restraining order in district court in case of \n           imminent danger to health or safety\n       With respect to the substantive provisions for which the \n     Office already has enforcement authority,43 the \n     Board's experience to date has illuminated a need to revisit \n     only one area, section 215(b) of the CAA which provides the \n     remedy for a violation of the substantive provisions of the \n     OSHAct made applicable by the CAA.44 Under section \n     215(b) the remedy for a violation of the CAA shall be a \n     corrective order, ``including such order as would be \n     appropriate if issued under section 13(a)'' of the OSHAct. \n     Among other things, the OSHAct authorizes the Secretary of \n     Labor to seek a temporary restraining order in district court \n     in the case of imminent danger. The General Counsel of the \n     Office of Compliance, who enforces the OSHAct provisions as \n     made applicable by the CAA, takes the position that section \n     213(b), by its terms, gives him the same standing to petition \n     the district court for a temporary restraining order in a \n     case of imminent danger as the Labor Department has under the \n     OSHAct. However, it has been suggested that the language of \n     section 213(b) does not clearly provide that authority.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\43\\ The CAA provides enforcement authority with respect to \n     two private-sector laws, the OSHAct and the provisions of the \n     ADA relating to public services and accommodations. The CAA \n     adopts much of the enforcement scheme provided under the \n     OSHAct; it creates an enforcement scheme with respect to the \n     ADA which is analogous to that provided under the private-\n     sector provisions but is sui generis.\n     \\44\\ Section 215(b) of the CAA reads as follows: \n     ``Remedy.''The remedy for a violation of subsection (a) shall \n     be an order to correct the violation, including such order as \n     would be appropriate if issued under section 13(a) of the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 662(a)).''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Although it has not yet proven necessary to resolve a case \n     of imminent danger by means of court order because compliance \n     with the provisions of section 5 of the OSHAct has been \n     achieved through other means,45 the express \n     authority to seek preliminary injunctive relief is essential \n     to the Office's ability promptly to eliminate all potential \n     workplace hazards. If it should become necessary to prosecute \n     a case of imminent danger by means of district court order, \n     action must be swift and sure. Therefore, the Board \n     recommends that the CAA be amended to clarify that the \n     General Counsel has the standing to seek a temporary \n     restraining order in federal district court and that the \n     court has jurisdiction to issue the order.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\45\\ See generally General Counsel of the Office of \n     Compliance, Report on Safety & Health Inspections Conducted \n     Under the Congressional Accountability Act (Nov. 1998).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       3. Make applicable the record-keeping and notice-posting \n           requirements of the private-sector CAA laws\n       Experience in the administration of the Act leads the Board \n     to recommend that all currently inapplicable record-keeping \n     and notice-posting provisions be made applicable under the \n     CAA. The Board recommends that the Office be granted the \n     authority to require that records be kept and notices posted \n     in the same manner as required by the agencies that enforce \n     the provisions of law made applicable by the CAA in the \n     private sector.\n       As the tables illustrate, 46 most of the laws \n     made generally applicable by the CAA authorize the enforcing \n     agency to require the keeping of pertinent records and the \n     posting of notices in the work place. Experience has \n     demonstrated that where employing offices have voluntarily \n     kept records, these records have greatly assisted in the \n     speedy resolution of disputed matters. Especially where the \n     law has not been violated, employing offices can more readily \n     demonstrate compliance if adequate records have been made and \n     preserved. Moreover, based upon its experience and expertise, \n     the Board has concluded that effective record keeping is not \n     only beneficial to the employer, but in many cases is \n     necessary to the effective vindication of the rights of \n     employees.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\46\\ See generally the tables of enforcement authorities set \n     forth in Appendix II to this Report.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Additionally, living with the same record-keeping and \n     notice-posting requirements as apply in the private sector \n     will give Congress the practical knowledge of the costs and \n     benefits of these requirements. Congress will be able to \n     determine experientially whether the benefits of each record-\n     keeping and notice-posting requirement outweigh the burdens. \n     Application of the record-keeping and notice-posting \n     requirements will thus achieve one of the primary goals of \n     the CAA, that the legislative branch live under the same laws \n     as the rest of the nation's citizens.\n       In addition to these specific recommendations, the Board \n     makes the following two general recommendations which derive \n     from the comparison between the CAA's remedial schemes and \n     those authorities provided for the administration and \n     enforcement of the CAA laws in the private sector:\n       4. Extend the benefits of the model alternative dispute \n           resolution system created by the CAA to the private and \n           the federal sectors\n       The CAA largely replaces the enforcement schemes used to \n     administer and enforce the CAA laws in the private sector \n     with a model alternative dispute resolution system that \n     mandates counseling and mediation prior to pursuing a claim \n     before a hearing officer or in district court. Experience \n     with this system has shown that most disputes under the CAA \n     are resolved by means of counseling and mediation. There are \n     substantial advantages in resolving disputes in their \n     earliest stages, before litigation. Positions have not \n     hardened; liability, if any, is generally at a minimum; and \n     the maintenance of amicable workplace relations is most \n     likely. Therefore, the Board recommends that Congress extend \n     the alternative dispute resolution system created by the CAA \n     to the private and federal sectors so that these sectors will \n     have parity with the Congress in the use of this effective \n     and efficient method of resolving disputes. The Board \n     believes that the use of this alternative dispute resolution \n     system can be harmonized with the administrative and \n     enforcement regimes in place in both the federal and private \n     sectors.\n       5. Grant the Office the other enforcement authorities \n           exercised by the agencies that implement the CAA laws \n           for the private sector\n       To further the goal of parity, the Board also recommends \n     that Congress grant the Office the remaining enforcement \n     authorities that executive-branch agencies utilize to \n     administer and enforce the provisions of law made applicable \n     by the CAA in the private sector. As the tables show, the \n     implementing agencies have investigatory and prosecutorial \n     authorities with respect to all of the private-sector CAA \n     laws, except the WARN Act. 47 Based on the \n     experience and expertise of Members of the Board, granting \n     the Office the same enforcement authorities as the agencies \n     that administer and enforce these substantive provisions in \n     the private sector would make the CAA more comprehensive and \n     effective. The Office can harmonize the exercise of \n     investigatory and prosecutorial authorities with the use of \n     the model alternative dispute resolution system that the CAA \n     creates. By taking these steps to live under full agency \n     enforcement authority, the Congress will strengthen the bond \n     that the CAA created between the legislator and the \n     legislated: ``This has always been deemed one of the \n     strongest bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers \n     and the people together. It creates between them that \n     communion of interests . . . without which every government \n     degenerates into tyranny.'' 48\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\47\\ The particular authorities afforded to the implementing \n     executive-branch agencies under the private-sector laws made \n     applicable by the CAA are summarized in the private-sector \n     enforcement authority tables set forth in Appendix II to this \n     Report.\n     \\48\\ The Federalist No. 57, at 42 (James Madison) (Franklin \n     Library ed., 1984).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     C. Conclusion\n       The biennial reporting requirement of section 102(b) \n     provides the opportunity for Congress to review the \n     comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the CAA in light of \n     the Board's recommendations and make the legislative changes \n     it deems necessary. The CAA was enacted in the spirit of \n     ``the framers of our constitution'' to take ``care to provide \n     that the laws shall bind equally on all, especially those who \n     make them.'' 49 Acknowledging that reaching that \n     goal was to be a continuing process, section 102(b) mandated \n     the periodic process of re-examination of which this Report \n     and its recommendations are a part.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\49\\ Thomas Jefferson, A Manual of Parliamentary Practice: \n     for the Use of the Senate of the United States, in \n     Jefferson's Parliamentary Writings 359 (Wilbur S. Howell ed., \n     1988) (2d ed. 1812).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The CAA took a giant step toward achieving parity and \n     providing comprehensive and effective coverage of the \n     legislative branch by applying certain substantive provisions \n     of law and by providing new administrative and judicial \n     remedies. However, the Board's review of all the currently \n     inapplicable provisions of the CAA laws, as set forth in the \n     accompanying table, 50 has demonstrated that \n     significant gaps remain in the laws made applicable, \n     particularly with respect to the manner in which these laws \n     are enforced under the CAA as compared with the private \n     sector. Based on its expertise in the application of the CAA \n     laws, its three years of experience in the administration and \n     enforcement of the Act, and its understanding that the \n     general purposes and goals of the Act were to achieve parity \n     in the application of laws and to provide the legislative \n     branch with comprehensive and effective protections, the \n     Board recommends that Congress now take the steps of \n     implementing the legislative changes discussed above. The \n     Board further advises the Congress that to realize fully the \n     goals of the CAA--to assure that ``congressional employees \n     will have the civil rights and social legislation that ensure \n     fair treatment of workers in the private sector'' and ``to \n     ensure that members of Congress will know firsthand the \n     burdens that the private sector lives with'' 51--\n     all inapplicable\n\n[[Page S1039]]\n\n     provisions of the CAA laws should, over time, be made \n     applicable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\50\\ See table of the significant provisions of the CAA laws \n     not yet made applicable by the CAA, set forth as Appendix I \n     to this Report.\n     \\51\\ 141 Cong.

LEGISLATIVE OPTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE APPLICATION OF LAWS \n                TO GAO, GPO, AND THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS\n\n     A. Background\n       Congress sought ``to bring order to the chaos of the way \n     the relevant laws apply to congressional instrumentalities'' \n     52 when, in enacting the CAA, it applied the CAA \n     to the smaller instrumentalities, but not to GAO, GPO, and \n     the Library. Instead, the CAA clarified and extended existing \n     coverage of the three largest instrumentalities in certain \n     respects 53 and, in section 230, required the \n     Board to conduct a study evaluating whether the ``rights, \n     protections, and procedures, including administrative and \n     judicial relief'' now in place at these instrumentalities \n     were ``comprehensive and effective'' and to make \n     ``recommendations for any improvements in regulations or \n     legislation.'' 54\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\52\\ 141 Cong. Rec. S445 (daily ed. Jan. 9, 1995) (statement \n     of Senator Grassley).\n     \\53\\ The CAA--(i) affirmed that GAO and GPO are covered under \n     Title VII and the ADEA and extended coverage under those laws \n     to additional employees at GPO; (ii) established new \n     procedures for enforcing existing ADA rights at GAO, GPO, and \n     the Library; (iii) removed GAO and the Library from coverage \n     under FMLA provisions generally applicable in the federal \n     sector and placed those instrumentalities under FMLA \n     provisions generally applicable in the private sector; and \n     (iv) affirmed that GPO is covered under the FLSA and extended \n     coverage under that law to additional employees at GPO. See \n     Sec. Sec. 201(c), 202(c), 203(d), 210(g) of the CAA.\n     \\54\\ Originally, the Administrative Conference of the United \n     States was charged with conducting the study and making \n     recommendations for improvements in the laws and regulations \n     governing the three instrumentalities, but when Congress \n     ceased funding the Conference, Congress also transferred its \n     responsibility for the Study to the Board.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The legislative history explains why Congress covered some \n     instrumentalities under the CAA but not others. Applying the \n     CAA to the smaller instrumentalities and their employees \n     would--extend to these employees, for the first time, the \n     right to bargain collectively, and it will provide a means of \n     enforcing compliance with these laws [made applicable by the \n     CAA] that is independent from the management of these \n     instrumentalities. . . . [B]y strengthening the enforcement \n     mechanisms, the [CAA] attempts to transform the patchwork of \n     hortatory promises of coverage into a truly enforceable \n     application of these laws.55\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\55\\ 141 Cong. Rec. S445 (daily ed. Jan. 9, 1995) (statement \n     of Senator Grassley).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       By contrast, GAO, GPO, and the Library--already have \n     coverage and enforcement systems that are identical or \n     closely analogous to the executive-branch agencies.\n       Notably, employees in each of these agencies already have \n     the right to seek relief in the Federal courts for violations \n     of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in \n     Employment Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, and they \n     are covered under the same provisions of the Family and \n     Medical Leave Act as executive-branch employees.\n       Employees in each of these instrumentalities also already \n     are assured of the right to bargain collectively, with a \n     credible enforcement mechanism to protect that right. For \n     these three instrumentalities, [the CAA] clarifies existing \n     coverage in certain respects, and expands coverage under the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act.56\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\56\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Furthermore, legislative history explained that extending \n     the CAA to cover the smaller instrumentalities would have the \n     advantage of ``using the apparatus that will already be \n     necessary to apply these [CAA] laws to the 20,000 employees \n     of the House and Senate [to also apply these laws] to the \n     remaining approximately 3,000 employees of the Architect [of \n     the Capitol]'' and other smaller \n     instrumentalities.57 On the other hand, the CAA \n     would ``reduce the adjudicatory burden on the new office by \n     excluding from its jurisdiction the approximately 15,000 \n     employees of GAO, GPO and the Library of Congress.'' \n     58\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\57\\ Id.\n     \\58\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       On December 30, 1996, the Board transmitted its study \n     mandated by section 230 of the CAA to Congress. This Section \n     230 Study explained that, to fulfill the statutory mandate to \n     assess whether the ``rights, protections, and procedures, \n     including administrative and judicial relief,'' 59 \n     at GAO, GPO, and the Library were ``comprehensive and \n     effective,'' the Board first had to establish a point of \n     comparison, and the Board decided that the CAA itself was the \n     appropriate benchmark. To give further content to the term \n     ``comprehensive and effective,'' the Board identified four \n     ``key aspects of the current statutory and regulatory \n     regimes,'' 60 which the Board reviewed in \n     evaluating the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the \n     rights, protections, and procedures at the three \n     instrumentalities:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\59\\ Sec. 230(c) of the CAA.\n     \\60\\ Section 230 Study at ii.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       (1) the nature of the substantive rights and protections \n     afforded to employees, both as guaranteed by statute and as \n     applied by rules and regulations;\n       (2) the adequacy of administrative processes, including: \n     (a) adequate enforcement mechanisms for monitoring compliance \n     and detecting and correcting violations, and (b) a fair and \n     independent mechanism for informally resolving or, if \n     necessary, investigating, adjudicating, and appealing \n     disputes;\n       (3) the availability and adequacy of judicial processes and \n     relief; and\n       (4) the adequacy of any process for issuing substantive \n     regulations specific to an instrumentality, including \n     proposal and adoption by an independent regulatory authority \n     under appropriate statutory criteria.61\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\61\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       After reviewing and analyzing the statutory and regulatory \n     regimes in place at the three instrumentalities, the Board \n     concluded that--overall, the rights, protections, procedures \n     and relief afforded to employees at the GAO, the GPO and the \n     Library under the twelve laws listed in section 230(b) are, \n     in general, comprehensive and effective when compared to \n     those afforded other legislative branch employees covered \n     under the CAA.62\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\62\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       However, the Board also found--The rights, protections, \n     procedures and relief applicable to the three \n     instrumentalities are different in some respects from those \n     afforded under the CAA, in part because employment at the \n     instrumentalities is governed either directly under civil \n     service statutes and regulations or under laws and \n     regulations modeled on civil service law.63\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\63\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       These civil-service provisions, which apply generally in \n     the federal sector, apply at the three instrumentalities \n     subject to numerous exceptions. In some instances where \n     federal-sector provisions do not apply, these \n     instrumentalities are covered under the CAA, and, in a few \n     instances, under the statutory provisions that apply \n     generally in the private sector. The result is what the Board \n     called a ``patchwork of coverages and exemptions.'' \n     64\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\64\\ Id. at iv.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       However, the Board decided that it would be ``premature'' \n     at that ``early stage of its administration of the Act'' \n     65 to make recommendations as to whether changes \n     were necessary in the statutory and regulatory regimes \n     applicable in these instrumentalities.66 The \n     ongoing nature of its reporting requirement under section \n     102(b) argued for making recommendations for statutory change \n     on an incremental basis as the Board gained experience in the \n     administration of the CAA, and the conclusions in the Section \n     230 Study would serve at the appropriate time as ``the \n     foundation for recommendations for change'' in a subsequent \n     report under section 102(b) of the CAA.67\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\65\\ Id.\n     \\66\\ The Board's institutional role, functions, and resources \n     were also very different from those of the Administrative \n     Conference, to which Congress originally assigned the task of \n     preparing the study under section 230. See footnote 54 at \n     page 23, above. The Conference in performing the study and \n     making recommendations would have been acting in accordance \n     with its institutional mandate to study administrative \n     agencies and make recommendations for improvements in their \n     procedures.\n     \\67\\ Section 230 Study at iii.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Pursuant to the CAA, several of its provisions became \n     effective with respect to GAO and the Library on December 30, \n     1997, which was one year after the Section 230 Study was \n     transmitted to Congress.68 On October 1, 1997, in \n     anticipation of the December 30 effective date, the Office of \n     Compliance published a notice proposing to extend its \n     Procedural Rules to cover claims alleging that GAO or the \n     Library violated applicable CAA requirements.69 \n     Comments in response to this notice, and to a supplemental \n     notice published on January 28, 1998,70 raised \n     questions as to whether the CAA authorizes GAO and Library \n     employees to use the procedures established by the Act to \n     seek remedies for alleged violations of sections 204-207 of \n     the Act. (These sections apply the EPPA, WARN Act, and USERRA \n     and prohibit retaliation for asserting CAA rights.) The \n     Office decided to terminate the rulemaking and, instead, ``to \n     recommend that the Office's Board of Directors prepare and \n     submit to Congress legislative proposals to resolve questions \n     raised by the comments.'' 71\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\68\\ See Sec. Sec. 204(d)(2), 205(d)(2), 206(d)(2), 215(g)(2) \n     of the CAA.\n     \\69\\ 143 Cong. Rec. S10291 (daily ed. Oct. 1, 1997) (Notice \n     of Proposed Rulemaking).\n     \\70\\ 144 Cong. Rec.

May 13, 1998) \n     (Notice of Decision to Terminate Rulemaking).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Board has decided that this Section 102(b) Report, \n     focusing on omissions in coverage of the legislative branch \n     under the laws made generally applicable by the CAA, provides \n     the appropriate time and place to make recommendations \n     regarding coverage of GAO, GPO, and the Library under those \n     laws. As anticipated in the Section 230 Study, enough \n     experience has now been gained in implementing the CAA to \n     enable the Board to make recommendations for improvements in \n     legislation applicable to these instrumentalities. Moreover, \n     resolution of uncertainty as to whether employees alleging \n     violations of sections 204-207 may use CAA procedures is an \n     additional reason to include in this Report recommendations \n     about coverage of the three instrumentalities.\n     B. Principal Options for Coverage of the Three \n         Instrumentalities\n       On the basis of the findings and analysis in the Section \n     230 Study, the Board has identified three principal options \n     for coverage of these instrumentalities:\n       (1) CAA Option --Coverage under the CAA, including the \n     authority of the Office of Compliance as it administers and \n     enforces the CAA. (The Board here takes as its model the CAA \n     as it would be modified by enactment of the recommendations \n     made in Part II of this Report.)\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\n       (2) Federal-Sector Option--Coverage under the statutory and \n     regulatory regime that applies generally in the federal \n     sector, including the authority of executive-branch agencies \n     as they administer and enforce the laws in the federal \n     sector.\n       (3) Private-Sector Option--Coverage under the statutory and \n     regulatory regimes that apply generally in the private \n     sector, including the authority of the executive-branch \n     agencies as they administer and enforce the laws in the \n     private sector.72\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\72\\ To be sure, other, hybrid models could be developed, \n     based on normative judgments respecting particular provisions \n     of law. Or, it would be possible to leave the ``patchwork'' \n     of coverages and exemptions currently in place at the three \n     instrumentalities and fill serious gaps in coverage on a \n     piecemeal basis. However, presentation of such models would \n     cloud the central question of which is the most appropriate \n     model for the instrumentalities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       These options are compared with the current regimes at GAO, \n     GPO, and the Library, identifying the significant effects of \n     applying each option.\n       The comparisons are presented in tables set forth in \n     Appendix III to this Report and are summarized and discussed \n     in narrative form below. Insofar as federal-sector employers, \n     private-sector employers, or the three instrumentalities are \n     covered by laws affording substantive rights that have no \n     analogue in the CAA, this Report does not discuss or chart \n     these rights. 73 In defining the coverage \n     described in the three options, the Board decided that, so as \n     not to create duplicative rights and remedies, the \n     application of the CAA or of analogous federal-sector or \n     private-sector provisions should supersede existing \n     provisions affording substantially similar substantive rights \n     or establishing administrative, judicial, or rulemaking \n     processes to implement, remedy, or enforce such rights. \n     However, substantive rights under federal-sector or other \n     laws having no analogue in the CAA, and processes used to \n     implement, remedy, or enforce such rights, would not be \n     affected by the coverage described in the three options.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\73\\  In evaluating these options, the Board is not \n     considering the veterans' preference statutory provisions \n     that apply generally in the federal sector and that, under \n     the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998 (``VEOA''), \n     were recently made applicable to certain employing offices of \n     the legislative branch. Veterans' preference requirements, \n     which were not made applicable by the CAA as enacted in 1995 \n     or listed for study under section 230, were not analyzed in \n     the Board's study under that section. Enacted on October 31, \n     1998, the VEOA assigned responsibility to the Board to \n     implement veterans' preference requirements as to certain \n     employing offices. It is premature for the Board now to \n     express any views about the extent to which veterans' \n     preference rights do, or should, apply to GAO, GPO, and the \n     Library, but the Board may decide to do so in a subsequent \n     biennial report under section 102(b).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In comparing each option for coverage with the regime in \n     place at each instrumentality, the Board has analyzed the \n     differences under the four general categories used in the \n     Section 230 Study: Substantive Rights, Administrative \n     Remedial and Enforcement Processes, Judicial Processes and \n     Relief, and Substantive Rulemaking Process. The narrative \n     comparisons highlight the main differences in each area. The \n     appended tables make a more detailed comparison of \n     differences between each option and the existing regimes at \n     the instrumentalities in each of the above-defined areas.\n       The examination of the consequences of applying the three \n     options demonstrates that each has advantages and \n     disadvantages with regard to ``comprehensiveness'' and \n     ``effectiveness,'' particularly in the area of administrative \n     processes and enforcement. A particular administrative/\n     enforcement scheme arguably may be more ``comprehensive'' \n     than another because it includes more avenues for the redress \n     of grievances, but the very multiplicity of avenues arguably \n     may make that scheme less ``effective'' than a more \n     streamlined system. Because all three options largely provide \n     the same substantive rights, determining whether to advocate \n     the option of applying the CAA, the federal-sector model, or \n     the private-sector model depends largely on weighing the \n     costs and benefits of administrative systems for resolving \n     disputes either primarily through a single-agency alternative \n     dispute resolution system, an internal-agency investigation \n     and multi-agency adjudicatory system, or a multi-agency \n     investigation and enforcement system.\n       The Board found that the question of which option to \n     recommend is by no means simple. Sensible arguments support \n     the application of each model. GAO, GPO, and the Library can \n     be analogized to either the other employing offices in the \n     legislative branch, of which these instrumentalities are by \n     statute a part, the executive branch, to which GAO, GPO, and \n     the Library have many functional similarities, or the private \n     sector, which the legislative history of the CAA portrays as \n     the intended workplace model for the legislative branch.\n       Arguably, the legislative-branch model of the CAA, \n     administered and enforced by the Office of Compliance, is the \n     most appropriate to the instrumentalities, in that Congress \n     has already placed not only the employing offices of the \n     House and Senate, but also the instrumentalities of the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the Capitol Police, \n     the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Compliance \n     under the CAA. Furthermore, as the legislative history of the \n     CAA makes clear, the authors of the Act expected the Board to \n     use the CAA as the benchmark in evaluating the \n     comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the regimes in place \n     at GAO, GPO, and the Library. Moreover, GAO, GPO, and the \n     Library are considered instrumentalities of the Congress for \n     many purposes, and some offices of these instrumentalities \n     work directly with Members and staff of Congress in the \n     legislative process, which legislative functions some Members \n     of Congress perceived as creating tension with executive- \n     branch agency coverage.\n       On the other hand, federal-sector laws and regulations, \n     administered and enforced in part by executive-branch \n     agencies, are already in place at the three instrumentalities \n     in many respects. In addition, the special circumstances \n     attendant to Congressional offices that warranted \n     administration and enforcement under the CAA by a separate \n     legislative-branch office, and that justified certain \n     limitations on rights and procedures under the CAA as \n     compared to those generally available in the federal sector, \n     are attenuated when applied to GAO, GPO, and the Library. \n     Moreover, as noted in Part II above, the Board has advised \n     that the Congress over time should make all currently \n     inapplicable provisions of the federal- and private-sector \n     CAA laws applicable to itself; thus the instrumentalities \n     should not become subject to those exemptions from coverage \n     attendant upon application of the CAA model.\n       Finally, the private-sector model arguably best serves the \n     goal of the CAA of achieving parity with the private sector \n     whenever possible. By so doing, those in the legislative \n     branch would live under the same legal regime as the private \n     citizen.\n     C. Comparison of the Options for Change\n       1. CAA Option: Bring the three instrumentalities fully \n           under the CAA, including the authority of the Office of \n           Compliance as it administers and enforces the Act\n       (a) Substantive rights. Covering GAO, GPO, and the Library \n     under the CAA would grant substantive rights that are \n     generally the same as those now applicable at these \n     instrumentalities. However, changes include: (i) GPO would \n     become covered under the rights of the WARN Act and EPPA, \n     which do not now apply at that instrumentality. (ii) Coverage \n     under the CAA would afford a greater scope of appropriate \n     bargaining units and collective bargaining than is now \n     established at GAO under regulations issued by the \n     Comptroller General under the GAO Personnel Act. (iii) \n     Coverage under section 220(e)(2)(H) of the CAA would add a \n     process by which the Board, with the approval of the House \n     and Senate, can remove an office from coverage under labor-\n     management provisions if exclusion is required because of \n     conflict of interest or Congress's constitutional \n     responsibilities; no such process applies now at the three \n     instrumentalities. (iv) The CAA, applying private-sector FMLA \n     rights, authorizes the employing office to recoup health \n     insurance costs from a covered employee who does not return \n     to work, to decline to restore ``key'' employees who take \n     FMLA leave, and to elect whether an employee must use \n     available paid annual or sick leave before taking leave \n     without pay; GAO and the Library have already been granted \n     these authorities, but coverage under the CAA would extend \n     these authorities to GPO. (v) CAA provisions that apply FLSA \n     rights would eliminate most use of compensatory time off, \n     ``credit hours,'' and compressed work schedules that may now \n     be used at the three instrumentalities in lieu of FLSA \n     overtime pay.\n       (b) Administrative and enforcement processes. In the \n     Section 230 Study, the Board found that the three \n     instrumentalities are subject to--a patchwork of coverages \n     and exemptions. . . . The procedural regimes at the \n     instrumentalities differ from one another, are different from \n     the CAA and are different from that in the executive branch. \n     . . . [T]he multiplicity of regulatory schemes means that, in \n     some cases, employees have more procedural options available, \n     and in some cases, fewer. Additional procedural steps may \n     afford opportunities to employees in some cases, but may also \n     be more time-consuming and inefficient. 74\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\74\\  Section 230 Study at iv.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In a number of respects, coverage under the CAA would grant \n     employees for the first time an avenue to have their claims \n     resolved by an administrative entity outside of the employing \n     instrumentality. Under present law, while employees of all \n     the instrumentalities may seek a remedy for unlawful \n     discrimination in federal district court, there are \n     limitations on the administrative remedies available outside \n     of their employing agency. At the Library, an employee \n     alleging discrimination may pursue a complaint through \n     internal Library procedures, but if the Librarian denies the \n     complaint, the employee has no right of appeal to an outside \n     administrative agency. Likewise, a GPO employee cannot appeal \n     administratively from the Public Printer's decision on a \n     complaint of discrimination on the basis of disability. The \n     GAO Personnel Appeals Board (``PAB''), which hears GAO \n     employee appeals, is administratively part of GAO, and its \n     Members are appointed by the Comptroller General.\n       In the area of occupational safety and health, the CAA \n     requires the General Counsel of the Office of Compliance to \n     conduct inspections periodically and in response to charges \n     and authorizes the prosecution of violations. Although these \n     CAA provisions already cover GAO and the Library, they do not \n     now cover GPO, where no outside agency has authority to \n     inspect or prosecute occupational safety and health \n     violations.\n\n[[Page S1041]]\n\n       The application of the CAA would end the patchwork of \n     administrative coverages and exemptions and extend an \n     administrative mechanism for resolving complaints that is \n     administered by an office independent of the employing \n     instrumentalities. The counseling and mediation system of the \n     Office provides a fair, swift, and independent mechanism for \n     informally resolving disputes. The complaint and appeals \n     process (along with the option of pursuing a civil action) \n     provides an impartial method of adjudicating and appealing \n     those disputes that cannot be resolved informally.\n       On the other hand, except in the areas of safety and \n     health, labor-management, and public access, the \n     investigatory and enforcement authorities now applicable at \n     the three instrumentalities are more extensive than those \n     under the CAA, especially without the authorities that the \n     Board recommends should be added to the CAA in Part II of \n     this Report. For example, internal procedures at the three \n     instrumentalities provide for investigation of every \n     discrimination complaint by the equal employment office of \n     the employing agency and the results of those investigations \n     are made available to the employee. Under the CAA, there is \n     no agency investigation, and an employer is not required to \n     disclose the results of any internal investigation to the \n     employee. Applying the CAA to the three instrumentalities \n     would not preclude continuing to make their internal \n     administrative and investigative procedures available for \n     employees who choose to use them, but employees might have to \n     choose whether to forgo using the internal procedures and \n     investigations in order to meet the time limits for \n     administrative or judicial claims resolution under the CAA.\n       Furthermore, the PAB General Counsel for GAO and the \n     Special Counsel for GPO provide for prosecution of \n     discrimination and other violations under certain \n     circumstances. The CAA does not now provide for prosecution \n     of discrimination or most other kinds of violations.\n       The Board also observes that the three instrumentalities \n     are now covered under federal-sector provisions of Title VII \n     and the ADEA that require equal employment opportunity \n     programs and affirmative employment plans, and that GAO's \n     programs and plans are reviewed by the PAB and GPO's programs \n     and plans are reviewed by the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission (``EEOC''). The CAA contains no comparable \n     provisions.\n       (c) Judicial processes and relief. Coverage under the CAA \n     would grant a private right of action that is not now \n     available to GPO employees to remedy FMLA and USERRA \n     violations and would clarify that GAO and Library employees \n     may use CAA judicial procedures to remedy EPPA, WARN Act, and \n     USERRA violations. The CAA would also grant the right to a \n     jury trial in all situations where it would be available in \n     the private sector, whereas a jury trial may not be available \n     now at the three instrumentalities in actions under the ADEA, \n     FMLA, or FLSA.\n       On the other hand, while the right to judicial appeal to \n     the Federal Circuit is largely the same under the CAA as it \n     is under the provisions of labor-management law currently \n     applicable at the three instrumentalities, the CAA does not \n     allow the charging party to take appeals from unfair labor \n     practice decisions and does not provide for appeal of \n     arbitral awards involving adverse actions or performance-\n     based actions.\n       (d) Substantive Rulemaking Process. GAO and the Library are \n     already subject to substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Board under CAA provisions applying rights under the EPPA, \n     WARN Act, and OSHAct, and the full application of CAA \n     coverage would also subject these two instrumentalities to \n     the Board's regulations implementing FLSA, FMLA, Chapter 71, \n     and ADA public access rights, and would subject GPO to all \n     substantive regulations under the CAA. Substantive \n     regulations are issued under section 304 of the CAA, which \n     authorizes the Board to issue regulations subject to approval \n     by the House and Senate. These regulations under the CAA must \n     generally be the same as those adopted by executive-branch \n     agencies under the laws made applicable by the CAA for the \n     private sector (or, under Chapter 71, for the federal \n     sector), or, if regulations are not adopted by the Office and \n     approved by the House and Senate, those executive-branch \n     agency regulations themselves are applied under the CAA in \n     most instances.75 The regulatory requirements made \n     applicable by the CAA are therefore established by regulatory \n     agencies independent of the employers being regulated.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\75\\ To date, regulations have been adopted and submitted to \n     the House and Senate but not approved in the following areas: \n     OSHAct, public access under the ADA, application of labor-\n     management rights to offices listed in Sec. 220(e) of the \n     CAA, and coverage of GAO and the Library under substantive \n     regulations with respect to EPPA, WARN Act, and OSHAct. \n     Regulations adopted by executive-branch agencies therefore \n     apply in all of these areas except Sec. 220(e), because \n     Sec. 411 of the CAA excepts from the default provision \n     regulations regarding the offices listed under \n     Sec. 220(e)(2). If the CAA covered the three \n     instrumentalities, Sec. 220(e) could affect them only if the \n     Board adopted regulations, approved by the House and Senate, \n     to exclude ``such other offices that perform comparable \n     functions,'' within the meaning of Sec. 220(e)(2)(H).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Currently, for the subject areas where the three \n     instrumentalities are not now subject to CAA regulations, the \n     substantive rights of employees at the three \n     instrumentalities are defined in most respects by government-\n     wide regulations adopted by executive-branch agencies. \n     However, in a few areas, the heads of these instrumentalities \n     are granted the authority to define and delimit rights for \n     their employees by regulation. For example, the GAO Personnel \n     Act authorizes the Comptroller General to establish a labor-\n     management program ``consistent'' with Chapter 71, and GAO's \n     order under this authority includes limits on appropriate \n     bargaining units and on the scope of bargaining that are more \n     restrictive than those in Chapter 71, as made applicable by \n     the CAA. The Comptroller General and the Librarian of \n     Congress have authority to promulgate substantive regulations \n     under the FMLA. The Public Printer is not bound to apply the \n     Labor Department's occupational safety and health standards, \n     provided he provides conditions ``consistent with'' those \n     standards. By contrast, if the CAA applied, these \n     instrumentalities would become subject to regulatory \n     requirements established by regulatory agencies independent \n     of the instrumentalities.\n       2. Federal-Sector Option: Bring the three instrumentalities \n           fully under federal-sector provisions of law, including \n           the authority of executive-branch agencies as they \n           administer and enforce those provisions\n       (a) Substantive rights. The substantive rights now \n     available at the three instrumentalities are mostly the same \n     as those that would become available under federal-sector \n     coverage. However, some changes would occur. For instance, \n     (i) Under the federal-sector regime, GAO and the Library \n     would no longer be covered under CAA provisions making \n     applicable the rights under the EPPA or WARN Act. (ii) GAO \n     and the Library would have coverage under the federal-sector \n     provisions of the FMLA, which do not allow the employer to \n     recoup health insurance costs from an employee who does not \n     return to work; or to limit the application of FMLA \n     restoration rights to ``key'' employees; or to elect whether \n     an employee must use available paid annual or sick leave \n     before taking leave without pay. (iii) Coverage under Chapter \n     71 would afford a greater scope of appropriate bargaining \n     units and collective bargaining than is now provided at GAO \n     under regulations issued by the Comptroller General under the \n     GAO Personnel Act.\n       (b) Administrative and enforcement processes. The \n     administrative processes now in place at GAO, GPO, and the \n     Library are similar to, and, in many instances, the same as, \n     those in effect generally for the federal sector. Of the \n     three, GPO has the most federal-sector coverage, being \n     already subject, in most areas, to the authority of the EEOC, \n     Merit Systems Protection Board (``MSPB''), and Special \n     Counsel, which investigate, bring enforcement actions, and \n     hear appeals arising out of executive-branch agencies, and \n     the Office of Personnel Management (``OPM''), which \n     promulgates government-wide regulations under the FLSA and \n     FMLA and investigates and resolves FLSA complaints. Choosing \n     the federal-sector option at GPO would extend this existing \n     situation across the board. Furthermore, whereas GPO \n     employees' ADA complaints are now investigated and resolved \n     by GPO management without any right of appeal to, or \n     investigation and prosecution by, any outside agency or \n     office, federal-sector coverage would bring such complaints \n     under the authority of executive-branch agencies. Also, \n     regarding occupational safety and health at GPO, whereas no \n     outside agency can now conduct inspections, consider employee \n     complaints, require compliance, or resolve disputes regarding \n     occupational safety and health, application of federal-sector \n     coverage would cause these functions to be performed by the \n     Department of Labor. In addition, while GPO, GAO, and the \n     Library are currently required to have internal mechanisms \n     for investigating and resolving public-access complaints \n     under the ADA, applying the federal-sector regime would \n     extend the Attorney General's authority under Executive Order \n     12250 to review the three instrumentalities' regulations, to \n     coordinate implementation, and to bring enforcement actions.\n       GAO is not now subject to executive-branch agencies' \n     authority in most respects, but was originally considered \n     part of the executive branch and remained subject to the \n     authority of the executive-branch agencies until the 1980 \n     enactment of the GAO Personnel Act, which consolidated the \n     appellate, enforcement, and oversight functions that in the \n     executive branch are performed by the EEOC, the MSPB, and the \n     Special Counsel into the function of the GAO PAB and its \n     General Counsel.76 Applying federal-sector \n     coverage would, with respect to the CAA laws, restore the \n     PAB's responsibilities to the EEOC, MSPB, and Special \n     Counsel, which, unlike the PAB, are fully separate and \n     independent from regulated employing agencies. GAO is already \n     subject to OPM's government-wide regulations and claims-\n     resolution authority under the FLSA.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\76\\ Legislative history explains that the GAO Personnel Act \n     was enacted to enable GAO to audit the executive-branch \n     personnel programs and agencies established under the Civil \n     Service Reform Act of 1978 without being subject to those \n     same programs and agencies. S. Rep. No. 96-540, 96th Cong. \n     (Dec. 20, 1979) (Governmental Affairs Committee), reprinted \n     in 1980 U.S. Code Cong. and Admin. News 50-53.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Library's internal claims processes are largely modeled \n     on those required and applied by executive-branch employing \n     agencies, but the Library has been exempted from the \n     authority of executive-branch agencies\n\n[[Page S1042]]\n\n     in most respects, with the principal exception being FLRA \n     authority over labor-management relations.77 \n     Application of federal-sector coverage would, with respect to \n     the CAA laws, extend the authority of the EEOC, MSPB, the \n     Special Counsel, and OPM to include the Library and its \n     employees.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\77\\ In an another area that is significant, though not \n     analogous to any of the laws made applicable by the CAA, the \n     Library is also subject to OPM's authority over job \n     classifications.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       (c) Judicial processes and relief. In most instances, \n     employees at the three instrumentalities are already covered \n     by the same judicial processes as federal-sector employees. \n     However, whereas PAB decisions may be reviewed only by appeal \n     to the Federal Circuit, federal-sector procedures would allow \n     suit and trial de novo after exhausting all administrative \n     remedies, even after decision on appeal to the EEOC or the \n     MSPB. On the other hand, GAO and Library employees would no \n     longer have a private right of action under FMLA, and, unlike \n     the CAA, which now provides for judicial review of OSHAct \n     decisions regarding GAO and the Library, final occupational \n     safety and health decisions under the federal-sector scheme \n     are made by the President.\n       (d) Substantive rulemaking process. In a number of areas, \n     the three instrumentalities are already subject to the same \n     government-wide regulations as are in place in the federal \n     sector. GAO and GPO are subject to OPM's regulations under \n     the FLSA, GPO is subject to OPM's regulations under the FMLA, \n     and GPO and the Library are subject to FLRA's regulations \n     under Chapter 71. However, in a number of instances the three \n     instrumentalities are currently able to issue their own \n     regulations without reference to the regulations in the \n     federal sector, as described at page 33 above in the \n     discussion of the substantive rulemaking process under the \n     CAA option. Coverage by the federal-sector regime would \n     subject the three instrumentalities to uniform government-\n     wide regulations in all areas.\n       3. Private-Sector Option: Bring the three instrumentalities \n           fully under private-sector provisions of law, including \n           the authority of executive-branch agencies as they \n           administer and enforce those provisions\n       (a) Substantive rights. The substantive rights and \n     responsibilities under the current regimes at the three \n     instrumentalities are generally similar to what would be \n     provided under private-sector provisions of law, with the \n     notable exception of the area of labor-management relations \n     where application of private-sector substantive law would \n     grant to employees at the three instrumentalities certain \n     rights, such as the right to strike, unavailable to other \n     federal government employees. There are also a number of \n     other differences between private-sector provisions and the \n     substantive provisions of law currently applicable at the \n     three instrumentalities. For example, the application of \n     private-sector provisions of the FLSA would eliminate most \n     use of compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay. Also, \n     private-sector FMLA provisions would apply at GPO, which \n     allow the employer to recoup health insurance costs from an \n     employee who does not return to work; to limit the \n     application of FMLA restoration rights to ``key'' employees; \n     and to elect whether an employee must use available paid \n     annual or sick leave before taking leave without pay. \n     Finally, GPO, which is not now covered by WARN Act or EPPA \n     rights, would become subject to those laws.\n       (b) Administrative processes. If provisions of private-\n     sector law were applied, the greatest impact would be in the \n     area of administrative processes. Under private-sector \n     schemes generally, with the exception of occupational safety \n     and health and labor-management relations, the agency's \n     responsibility is limited to investigation and prosecution, \n     without administrative adjudication and appeal.\n       The consequences of application of private-sector \n     administrative schemes would be different at each \n     instrumentality. The most significant change would be at the \n     Library, where outside agencies now have little role in \n     either investigation and prosecution or in administrative \n     adjudication and appeals. If private-sector coverage applied, \n     an agency outside of the Library would have authority to \n     investigate and prosecute discrimination, FLSA, FMLA, and \n     other laws. At GAO and GPO, the present adjudicatory and \n     prosecutory schemes would be replaced by a new prosecutorial \n     regime handled by agencies ordinarily responsible for \n     private-sector enforcement. For example, FLSA and FMLA \n     enforcement would be handled by the Labor Department in its \n     investigatory and prosecutorial role, rather than OPM and the \n     PAB at GAO and OPM and MSPB at GPO. However, under the \n     currently applicable provisions of law and regulation that \n     govern the federal sector with respect to the FLSA, OPM has \n     authority to direct GPO and GAO to comply, whereas under the \n     provisions of law and regulation that govern the private \n     sector, the Labor Department would have to bring suit to \n     enforce compliance. In the area of discrimination at GPO, \n     rather than appeal rights to EEOC and MSPB, there would be \n     investigation and prosecution by the EEOC, while at GAO, the \n     PAB's role would be replaced by EEOC investigation and \n     prosecution. In the area of occupational safety and health, \n     the enforcement responsibilities for GAO and the Library \n     would be transferred from the OC to the Labor Department, and \n     the Labor Department would also assume these responsibilities \n     for GPO, where currently no outside agency exercises these \n     responsibilities.\n       (c) Judicial processes and relief. In the area of judicial \n     processes and relief, if private-sector laws were applied, a \n     private right of action would be added under a number of \n     provisions where it does not currently exist. For example, \n     GPO employees would gain a private right of action under FMLA \n     and USERRA. GAO and Library employees would gain an \n     unambiguous private right of action under WARN, USERRA, and \n     EPPA. Moreover, punitive damages are part of the private-\n     sector remedial scheme, whereas they are currently \n     unavailable at the three instrumentalities.\n       (d) Adoption of substantive regulations. Application to the \n     three instrumentalities of the substantive rulemaking process \n     governing the private sector would resolve concerns \n     respecting independent rulemaking authority under the regimes \n     currently in place at these instrumentalities. The agencies \n     issuing regulations that govern the private sector have no \n     employment relationship with the community they regulate, \n     unlike the three instrumentalities themselves when they \n     promulgate substantive rules. Moreover, a switch to private-\n     sector coverage in the areas of OSHAct, WARN Act, and EPPA \n     would remove GAO and the Library, which are currently subject \n     to CAA substantive rules in those areas, from the section 304 \n     process of adoption and issuance of substantive regulations.\n       The three instrumentalities are currently covered by a \n     number of civil service and other protections which have no \n     analogue in the CAA and which the Board does not undertake to \n     review here. The Board determined that such substantive \n     rights under federal-sector or other laws having no analogue \n     in the CAA, and processes used to implement, remedy, or \n     enforce such rights, should not be affected by the coverage \n     under any of the options. However, to avoid creating \n     duplicative rights and remedies, the application of the CAA \n     or of analogous federal-sector or private-sector provisions \n     should supersede existing provisions affording substantially \n     similar substantive rights or establishing administrative, \n     judicial, or rulemaking processes to implement, remedy, or \n     enforce such rights.\n     D. Recommendations\n       1. The current ``patchwork of coverages and exemptions'' \n           78 at GAO, GPO, and the Library should be \n           replaced by coverage under either the CAA or the \n           federal-sector regime\n       In its Section 230 Study, the Board described the current \n     systems in place at the instrumentalities, and stated: \n     ``Congressional decisions made over many years in different \n     statutes subject the three instrumentalities to the \n     authorities of certain executive-branch agencies with respect \n     to certain laws, but exempt them from executive-branch \n     authority with respect to others. . . . The result is a \n     patchwork of coverages and exemptions from the procedures \n     afforded under civil service law and the authority of \n     executive-branch agencies, and from the procedures afforded \n     under the CAA and the authority of the Office of \n     Compliance.'' 79\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\78\\ Section 230 Study at iv.\n     \\79\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In preparing this 1998 Report, the Board considered whether \n     to recommend that serious gaps in coverage at the three \n     instrumentalities be filled without fundamentally changing \n     the regimes already in place at each instrumentality. \n     However, the Board unanimously rejected that piecemeal \n     approach. The ``patchwork'' nature of existing coverages and \n     exemptions yields complexity and areas of legal uncertainty \n     in coverage at the three instrumentalities. Furthermore, in \n     several areas, the three instrumentalities are not now \n     subject to the authority of any outside regulatory or \n     personnel agency to promulgate regulations, resolve claims, \n     or exercise enforcement authorities.\n       Accordingly, the Board unanimously concluded that this \n     current system is less comprehensive and effective than, and \n     should be replaced by, coverage under one of the options \n     described in the previous section. The Board also agreed \n     unanimously that coverage under the private-sector regime is \n     not the best of the three options it considered. However, the \n     Board did not reach a consensus as to whether the CAA or the \n     laws and regulations applicable in the federal sector should \n     be made applicable to GAO, GPO, and the Library. Instead, for \n     the reasons stated below, Members Adler and Seitz concluded \n     that the three instrumentalities should be covered under the \n     CAA, with certain modifications, and Chairman Nager and \n     Member Hunter concluded that the three instrumentalities \n     should be made fully subject to the laws and regulations \n     generally applicable in the federal sector.\n       2. Members Adler and Seitz have concluded that GAO, GPO, \n           and the Library should be covered under the CAA, \n           including the authority of the Office of Compliance, \n           and that the CAA, as applied to these \n           instrumentalities, should be modified--(a) to add \n           Office of Compliance enforcement authorities as \n           recommended in Part II of this Report and (b) to \n           preserve certain rights now applicable at the three \n           instrumentalities.\n       Members Adler and Seitz concluded that the three \n     instrumentalities should be\n\n[[Page S1043]]\n\n     brought under the CAA primarily for two reasons. As noted \n     above, the Board in the Section 230 Study decided that its \n     statutory mandate was to evaluate the ``comprehensiveness and \n     effectiveness'' of the existing statutory and regulatory \n     regimes at the three instrumentalities by comparing them to \n     the regime under the CAA. The application of the CAA to the \n     three instrumentalities would assure that this standard of \n     ``comprehensiveness and effectiveness'' is achieved \n     throughout the legislative branch.\n       Second, all laws made applicable by the CAA are \n     administered by a single Office. The advantages of this \n     unified structure are that employees can turn to a single \n     place for assistance; efficient and uniform procedures under \n     a model administrative dispute resolution system have been \n     established for various types of complaints; and a single \n     body of substantive regulations and decisions, which is as \n     internally consistent as possible within the constraints of \n     applicable law, is being developed. Extending the \n     jurisdiction of the Office to include GAO, GPO, and the \n     Library for all of the laws made applicable by the CAA will \n     foster such efficient and consistent administration of the \n     laws at the three instrumentalities, and will put the \n     expertise and resources of the Office of Compliance to full \n     use throughout the legislative branch.\n       The conclusions of Members Adler and Seitz are premised and \n     dependent upon the CAA's being applied to the three \n     instrumentalities with certain modifications. First, the Act \n     should be amended to enlarge the Office of Compliance's \n     enforcement authorities as recommended above in Part II of \n     this Report. The Board there described its determination that \n     certain additional provisions of CAA laws should be made \n     applicable to all employing offices of the legislative branch \n     that are now covered under the CAA, and, for the reasons \n     discussed above, such additional provisions should be made \n     applicable to GAO, GPO, and the Library as well.\n       Second, the rights extended by the CAA in the House and \n     Senate and the smaller instrumentalities are subject to \n     certain limitations that do not apply under the regimes now \n     at GAO, GPO, and the Library. These limitations appear to \n     have been included in the CAA to preserve the independence of \n     the House and Senate, to protect against publicity attendant \n     to complaints or litigation that Congress believed might \n     unduly affect the legislative and electoral processes, and to \n     avoid labor activities that Congress was concerned might, in \n     certain situations, engender conflict of interest or \n     interfere with fulfillment by Congress of its constitutional \n     responsibilities. However sound these reasons may have been \n     with respect to Congressional offices for which the CAA was \n     principally designed, these reasons have less force as to \n     GAO, GPO, and the Library in view of their respective roles \n     in the legislative process.\n       Members Adler and Seitz therefore believe that limitations \n     such as those imposed by sections 220(c)(2)(H) and 416 of the \n     CAA should not apply at GAO, GPO, and the Library. Section \n     220(c)(2)(H) of the CAA establishes a process by which the \n     Board, with the approval of the House and Senate, may remove \n     an office from coverage under some or all provisions of \n     labor-management law if ``required because of--(i) a conflict \n     of interest or appearance of a conflict of interest; or (ii) \n     Congress' constitutional responsibilities.'' 80 No \n     such process applies under labor-management law now \n     applicable at GAO, GPO, and the Library, and none should be \n     made applicable to them under the CAA. Section 416 of the CAA \n     makes the counseling, mediation, and administrative hearing \n     processes of the CAA ``confidential.'' The CAA, in being made \n     applicable to these three instrumentalities, should not \n     impose confidentiality requirements except to the same extent \n     that confidentiality is imposed in proceedings by the \n     executive-branch agencies implementing the CAA laws and to \n     the extent necessary to facilitate effective counseling and \n     mediation under Sec. Sec. 402 and 403 of the \n     CAA.81\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\80\\ Section 220(e)(1)(B) of the CAA.\n     \\81\\ Cf. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 574 (duties of confidentiality in \n     mediation or other proceedings under the Administrative \n     Dispute Resolution Act).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       3. Chairman Nager and Member Hunter have concluded that the \n           federal-sector model should apply, including the \n           authority of executive-branch personnel-management and \n           regulatory agencies to implement and enforce the laws.\n       Chairman Nager and Member Hunter have concluded that GAO, \n     GPO, and the Library should be brought under the statutory \n     and regulatory regime that applies generally in the federal \n     sector, including the authority of executive-branch agencies \n     as they administer and enforce laws in the federal sector, \n     for several reasons. Insofar as the present statutory scheme \n     is not ``comprehensive and effective'' because it does not \n     provide employees access to an outside regulatory entity to \n     promulgate regulations and resolve claims, this problem could \n     be solved by extending the authority of the executive-branch \n     agencies over the three instrumentalities.\n       GAO, GPO, and the Library are already subject to many of \n     the same personnel statutes that apply generally in the \n     federal sector and, in some instances, to the authority of \n     executive-branch agencies as well. Making the federal-sector \n     regime fully applicable would be less disruptive to the three \n     instrumentalities than replacing the coverage already in \n     effect with either the CAA or private-sector coverage.\n       Furthermore, employment at these three instrumentalities is \n     more akin to the large civilian departments and agencies of \n     the executive branch, for which federal-sector laws and \n     regulations were designed, than the employing offices of the \n     House and Senate, for which the CAA was primarily designed. \n     For example, substantive provisions of federal-sector \n     statutes and regulations in such areas as overtime pay, \n     family and medical leave, and advance notification of layoffs \n     are designed to dove-tail with merit-based retention systems, \n     position-classification systems, leave policies, and other \n     personnel practices that are found generally in both the \n     executive branch and the three large instrumentalities, but \n     that are not common in either House and Senate offices or the \n     private sector. Also, while federal-sector law in some \n     respects limits the right to sue, it also affords \n     administrative procedures and remedies that exceed what are \n     available under the CAA or in the private sector. Such \n     procedures have traditionally been seen as appropriate to \n     avoid politicized employment and to provide for \n     accountability in large, apolitical bureaucracies. In \n     congressional staff, where political appointment is generally \n     seen as proper and where accountability is achieved through \n     the electoral process, these federal-sector procedures and \n     remedies have been considered inappropriate. However, the \n     three instrumentalities have traditionally been seen as \n     having many of the attributes of the large, apolitical \n     bureaucracy, and employment practices have largely followed \n     the federal-sector model.\n       Placing GAO, GPO, and the Library under federal-sector \n     coverage would also have the salutary effect of giving \n     Congress the experience of living under the laws that it \n     enacts for the executive branch. According to the authors of \n     the CAA, a principal goal of that Act was to make Congress \n     live under the laws that it enacts for the private sector, so \n     that Congress can better understand the consequences of those \n     laws. Congress might likewise better understand the \n     consequences of the laws that it enacts for the executive \n     branch if the large instrumentalities of Congress were fully \n     subject to those laws.\n\n  Appendix I--Inapplicable Private-Sector Provisions of the Laws Made \n                         Applicable by the CAA\n\n       This table describes significant statutory provisions that \n     are contained in the laws made applicable by the CAA (the \n     ``CAA laws'') and that apply in the private sector, but that \n     do not apply fully to the legislative branch. ``Apply'' means \n     that a provision is referenced and incorporated by the CAA, \n     or a substantially similar provision is set forth in the CAA, \n     or the provision applies to the legislative branch by its own \n     terms without regard to the CAA. Whether provisions apply to \n     GAO, GPO, and the Library of Congress is not discussed in \n     this table, but is analyzed in the tables contained in \n     Appendix III of this Report.\n\n TITLE VII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 (``TITLE VII'') AND 42 U.S.C.\n                         Sec.

SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS\n \n1. Employment discrimination against individuals    Secs. 703(a)(1); 42\n employed by other employers. Sec.  703(a)(1) of     U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n Title VII forbids employment discrimination by      2000e-2(a)(1).\n covered employers against ``any individual.''\n Courts have held that this prohibition extends\n beyond the immediate employer-employee\n relationship under certain circumstances,\n including where a defendant who does not employ\n an individual controls that individual's access\n to employment with another employer and denies\n access based on unlawful criteria.1 Under the\n CAA, an employing office may only be charged with\n discrimination by a ``covered employee,'' defined\n as an employee of the nine legislative-branch\n employers listed in Sec.  101(3) of the CAA.\n2. Publication of discriminatory notices or         Sec. 704(b); 42\n advertisements. Publication of discriminatory       U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n notices or advertisements is prohibited under       3(b).\n Sec.  704(b) of Title VII. Under the CAA, a\n notice or advertisement might be evidence of\n discriminatory animus, but Sec.  704(b) of Title\n VII, which makes unlawful the mere publication of\n a discriminatory notice or advertisement, is not\n referenced by the CAA.\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n\n \n3. Coverage of unions. Discrimination by private-   Secs. 703(c), 704,\n sector unions is forbidden by Sec. Sec.  703(c)     706; 42 U.S.C. Sec.\n and 704 of Title VII and is subject to              Sec.  2000e-2(c),\n enforcement under Sec.  706. The CAA does not       2000e-3, 2000e-5.\n make these provisions applicable against unions\n discriminating against legislative branch\n employees, because Sec.  201 of the CAA forbids\n discrimination only in ``personnel actions'' and\n Sec. Sec.  401-408 of the CAA allow complaints\n only against employing offices. (Unlawful\n discrimination by a union may be an unfair labor\n practice under Sec.  220 of the CAA, but the\n procedures and remedies under that section are\n very different from those under Title VII and\n under the CAA for violations of Title VII rights\n and protections.) A similar situation exists in\n the executive branch, where Sec.  717 of Title\n VII does not cover discrimination by unions\n against executive branch employees, but courts\n and the EEOC are divided as to whether the\n private-sector provisions of Title VII and 42\n U.S.C. Sec.  1981 apply by their own terms to\n such discrimination. See generally II Lindemann &\n Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1320,\n 1575 (3d ed. 1996). Similarly, differing views\n might be expressed with respect to whether these\n private-sector provisions apply by their own\n terms to forbid discrimination by unions against\n legislative-branch employees.\n4. Consideration of political party, domicile, or   Sec. 703; 42 U.S.C.\n political compatibility. Under the CAA, Sec.  502   Sec.  2000e-2.\n provides that consideration of political party,\n domicile, or political compatibility by Members,\n committees, or leadership offices shall not be a\n violation of Sec.  201, which is the section that\n makes applicable the rights and protections of\n Title VII. Under Title VII, there is no specific\n immunity for consideration of political party,\n domicile, or political compatibility.\n \nB. ENFORCEMENT\n \nAgency Enforcement Authorities:\n    5. Agency responsibility to investigate         Sec. 706(b); 42\n     charges filed by an employee or Commission      U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     Member. Title VII requires the EEOC to          5(b).\n     investigate charges filed by either an\n     employee or a Member of the Commission. The\n     CAA neither references these provisions nor\n     sets forth similar provisions authorizing\n     agency investigation.\n    6. Agency responsibility to ``endeavor to       Sec. 706(b); 42\n     eliminate'' the violation by informal           U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     conciliation. Title VII requires that, upon     5(b).\n     the filing of a charge, if the EEOC\n     determines that ``there is reasonable cause\n     to believe that the charge is true,'' the\n     agency must ``endeavor to eliminate any such\n     alleged unlawful employment practice'' by\n     informal conference, conciliation, and\n     persuasion. The CAA does not reference these\n     provisions; it requires the mediation of\n     allegations of discrimination and requires\n     approval of settlements by the Executive\n     Director, but does not require any person\n     involved in the mediation or in approving the\n     settlement to ``endeavor to eliminate'' the\n     alleged discrimination.\n    7. Agency authority to bring judicial           Sec. 706(f)(1); 42\n     enforcement actions. Title VII authorizes the   U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     EEOC to bring a civil action. The CAA neither   5(f)(1).\n     references these provisions nor sets forth\n     similar provisions authorizing an agency to\n     bring enforcement proceedings.\n    8. Agency authority to intervene in private     Sec. 706(f)(1); 42\n     civil action of general public importance.      U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     Under Title VII, the EEOC may intervene in a    5(f)(1).\n     private action of general public importance.\n     The CAA neither references these provisions\n     nor sets forth similar provisions authorizing\n     an agency to intervene in private actions.\n    9. Agency authority to apply to court for       Sec. 706(i); 42\n     enforcement of judicial orders. Title VII       U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     authorizes the EEOC to commence judicial        5(i).\n     proceedings to compel compliance with\n     judicial orders. The CAA does not reference\n     these provisions. Sec.  407(a)(2) of the CAA\n     enables the Office of Compliance to petition\n     the Court of Appeals to enforce final orders\n     of a hearing officer or the Board, but the\n     CAA sets forth no provision enabling an\n     agency to seek the enforcement of judicial\n     orders.\n    10. Grant of subpoena power and other powers    Secs. 709(a), 710;\n     for investigations and hearings. Title VII      42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n     grants the EEOC powers to gain access to         2000e-8(a), 2000e-\n     evidence, including subpoena powers, in         9.\n     support of its investigations and hearings.\n     The CAA neither references these provisions\n     nor sets forth similar provisions granting an\n     agency investigatory powers. (Sec.  405(f) of\n     the CAA grants subpoena powers to hearing\n     officers, and Sec.  408 authorizes civil\n     actions in which courts may issue subpoenas,\n     but these CAA provisions do not subpoena\n     powers for use in agency investigation.)\n    11. Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.   Sec. 709(c); 42\n     Title VII requires employers in the private     U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     sector to make and preserve such records and    8(c).\n     make such reports therefrom as the EEOC shall\n     prescribe by regulation or order, after\n     public hearing, as reasonable, necessary, or\n     appropriate for enforcement. The CAA does not\n     reference these provisions, and the Board, in\n     issuing substantive regulations with respect\n     to several other laws, found that\n     recordkeeping and reporting requirements\n     under those laws were not made applicable by\n     the CAA.\nAdministrative and Judicial Procedures and\n Remedies:\n    12. Suing individuals as agent; possibility of  Sec. 701(b); 42\n     individual liability. Because the definition    U.S.C. Sec.\n     of ``employer'' in Title VII includes ``any     2000e(b).\n     agent,'' a plaintiff may choose to sue the\n     employer by naming an appropriate individual\n     in the capacity of agent. Furthermore, while\n     many recent cases hold that individuals may\n     not be held individually liable in\n     discrimination cases, some cases hold to the\n     contrary and the issue remains unresolved.\n     See generally II Lindemann & Grossman,\n     Employment Discrimination Law 1314-16 (3d ed.\n     1996). Under the CAA, individuals may be\n     neither sued nor held individually liable,\n     because only an employing office may be named\n     as respondent or defendant under Sec. Sec.\n     401-408 and all awards and settlements must\n     generally be paid out of an account of the\n     Office of Compliance under Sec.  415(a).\n    13. Enforceability of subpoenas for             Sec. 706(f)(1); 42\n     information or documents within the             U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     jurisdiction of the House or Senate. Title      5(f)(1).\n     VII authorizes civil actions in which courts\n     exercise their ordinary subpoena authority.\n     The CAA also authorizes civil actions, as\n     well as administrative adjudications, but\n     such authorization is subject to Sec.  413 of\n     the CAA, by which the House and Senate\n     decline to waive ``any power of either the\n     Senate or the House of Representatives under\n     the Constitution,'' including under the\n     ``Journal of Proceedings Clause,'' and under\n     the rules of either House relating to records\n     and information.\n    14. Appointment of counsel and waiver of fees.  Sec. 706(f)(1); 42\n     Sec.  706(f)(1) of Title VII authorizes the     U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     court to appoint an attorney for the            5(f)(1).\n     complainant in a private action and to waive\n     costs. The CAA does not reference Sec.\n     706(f)(1). In judicial proceedings under the\n     CAA, the courts may exercise their general\n     powers to authorize proceedings in forma\n     pauperis and waive fees and costs and appoint\n     counsel if a party is unable to pay. See 28\n     U.S.C. Sec.  1915. In administrative\n     proceedings under the CAA, there are no fees\n     and costs to waive, but there is also no\n     power to appoint counsel.\n    15. Agency authority to apply for TRO or        Sec. 706(f)(2); 42\n     preliminary relief. Sec.  706(f)(2) of Title    U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     VII authorizes the EEOC to bring an action      5(f)(2).\n     for a temporary restraining order (``TRO'')\n     or preliminary relief pending resolution of a\n     charge. The CAA neither references Sec.\n     706(f)(2) nor sets forth similar provisions\n     authorizing TROs or preliminary relief, and\n     the CAA does not allow a covered employee to\n     commence an administrative complaint or civil\n     action until after having completed periods\n     of counseling and mediation and an additional\n     period of at least 30 days\n    16. Private right to sue immediately, without   42 U.S.C. Sec.\n     having exhausted administrative remedies. An    1981.\n     employee alleging race or color\n     discrimination who prefers not to pursue a\n     remedy through the EEOC may choose to sue\n     immediately under 42 U.S.C. Sec.  1981. The\n     CAA allows a covered employee to file an\n     administrative complaint or commence a civil\n     action only after having completed periods of\n     counseling and mediation and an additional\n     period of at least 30 days..\nDefense:\n    17. Defense for good faith reliance on agency   Sec. 713(b); 42\n     interpretations. Sec.  713(b) of Title VII      U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     provides a defense for an employer who relies   12(b).\n     in good faith on an interpretation by the\n     EEOC. The CAA does not specifically reference\n     Sec.  713(b), but the Board decided that a\n     similar defense in the Portal-to-Portal Act\n     (``PPA'') was incorporated into Sec.  203 of\n     the CAA and applies where an employing office\n     relies on an interpretation of the Wage and\n     Hour Division.\nPunitive Damages:\n    18. Punitive damages. 42 U.S.C. Sec.            42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n     1981a(b)(1) authorizes punitive damages in      1981, 1981a(b)(1).\n     cases under Title VII where malice or\n     reckless indifference is demonstrated, and\n     under 42 U.S.C. Sec.  1981 punitive damages\n     may be warranted in cases of race or color\n     discrimination. However, Sec.  1981a(b)(1) is\n     not referenced by the CAA at all, and Sec.\n     1981 is referenced by Sec.  201(b)(1)(B) of\n     the CAA with respect to the awarding of\n     ``compensatory damages'' only; furthermore,\n     Sec.  225(c) of the CAA expressly precludes\n     the awarding of punitive damages.\n \nC. OTHER AGENCY AUTHORITIES\n \n19. Notice-posting requirements. Title VII          Sec. 711; 42 U.S.C.\n requires employers, employment agencies, and        Sec.  2000e-10.\n unions to post notices prepared or approved by\n the EEOC, and establishes fines for violation.\n The CAA does not reference these provisions, and\n the Board, in issuing substantive regulations\n with respect to several other laws, found that\n notice-posting requirements under those laws were\n not incorporated by the CAA.\n20. Authority to issue interpretations and          Sec. 713(b); 42\n opinions. Sec.  713(b) of Title VII establishes a   U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n defense for good-faith reliance on ``any written    12(b).\n interpretation and opinion'' of the EEOC, and the\n EEOC has established a process by which ``[a]ny\n interested person desiring a written title VII\n interpretation or opinion from the Commission may\n make such a request.'' 29 C.F.R. Sec.  1601.91 et\n seq. The CAA does not reference Sec.  713(b)\n specifically. Furthermore, as noted on page 4,\n row 17, above, the Board decided that the defense\n for good-faith reliance stated in the PPA, which\n is similar to the defense in Sec.  713(b), was\n incorporated into Sec.  203 of the CAA; but the\n Board also then stated that ``it seems unwise, if\n not legally improper, for the Board to set forth\n its views on interpretive ambiguities in the\n regulations outside of the adjudicatory context\n of individual cases,'' and ``the Board would in\n the exercise of its considered judgment decline\n to provide authoritative opinions to employing\n offices as part of its ``education'' and\n ``information'' programs.'' 142 Cong. Rec. S221,\n S222-S223 (daily ed. Jan. 22, 1996).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1 See, e.g., Sibley Memorial Hosp. v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338, 1341 (D.C.\n  Cir. 1973) (``nowhere are there words of limitation that restrict\n  references in the Act to `any individual' as comprehending only an\n  employee of the employer,'' nor could the court perceive ``any good\n  reason to confine the meaning of `any individual' to include only\n  former employees and applicants for employment, in addition to present\n  employees''); Moland v. Bil-Mar Foods, 994 F.Supp. 1061, 1075 (N.D.\n  Iowa 1998) (interlocutory appeal certified) (trucking company's\n  employee assigned to scale house on processing-plant premises could\n  maintain sex discrimination complaint against processing company);\n  King v.

Ill. 1993)\n  (cleaning company and its chairman held potentially liable under Title\n  VII for causing a high-rise building to fire a security guard).\n\n\n         AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 1967 (``ADEA'')\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA. SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS\n \n1. Employment discrimination against individuals    Sec. 4(a)(1); 29\n employed by other employers. Sec. 4(a)(1) of the    U.S.C. Sec.\n ADEA forbids employment discrimination by covered   623(a)(1).\n employers against ``any individual.'' As\n discussed at page 1, row 1, above, courts have\n held that a Title VII provision forbidding\n discrimination against ``any individual'' extends\n beyond the immediate employer-employee\n relationship under certain circumstances,\n including where a defendant who does not employ\n an individual controls that individual's access\n to employment with another employer and denies\n access based on unlawful criteria. Under the CAA,\n an employing office may only be charged with\n discrimination by a ``covered employee,'' defined\n as an employee of the nine legislative-branch\n employers listed in Sec. 101(3).\n2. Reduction of wages to achieve compliance. Sec.   Sec. 4(a)(3); 29\n 4(a)(3) of the ADEA forbids employers in the        U.S.C. Sec.\n private sector to reduce the wage rate of any       623(a)(3).\n employee in order to comply with the ADEA. Sec.\n 4(a)(3) is not referenced by the CAA, and Sec. 15\n of the ADEA, which is referenced by Sec.\n 201(a)(2) of the CAA, contains a subsection (f)\n that specifically precludes the application of\n any provision outside of Sec. 15.\n\n[[Page S1045]]\n\n \n3. Publication of discriminatory notices or         Sec. 4(e); 29 U.S.C.\n advertisements. Publication of discriminatory       Sec. 623(e).\n notices or advertisements is prohibited by Sec.\n 4(e) of the ADEA. Under the CAA, a notice or\n advertisement might be evidence of discriminatory\n animus, but Sec. 4(e) of the ADEA, which makes\n unlawful the mere publication of a discriminatory\n notice or advertisement, is not referenced by the\n CAA, and Sec. 15 of the ADEA, which is referenced\n by Sec. 201(a)(2) of the CAA, contains a\n subsection (f) that specifically precludes the\n application of any provision outside of Sec. 15.\n4. Coverage of unions. Sec. 4(c)-(e) of the ADEA    Secs. 4(c)-(e), 7;\n forbids discrimination by unions in the private     29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n sector, and these provisions may be enforced        623(c)-(e), 626.\n against private-sector unions under Sec. 7 of the\n ADEA. The CAA does not make these provisions\n applicable to unions discriminating against\n legislative branch employees, because Sec. 201 of\n the CAA only forbids discrimination in\n ``personnel actions'' and Sec. Sec. 401-408 allow\n complaints only against employing offices.\n (Unlawful discrimination by a union may be an\n unfair labor practice under Sec. 220 of the CAA,\n but the procedures and remedies under that\n section are very different from those under the\n ADEA and under the CAA for violations of ADEA\n rights and protections.) As noted at page 1, row\n 3, above, a similar situation exists in the\n executive branch, where Sec. 717 of Title VII\n does not cover discrimination by unions against\n executive branch employees, but courts and the\n EEOC are divided as to whether the private-sector\n provisions of Title VII and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981\n apply by their own terms to such discrimination.\n Similarly, differing views might be expressed\n with respect to whether the private-sector\n provisions of the ADEA apply by their own terms\n to forbid discrimination by unions against\n legislative-branch employees.\n5. Mandatory retirement for state and local police  Sec. 4(j); 29 U.S.C.\n forces. Sec. 4(j) of the ADEA allows age-based      Sec. 623(j).\n hiring and firing of state and local law\n enforcement officers. The CAA does not reference\n Sec. 4(j) of the ADEA, and Sec. 15 of the ADEA,\n which is referenced by Sec. 201(a)(2) of the CAA,\n contains a subsection (f) that specifically\n precludes the application of any provision\n outside of Sec. 15. Furthermore, the CAA does not\n contain any provisions similar to Sec. 4(f) of\n the ADEA providing an exception for the Capitol\n Police. However, the Capitol Police Retirement\n Act (``CPRA'), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8425, imposes age-\n based mandatory retirement for Capitol Police\n Officer. The CAA does not state expressly whether\n it repeals the CPRA, but the Federal Circuit held\n that the application of ADEA rights and\n protections by the Government Employee Rights\n Act, a predecessor to the CAA that applied\n certain rights and protections to the Senate, did\n not implicitly repeal the CPRA. Riggin v. Office\n of Senate Fair Employment Practices, 61 F.3d 1563\n (Fed. Cir. 1995).\n6. State and local police officers entitlement to   Sec. 4(j); 29 U.S.C.\n job-performance testing to continue employment      Sec. 623(j).\n after retirement age. Under Sec. 4(j) of the\n ADEA, after a study and rulemaking by the Labor\n Secretary are completed, state and local law\n enforcement officers who exceed mandatory\n retirement age will become entitled to an annual\n opportunity to demonstrate job fitness to\n continue employment. The CAA does not reference\n Sec. 4(j) of the ADEA, and Sec. 15 of the ADEA,\n which is referenced by Sec. 201(a)(2) of the CAA,\n contains a subsection (f) that specifically\n precludes the application of any provision\n outside of Sec. 15. (Whether the Capitol Police\n remain subject to mandatory retirement at all is\n discussed in row 5 above.).\n7. Age-based mandatory retirement of executives     Sec. 12(c); 29\n and high policy-makers. Sec. 12(c) of the ADEA      U.S.C. Sec. 631(c).\n allows aged-based mandatory retirement for bona\n fide executives and high policy-makers in the\n private sector. The CAA does not reference Sec.\n 12(c) of the ADEA, and Sec. 15 of the ADEA, which\n is referenced by Sec. 201(a)(2) of the CAA,\n contains a subsection (f) that specifically\n precludes the application of any provision\n outside of Sec. 15.\n8. Consideration of political party, domicile, or   Sec. 4; 29 U.S.C.\n political compatibility. Under the CAA, Sec. 502    Sec. 623.\n provides that consideration of political party,\n domicile, or political compatibility by Members,\n committees, or leadership offices shall not be a\n violation of Sec. 201, which is the section that\n makes applicable the rights and protections of\n the ADEA. Under the ADEA, there is no specific\n immunity for consideration of political party,\n domicile, or political compatibility.\n \nB. ENFORCEMENT....................................\n \nAgency Enforcement Authorities:\n    9. Grant of subpoena power and other powers     Sec. 7(a); 29 U.S.C.\n     for investigations and hearings. The ADEA       Sec. 626(a),\n     grants the EEOC subpoena and other              referencing Sec. 9\n     investigatory powers for use in                 of FLSA, 29 U.S.C.\n     investigations and hearings. The CAA neither    Sec. 209.\n     references these provisions nor sets forth\n     similar provisions granting an agency\n     investigatory powers. (Sec. 405(f) of the CAA\n     grants subpoena powers to hearing officers,\n     and Sec. 408 authorizes civil actions in\n     which courts may issue subpoenas, but these\n     CAA provisions do not grant subpoena powers\n     for use in agency investigation).\n    10. Authority to receive and investigate        Sec. 7(a), (d); 29\n     charges and complaints and to conduct           U.S.C. Sec. 626(a),\n     investigations on agency's initiative. Under    (d), and\n     authority of Sec. 7 of the ADEA, the EEOC       referencing Sec.\n     investigates employee charges of ADEA           11(a) of FLSA, 29\n     violations and initiates investigations on      U.S.C. Sec. 211(a).\n     its own initiative. The CAA neither\n     references these provisions nor sets forth\n     similar provisions authorizing agency\n     investigations.\n    11. Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.   Secs. 7(a); 29\n     The ADEA empowers the EEOC to require the       U.S.C. Sec. 626(a),\n     keeping of necessary and appropriate records    referencing Sec.\n     in accordance with the powers in Sec. 11 of     11(c) of FLSA, 29\n     the FLSA. That section requires employers in    U.S.C. Sec. 211(c).\n     the private sector to make and preserve such\n     records and make such reports therefrom as\n     the agency shall prescribe by regulation or\n     order as necessary or appropriate for\n     enforcement. EEOC regulations specify the\n     ``payroll'' records that employers must\n     maintain and preserve for at least 3 years\n     and the ``personnel or employment'' records\n     that employers must maintain and preserve for\n     at least 1 year. 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1627.3. EEOC\n     regulations further require that each\n     employer ``shall make such extension,\n     recomputation or transcriptions of his\n     records and shall submit such reports\n     concerning actions taken and limitations and\n     classifications of individuals set forth in\n     records'' as the EEOC or its representative\n     may request in writing. 29 C.F.R. Sec.\n     1627.7. The CAA does not reference these\n     provisions, and the Board, in issuing\n     substantive regulations with respect to\n     several other laws, found that recordkeeping\n     and reporting requirements under those laws\n     were not made applicable by the CAA.\n    12. Agency authority to bring judicial          Sec. 7(b); 29 U.S.C.\n     enforcement actions. The ADEA authorizes the    Sec. 626(a),\n     EEOC to bring an action in district court       referencing Sec.\n     seeking damages, including liquidated           Sec. 16(c), 17 of\n     damages, and injunctive relief. The CAA         FLSA, 29 U.S.C.\n     neither references these provisions nor sets    Sec. Sec. 216(c),\n     forth similar provisions authorizing an         217.\n     agency to bring enforcement proceedings.\n    13. Agency responsibility to ``seek to          Sec. 7(b), (d); 29\n     eliminate'' the violation. The ADEA requires    U.S.C. Sec. 626(b),\n     that, upon receiving a charge, the EEOC must    (d).\n     ``seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful\n     practice'' by informal conference,\n     conciliation, and persuasion, and, before\n     instituting a judicial action, the agency\n     must use such conciliation to ``attempt to\n     eliminate the discriminatory practice or\n     practices and to effect voluntary\n     compliance.'' The CAA does not reference\n     these provisions; it requires the mediation\n     of allegations of discrimination and requires\n     approval of settlements by the Executive\n     Director, but does not require any person\n     involved in the mediation or in approving the\n     settlement to determine ``reasonable cause''\n     or to ``endeavor to eliminate'' the alleged\n     discrimination.\nAdministrative and Judicial Procedures and\n Remedies:\n    14. Enforceability of subpoenas for             Sec. 7(b)-(c); 29\n     information or documents within the             U.S.C. Sec. 626(c),\n     jurisdiction of the House or Senate. The ADEA   referencing Sec.\n     authorizes civil actions in which courts        16(b)-(c) of FLSA,\n     exercise their ordinary subpoena authority.     29 U.S.C. Sec.\n     The CAA also authorizes civil actions, as       216(b)-(c).\n     well as administrative adjudications, but\n     such authorization is subject to Sec. 413 of\n     the CAA, by which the House and Senate\n     decline to waive certain powers relating to\n     records and information, as discussed in\n     connection with Title VII at page 3, row 13,\n     above.\n    15. Suing individuals as agent; possibility of  Sec. 11(b) 29 U.S.C.\n     individual liability. Because the definition    Sec. 630(b).\n     of ``employer'' in the ADEA includes any\n     agent, a plaintiff may choose to sue the\n     employer by naming an individual in the\n     capacity of agent. Furthermore, as noted with\n     respect to Title VII at page 3, row 12,\n     above, while many recent cases hold that\n     individuals may not be held individually\n     liable in discrimination cases, some courts\n     hold to the contrary and the issue remains\n     unresolved. Under the CAA, however,\n     individuals may be neither sued nor held\n     individually liable, because only an\n     employing office may be named as respondent\n     or defendant under Sec. Sec. 401-408 and all\n     awards and settlements must generally be paid\n     out of an account of the Office of Compliance\n     under Sec. 415(a).\nDefense:\n    16. Defense for good faith reliance on agency   Sec. 7(e); 29 U.S.C.\n     interpretations. Sec. 7(e) of the ADEA          Sec. 626(e),\n     provides that Sec. 10 of the Portal-to-Portal   referencing Sec. 10\n     Act (``PPA'') shall apply to actions under      of PPA, 29 U.S.C.\n     the ADEA, and Sec. 10 of the PPA establishes    Sec. 259.\n     a defense for an employer who relies in good\n     faith on an interpretation by the EEOC.\n     However, the CAA does not reference Sec. 7(e)\n     of the ADEA, and Sec. 15 of the ADEA, which\n     is referenced by Sec. 201(a)(2) of the CAA,\n     contains a subsection (f) that specifically\n     precludes the application of provisions\n     outside of Sec. 15. The ADEA thus differs\n     from Title VII, as discussed at page 4, row\n     17, above, because the Title VII provisions\n     referenced by the CAA contain no provision\n     like ADEA Sec. 15(f) precluding the\n     application of other statutory provisions.\nDamages:\n    17. Liquidated damages for retaliation. Sec.    Secs. 4(d), 7(b); 29\n     4(d) of the ADEA forbids discrimination         U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n     against employees for exercising ADEA rights,   623(d), 626(b),\n     and Sec. 7(b) of the ADEA provides that         including reference\n     liquidated damages, in an amount equal to the   to Sec. 16(b) of\n     amount otherwise owing because of a             FLSA, 29 U.S.C.\n     violation, shall be payable in cases of         Sec. 216(b).\n     willful violations. Under the CAA, Sec.\n     201(a)(2)(B) incorporates ``such liquidated\n     damages as would be appropriate if awarded\n     under Sec. 7(b) of [the ADEA],'' but only for\n     ``a violation of subsection (a)(2).'' Sec.\n     201(a)(2) does not reference Sec. 4(d) of the\n     ADEA, but rather, Sec. 201(a)(2) prohibits\n     discrimination within the meaning of Sec. 15\n     of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 633a, and Sec. 15\n     does not prohibit retaliation either\n     expressly or by implication. See Tomasello v.\n     Rubin, 920 F. Supp. 4 (D.D.C. 1996); Koslow\n     v. Hundt, 919 F. Supp. 18 (D.D.C. 1995).\n     Retaliation is prohibited by Sec. 207(a) of\n     the CAA, but the remedy under Sec. 207(b) is\n     ``such legal or equitable remedy as may be\n     appropriate,'' with no express authority to\n     award liquidated damages.\n \n    C. OTHER AGENCY AUTHORITIES...................\n \n18. Authority to issue written interpretations and  Sec. 7(e); 29 U.S.C.\n opinions. Sec. 7(e) of the ADEA, referencing Sec.   Sec. 626(e),\n 10 of the PPA, establishes a defense for good-      referencing Sec. 10\n faith reliance on ``any written administrative      of PPA, 29 U.S.C.\n regulation, order, ruling, approval, or             Sec. 259.\n interpretation'' of the EEOC, and the EEOC has\n established a process by which a request for an\n opinion letter may be submitted to the\n Commission. See 29 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 1626.17-\n 1626.18. However, as noted at page 9, row 16,\n above, the CAA does not reference Sec. 7(e).\n Furthermore, as discussed in connection with\n Title VII at page 5, row 20, above, the Board has\n decided that the PPA defense was incorporated\n into Sec. 203 of the CAA, but that the Board\n would not provide authoritative interpretations\n and opinions outside of adjudicating individual\n cases.\n19. Notice-posting requirements. The ADEA requires  Sec. 8; 29 U.S.C.\n employers, employment agencies, and unions to       Sec. 627.\n post notices prepared or approved by the EEOC.\n The CAA does not reference these provisions, and\n the Board, in issuing substantive regulations as\n to several other laws, found that notice-posting\n requirements under those laws were not\n incorporated by the CAA.\n\n[[Page S1046]]\n\n \n20. Substantive rulemaking authority. Under Sec. 9  Sec. 9; 29 U.S.C.\n of the ADEA, the EEOC promulgates substantive as    Sec. 628.\n well as procedural regulations applicable to the\n private sector. Sec. 9 is not referenced by the\n CAA, and Sec. 201 of the CAA, unlike most other\n CAA sections, does not require that the Board\n adopt implementing regulations. Sec. 304 of the\n CAA, which establishes the process by which the\n Board adopts substantive regulations, specifies\n that such regulations ``shall include regulations\n the Board is required to issue under title II [of\n the CAA],'' but does not state explicitly whether\n the Board has authority to promulgate\n regulations, at its discretion, that the Board is\n not required to issue. Furthermore, Sec.\n 201(a)(2) of the CAA references Sec. 15 of the\n ADEA, which, in subsection (b), requires the EEOC\n to issue regulations, orders, and instructions\n applicable to the executive branch and requires\n each federal agency covered by Sec. 15 to comply\n with them. The CAA does not state expressly\n whether the reference to Sec. 15 makes subsection\n (b) of that section applicable, and,\n specifically, whether employing offices must\n comply with regulations, orders, and instructions\n promulgated by the EEOC under Sec. 15(b), or\n whether the Board can exercise the authority of\n the EEOC under Sec. 15(b) to issue regulations,\n orders, and instructions binding on employing\n offices.\n21. Authority to grant ``reasonable exemptions''    Sec. 9; 29 U.S.C.\n in the ``public interest.'' With respect to the     Sec. 628.\n private sector, Sec. 9 of the ADEA authorizes the\n EEOC to establish ``reasonable exemptions'' from\n the ADEA ``as it may find necessary and proper in\n the public interest.'' Sec. 9 is not referenced\n by the CAA, and Sec. 15 of the ADEA, which is\n referenced by Sec. 201(a)(2) of the CAA, contains\n a subsection (f) that specifically precludes the\n application of any provision outside of Sec. 15.\n However, Sec. 15(b) of the ADEA authorizes the\n EEOC to establish ``[r]easonable exemptions'' for\n the executive branch upon determining that age is\n a BFOQ. The CAA does not state expressly whether\n the reference to Sec. 15 makes subsection (b) of\n that section applicable, and, specifically,\n whether any BFOQs granted by the EEOC under Sec.\n 15(b) would apply to employing offices, or\n whether the Board can exercise the authority of\n the EEOC under Sec. 15(b) to issue BFOQs\n applicable to employing offices.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n            AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990 (``ADA'')\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           TITLE I--EMPLOYMENT\n \nA. SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS\n \n1. Employment discrimination against an individual  Sec. 102(a); 42\n employed by another employer. Sec.  102(a) of the   U.S.C. Sec.\n ADA forbids employment discrimination by covered    12112(a).\n employers against ``a qualified individual with a\n disability.'' As discussed at page 1, row 1,\n above, courts have held that a Title VII\n provision forbidding discrimination against ``any\n individual'' extends, under certain\n circumstances, beyond the immediate employer-\n employee relationship, including where a\n defendant who does not employ an individual\n controls that individual's access to employment\n with another employer and denies access based on\n unlawful criteria. Under the CAA, an employing\n office may only be charged with discrimination by\n a ``covered employee,'' defined as an employee of\n the nine legislative-branch employers listed in\n Sec.  101(3).\n2. Coverage of unions. Sec.  102 of the ADA         Secs. 102, 107(a);\n forbids discrimination by unions in the private     42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n sector, and these provisions may be enforced         12112, 12117(a).\n against private-sector unions under Sec.  107(a)\n of the ADA. The CAA does not make these\n provisions applicable to unions discriminating\n against legislative branch employees, because\n Sec.  201 of the CAA only forbids discrimination\n in ``personnel actions'' and Sec. Sec.  401-408\n allow complaints only against employing offices.\n (Unlawful discrimination by a union may be an\n unfair labor practice under Sec.  220 of the CAA,\n but the procedures and remedies under that\n section are very different from those under the\n ADA and under the CAA for violations of ADA\n rights and protections.) As noted at page 1, row\n 3, above, a similar situation exists in the\n executive branch, where Sec.  717 of Title VII\n does not cover discrimination by unions against\n executive branch employees, but courts and the\n EEOC are divided as to whether the private-sector\n provisions of Title VII and 42 U.S.C. Sec.  1981\n apply by their own terms to such discrimination.\n Similarly differing views might be expressed with\n respect to whether the ADA applies by its own\n terms to forbid discrimination by unions against\n legislative-branch employees.\n3. Consideration of political party, domicile, or   Secs. 102-103; 42\n political compatibility. Under the CAA, Sec.  502   U.S.C. Sec.  12112-\n provides that consideration of political party,     12113.\n domicile, or political compatibility by Members,\n committees, or leadership offices shall not be a\n violation of Sec.  201, which is the section that\n makes applicable the rights and protections of\n title I of the ADA. Under the ADA, there is no\n specific immunity for consideration of political\n party, domicile, or political compatibility.\n \nB. ENFORCEMENT\n \nAgency Enforcement Authorities:\n    4. Agency responsibility to investigate         Sec. 107(a); 42\n     charges filed by an employee or Commission      U.S.C. Sec.\n     Member. The ADA requires the EEOC to            12117(a),\n     investigate charges brought by an employee or   referencing Sec.\n     by a Member of the Commission. The CAA          706(b) of Title\n     neither references these provisions nor sets    VII, 42 U.S.C. Sec.\n     forth similar provisions authorizing agency      2000e-5(b).\n     investigation.\n    5. Agency responsibility to determine           . . . referencing\n     ``reasonable cause'' and to ``endeavor to       Sec.  706(b) of\n     eliminate'' the violation by informal           Title VII, 42\n     conciliation. The ADA requires that, upon the   U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     filing of a charge, the EEOC must determine     5(b).\n     whether ``there is reasonable cause to\n     believe that the charge is true'' and\n     ``endeavor to eliminate any such alleged\n     unlawful employment practice'' by informal\n     conference, conciliation, and persuasion. The\n     CAA does not reference these provisions; it\n     requires the mediation of allegations of\n     discrimination and requires approval of\n     settlements by the Executive Director, but\n     does not require any person involved in the\n     mediation or in approving the settlement to\n     determine ``reasonable cause'' or to\n     ``endeavor to eliminate'' the alleged\n     discrimination.\n    6. Agency authority to bring judicial           . . . referencing\n     enforcement actions. The ADA authorizes the     Sec.  706(f)(1) of\n     EEOC to bring a civil action. The CAA neither   Title VII, 42\n     references these provisions nor sets forth      U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     similar provisions authorizing an agency to     5(f)(1).\n     bring enforcement proceedings.\n    7. Agency authority to intervene in private     . . . referencing\n     civil action of general public importance.      Sec.  706(f)(1) of\n     Under the ADA, the EEOC may intervene in a      Title VII, 42\n     private action of general public importance.    U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     The CAA neither references these provisions     5(f)(1).\n     nor sets forth similar provisions authorizing\n     an agency to intervene in private actions.\n    8. Agency authority to apply to court for       . . . referencing\n     enforcement of judicial orders. The ADA         Sec.  706(i) of\n     authorizes the EEOC to commence judicial        Title VII, 42\n     proceedings to compel compliance with           U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     judicial orders. The CAA does not reference     5(i).\n     these provisions. Sec.  407(a)(2) of the CAA\n     enables the Office of Compliance to petition\n     the Court of Appeals to enforce final orders\n     of a hearing officer or the Board, but the\n     CAA sets forth no provision enabling an\n     agency to seek the enforcement of judicial\n     orders.\n    9. Grant of subpoena power and other general    . . . referencing\n     powers for investigations and hearings. The     Sec. Sec.  709(a),\n     ADA grants the EEOC access to evidence,         710 of Title VII,\n     including subpoena powers, in support of its    42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n     investigations and hearings. The CAA neither     2000e-8(a), 2000e-\n     references these provisions nor sets forth      9.\n     similar provisions granting an agency\n     investigatory powers. (Sec.  405(f) of the\n     CAA grants subpoena powers to hearing\n     officers, and Sec.  408 authorizes civil\n     actions in which courts may issue subpoenas,\n     but these CAA provisions do not grant\n     subpoena powers for use in agency\n     investigation.)\n    10. Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.   . . . referencing\n     The ADA incorporates Title VII provisions       Sec.  709(c) of\n     requiring private-sector employers to make      Title VII, 42\n     and preserve such records and make such         U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     reports therefrom as the EEOC shall             8(c).\n     prescribed by regulation or order, after\n     public hearing, as reasonable, necessary, or\n     appropriate for enforcement. EEOC regulations\n     require that all personnel or employment\n     records generally be preserved for 1 year and\n     reserve the agency's right to impose special\n     reporting requirements on individual\n     employers or groups of employers. 29 C.F.R.\n     Sec.  1602.11. The CAA does not reference\n     these provisions, and the Board, in issuing\n     substantive regulations with respect to\n     several other laws, found that recordkeeping\n     and reporting requirements under those laws\n     were not incorporated by the CAA.\nAdministrative and Judicial Procedures and\n Remedies:\n    11. Suing individuals as agent; possibility of  Sec. 101(5)(A); 42\n     individual liability. Because the definition    U.S.C. Sec.\n     of ``employer'' under the ADA includes any      12111(5)(A).\n     agent, a plaintiff may choose to sue the\n     employer by naming an individual in the\n     capacity of agent. Furthermore, as noted with\n     respect to Title VII at page 3, row 12,\n     above, while many recent cases hold that\n     individuals may not be held individually\n     liable in discrimination cases, some courts\n     hold to the contrary and the issue remains\n     unresolved. Under the CAA, individuals may be\n     neither sued nor held individually liable,\n     because only an employing office may be named\n     as respondent or defendant under Sec. Sec.\n     401-408 and all awards and settlements must\n     generally be paid out of an account of the\n     Office of Compliance under Sec.  415(a).\n    12. Enforceability of subpoenas for             Sec. 107(a); 42\n     information or documents within the             U.S.C. Sec.\n     jurisdiction of the House or Senate. The ADA    12117(a),\n     authorizes civil actions in which courts        referencing Sec.\n     exercise their ordinary subpoena authority.     706(f)(1) of Title\n     The CAA also authorizes civil actions, as       VII, 42 U.S.C. Sec.\n     well as administrative adjudications, but        2000e-5(f)(1).\n     such authorization is subject to Sec.  413 of\n     the CAA, by which the House and Senate\n     decline to waive certain powers relating to\n     records and information, as discussed in\n     connection with Title VII at page 3, row 13,\n     above.\n    13. Appointment of counsel and waiver of fees.  . . . referencing\n     The ADA authorizes the court to appoint an      Sec.  706(f)(1) of\n     attorney for the complainant in a private       Title VII, 42\n     action and to waive costs. The CAA does not     U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     reference these provisions. In judicial         5(f)(1).\n     proceedings under the CAA, the courts may\n     exercise their general powers to authorize\n     proceedings in forma pauperis and waive fees\n     and costs and appoint counsel if a party is\n     unable to pay. See 28 U.S.C. Sec.  1915. In\n     administrative proceedings under the CAA,\n     there are no fees and costs to waive, but\n     there is also no power to appoint counsel.\n    14. Agency authority to apply for TRO or        . . . referencing\n     preliminary relief. Sec.  107(a) of the ADA,    Sec. 706(f)(2) of\n     which references Sec.  706(f)(1) of Title       Title VII, 42\n     VII, authorizes the EEOC to bring an action     U.S.C. Sec.  2000e-\n     for a TRO or preliminary relief pending         5(f)(2).\n     resolution of a charge. The CAA neither\n     references Sec.  107(a) of the ADA nor sets\n     forth similar provisions authorizing TROs or\n     preliminary relief, and the CAA does not\n     allow a covered employee to commence an\n     administrative complaint or civil action\n     until after having completed periods of\n     counseling and mediation and an additional\n     period of at least 30 days.\nPunitive Damages:\n    15. Punitive damages. Punitive damages are      42 U.S.C. Sec.\n     available in cases of malice or reckless        1981a(b)(1).\n     indifference brought under title I of the\n     ADA. The CAA does not reference this\n     provision, and Sec.  225(c) of the CAA\n     expressly precludes the awarding of punitive\n     damages.\n \nOTHER AGENCY AUTHORITIES\n \n16. Notice-posting requirements. The ADA requires   Sec. 105; 42 U.S.C.\n employers, employment agencies, and unions and      Sec.  12115.\n joint labor-management committees to post notices\n prepared or approved by the EEOC. The CAA does\n not reference these provisions, and the Board, in\n issuing substantive regulations with respect to\n several other laws, found that notice-posting\n requirements under those laws were not\n incorporated by the CAA.\n17. Substantive rulemaking authority. Under Sec.    Sec. 106; 42 U.S.C.\n 106 of the ADA, the EEOC promulgates both           Sec.  12116.\n procedural and substantive regulations. Sec.  106\n is not referenced by the CAA, and Sec.  201,\n unlike most other sections of title II of the\n CAA, contains no requirement that the Board adopt\n implementing regulations. Sec.  304 of the CAA,\n which establishes the process by which the Board\n adopts substantive regulations, specifies that\n such regulations ``shall include regulations the\n Board is required to issue under title II,'' but\n does not state explicitly whether other\n regulations, which the Board is not required to\n issue, may be issued at the Board's discretion.\n\n[[Page S1047]]\n\n \n \n                        TITLE II--PUBLIC SERVICES\n \nENFORCEMENT\n \nAgency Enforcement Authorities:\n    18. Agencies must investigate any alleged       Sec. 203; 42 U.S.C.\n     violation, even if not charged by a qualified   Sec.  12133,\n     person with a disability. Title II of the ADA   referencing Sec.\n     affords the remedies, procedures, and rights    505 of\n     set forth in Sec.  505 of the Rehabilitation    Rehabilitation Act\n     Act of 1973 to ``any person alleging            of 1973, 29 U.S.C.\n     discrimination.'' The regulations of the        Sec.  794a.\n     Attorney General (``AG'') implementing title\n     II require that, if any ``individual who\n     believes that he or she or a specific class\n     of individuals'' has been subject to\n     discrimination files a complaint, then the\n     appropriate federal agency must investigate\n     the complaint. 28 C.F.R. Sec. Sec.\n     35.170(a), 35.172(a). Under the CAA, Sec.\n     210(d)(1), (f) provides express authority for\n     the General Counsel to investigate only when\n     ``[a] qualified person with a disability, . .\n     . who alleges a violation[,] . . . file[s] a\n     charge'' and in ``periodic inspections'' that\n     are ``[o]n a regular basis, and at least once\n     each Congress.''\n    19. Agencies must issue ``Letter of Findings''  Sec. 203; 42 U.S.C.\n     and endeavor to ``secure compliance by          Sec.  12133,\n     voluntary means.'' Title II of the ADA          referencing Sec.\n     affords the remedies, procedures, and rights    602 of title VI of\n     of Sec.  505 of the Rehabilitation Act, and     the CRA, 42 U.S.C.\n     Sec.  505 incorporates the remedies,            Sec.  2000d-1.\n     procedures and rights of titles VI and VII of\n     the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (``CRA''). Sec.\n     602 in title VI of the CRA provides that\n     enforcement action may be taken only if the\n     federal agency concerned ``has determined\n     that compliance cannot be secured by\n     voluntary means.'' The AG's regulations\n     implementing title II of the ADA require that\n     the Federal agency investigating a complaint\n     must issue a Letter of Findings, 28 C.F.R.\n     Sec.  35.172, and, if noncompliance is found,\n     the agency must initiate negotiations ``to\n     secure voluntary compliance'' and any\n     compliance agreement must specify the action\n     that will be taken ``to come into\n     compliance'' and must ``[p]rovide assurance\n     that discrimination will not recur,'' 28\n     C.F.R. Sec.  35.173. The CAA does not\n     reference these provisions. Under the CAA,\n     Sec.  210(d)(2) authorizes the General\n     Counsel to request mediation between the\n     charging individual and the responsible\n     entity, and the CAA requires approval of any\n     settlement by the Executive Director.\n     However, the General Counsel is specifically\n     forbidden to participate in the mediation,\n     and the CAA does not require any person\n     involved in the mediation or in approving the\n     settlement to make findings as to compliance\n     or noncompliance or to endeavor ``to secure\n     voluntary compliance.''\n    20. Attorney General's authority to bring       Sec. 203; 42 U.S.C.\n     enforcement proceeding without a charge by a    Sec.  12133.\n     qualified person with a disability. Under\n     title II of the ADA and under regulations of\n     the AG, if a federal agency receives a\n     complaint from any individual who believes\n     there has been discrimination and is unable\n     to secure voluntary compliance, the agency\n     may refer the matter to the AG for\n     enforcement. 28 C.F.R. Sec.  35.174; see U.S.\n     v. Denver, 927 F. Supp. 1396, 1399-1400 (D.\n     Col. 1996). Under the CAA, Sec.  210(d)(3)\n     authorizes the General Counsel to file an\n     administrative complaint only after ``[a]\n     qualified person with a disability, . . . who\n     alleges a violation[,] . . . file[s] a\n     charge.''\n    21. Attorney General's authority to bring       Sec. 203; 42 U.S.C.\n     enforcement action in federal district court.   Sec.  12133.\n     The AG enforces against a violation of ADA\n     title II by filing an action in federal\n     district court. Under the CAA, Sec.\n     210(d)(3) authorizes the General Counsel to\n     enforce by filing an administrative\n     complaint, but not by commencing an action in\n     court.\nJudicial Procedures and Remedies:\n    22. Private right of action. Under title II of  Sec. 203; 42 U.S.C.\n     the ADA, both employees and non-employees of    Sec.  12133.\n     a public entity may sue a public entity for\n     discrimination on the basis of disability.\n     Under the CAA, non-covered-employees have no\n     right to sue or bring administrative\n     proceedings under Sec.  210 or any other\n     section of the CAA. (As discussed at page 16,\n     row 23, below, covered employees may sue or\n     bring administrative complaints under Sec.\n     201 and Sec. Sec.  401-408 of the CAA.)\n    23. Private right to sue immediately, without   Sec. 203; 42 U.S.C.\n     having exhausted administrative remedies.       Sec.  12133.\n     Both employees and non-employees of a non-\n     federal public entity may sue under title II\n     of the ADA immediately, regardless of whether\n     administrative remedies have been exhausted.1\n     Under the CAA, covered employees may not file\n     an administrative complaint or commence a\n     civil action until after having completed\n     periods of counseling and mediation and an\n     additional period of at least 30 days. (As\n     discussed at page 15, row 22, above, non-\n     covered-employees have no private right of\n     action.)\nDamages:\n    24. Monetary damages. Sec.  203 of the ADA      Sec. 203; 42 U.S.C.\n     incorporates the remedies of titles VI and      Sec.  12133,\n     VII of the CRA, as noted in page 15, row 19,    referencing title\n     above. Title VII does not provide for damages   VI and Sec. Sec.\n     other than back pay under Sec.  706(g)(1) in    706(f)-(k), 716 of\n     connection with hiring or reinstatement, but,   the CRA, 42 U.S.C.\n     under title VI, courts have inferred a          Sec. Sec.  2000d et\n     private right to recover damages for an         seq., 2000e-5(f)-\n     intentional violation. Franklin v. Gwinnett     (k), 2000e-16.\n     County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 70, 112\n     S. Ct. 1028, 1035 (1992). Under the CAA, Sec.\n      210(c) incorporates the remedies under Sec.\n     203 of the ADA. However, a court has held\n     that the Federal Government is immune, under\n     sovereign immunity principles, against the\n     implied right to recover damages under title\n     VI as incorporated by Sec.  505 of the\n     Rehabilitation Act. Dorsey v. U.S. Dep't of\n     Labor, 41 F.3d 1551 (D.C. Cir. 1994).\n \n    TITLE III--PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS AND SERVICES OPERATED BY PRIVATE\n                                ENTITIES\nENFORCEMENT\n \n    Agency Enforcement Authorities................\n    25. Attorney General may investigate whenever   Sec.\n     there is reason to believe there may be a       308(b)(1)(A)(i); 42\n     violation, even if not charged by a qualified   U.S.C. Sec.\n     person with a disability. Title III of the      12188(b)(1)(A)(i).\n     ADA requires the AG to investigate alleged\n     violations and to undertake periodic\n     compliance reviews. The AG's regulations\n     implementing title III specify that ``[a]ny\n     individual who believes that he or she or a\n     specific class of persons'' has been subject\n     to discrimination may request an\n     investigation, and that, whenever the AG\n     ``has reason to believe'' there may be a\n     violation, the AG may initiate a compliance\n     review. 28 C.F.R. Sec.  36.502. The CAA does\n     not reference these provisions, and Sec.\n     210(d)(1), (f) of the CAA provides express\n     authority for the General Counsel to\n     investigate only when ``[a] qualified person\n     with a disability, . . . who alleges a\n     violation[,] . . . file[s] a charge'' and in\n     ``periodic inspections'' that are ``[o]n a\n     regular basis, and at least once each\n     Congress.''.\n    26. Attorney General's authority to bring       Sec. 308(b)(1)(B);\n     enforcement action without a charge by a        42 U.S.C. Sec.\n     qualified person with a disability. Under       12188(b)(1)(B).\n     title III of the ADA, if the AG has\n     reasonable cause to believe that there is\n     discrimination that constitutes a pattern or\n     practice of discrimination or that raises an\n     issue of general public importance, the AG\n     may commence a civil action. These provisions\n     are not referenced by the CAA. Sec.\n     210(d)(3) of the CAA authorizes the General\n     Counsel to file an administrative complaint\n     only in response to a charge filed by a\n     qualified person with a disability who\n     alleges a violation.\n    27. Attorney General's authority to bring       Sec. 308(b)(1)(B);\n     enforcement action in federal district court.   42 U.S.C. Sec.\n     The AG brings enforcement actions, as noted     12188(b)(1)(B).\n     at page 17, row 26, above, by filing an\n     action in federal district court. These\n     provisions are not referenced by the CAA.\n     Sec.  210(d)(3) of the CAA authorizes the\n     General Counsel may bring an enforcement\n     action by filing an administrative complaint,\n     but not by commencing an action in court.\nJudicial Procedures and Remedies:\n    28. Private right of action. A private right    Sec. 308(a); 42\n     of action is available for violations of        U.S.C. Sec.\n     title III of the ADA. The CAA neither           12188(a).\n     references these provisions nor sets forth\n     similar provisions establishing a private\n     right to commence either an administrative or\n     judicial proceedings.\nDamages and Penalties:\n    29. Monetary damages. Sec.  308(b)(2)(B) of     Sec. 308(b)(2)(B);\n     the ADA provides that, when the AG brings a     42 U.S.C. Sec.\n     civil action, he or she may ask the court to    12188(b)(2)(B).\n     award monetary damages to the person\n     aggrieved. The CAA does not reference Sec.\n     308(b)(2)(B), but, rather, Sec.  210(c) of\n     the CAA references the remedies under Sec.\n     Sec.  203 and 308(a) of the ADA. Sec.  203 of\n     the ADA references the remedies of titles VI\n     and VII of the CRA, as noted in row 19 above,\n     and Sec.  308(a) of the ADA references the\n     remedies of title II of the CRA, 42 U.S.C.\n     Sec. Sec.  2000a-3(a). Neither title II nor\n     title VII of the CRA provides for damages,\n     other than back pay under Sec.  706(g)(1) of\n     title VII in connection with hiring or\n     reinstatement. Courts have inferred a private\n     right to recover damages under title VI of\n     the CRA, but, as discussed at page 16, row\n     24, above, the Federal Government may be\n     immune. Furthermore, the remedies of title VI\n     of the CRA are referenced by Sec.  203 of\n     title II of the ADA, not by Sec.  308(a) of\n     title III of the ADA, and might therefore not\n     be available for a violation of title III\n     rights and protections as made applicable by\n     Sec.  210 of the CAA.\n    30. Civil penalties. In a civil action brought  Sec. 308(b)(2)(C);\n     by the Attorney General under title III of      42 U.S.C. Sec.\n     the ADA, the court may assess a civil           12188(b)(2)(C).\n     penalty. The CAA does not reference this\n     provision and Sec.  225(c) of the CAA\n     specifically disallows the assessment of\n     civil penalties.\n \n                    TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n \nSUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS\n \n31. Retaliation against employees of other          Sec. 503; 42 U.S.C.\n employers. Sec.  503 of the ADA protects ``any      Sec.  12203.\n individual'' against retaliation for asserting,\n exercising, or enjoying rights under the ADA.\n Employers'' obligations under this section are\n not expressly limited to their own employees,\n and, in the context of the retaliation provision\n in the OSHAct, the Labor Department has construed\n the term ``any employee'' to forbid employers to\n retaliate against employees of other employers,\n as discussed at page 32, row 1, below. Sec.  503\n is not referenced by the CAA, and Sec.  207 of\n the CAA, which sets forth provisions prohibiting\n retaliation, applies by its terms to covered\n employees only.\n32. Retaliation against non-employees exercising    Sec. 503; 42 U.S.C.\n rights with respect to public entities or public    Sec.  12203.\n accommodations. Sec.  503 of the ADA protects any\n individual against retaliation for asserting,\n exercising, or enjoying rights under the ADA.\n Such individuals may include non-employees who\n exercise or enjoy rights with respect to public\n entities under title II of the ADA or public\n accommodations under title III of the ADA. Sec.\n 503 is not referenced by the CAA, and Sec.  207\n of the CAA, which sets forth provisions\n establishing retaliation protection, applies by\n its terms to covered employees only.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 See Tyler v.

SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS\n \n1. Duties owed by ``secondary'' employers to        Secs.\n employees hired and paid by temp agencies and       101(4)(A)(ii)(I),\n another ``primary'' employers. The FMLA defines     105(a)(1)-(2), (b);\n ``employer'' to include any person ``who acts,      29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n directly or indirectly, in the interest of an        2611(4)(A)(ii)(I),\n employer'; makes it unlawful for any employer to    2615(a)(1)-(2),\n interfere with the exercise of FMLA rights; and     (b).\n forbids employers and other persons from\n retaliating against ``any individual.'' The Labor\n Secretary, citing this statutory authority,\n promulgated regulations on ``joint employment''\n that prohibit ``secondary employers'' from\n interfering with the exercise of FMLA rights by\n employees hired and paid by a ``primary''\n employer, e.g., by a temporary help or leasing\n agency. 29 C.F.R. Sec.  825.106(f); 60 Fed. Reg.\n 2180, 2183 (Jan. 8, 1995). Under the CAA,\n individuals who are not employees of the nine\n legislative-branch employers in Sec.  101(3) are\n outside the definition of ``covered employee''\n and are not covered by family and medical leave\n protection under Sec.  202(a) or by retaliation\n protection under Sec.  207(a), regardless of\n whether an employing office would be considered\n the ``secondary employer'' within the meaning of\n the Labor Secretary's regulations. The Board, in\n promulgating its implementing regulations, stated\n specifically that employees of temporary and\n leasing agencies are not covered by the CAA. 142\n Cong. Rec. S196, S198 (daily ed. Jan. 22, 1996).\n \nB. ENFORCEMENT\n \nAgency Enforcement Authorities:\n    2. Agency's general authority to investigate    Sec. 106(a),\n     to ensure compliance, and responsibility to     107(b)(1); 29\n     investigate complaints of violations. Sec.      U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n     106(a) of the FMLA authorizes the Labor         2616(a),\n     Secretary generally to make investigations to   2617(b)(1).\n     ensure compliance, and Sec.  107(b)(1)\n     specifically requires the Labor Secretary to\n     receive, investigate, and attempt to resolve\n     complaints of violations. The CAA neither\n     references these provisions nor sets forth\n     similar provisions authorizing an agency to\n     conduct investigations.\n    3. Grant of subpoena and other investigatory    Sec. 106(a), (d); 29\n     powers. The FMLA grants the Labor Secretary     U.S.C. Sec.\n     subpoena and other investigatory powers for     2616(a), (d).\n     any investigations. The CAA neither\n     references these provisions nor sets forth\n     similar provisions granting an agency\n     investigatory powers. (Sec.  405(f) of the\n     CAA grants subpoena powers to hearing\n     officers, and Sec.  408 authorizes civil\n     actions in which courts may issue subpoenas,\n     but these CAA provisions do not grant\n     subpoena powers for use in agency\n     investigation.).\n    4. Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.    Sec. 106(b)-(c); 29\n     The FMLA requires private-sector employers to   U.S.C. Sec.\n     make and preserve records pertaining to         2616(b)-(c),\n     compliance in accordance with Sec.  11(c) of    referencing Sec.\n     the FLSA and in accordance with regulations     11(c) of the FLSA,\n     issued by the Labor Secretary. Sec.  11(c) of   29 U.S.C. Sec.\n     the FLSA requires every employer to make and    211(c).\n     preserve such records and to make such\n     reports therefrom as the Wage and Hour\n     administrator shall prescribe by regulation\n     or order. The Secretary's FMLA regulations\n     specify the records regarding payroll,\n     benefits, and FMLA leave and disputes that\n     employers must maintain and preserve for 3\n     years, and indicate that employers must\n     submit records specifically requested by a\n     Departmental official and must prepare\n     extensions or transcriptions of information\n     in the records upon request. 29 C.F.R. Sec.\n     825.500(a)-(b). The CAA does not reference\n     these statutory provisions, and the Board, in\n     adopting implementing regulations under Sec.\n     202 of the CAA, found that the CAA explicitly\n     did not make these requirements applicable.\n    5. Agency authority to bring judicial           Sec. 107(b)(2), (d);\n     enforcement actions. The FMLA authorizes the    29 U.S.C. Sec.\n     Labor Secretary to bring a civil action to      2617(b)(2), (d).\n     recover damages, and grants the district\n     courts jurisdiction, upon application of the\n     Labor Secretary, to restrain violations and\n     to award other equitable relief. The CAA\n     neither references these provisions nor sets\n     forth similar provisions authorizing an\n     agency to bring enforcement proceedings.\nJudicial Procedures and Remedies:\n    6. Individual liability. Because the            Secs.\n     definition of ``employer'' under the FMLA       101(4)(A)(ii)(I),\n     includes any person who ``acts, directly or     107; 29 U.S.C. Sec.\n     indirectly, in the interest of an employer,''   Sec.  2611(4)(A)(ii\n     the weight of authority is that individuals     )(I), 2617.\n     may be held individually liable in an action\n     under Sec.  107 of the FMLA.1 Under the CAA,\n     individuals may not be held individually\n     liable, because only an employing office may\n     be named as respondent or defendant under\n     Sec. Sec.  401-408 and all awards and\n     settlements must generally be paid out of an\n     account of the Office of Compliance under\n     Sec.  415(a).\n    7. Enforceability of subpoenas for information  Sec. 107(a)(2); 29\n     or documents within the jurisdiction of the     U.S.C. Sec.\n     House or Senate. The FMLA authorizes civil      2617(a)(2).\n     actions in which courts exercise their\n     ordinary subpoena authority. The CAA also\n     authorizes civil actions, as well as\n     administrative adjudications, but such\n     authorization is subject to Sec.  413 of the\n     CAA, by which the House and Senate decline to\n     waive certain powers relating to records and\n     information, as discussed in connection with\n     Title VII at page 3, row 13, above.\n    8. Private right to sue immediately, without    Sec. 107(a); 29\n     having exhausted administrative remedies. An    U.S.C. Sec.\n     employee who alleges an FMLA violation may      2617(a).\n     choose to sue immediately, without exhausting\n     any administrative remedies. The CAA allows a\n     covered employee to file an administrative\n     complaint or commence a civil action only\n     after having completed periods of counseling\n     and mediation and an additional period of at\n     least 30 days.\n    9. Two- or 3-year statute of limitations. A     Sec. 107(c); 29\n     civil action may be brought under the FMLA      U.S.C. Sec.\n     within two years after the violation            2617(c).\n     ordinarily, or, in the case of a willful\n     violation, within three years. Proceedings\n     under the CAA must be commenced within 180\n     days after the alleged violation.\nC. Other Agency Authorities:\n    10. Notice-posting requirements. The FMLA       Sec. 109; 29 U.S.C.\n     requires employers to post notices prepared     Sec.  2619.\n     or approved by the Labor Secretary, and\n     establishes civil penalties for a violation.\n     The CAA does not reference these provisions,\n     and, in adopting implementing regulations,\n     the Board found that the CAA explicitly did\n     not incorporate these requirements.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ See Beyer v.

SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS\n \nProhibition against compensatory time off. Under    Sec. 7(a); 29 U.S.C.\n the FLSA, employers generally may neither require   Sec.  207(a).\n nor allow employees to receive compensatory time\n off in lieu of overtime pay. Sec.  203 of the CAA\n makes this prohibition generally applicable, but\n provisions of the CAA and other laws establish\n exceptions:\n    1. Coverage of Capitol Police officers. Sec.\n     203(c)(4) of the CAA, as amended, allows\n     Capitol Police officers to elect time off in\n     lieu of overtime pay.\n    2. Coverage of employees whose work schedules\n     directly depend on the House and Senate\n     schedules. Sec.  203(c)(3) of the CAA\n     requires the Board to issue regulations\n     concerning overtime compensation for covered\n     employees whose work schedule depends\n     directly on the schedule of the House and\n     Senate, and Sec.  203(a)(3) provides that,\n     under those regulations, employees may\n     receive compensatory time off in lieu of\n     overtime pay.\n    3. Coverage of salaried employees of the\n     Architect of the Capitol. 5 U.S.C. Sec.\n     5543(b) provides that the Architect of the\n     Capitol may grant salaried employees\n     compensatory time off for overtime work. The\n     CAA does not state expressly whether it\n     repeals this authority.\nInterns are not covered. Sec.  203(a)(2) of the\n CAA excludes ``interns,'' as defined in\n regulations issued by the Board, from the\n coverage of all rights and protections of the\n FLSA:\n    4. Minimum wage. Interns are excluded from      Sec. 6(a); 29 U.S.C.\n     coverage under the entitlement to the minimum   Sec.  206(a).\n     wage.\n    5. Entitlement to overtime pay. Interns are     Sec. 7(a); 29 U.S.C.\n     excluded from coverage under the entitlement    Sec.  207(a).\n     receive overtime pay.\n    6. Equal Pay Act provisions. Interns are        Sec. 6(d); 29 U.S.C.\n     excluded from coverage under Equal Pay          Sec.  206(d).\n     provisions, prohibiting sex discrimination in\n     the payment of wages.\n    7. Child labor protections. Interns are         Sec. 12(c); 29\n     excluded from coverage under child labor        U.S.C. Sec.\n     protections.                                    212(c).\n    8. Coverage of unions under Equal Pay           Secs. 6(d)(2),\n     provisions. The Equal Pay provisions at Sec.    16(b); 29 U.S.C.\n     6(d)(2) of the FLSA forbid unions in the        Sec. Sec.  206(d),\n     private-sector to cause or attempt to cause     216(b).\n     an employer to discriminate on the basis of\n     sex in the payment of wages, and these\n     provisions may be enforced against private-\n     sector unions under Sec.  16(b) of the FLSA.\n     Under the CAA, Sec.  203(a)(1) makes the\n     rights and protections of Sec.  6(d) of the\n     FLSA applicable to covered employees, but no\n     mechanism is expressly provided for enforcing\n     these rights and protections against unions,\n     because Sec. Sec.  401-408 of the CAA allow\n     complaints only against employing offices.\n     (Unlawful discrimination by a union may be an\n     unfair labor practice under Sec.  220 of the\n     CAA, but the procedures and remedies under\n     that section are very different from those\n     under the FLSA and under the CAA for\n     violations of Equal Pay rights and\n     protections.) As noted at page 1, row 3,\n     above, a similar situation exists in the\n     executive branch, where Sec.  717 of Title\n     VII does not cover discrimination by unions\n     against executive branch employees, but\n     courts and the EEOC are divided as to whether\n     the private-sector provisions of Title VII\n     and 42 U.S.C. Sec.  1981 apply by their own\n     terms to such discrimination. Similarly,\n     differing views might be expressed with\n     respect to whether Sec. Sec.  6(d)(2) and\n     16(b) of the FLSA apply by their own terms to\n     prohibit discrimination by unions against\n     legislative-branch employees.\n    9. Prohibition of retaliation by ``persons,''   Sec. 15(a)(3); 29\n     including unions, not acting as employers.      U.S.C. Sec.\n     Sec.  15(a)(3) of the FLSA forbids              215(a)(3).\n     retaliation by any ``person'' against an\n     employee for exercising rights under the\n     FLSA, and Sec.  3(a) defines ``person''\n     broadly to include any ``individual'' and any\n     ``organized group of persons.'' This\n     definition is broad enough to include a labor\n     union, its officers, and members. See Bowe v.\n     Judson C. Burns, Inc., 137 F.2d 37 (3d Cir.\n     1943). The CAA does not reference Sec.\n     15(a)(3) of the FLSA, and Sec.  207 of the\n     CAA forbids retaliation only by employing\n     offices.\n \nB. ENFORCEMENT\n \nAgency Enforcement Authorities:\n    10. Grant of subpoena and other powers for use  Sec. 9; 29 U.S.C.\n     in investigations and hearings. Sec.  9 of      Sec.  209.\n     the FLSA grants the Labor Secretary subpoena\n     and other investigatory powers for use in\n     investigations and hearings. The CAA neither\n     references these provisions nor sets forth\n     similar provisions granting an agency\n     investigatory powers. (Sec.  405(f) of the\n     CAA grants subpoena powers to hearing\n     officers, and Sec.  408 authorizes civil\n     actions in which courts may issue subpoenas,\n     but these CAA provisions do not grant\n     subpoena powers for use in agency\n     investigation.)\n    11. Agency authority to investigate complaints  Sec. 11(a); 29\n     of violations and to conduct agency initiated   U.S.C. Sec.\n     investigations. Under authority of Sec.         211(a).\n     11(a) of the FLSA, the Wage and Hour Division\n     investigates complaints of violations and\n     also conducts agency-initiated\n     investigations. The CAA neither references\n     these provisions nor sets forth similar\n     provisions. authorizing agency investigation.\n\n[[Page S1049]]\n\n \n    12. Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.   Sec. 11(c); 29\n     The FLSA requires employers in the private      U.S.C. Sec.\n     sector to make and preserve such records and    211(c).\n     to make such records therefrom as the Wage\n     and Hour Administrator shall prescribe by\n     regulation or order as necessary or\n     appropriate for enforcement. Labor Department\n     regulations specify the ``payroll'' and other\n     records that must be preserved for at least 3\n     years and the ``employment and earnings''\n     records that must be preserved for at least 2\n     years, and require each employer to make\n     ``such extension, recomputation, or\n     transcription'' of required records, and to\n     submit such reports concerning matters set\n     forth in the records, as the Administrator\n     may request in writing. 29 C.F.R. Sec. Sec.\n     516.5-516.8. As to the Equal Pay provisions,\n     EEOC regulations require employers to keep\n     records in accordance with The CAA does not\n     reference these provisions, and, in adopting\n     implementing regulations, the Board found\n     that the CAA explicitly did not made these\n     requirements applicable.\n    13. Agency authority to bring judicial          Secs. 16(c), 17; 29\n     enforcement actions. The FLSA authorizes the    U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n     Labor Secretary to bring an action in           216(c), 217.\n     district court to recover unpaid minimum\n     wages or overtime compensation, and an equal\n     amount of liquidated damages, and civil\n     penalties, as well as injunctive relief. The\n     CAA neither references these provisions nor\n     sets forth similar provisions authorizing an\n     agency to bring enforcement proceedings.\nJudicial Procedures and Remedies:\n    14. Individual liability. Because the           Secs. 3(d), 16(b);\n     definition of ``employer'' under the FLSA       29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n     includes any person who ``acts, directly or      203(d), 216(b).\n     indirectly, in the interest of an employer,''\n     individuals may be held individually liable\n     in an action under Sec. 16(b) of the FLSA.\n     Under the CAA, individuals may not be held\n     individually liable, because only an\n     employing office may be named as respondent\n     or defendant under Sec. Sec.  401-408 and all\n     awards and settlements must generally be paid\n     out of an account of the Office of Compliance\n     under Sec.  415(a).\n    15. Private right to sue immediately, without   Sec. 16(b); 29\n     having exhausted administrative remedies. An    U.S.C. Sec.\n     employee who alleges an FLSA violation may      216(b).\n     sue immediately, without exhausting any\n     administrative remedies. The CAA allows a\n     covered employee to file an administrative\n     complaint or commence a civil action only\n     after having completed periods of counseling\n     and mediation and an additional period of at\n     least 30 days.\n    16. Enforceability of subpoenas for             Sec. 16; 29 U.S.C.\n     information or documents within the             Sec.  216.\n     jurisdiction of the House or Senate. The FLSA\n     authorizes civil actions in which courts\n     exercise their ordinary subpoena authority.\n     The CAA also authorizes civil actions, as\n     well as administrative adjudications, but\n     such authorization is subject to Sec.  413 of\n     the CAA, by which the House and Senate\n     decline to waive certain powers relating to\n     records and information, as discussed in\n     connection with Title VII at page 3, row 13,\n     above.\n    17. Injunctive relief. Sec.  17 of the FLSA     Sec. 17; 29 U.S.C.\n     grants jurisdiction to the district courts,     Sec.  217.\n     upon the complaint of the Labor Secretary, to\n     restrain violations. The CAA neither\n     references these provisions nor sets forth\n     similar provisions authorizing an agency to\n     seek injunctive relief or granting a court or\n     other tribunal jurisdiction to grant it.\n    18. Two- or 3-year statute of limitations. A    Secs. 6-7 of the\n     civil action under the FLSA may be brought      Portal-to-Portal\n     within two years after the violation            Act (``PPA''); 29\n     ordinarily, or, in the case of a willful        U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n     violation, within three years. Proceedings      255-256.\n     under the CAA must be commenced within 180\n     days after the alleged violation.\n    19. Remedy for a child labor violation. Sec.    Secs. 16(a), (e),\n     Sec.  16(a), (e), and 17 of the FLSA provide    17; 29 U.S.C. Sec.\n     for enforcement of child labor requirements     Sec.  216(a), (e),\n     through agency enforcement actions for civil    217.\n     penalties or injunction and by criminal\n     prosecution. The CAA does not reference Sec.\n     Sec.  16(a), (e), or 17 of the FLSA. Sec.\n     203(b) of the CAA references only the\n     remedies of Sec.  16(b) of the FLSA, and Sec.\n      16(b) makes employers liable for: (1)\n     damages if the employer violated minimum-wage\n     or overtime requirements of the FLSA, and (2)\n     legal or equitable relief if the employer\n     violated the anti-retaliation requirements of\n     the FLSA. The CAA thus does not expressly\n     reference any FLSA provision establishing\n     remedies for child labor violations.\nLiquidated Damages; Civil and Criminal Penalties:\n    20. Criminal penalties. The FLSA makes fines    Sec. 16(a); 29\n     and imprisonment available for willful          U.S.C. Sec.\n     violations. The CAA neither references these    216(a).\n     provisions nor sets forth similar provisions\n     imposing criminal penalties.\n    21. Liquidated damages for retaliation. Sec.    Sec. 16(b); 29\n     15(a)(3) of the FLSA prohibits discrimination   U.S.C. Sec.\n     against an employee for exercising FLSA         216(b).\n     rights, and Sec.  16(b) provides that an\n     employer who violates Sec.  15(a)(3) is\n     liable for legal or equitable relief and ``an\n     additional equal amount as liquidated\n     damages.'' Under the CAA, Sec.  203(b)\n     incorporates the remedies of Sec. 16(b) of\n     the FLSA and explicitly includes ``liquidated\n     damages,'' but only ``for a violation of\n     subsection (a),'' and Sec.  203(a) does not\n     reference Sec.  15(a)(3) of the FLSA or\n     otherwise prohibit retaliation. Retaliation\n     is prohibited by Sec.  207(a) of the CAA, but\n     the remedy under Sec.  207(b) is ``such legal\n     or equitable remedy as may be appropriate,''\n     with no express authority to award liquidated\n     damages.\n    22. Civil penalties. The FLSA authorizes the    Sec. 16(e); 29\n     Labor Secretary or the court to assess civil    U.S.C. Sec. 216(e).\n     penalties for child labor violations or for\n     repeated or willful violations of the minimum\n     wage or overtime requirements. The CAA does\n     not reference these provisions, and Sec.\n     225(c) of the CAA expressly precludes the\n     awarding of civil penalties under the CAA.\n \nC. OTHER AGENCY AUTHORITIES\n \n23. Agency issuance of interpretative bulletins.    Secs. 9, 11, 16-17;\n The Wage and Hour Administrator has issued a        29 U.S.C. Sec.\n number of interpretative bulletins and advisory     209, 211, 216-217.\n opinions, and Sec.  10 of the PPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec.\n  259, in establishing a defense for good-faith\n reliance, refers to the ``written administrative\n regulation, order, ruling, approval, or\n interpretation'' of the Administrator. Under the\n CAA, in adopting regulations implementing Sec.\n 203, the Board stated that the Wage and Hour\n Division's legal basis and practical ability to\n issue interpretive bulletins and advisory\n opinions arises from its investigatory and\n enforcement authorities, and that, absent such\n authorities, ``it seems unwise, if not legally\n improper, for the Board to set forth its views on\n interpretive ambiguities in the regulations\n outside of the adjudicatory context of individual\n cases,'' and, further, that the Board ``would in\n the exercise of its considered judgment decline\n to provide authoritative opinions'' as part of\n its education and information programs. 142 Cong.\n Rec. S221, S222-S223 (daily ed. Jan. 22, 1996).\n24. Requirements to post notices. Although the      Sec. 11; 29 U.S.C.\n FLSA does not expressly require the posting of      Sec.  211.\n notices, the Labor Secretary promulgated\n regulations requiring employers to post notices\n informing employees of their rights. 29 C.F.R.\n Sec.  516.4. In so doing, the Secretary relied on\n authority under Sec.  11, which deals generally\n with the collection of information. 29 C.F.R.\n part 516 (statement of statutory authority). In\n adopting implementing regulations, the Board\n found that the CAA explicitly did not incorporate\n these notice-posting requirements.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Labor v.

SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS\n \n1. Coverage of Capitol Police. The EPPA applies to  Secs. 2(1)-(2), 3(1)-\n any employer in commerce, with no exception for     (3), 7;  29 U.S.C.\n private-sector police forces. Under the CAA, Sec.   Sec. Sec.  2001(1)-\n  204(a)(3) authorizes the Capitol Police to use     (2), 2002(1)-(3),\n lie detectors in accordance with regulations        2006.\n issued by the Board under Sec.  204(c), and the\n Board's regulations exempt the Capitol Police\n from EPPA requirements with respect to Capitol\n Police employees.\n \nB. ENFORCEMENT\n \nAgency Enforcement Authorities:\n    2. Authority to make investigations and         Sec. 5(a)(3); 29\n     inspections. The EPPA authorizes the Labor      U.S.C. Sec.\n     Secretary to make investigations and            2004(a)(3).\n     inspections. The CAA neither references these\n     provisions nor sets forth similar provisions\n     authorizing investigations or inspections by\n     an agency.\n    3. Recordkeeping requirements. The EPPA         Sec. 5(a)(3); 29\n     authorizes the Labor Secretary to require the   U.S.C. Sec.\n     keeping of records necessary or appropriate     2004(a)(3).\n     for the administration of the Act. Labor\n     Department regulations specify the records\n     regarding any polygraph use that employers\n     and examiners must maintain and preserve for\n     3 years. 29 C.F.R. Sec.  801.30. The CAA does\n     not reference these provisions, and, in\n     adopting implementing regulations, the Board\n     found that the CAA explicitly did not make\n     these requirements applicable.\n    4. Grant of subpoena and other powers for       Sec. 5(b); 29 U.S.C.\n     investigations and hearings. The EPPA grants    Sec.  2004(b).\n     the Labor Secretary subpoena and other\n     investigatory powers for use in\n     investigations and hearings. The CAA neither\n     references these provisions nor sets forth\n     similar provisions granting an agency\n     investigatory powers. (Sec.  405(f) of the\n     CAA grants subpoena powers to hearing\n     officers, and Sec.  408 authorizes civil\n     actions in which courts may issue subpoenas,\n     but these CAA authorities do not grant\n     subpoena powers for use in agency\n     investigation.).\n    5. Agency authority to bring judicial           Sec. 6(a)-(b);  29\n     enforcement actions. The EPPA authorizes the    U.S.C. Sec.\n     Labor Secretary to bring an action in           2005(a)-(b).\n     district court to restrain violations or for\n     other legal or equitable relief. The CAA\n     neither references these provisions nor sets\n     forth similar provisions authorizing an\n     agency to bring enforcement proceedings.\nJudicial Procedures and Remedies:\n    6. Individual liability. The definition of      Secs. 2(2), 6; 29\n     ``employer'' under the EPPA includes any        U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n     person who ``acts, directly or indirectly, in   2001(2), 2005.\n     the interest of an employer.'' This\n     definition is substantially the same as that\n     in the FLSA and the FMLA. As discussed in\n     connection with these laws at page 20, row 6,\n     and page 24, row 14, above, individuals may\n     be held individually liable under the FLSA,\n     and, by the weight of authority, under the\n     FMLA. Under the CAA, individuals may not be\n     held individually liable, because only an\n     employing office may be named as respondent\n     or defendant under Sec. Sec.  401-408 of the\n     CAA and all awards and settlements must\n     generally be paid out of an account of the\n     Office of Compliance under Sec.  415(a).\n    7. Enforceability of subpoenas for information  Sec. 6(c)(2); 29\n     or documents within the jurisdiction of the     U.S.C. Sec.\n     House or Senate. The EPPA authorizes civil      2005(c)(2).\n     actions in which courts exercise their\n     ordinary subpoena authority. The CAA also\n     authorizes civil actions, as well as\n     administrative adjudications, but such\n     authorization is subject to Sec.  413 of the\n     CAA, by which the House and Senate decline to\n     waive certain powers relating to records and\n     information, as discussed in connection with\n     Title VII at page 3, row 13, above.\n    8. Private right to sue immediately, without    Sec. 6(c)(2); 29\n     having exhausted administrative remedies. An    U.S.C. Sec.\n     employee who alleges an EPPA violation may      2005(c)(2).\n     sue immediately, without having exhausted any\n     administrative remedies. The CAA allows a\n     covered employee to file an administrative\n     complaint or commence a civil action only\n     after having completed periods of counseling\n     and mediation and an additional period of at\n     least 30 days.\n    9. Three-year statute of limitations. A civil   Sec. 6(c)(2); 29\n     action under the EPPA may be brought within     U.S.C. Sec.\n     three years after the alleged violation.        2005(c)(2).\n     Proceedings under the CAA must be commenced\n     within 180 days after the alleged violation.\n\n[[Page S1050]]\n\n \nCivil Penalties:\n    10. Civil penalties. The EPPA authorizes the    Sec. 6(a); 29 U.S.C.\n     assessment by the Labor Secretary of civil      Sec.  2005(a).\n     penalties for violations. The CAA does not\n     reference these provisions, and Sec.  225(c)\n     of the CAA expressly precludes the awarding\n     of civil penalties under the CAA.\n \nC. OTHER AGENCY AUTHORITIES\n \n11. Requirement to post notices. The EPPA requires  Sec. 4; 29 U.S.C.\n employers to post notices prepared and              Sec.  2003.\n distributed by the Labor Secretary. The CAA does\n not reference these provisions, and, in adopting\n implementing regulations, the Board found that\n the CAA explicitly did not incorporate these\n requirements.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING NOTIFICAITON ACT (``WARN Act'')\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA. SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS\n \n1. Notification of state and local governments.     Secs. 3(a), 5(a)(3);\n The WARN Act requires the employer to notify not    29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n only affected employees, but also the state          2102(a),\n dislocated worker unit and the chief elected        2104(a)(3).\n official of local government. Although Sec.\n 205(a)(1) of the CAA references Sec.  3 of the\n WARN Act for the purpose of incorporating the\n ``meaning'' of office closure and mass layoff,\n that section of the CAA sets forth provisions\n requiring notification of employees, but not of\n state and local governments.\nB. ENFORCEMENT\n \nJudicial Procedures and Remedies:\n    2. Representative of employees may bring civil  Sec. 5(a)(5); 29\n     action. The WARN Act allows a representative    U.S.C. Sec.\n     of employees to sue to enforce liability. The   2104(a)(5).\n     CAA does not reference these provisions, and\n     Sec. Sec.  401-408 of the CAA provide only\n     for the commencement or proceedings by\n     covered employees.\n    3. Unit of local government may bring civil     Sec. 5(a)(5); 29\n     action. The WARN Act allows a unit of local     U.S.C. Sec.\n     government to sue to enforce liability. The     2104(a)(5).\n     CAA does not reference these provisions, and\n     Sec. Sec.  401-408 of the CAA provide only\n     for the commencement or proceedings by\n     covered employees.\n    4. Private right to sue immediately, without    Sec. 5(a)(5); 29\n     having exhausted administrative remedies. An    U.S.C. Sec.\n     employee, union, or local government that       2104(a)(5).\n     alleges a WARN Act violation may sue\n     immediately, without exhausting any\n     administrative remedies. The CAA allows a\n     covered employee to file an administrative\n     complaint or commence a civil action only\n     after having completed periods of counseling\n     and mediation and an additional period of at\n     least 30 days.\n    5. Limitations period borrowed from state law.  Sec. 5(a)(5); 29\n     The WARN Act does not provide a limitations     U.S.C. Sec.\n     period for the civil actions authorized by      2104(a)(5).\n     Sec.  5, and the Supreme Court has held that\n     limitations periods borrowed from state law\n     should be applied to WARN Act claims. North\n     Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515 U.S. 29, 115\n     S.Ct. 1927 (1995). Courts have generally\n     applied state limitations periods to WARN Act\n     claims ranging between one and six years. See\n     id.; 29 U.S.C.A. Sec.  2104 notes of\n     decisions (Note 17--Limitations) (1997 suppl.\n     pamphlet). Under the CAA, proceedings must be\n     commenced within 180 days after the alleged\n     violation.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    UNIFORMED SERVICES EMPLOYMENT AND REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS ACT OF 1994\n                               (``USERRA')\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENFORCEMENT\n \nAgency Enforcement Authorities:\n    1. Agency authority to bring judicial           38 U.S.C. Sec.\n     enforcement action. Under USERRA, if a          4323(a)(1).\n     private-sector employee files a complaint\n     with the Labor Secretary, and if the Labor\n     Secretary refers the complaint to the\n     Attorney General, the Attorney General may\n     commence an action in court on behalf of the\n     employee. However, while the USERRA\n     provisions establishing substantive rights\n     and protections generally extend, by their\n     own terms, to the legislative branch, the\n     Attorney General's authority under USERRA\n     does not. Furthermore, the CAA neither\n     references the Attorney General's authority\n     under the USERRA nor sets forth similar\n     provisions authorizing an agency to bring\n     enforcement proceedings.\n    2. Grant of subpoena and other investigatory    38 U.S.C. Sec.\n     powers. Under USERRA, the Labor Secretary may   4326(b)-(d).\n     receive and investigate complaints from\n     private-sector employees, and may issue\n     enforceable subpoenas in carrying out such an\n     investigation. However, while the USERRA\n     provisions authorizing the Secretary to\n     receive and investigate complaints extend, by\n     their own terms, to the legislative branch,\n     the Secretary's power to issue subpoenas does\n     not. Furthermore, the CAA neither references\n     the Secretary's authority and powers under\n     USERRA nor sets forth provisions granting an\n     agency investigatory authority and powers.\n     (Sec.  405(f) of the CAA grants subpoena\n     powers to hearing officers, and Sec.  408\n     authorizes civil actions in which courts may\n     issue subpoenas, but these CAA authorities do\n     not grant subpoena powers for use in agency\n     investigation.).\nJudicial Procedures and Remedies:\n    3. Individual liability. Because 38 U.S.C.      38 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n     Sec.  4303(4)(A)(1) defines an ``employer''     4303(4)(A)(1),\n     in the private sector to include a ``person .   4323.\n     . . to whom the employer has delegated the\n     performance of employment-related\n     responsibilities,'' two courts have held that\n     individuals may be held individually liable\n     in an action under 38 U.S.C. Sec.  4323.\n     Jones v. Wolf Camera, Inc., Civ. A. No. 3:96-\n     CV-2578-D, 1997 WL 22678, at *2 (N.D. Tex.,\n     Jan. 10, 1997); Novak v. Mackintosh, 919\n     F.Supp. 870, 878 (D.S.D. 1996). However, the\n     USERRA provisions that authorize civil\n     actions and damages do not, by their own\n     terms, extend to the legislative branch.\n     Under the CAA, while Sec.  206(b) authorizes\n     damages, individuals may not be held\n     individually liable, because only an\n     employing office may be named as respondent\n     or defendant under Sec. Sec.  401-408 of the\n     CAA and all awards and settlements must\n     generally be paid out of an account of the\n     Office of Compliance under Sec.  415(a) of\n     the CAA.\n    4. Private right to sue immediately, without    38 U.S.C. Sec.\n     having exhausted administrative remedies. A     4323(a)(2), (b).\n     private-sector employee alleging a USERRA\n     violation may sue immediately, without\n     exhausting any administrative remedies.\n     However, USERRA does not, by its own terms,\n     entitle legislative branch employees to\n     either file an administrative complaint or\n     commence a civil action. Under the CAA, a\n     covered employee may file an administrative\n     complaint or commence a civil action, but\n     only after having completed periods of\n     counseling and mediation and an additional\n     period of at least 30 days.\n    5. Enforceability of subpoenas for information  38 U.S.C. Sec.\n     or documents within the jurisdiction of the     4323(a)(2), (b).\n     House or Senate. USERRA authorizes civil\n     actions against private-sector employees in\n     which courts exercise their ordinary subpoena\n     authority. As noted in row 4 above, USERRA\n     does not, by its own terms, entitle\n     legislative branch employees to either file\n     an administrative complaint or commence a\n     civil action. The CAA does authorize civil\n     actions, as well as administrative\n     adjudications, but such authorization is\n     subject to Sec.  413 of the CAA, by which the\n     House and Senate decline to waive certain\n     powers relating to records and information,\n     as discussed in connection with Title VII at\n     page 3, row 13, above.\n    6. Four-year statute of limitation. USERRA      38 U.S.C. Sec.\n     states that no state statute of limitations     4323(c)(6).\n     shall apply, but otherwise provides no\n     statute of limitations. Under 28 U.S.C. Sec.\n     1658, statutes like USERRA enacted after\n     December 1, 1990, have a 4-year statute of\n     limitations unless otherwise provided by law.\n     As noted in row 4 above, USERRA does not\n     entitle legislative branch employees to\n     either file an administrative complaint or\n     commence a civil action. Under the CAA,\n     proceedings must be commenced within 180 days\n     after the alleged violation.\nDamages:\n    7. Liquidated damages. Under USERRA, 38 U.S.C.  38 U.S.C. Sec.\n     Sec.  4323(c)(1)(A)(iii) grants the district    4323(c)(1)(A)(iii).\n     courts jurisdiction to require a private-\n     sector employer to pay not only compensatory\n     damages, but also an equal amount of\n     liquidated damages. This provision does not,\n     by its own terms, extend to the legislative\n     branch. Under the CAA, Sec.  206(b) provides\n     that the remedy for a violation of Sec.\n     206(a) of the CAA shall include such remedy\n     as would be appropriate if awarded under 38\n     U.S.C. Sec.  4323(c)(1). However, the CAA\n     does not state specifically whether the\n     liquidated damages authorized by subparagraph\n     (A)(iii) of Sec.  4323(c)(1) are included\n     among the remedies incorporated by Sec.\n     206(a). By contrast, in the two other\n     instances where a law made generally\n     applicable by the CAA provides for liquidated\n     damages, the CAA states specifically that the\n     liquidated damages are incorporated. See Sec.\n      201(b)(2)(B) of the CAA (authorizing the\n     award of ``such liquidated damages as would\n     be appropriate if awarded under section 7(b)\n     of [the ADEA]'); Sec.  203(b) of the CAA\n     (authorizing the award of ``such remedy,\n     including liquidated damages, as would be\n     appropriate if awarded under section 16(b) of\n     the [FLSA]'').\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n         OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT OF 1970 (``OSHAct'')\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA. SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS\n \n1. Employers may not retaliate against employees    Sec. 11(c); 29\n of other employers. Sec.  11(c) of the OSHAct       U.S.C. Sec.\n forbids retaliation against ``any employee'' for    660(c).\n exercising rights under the OSHAct, and Labor\n Department regulations state that ``because\n section 11(c) speaks in terms of any employee, it\n is also clear that the employee need not be an\n employee of the discriminator.'' 29 C.F.R. Sec.\n 1977.5(b). Under the CAA, an employing office may\n be charged with retaliation under Sec.  207 only\n by a ``covered employee,'' defined as an employee\n of the nine legislative-branch employers listed\n in Sec.  101(3).\n2. Unions and other ``persons'' not acting as       Secs. 3(4), 11(c);\n employers may not retaliate. Sec.  11(c) of the     29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n OSHAct forbids retaliation against an employee by    652(4), 660(c).\n any ``person,'' and Sec.  3(4) defines ``person''\n broadly to include ``one or more individuals'' or\n ``any organized group of persons.'' Regulations\n of the Labor Secretary explain: ``A person may be\n chargeable with discriminatory action against an\n employee of another person. Sec.  11(c) would\n extend to such entities as organizations\n representing employees for collective bargaining\n purposes, employment agencies, or any other\n person in a position to discriminate against an\n employee.'' 29 C.F.R. Sec.  1977.5(b). Under the\n CAA, Sec.  207 forbids retaliation only by an\n employing office.\n \nB. ENFORCEMENT\n \nAgency Enforcement Authorities:\n3. Authority to conduct ad hoc inspections without  Sec. 8(a); 29 U.S.C.\n a formal request by an employing office or          Sec.  657(a).\n covered employee. Sec.  8(a) of the OSHAct\n authorizes the Labor Secretary to conduct\n inspections in the private sector at any\n reasonable times. Under the CAA, Sec.  215(c)(1),\n (e)(1) references Sec.  8(a) of the OSHAct, but\n only for the purpose of authorizing the General\n Counsel to exercise the Secretary's authority in\n making inspections. However, Sec.  215(c)(1), (e)\n only provides express authority to inspect\n ``[u]pon written request of any employing office\n or covered employee'' or in ``periodic\n inspections'' that are ``[o]n a regular basis,\n and at least once each Congress.''.\n\n[[Page S1051]]\n\n \n    4. Grant of investigatory powers. The OSHAct    Sec. 8(b); 29 U.S.C.\n     empowers the Labor Secretary, in conducting     Sec.  657(b).\n     an inspection or investigation, to compel the\n     production of evidence under oath. The CAA\n     neither references Sec.  8(b) nor sets forth\n     similar provisions granting compulsory\n     process in the context of inspections and\n     investigations. (Sec.  405(f) of the CAA\n     grants subpoena powers to hearing officers,\n     but these CAA authorities do not grant\n     subpoena powers for use in agency inspection\n     or investigation.).\n5. Authority to require recordkeeping and           Secs. 8(c), 24(e);\n reporting of general work-related injuries and      29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.\n illnesses. The OSHAct requires employers to make     657(c), 673(e).\n and preserve such records as the Labor Secretary,\n in consultation with the HHS Secretary, may\n prescribe by regulation as necessary or\n appropriate for enforcement, and to file such\n reports as the Secretary may prescribe by\n regulation. Employers must also maintain records\n and make periodic reports on work-related deaths,\n injuries, and illnesses, and maintain records of\n employee exposure to toxic materials. The CAA\n does not reference these provisions, and the\n Board, in adopting implementing regulations,\n determined that these requirements were not made\n applicable by the CAA. 143 Cong. Rec. S64 (Jan.\n 7, 1997). However, the Board did incorporate into\n its regulations several employee-notification\n requirements with respect to particular hazards\n that are contained in specific Labor Department\n standards.\n6. Agency enforcement of the prohibition against    Sec. 11(c)(2); 29\n retaliation. Under the OSHAct, an employee who      U.S.C. Sec.\n has suffered retaliation may file a complaint       660(c)(2).\n with the Labor Secretary, who shall conduct an\n investigation and, if there was a violation,\n shall sue in district court. The CAA does not\n reference these provisions and no provision of\n the CAA sets forth similar provisions authorizing\n an agency to investigate a complaint of\n retaliation or to bring an enforcement proceeding.\nAdministrative and Judicial Procedures and\n Remedies:\n7. Individual liability for retaliation. Because    Sec. 11(c); 29\n Sec.  11(c) of the OSHAct forbids retaliation by    U.S.C. Sec.\n ``any person,'' an employee's officer responsible   660(c).\n for retaliation may be sued and, in appropriate\n circumstances, be held liable. See Donovan v.\n Diplomat Envelope Corp., 587 F. Supp. 1417, 1425\n (E.D.N.Y. 1984) (``We cannot rule out the\n possibility that damages might under some\n circumstances be appropriately imposed upon an\n employer's officer responsible for a\n discriminatory discharge.'') The CAA does not\n reference Sec.  11(c) of the OSHAct, and\n individuals may be neither sued nor held liable\n under the CAA because Sec.  207 forbids\n retaliation only by an employing office, only an\n employing office may be named as respondent or\n defendant under Sec. Sec.  401-408, and all\n awards and settlements must generally be paid out\n of an account of the Office of Compliance under\n Sec.  415(a).\n8. Employer's burden to contest a citation within   Sec. 10(a); 29\n 15 days. The OSHAct provides that the employer      U.S.C. Sec.\n has the burden of contesting a citation within 15   659(a).\n days, or else the citation becomes final and\n unreviewable. The CAA does not reference these\n provisions, and Sec.  215(c)(3) of the CAA places\n the burden of initiating proceedings on the\n General Counsel.\n9. Employees' right to challenge the abatement      Sec. 10(c); 29\n period. The OSHAct gives employees or their         U.S.C. Sec.\n representatives the right to challenge, in an       659(c).\n adjudicatory hearing, the period of time fixed in\n a citation for the abatement of a violation. The\n CAA neither references these provisions nor sets\n forth similar provisions establishing a process\n by which employees or their representatives may\n challenge the abatement period.\n10. Employees' right to participate as parties in   Sec. 10(c); 29\n hearings on citations. The OSHAct gives affected    U.S.C. Sec.\n employees or their representatives the right to     659(c).\n participate as parties in hearings on a citation.\n The CAA neither references these provisions nor\n sets forth similar provisions allowing employees\n or their representatives to participate as\n parties.\n11. Employees' right to take appeal from            Sec. 11(a); 29\n administrative orders on citations. The OSHAct      U.S.C. Sec.\n gives ``any person adversely affected or            660(a).\n aggrieved'' by an order on a citation the right\n to appeal to the U.S. Courts of Appeals. The CAA\n does not reference these provisions, and Sec.\n 215 (c)(3), (5) sets forth authority for the\n employing office and the General Counsel to bring\n or participate in administrative or judicial\n appeals on a citation only.\n12. Enforceability of subpoenas for information or  Sec. 12(h)-(i); 29\n documents within the jurisdiction of the House or   U.S.C. Sec.  661(h)-\n Senate. The OSHAct grants subpoena power to the     (i).\n Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission,\n which holds adjudicatory hearings under the\n OSHAct. The CAA also authorizes administrative\n adjudications, but such authorization is subject\n to Sec.  413 of the CAA, by which the House and\n Senate decline to waive certain powers relating\n to records and information, as discussed in\n connection with Title VII at page 3, row 13,\n above.\n13. Court jurisdiction, upon petition of the        Sec. 13(a) 29 U.S.C.\n agency, to restrain imminent danger. Sec.  13(a)    Sec.  662.\n of the OSHAct grants jurisdiction to the district\n courts, upon petition of the Labor Secretary, to\n restrain an imminent danger. Under the CAA, Sec.\n 215(b) references Sec.  13(a) of the OSHAct to\n the extent of providing that ``the remedy for a\n violation'' shall be ``an order to correct the\n violation, including such order as would be\n appropriate if issued under section 13(a).''\n However, the only process set forth in the CAA\n for the granting of remedies is the citation\n procedure under Sec. Sec.  215(c)(2)-(3) and 405,\n culminating when the hearing officer issues a\n written decision that shall ``order such remedies\n as are appropriate pursuant to title II [of the\n CAA].'' Thus, the CAA does not expressly grant\n jurisdiction to courts to issue restraining\n orders authorized under Sec.  215(b) and does not\n expressly authorize the General Counsel to\n petition for such restraining orders. However,\n Sec.  4.12 of the Procedural Rules of the Office\n of Compliance states that, if the General\n Counsel's designee concludes that an imminent\n danger exists, ``he or she shall inform the\n affected employees and the employing offices . .\n . that he or she is recommending the filing of a\n petition to restrain such conditions or practices\n . . . in accordance with section 13(a) of the\n OSHAct, as applied by section 215(b) of the CAA.\n14. Employees' right to sue for mandamus            Sec. 13(d); 29\n compelling the Labor Secretary to seek a            U.S.C. Sec.  662(d)\n restraining order against an imminent danger. The\n OSHAct gives employees at risk or their\n representatives the right to sue for a writ of\n mandamus to compel the Secretary to seek a\n restraining order and for further appropriate\n relief. The CAA neither references these\n provisions nor sets forth similar provisions\n authorizing employees or their representatives to\n seek to compel an agency to act.\nCivil and Criminal Penalties:\n15. Civil penalties for violation. Civil penalties  Sec. 17(a)-(d), (i)-\n may be assessed for violations of the OSHAct,       (l); 29 U.S.C. Sec.\n graded in terms of seriousness and willfulness of    666(a)-(d), (i)-\n the violation. The CAA does not reference these     (l).\n provisions, and Sec.  225(c) of the CAA\n specifically precludes the awarding of civil\n penalties.\n16. Criminal penalties for willful violation        Sec. 17(e); 29\n causing death. Under the OSHAct, fines and          U.S.C. Sec.\n imprisonment may be imposed for a willful           666(e).\n violation causing death. The CAA neither\n references these provisions nor sets forth\n similar provisions imposing criminal penalties.\n17. Criminal penalties for giving unauthorized      Sec. 17(f); 29\n advance notice of inspection. Under the OSHAct,     U.S.C. Sec.\n fines and imprisonment may be imposed for giving    666(f).\n unauthorized advance notice of an inspection. The\n CAA does not reference these provisions or\n otherwise provide for criminal penalties. Sec.\n 4.06 of the Procedural Rules of the Office of\n Compliance forbids giving advance notice of\n inspections except as authorized by the General\n Counsel in specified circumstances, but\n applicable penalties are not specified.\n18. Criminal penalties for knowingly making false   Sec. 17(g); 29\n statements. Under the OSHAct, fines and             U.S.C. Sec.\n imprisonment may be imposed for knowingly making    666(g).\n false statements in any application, record, or\n report under the OSHAct. The CAA neither\n references these provisions nor sets forth\n similar provisions imposing criminal penalties.\n \nC. OTHER AGENCY AUTHORITIES\n \n19. Requirement that citations be posted. Sec.      Sec. 9(b); 29 U.S.C.\n 9(b) of the OSHAct requires that each citation be   Sec.  658(b).\n posted at or near the place of violation, as\n prescribed by ``regulations issued by the\n Secretary.'' The Secretary may enforce this\n requirement under Sec. Sec.  9 and 17 of the\n OSHAct, which include authority to issue\n citations and to assess or seek civil and\n criminal penalties for a violation of any\n ``regulations prescribed pursuant to'' the\n OSHAct. Under the CAA, Sec.  215(c)(2) references\n Sec.  9 of the OSHAct, but only to the extent of\n granting the General Counsel the authorities of\n the Secretary ``to issue'' a citation or notice,\n and the CAA does not expressly state whether the\n employing office has a duty to post the citation.\n Sec.  4.13 of the Procedural Rules of the Office\n of Compliance directs employing offices to post\n citations, but the Procedural Rules are issued\n under Sec.  303 of the CAA, which authorizes the\n adoption of rules governing ``the procedures of\n the Office [of Compliance].'' Furthermore, as to\n whether a requirement to post citations is\n enforceable under the CAA, the only enforcement\n mechanism stated in Sec.  215 is set forth in\n subsection (c)(2), which authorizes the General\n Counsel to issue citations ``to any employing\n office responsible for correcting a violation of\n subsection (a)''; but subsection (a) does not\n expressly reference either Sec.  9(b) of the\n OSHAct or the Office's Procedural Rules.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAppendix II--Enforcement Regimes of Certain Laws Made Applicable by the \n                                  CAA\n\n       The tables in this Appendix show the elements of private-\n     sector enforcement regimes for nine of the laws made \n     applicable by the CAA: Title VII, ADEA, EPA, ADA title I, \n     FMLA, FLSA, EPPA, WARN Act, and USERRA. (Because ADA title I \n     incorporates powers and procedures from Title VII, these two \n     laws are combined in a single table.) These nine are the laws \n     for which the CAA does not grant investigatory or prosecutory \n     authority to the Office of Compliance. ADA titles II-II, the \n     OSHAct, and Chapter 71, for which the CAA does grant such \n     enforcement authority to the Office of Compliance, are not \n     included in these tables.\n       In each of the tables, agency enforcement authority is \n     described in the following six categories:\n       1. Initiation of agency investigation, whether by receipt \n     of a charge by an affected individual or by agency \n     initiative.\n       2. Investigatory powers of the agency, including authority \n     to conduct on-site investigations and power to issue and \n     enforce subpoenas.\n       3. Authority to seek compliance by informal conference, \n     conciliation, and persuasion.\n       4. Prosecutory authority, including power of an agency to \n     commence civil actions, the remedies available, and the \n     authority to seek fines or civil penalties.\n       5. Authority of the agency to issue advisory opinions.\n       6. Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.\n\n\n        TITLE VII and AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (title I)\n\n       The ADA (title I) incorporates by reference the enforcement \n     powers, remedies, and procedures of Title VII,1 \n     and is therefore summarized here in the same chart as Title \n     VII.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Endnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       1. Initiation of investigation. Individual charges. When an \n     individual claimant files a charge, Title VII and the ADA \n     require the EEOC to serve notice of the charge on the \n     respondent and to investigate.2 Commissioner \n     charges. Title VII and the ADA also require the EEOC to serve \n     notice and to investigate any charge filed by a Member of the \n     EEOC.3 Commissioner charges are ordinarily based \n     on leads developed by EEOC field offices.\n       2. Investigatory powers.\n       On-site investigation. In connection with the investigation \n     of an individual charge or a Commissioner charge, Title VII \n     and the ADA authorize the EEOC and its representatives to \n     ``have access to, for purposes of examination, and the right \n     to copy any evidence.'' 4 According to the EEOC \n     Compliance\n\n[[Page S1052]]\n\n     Manual, this authority includes interviewing \n     witnesses.5\n       Subpoenas. Issuance. Title VII and the ADA grant the EEOC \n     the power to issue subpoenas, relying on authorities under \n     the NLRA,6 and EEOC regulations specify that \n     subpoenas may be issued by any Commission member or any \n     District Directors and certain other agency Directors and \n     ``any representatives designated by the Commission.'' \n     7 Petitions for revocation or modification. Under \n     EEOC regulations, Title VII and ADA subpoenas may be \n     challenged by petition to the Director who issued the \n     subpoena, who shall either grant the petition in its entirety \n     or submit a proposed determination to the Commission for \n     final determination.8 Enforcement. Title VII and \n     the ADA also empower the EEOC to seek district court \n     enforcement of such subpoenas under authorities of the \n     NLRA,9 and EEOC regulations specify that the \n     General Counsel or his or her designee may institute such \n     proceedings.10\n       3. ``Reasonable cause'' determination; Conciliation. Title \n     VII and the ADA provide that, if the EEOC determines after \n     investigation that there is ``reasonable cause to believe \n     that the charge is true,'' then the EEOC must ``endeavor to \n     eliminate any such alleged unlawful employment practice'' by \n     informal ``conference, conciliation, and persuasion''; \n     otherwise, the EEOC must dismiss the charge and send notice \n     to the parties, including a right-to-sue letter to the person \n     aggrieved.11\n       4. Prosecutory authority.\n       Civil enforcement actions. Generally. The EEOC has the \n     authority to prosecute alleged private-sector Title VII and \n     ADA violations in district court, after the Commission has \n     found ``reasonable cause'' and has been unable to resolve the \n     case through ``conference, conciliation, and persuasion.'' \n     12 The EEOC General Counsel brings such civil \n     actions on behalf of the EEOC. Remedies. The agency may \n     request Title VII remedies (injunction, with or without back \n     pay);13 compensatory or punitive damages may be \n     granted only in an ``action brought by a complaining party.'' \n     14 Title VII and the ADA also authorize the EEOC \n     to ask the district courts for temporary or preliminary \n     relief.15\n       Relation with private right of action. If the EEOC sues, \n     Title VII specifically authorizes the person aggrieved to \n     intervene.16 If the EEOC dismisses the charge, or \n     fails to either enter into a conciliation agreement including \n     the person aggrieved or commence a civil action within 180 \n     days after the charge is filed, the EEOC must issue a right-\n     to-sue letter to the person aggrieved, who may then sue; and \n     the EEOC may then intervene if the case is of ``general \n     public importance.'' 17\n       Fine for notice-posting violation. Title VII (though not \n     the ADA) imposes a fine of not more than $100 for a willful \n     violation of notice-posting requirements.18 The \n     EEOC Compliance Manual states that the EEOC district or area \n     office can levy such a fine, and, if a respondent is \n     unwilling to pay, ``The Regional Attorney should be \n     notified.'' 19\n       5. Advisory opinions. Title VII. Title VII establishes a \n     defense for good-faith reliance on ``any written \n     interpretation or opinion of the Commission.'' 20 \n     EEOC regulations specify that the following may be relied \n     upon as such: (i) an ``opinion letter'' of the Legal Counsel \n     or the General Counsel approved by the Commission, (ii) a \n     Federal Register publication designated as an \n     ``interpretation or opinion,'' or (iii) an ``interpretation \n     or opinion'' included in a Commission determination of no \n     reasonable cause. 21 ADA. Unlike the other \n     discrimination laws, the ADA does not establish a defense for \n     good-faith reliance on advisory opinions, and EEOC \n     regulations do not provide for their issuance. Nevertheless, \n     the EEOC appended ``interpretive guidance'' to its \n     substantive regulations, stating that ``the Commission will \n     be guided by it when resolving charges of employment \n     discrimination.'' 22\n       6. Recordkeeping/reporting. Title VII and the ADA require \n     employers to make and preserve records, and to make reports, \n     as the EEOC shall prescribe ``by regulation or order, after \n     public hearing.'' 23 Recordkeeping. EEOC \n     regulations require employers to preserve for one year \n     ``[a]ny personnel or employment record,'' 24 and \n     also reserve the right to impose specific recordkeeping \n     requirements on individual employers or group of \n     employers.25 The EEOC's Title VII ``Uniform \n     Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures'' require that \n     records be maintained by users of such \n     procedures.26 Reporting. EEOC regulations require \n     employers having 100 or more employees to file an annual \n     Title VII ``Employer Information Report EEO-1,'' \n     27 and also reserve the right to impose special or \n     supplementary reporting requirements on individual employers \n     or groups of employers under either Title VII or the \n     ADA.28 Enforcement. The EEOC may ask district \n     courts to order compliance with Title VII and the ADA \n     recordkeeping and reporting requirements.29\n\n\n              AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 1967\n\n       The ADEA is a procedural hybrid, modeling some of its \n     procedures on Title VII, and incorporating other procedures \n     from the FLSA. The ADEA was originally implemented and \n     enforced by the Labor Department; the Secretary's functions \n     were transferred to the EEOC by the Reorganization Plan in \n     1978, 30 and ADEA procedures were conformed in \n     some respects to those of Title VII by the Civil Rights Act \n     of 1991.\n       1. Initiation of investigation. Individual charges. Upon \n     receiving any ADEA complaint, the EEOC must notify the \n     respondent. 31 Unlike Title VII and the ADA, the \n     ADEA does not specifically require the EEOC to investigate \n     complaints, but the EEOC applies a uniform policy for all \n     discrimination laws, conducting an investigation appropriate \n     to each particular charge. 32 Directed \n     investigations. Unlike Commissioner charges under Title VII \n     or the ADA, directed investigations under the ADEA may be \n     commenced without action by an EEOC Member or notice to the \n     respondent.\n       2. Investigatory powers. The ADEA grants the EEOC broad \n     investigatory power by reference to the FLSA. 33 \n     With respect to subpoenas, the FLSA relies, in turn, on \n     authorities of the FTC Act. 34\n       On-site investigation. The EEOC and its representatives are \n     authorized to investigate and gather data, enter and inspect \n     an employer's premises and records, and question employees to \n     ``determine whether any person has violated'' the ADEA or \n     which may ``aid in . . . enforcement.'' 35\n       Subpoenas. Issuance. The ADEA, relying on authorities of \n     the FTC Act, grants to the EEOC the power to issue subpoenas. \n     36 EEOC regulations, citing the agency's power to \n     delegate under the ADEA, delegate subpoena power to agency \n     Directors and the General Counsel or their designees. \n     37 Unlike under Title VII and the ADA, there is no \n     procedure for asking the EEOC to reconsider or review a \n     subpoena under the ADEA. 38 Enforcement. The ADEA \n     authorizes the EEOC to invoke the aid of Federal courts to \n     enforce subpoenas under authorities of the FTC Act, \n     39 and the EEOC Compliance Manual specifies that \n     the Office of General Counsel and the Regional Attorneys may \n     institute such proceedings. 40\n       3. ``Reasonable cause'' determination; Conciliation. The \n     ADEA provides that, upon receiving a charge, the EEOC must \n     ``seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful practice'' by \n     informal ``conference, conciliation, and persuasion.'' \n     41 The ADEA, unlike Title VII and the ADA, does \n     not require the Commission to make a ``reasonable cause'' \n     determination as a prerequisite to conciliation, but EEOC \n     regulations state that informal conciliation will be \n     undertaken when the Commission has a ``reasonable basis to \n     conclude'' that a violation has occurred or will occur. \n     42\n       4. Prosecutory authority.\n       Civil actions. Generally. The EEOC has authority to \n     prosecute alleged ADEA violations in district court if the \n     EEOC is unable to ``effect voluntary compliance'' through \n     informal conciliation. 43 The EEOC General Counsel \n     brings such civil actions on behalf of the EEOC. Remedies. \n     The agency may request amounts owing under the ADEA, \n     including liquidated damages in case of willful violations, \n     and an order restraining violations, including an order to \n     pay compensation due. 44\n       Relation with private right of action. An individual may \n     bring a civil action 60 days after a charge is filed \n     45 and must sue within 90 days after receiving \n     notice from the EEOC that the charge has been dismissed or \n     proceedings otherwise terminated. 46 Thus, in \n     contrast to Title VII and the ADA, the ADEA does not require \n     that the EEOC issue a right to sue letter before an \n     individual may sue. 47 As is the case under the \n     FLSA, the EEOC's commencement of a suit on the individual's \n     behalf terminates the individual's unexercised right to sue, \n     48 but most cases hold that an EEOC suit filed \n     after an individual has commenced a suit does not terminate \n     the individual's suit. 49\n       5. Advisory opinions. The ADEA establishes a defense for \n     good-faith reliance on ``any written administrative \n     regulation, order, ruling, approval, or interpretation'' of \n     the EEOC. 50 EEOC regulations specify that the \n     following may be relied upon as such: (i) an ``opinion \n     letter'' of the Legal Counsel or the General Counsel approved \n     by the Commission, or (ii) a Federal Register publication \n     designated as an ``interpretation or opinion'; 51 \n     and the EEOC has codified a body of its ADEA interpretations \n     in the Code of Federal Regulations. 52\n       6. Recordkeeping/reporting. The ADEA empowers the EEOC to \n     require the keeping of necessary and appropriate records in \n     accordance with the powers in section 11 of the FLSA. \n     Recordkeeping. EEOC regulations specify the ``payroll'' \n     records that employers must maintain and preserve for at \n     least 3 years and ``personnel or employment'' records that \n     employers must maintain and preserve for at least 1 year. \n     53 Reporting. Although the ADEA does not \n     specifically require employees to submit reports, it \n     references FLSA provisions requiring every employer ``to make \n     such reports'' from required records'' as the Administrator \n     shall prescribe. 54 EEOC regulations require each \n     employer to make ``such extension, recomputation, or \n     transcription'' of records and to submit ``such reports \n     concerning actions taken and limitations and classifications \n     of individuals set forth in records'' as the EEOC or its \n     representative may request in writing. 55\n\n\n                             equal pay act\n\n       The enforcement regime for the Equal Pay Act (``EPA'') is a \n     hybrid between the FLSA model and the Title VII mode. The EPA \n     legislation in 1963 added a new section 6(d) to the FLSA \n     establishing substantive rights and \n     responsibilities,56 and relied on the existing \n     FLSA provisions establishing enforcement powers, remedies, \n     and procedures. The EPA was, at first, implemented and \n     enforced by the Labor Department with the rest of the FLSA; \n     the Secretary's EPA functions were transferred to the EEOC by \n     the Reorganization Plan in 1978,57 and the EEOC \n     has\n\n[[Page S1053]]\n\n     conformed its EPA enforcement processes with those for Title \n     VII in some respects.\n       1. Initiation of investigation. Individual complaints. \n     Unlike the other discrimination laws, the FLSA, as amended by \n     the EPA, does not require the EEOC to notify the respondent \n     or to investigate complaints. However, the EEOC applies a \n     uniform policy for all discrimination laws, conducting an \n     investigation appropriate to each particular \n     charge.58 Directed investigations. Unlike \n     Commissioner charges under Title VII and the ADA, directed \n     investigations under the ADEA may be commenced without action \n     by an EEOC Member or notice to the respondent.\n       2. Investigatory powers. The FLSA, of which the EPA is a \n     part, grants the EEOC broad investigatory \n     authority.59 With respect to subpoenas, the FLSA \n     relies, in turn, on authorities of the FTC Act.60\n       On-site investigation. The FLSA, as amended by the EPA, \n     authorizes the EEOC and its representatives to investigate \n     and gather data, enter and inspect an employer's premises and \n     records, and question employees to ``determine whether any \n     person has violated'' the EPA or which may ``aid in . . . \n     enforcement'' of the EPA. 61\n       Subpoenas. Under the FLSA, as amended by the EPA, the EEOC \n     can issue and enforce subpoenas, relying on the authorities \n     of the FTC Act.62 Issuance. The power under the \n     FLSA to issue subpoenas may not be delegated,63 \n     and EEOC regulations provide that subpoenas may be issued by \n     any Member of the Commission.64 Enforcement. The \n     FLSA, as amended by the EPA, authorizes the EEOC to invoke \n     the aid of Federal courts to enforce subpoenas,65 \n     and the EEOC Compliance Manual specifies that the Office of \n     General Counsel and the Regional Attorneys may institute such \n     proceedings.66\n       3. ``Reasonable Cause'' Determination; Conciliation. The \n     FLSA, as amended by the EPA, does not require the EEOC to \n     issue a written determination on each case or to undertake \n     conciliation efforts. However, it is EEOC's uniform policy to \n     issue ``reasonable cause'' letters for all laws, once a case \n     has been found to meet the reasonable cause \n     standard,67 and EEOC office directors are granted \n     discretion to invite a respondent to engage in conciliation \n     negotiations when a ``reasonable cause'' letter is \n     issued.68\n       4. Prosecutory authority.\n       Civil proceedings. Generally. The EEOC has the authority to \n     prosecute alleged EPA violations in district \n     court.69 Unlike other discrimination laws, the \n     FLSA, as amendment by the EPA, authorizes the EEOC to sue \n     without first having undertaken conciliation efforts. The \n     EEOC General Counsel brings such civil actions on behalf of \n     the EEOC. Remedies. The agency may request back wages, plus \n     an equal amount in liquidated damages on behalf of aggrieved \n     persons, and may also seek an injunction in federal district \n     court restraining violations, including an order to pay \n     compensation due, plus interest.70\n       Relation with private right of action. Unlike the other \n     discrimination laws, the FLSA, as amended by the EPA, does \n     not require an individual to first file a charge with the \n     EEOC and await conciliation efforts before bringing a civil \n     action.71 If the EEOC first commences suit on the \n     individual's behalf, the individual's right to bring suit \n     terminates.72\n       5. Advisory opinions. The Portal-to-Portal Act (``PPA'') \n     establishes a defense for good-faith reliance on the \n     ``written administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, \n     or interpretation'' of the Administrator.73 The \n     EEOC has published procedures for requesting opinion letters \n     under the EPA, and has specified that the following may be \n     relied upon as such: (i) an ``opinion letter'' of the Legal \n     Counsel or the General Counsel approved by the Commission, or \n     (ii) a Federal Register publication designated as an \n     ``interpretation or opinion.'' 74\n       6. Recordkeeping/reporting. Under the FLSA, as amended by \n     the EPA, every employer must make and preserve such records, \n     and ``make such reports therefrom,'' as the EEOC shall \n     prescribe ``by regulation or order.'' 75 \n     Recordkeeping. The EEOC regulations adopt by reference the \n     Labor Department's FLSA regulations specifying the \n     ``payroll'' and other records that employers must maintain \n     and preserve for at least 3 years and the ``employment and \n     earnings'' records that employers must maintain and preserve \n     for at least 2 years.76 In addition, EEOC \n     regulations require employers to preserve for 2 years any \n     records made in the ordinary course of business that describe \n     or explain any differential in wages paid to members of the \n     opposite sex in the same establishment.77 \n     Reporting. The Labor Department's regulations, which are \n     adopted by reference by EEOC's regulations, also require each \n     employer to make ``such extension, recomputation, or \n     transcription'' of required records, and to submit ``such \n     reports,'' as may be ``require[d] in writing.'' 78\n\n\n                  family and medical leave act of 1993\n\n       The FMLA incorporates much of the investigative authority \n     set forth in the FLSA 79 and establishes \n     prosecutorial powers modeled on those in the \n     FLSA.80 Furthermore, the FMLA specifically \n     requires the Secretary to ``receive, investigate, and attempt \n     to resolve'' complaints of violations ``in the same manner \n     that the Secretary receives, investigates, and attempts to \n     resolve complaints of [FLSA] violations.'' 81\n       1. Initiation of investigation. Individual complaints. The \n     FMLA requires that complaints be received and investigated in \n     the same manner as FLSA complaints, even though the FLSA \n     itself does not require the receipt and investigation of \n     individual complaints. In practice, as the Wage and Hour \n     Division receives and accepts complaints, which it analyzes \n     and investigates on a worst-first priority \n     basis,82 the Division is required to do the same \n     for FMLA complaints. Directed investigations. The FMLA \n     references the investigatory power as the FLSA,83 \n     under which authority the Division conducts directed \n     investigations.84\n       2. Investigatory powers.\n       On-site investigation. The FMLA references the \n     investigatory power of the FLSA,85 which affords \n     authority to the Administrator and his representatives to \n     investigate and gather data, enter and inspect an employer's \n     premises and records, and question employees to ``determine \n     whether any person has violated'' the FLSA or which may ``aid \n     in . . . enforcement'' of the FLSA.86\n       Subpoenas. The FMLA incorporates the subpoena power set \n     forth in the FLSA, under which the Secretary and the \n     Administrator can issue and enforce subpoenas, relying on the \n     authorities of the FTC Act.87 Issuance. The power \n     of the Secretary and the Administrator to issue subpoenas \n     under the FLSA may not be delegated.88 \n     Enforcement. The FLSA authorizes the Secretary and the \n     Administrator to invoke the aid of Federal courts to enforce \n     subpoenas,89 and that such civil litigation on \n     behalf of the Department is handled by the Solicitor of Labor \n     and the Regional Solicitors.\n       3. Conciliation. The FMLA requires the Secretary to \n     ``attempt to resolve'' FMLA complaints in the same way as \n     FLSA complaints, even though the FLSA does not require \n     conciliation. In practice, however, where the FLSA violation \n     appears to be minor and to involve only a single individual, \n     the investigator will ask the employee for permission to use \n     his or her name and will then telephone the employer to ask \n     for a response to the charge, and, if there appears to be a \n     violation, will close the matter upon the payment of back \n     wages.90\n       4. Prosecutory authority.\n       Civil proceedings. Generally. The Secretary has the \n     authority to prosecute alleged FMLA violations in district \n     court.91 The FMLA specifies that the Solicitor of \n     Labor may represent the Secretary in any such \n     litigation.92 Remedies. The agency may seek: (i) \n     damages, including liquidated damages, owing to an employee, \n     and (ii) an order restraining violations, including an order \n     to pay compensation due, or other equitable \n     relief.93\n       Relation with private right of action. Unlike the \n     discrimination laws, but like the FLSA, the FMLA does not \n     require an individual to first file a charge with the agency \n     and await conciliation efforts before bringing a civil \n     action.94 However, if the Labor Department first \n     commences suit on the individual's behalf, the individual's \n     right to bring suit terminates.95\n       Administrative assessment of civil penalties. Civil \n     penalties for violation of notice-posting requirements \n     96 may be assessed, according to the Secretary's \n     regulations, by any Labor Department representative, subject \n     to appeal to the Wage and Hour Regional Administrator, and \n     subject to judicial collection proceeding commenced by the \n     Solicitor of Labor.97\n       5. Advisory opinions. Although the FMLA establishes a \n     defense against liquidated damages for good-faith violations \n     where the employer had reasonable cause to believe the \n     conduct was not a violation,98 the Act does not \n     refer specifically to reliance on interpretations or opinions \n     of the Secretary or the Administrator, and the Secretary's \n     regulations contain neither FMLA interpretations or opinions \n     designated as such nor procedures for requesting \n     interpretations or opinions.\n       6. Recordkeeping/reporting. Recordkeeping. The FMLA \n     requires employers to make, keep, and preserve records in \n     accordance with regulations of the Secretary,99 \n     and those regulations specify the records regarding payroll, \n     benefits, and FMLA leave and disputes that employers must \n     maintain and preserve for 3 years.100 Reporting. \n     The FMLA references the recordkeeping authorities under the \n     FLSA, which include the requirement that employers shall make \n     ``reports therefrom [from required records]'' as the \n     Administrator shall ``prescribe by regulation or \n     order.''101 The FMLA further provides that the \n     Secretary may not require an employer to submit to the \n     Secretary any books or records more than once in 12 months, \n     unless the Secretary has reasonable cause to believe there \n     may be a violation or is investigating an employee \n     charge.102 The Secretary's FMLA regulations \n     indicate that employers must submit records ``specifically \n     requested by a Departmental official'' and must prepare \n     ``extensions or transcriptions'' of information in the \n     records ``upon request.'' 103\n\n\n                    FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938\n\n       1. Initiation of investigation. Individual complaints. \n     Unlike Title VII, the FLSA does not specifically require the \n     investigation of individual complaints, but the Wage and Hour \n     Division receives and accepts complaints, which it analyzes \n     and investigates on a worst-first priority basis. \n     104 Directed investigations. The FLSA has no \n     counterpart to the Commissioner charges under Title VII. \n     Instead, the Division can conduct directed investigations \n     without formal approval by the head of the agency, developing \n     leads\n\n[[Page S1054]]\n\n     from a variety of sources. 105 The Division also \n     conducts periodic compliance surveys, reviewing wages paid to \n     a statistical sampling of employees at a random sample of \n     employers, and may initiate a directed investigation when a \n     violation is evident. 106\n       2. Investigatory powers.\n       On-site investigation. The FLSA authorizes the \n     Administrator and his representatives to investigate and \n     gather data, enter and inspect an employer's premises and \n     records, and question employees to ``determine whether any \n     person has violated'' the FLSA or which may ``aid in . . . \n     enforcement'' of the FLSA. 107\n       Subpoenas. Under the FLSA, the Secretary and the \n     Administrator can issue and enforce subpoenas, relying on the \n     authorities of the FTC Act. 108 Issuance. The \n     power of the Secretary and the Administrator to issue \n     subpoenas under the FLSA may not be delegated. 109 \n     Enforcement. The FLSA authorizes the Secretary and the \n     Administrator to invoke the aid of Federal courts to enforce \n     subpoenas, 110 and such civil litigation on behalf \n     of the Department is handled by the Solicitor of Labor and \n     the Regional Solicitors.\n       3. Conciliation. Unlike Title VII, the FLSA does not \n     require ``reasonable cause'' determinations or conciliation. \n     In practice, where the violation appears to be minor and to \n     involve only a single individual, the investigatory will ask \n     the employee for permission to use of his or her name and \n     will then telephone the employer to ask for a response to the \n     charge, and, if there appears to be a violation, will close \n     the matter upon the payment of back wages. 111\n       4. Prosecutory authority.\n       Civil proceedings. Generally. The Secretary has the \n     authority to prosecute alleged FLSA violations in district \n     court. 112 The Solicitor of Labor and Regional \n     Solicitors are responsible for bringing litigation on behalf \n     of the Administrator.

The agency may seek: (i) \n     unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation and liquidated \n     damages owing to an employee, (ii) civil penalties, and (iii) \n     an order restraining violations, including an order to pay \n     compensation due. 113\n       Relation with private right of action. Unlike the \n     discrimination laws, the FLSA does not require an individual \n     to first file a charge with the agency and await conciliation \n     efforts before bringing a civil action. 114 \n     However, if the Labor Department first commences suit on the \n     individual's behalf, the individual's right to bring suit \n     terminates. 115\n       Administrative assessment of civil penalties; criminal \n     proceedings. Civil penalties for repeated or willful \n     violations or for child labor violations are assessed \n     initially by the Secretary, and, if the respondent takes \n     exception, are decided through adjudication before an ALJ, \n     subject to appeal to the Labor Secretary and judicial review \n     in federal district court. 116 The FLSA also \n     imposes fines and imprisonment for willful violations. \n     117\n       5.

The Portal-to-Portal Act establishes \n     a defense for good-faith reliance on the ``written \n     administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, or \n     interpretation'' of the Administrator. 118 The \n     Administrator has issued interpretative bulletins and \n     advisory opinions ``to indicate the construction of the law \n     which will guide the Administrator in the performance of his \n     administrative duties.'' 119\n       6. Recordkeeping/reporting. The FLSA requires every \n     employer to make and preserve such records, and ``to make \n     such reports therefrom,'' as the Wage and Hour Administrator \n     shall prescribe ``by regulation or order.'' 120 \n     Recordkeeping. Labor Department regulations specify the \n     ``payroll'' and other records that employers must maintain \n     and preserve for at least 3 years and the ``employment and \n     earnings'' records that employers must maintain and preserve \n     for at least 2 years. 121 Reporting. These \n     regulations also require each employer to make ``such \n     extension, recomputation, or transcription'' of required \n     records, and to submit ``such reports,'' as the Administrator \n     may ``request in writing.'' 122\n\n\n               EMPLOYEE POLYGRAPH PROTECTION ACT OF 1988\n\n       The enforcement regime under the EPPA is similar to that \n     under the FLSA in some respects, and in other respects is sui \n     generis.\n       1. Initiation of investigation. Individual complaints. Like \n     the FLSA and unlike Title VII, the EPPA does not specifically \n     require the investigation of individual complaints. However, \n     the Labor Secretary's regulations provide that the Wage and \n     Hour Division will receive reports of violations from any \n     person. 123 Directed investigations. Like the FLSA \n     and unlike Title VII, the EPPA authorizes the Labor \n     Department to conduct directed investigations without formal \n     approval by the head of the agency. 124\n       2. Investigatory powers.\n       On-site investigation. The EPPA authorizes the Secretary to \n     make ``necessary or appropriate'' investigations and \n     inspections. 125\n       Subpoenas. Under the EPPA, as under the FLSA, the Secretary \n     can issue and enforce subpoenas, relying on the authorities \n     of the FTC Act. 126 The EPPA authorizes the \n     Secretary to invoke the aid of Federal courts to enforce \n     subpoenas, 127 and civil litigation on behalf of \n     the Department is handled by the Solicitor of Labor. \n     128\n       3. Conciliation. Like the FLSA and unlike Title VII, the \n     EPPA does not require ``reasonable cause'' determinations or \n     conciliation.\n       4. Prosecutory authority.\n       Civil proceedings. Generally. The EPPA authorizes the Labor \n     Secretary to prosecute in alleged EPPA violations in district \n     court. 129 The Solicitor of Labor may represent \n     the Secretary in such litigation. 130 Remedies. \n     The agency may seek temporary or permanent restraining orders \n     and injunctions to require compliance, including incidental \n     relief such as reinstatement and back pay and benefits. \n     131\n       Relation with private right of action. Unlike the \n     discrimination laws, and like the FLSA, the EPPA does not \n     require an individual to first file a charge with the agency \n     and await conciliation efforts before bringing a civil \n     action. 132 However, unlike both the \n     discrimination laws and the FLSA, the EPPA does not state \n     that the individual's right to bring suit to terminates upon \n     the filing of an enforcement action by the Secretary. \n     133\n       Administrative assessment of civil penalties. Civil \n     penalties for violations are assessed initially by the \n     Secretary. Applying the procedures of the Migrant and \n     Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, the EPPA \n     provides that, if the respondent takes exception, the \n     validity of the assessment is decided through adjudication \n     before an ALJ, who renders an initial decision subject to \n     modification by the Labor Secretary, and subject to judicial \n     review in federal district court. 134\n       5. Advisory opinions. Unlike both Title VII and the FLSA, \n     the EPPA establishes no defense for good-faith reliance on \n     agency advisory opinions, and the Labor Secretary's EPPA \n     regulations contain neither EPPA interpretations or opinions \n     designated as such nor procedures for requesting \n     interpretations or opinions. However, the regulations contain \n     provisions that the Secretary characterized as \n     ``interpretations regarding the effect of . . . the Act on \n     other laws and collective bargaining agreements.' \n     135\n       6. Recordkeeping/reporting. Recordkeeping. The EPPA \n     requires the keeping of records ``necessary or appropriate \n     for the administration'' of the EPPA. 136 Labor \n     Department regulations specify the records regarding any \n     polygraph use that employers and examiners must maintain and \n     preserved for 3 years. 137 Reporting. The EPPA and \n     Labor Department regulations do not impose any reporting \n     requirements.\n\n\n           WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING NOTIFICATION ACT\n\n       The WARN Act establishes no agency investigative or \n     enforcement authority, and is enforced solely through the \n     private right of action.\n       1. Initiation of investigation. None.\n       2. Investigatory powers. None.\n       3. Conciliation. The WARN Act makes no provision for \n     conciliation.\n       4. Prosecutory authority. None.\n       5. Advisory opinions. The WARN Act makes no provision for \n     advisory opinions.\n       6. Recordkeeping/reporting. None.\n\n\n   UNIFORMED SERVICES EMPLOYMENT AND REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS ACT OF 1994\n\n       1. Initiation of investigation. Individual complaints. When \n     an employee files a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, \n     the Secretary is required to investigate.138 \n     Directed investigations. The USERRA does not authorize \n     investigations without an employee complaint.\n       2. Investigatory powers.\n       On-site investigation. In connection with the investigation \n     of any complaint, USERRA authorizes the Secretary's ``duly \n     authorized representatives'' to interview witnesses and to \n     examine and copy any relevant documents.139\n       Subpoenas. Issuance. The Secretary can issue subpoenas \n     under the USERRA.140 Enforcement. The USERRA \n     authorizes the Attorney General, upon the request of the \n     Secretary, to invoke the aid of Federal courts to enforce \n     subpoenas.141\n       3. Finding that violation occurred; conciliation. If the \n     Secretary determines that the action alleged in a complaint \n     occurred, the USERRA requires the Secretary to ``attempt to \n     resolve the complaint by making reasonable efforts to \n     ensure'' compliance.142 If the Secretary is unable \n     to resolve the complaint in this manner, the Secretary shall \n     so notify the complaining employee.143\n       4. Prosecutory authority.\n       Civil proceedings. Generally. A complaining employee who \n     receives notification that the Secretary could not resolve \n     the complaint may ask the Secretary to refer the matter to \n     the Attorney General, who, if reasonably satisfied that the \n     complaint is meritorious, may prosecute the alleged USERRA \n     violation in district court on behalf of the \n     employee.144 Remedies. The Attorney General may \n     seek the same remedies as a private individual under USERRA: \n     injunctions and orders requiring compliance, compensation for \n     lost wages and benefits, and, for willful violations, \n     liquidated damages.145\n       Relation with private right of action. Unlike the \n     discrimination laws, the USERRA does not require an employee \n     to first file an administrative complaint and await \n     conciliation efforts before bringing a civil \n     action.146 If the employee does choose to file an \n     administrative complaint, the employee may sue upon \n     notification that the Secretary could not resolve the \n     complaint informally, and may sue as well if the employee \n     asks the Attorney General to take the case but the Attorney \n     General declines.147 If the employee asks the \n     Attorney General to pursue the case and the Attorney General \n     does so, the individual may not also pursue a private action.\n       5. Advisory opinions. The USERRA establishes no defense for \n     good-faith reliance on agency advisory opinions, and the \n     Labor Secretary has not promulgated in the Federal Register \n     any interpretations or opinions designated as such nor \n     procedures for requesting interpretations or opinions.\n\n[[Page S1055]]\n\n       6. Recordkeeping/reporting. The USERRA imposes no \n     recordkeeping or reporting requirements.\n\n\n                                ENDNOTES\n\n     Notes regarding table 1--title VII & ADA (title I)\n     \\1\\ Sec. 107(a) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C.

(The Board takes as its model the CAA as it \n     would be modified by enactment of the recommendations made in \n     Part II of this Report.)\n       (2) Federal-Sector Option--Coverage under the statutory and \n     regulatory regime that applies generally in the federal \n     sector, including the authority of executive-branch agencies \n     as they administer and enforce those laws in the federal \n     sector.\n       (3) Private-Sector Option--Coverage under the statutory and \n     regulatory regimes that apply generally in the private \n     sector, including the authority of the executive-branch\n\n[[Page S1056]]\n\n     agencies as they administer and enforce those laws in the \n     private sector.\n       To make these comparisons, the tables use four side-by-side \n     columns. The first column shows the current regime at each \n     instrumentality, described in four categories: (a) \n     substantive rights, (b) administrative processes, (c) \n     judicial procedures, and (d) substantive rulemaking \n     processes, if any. The other three columns compare the \n     current regime with the CAA option, the federal-sector \n     option, and the private-sector option.\n       Items in the charts are marked with the following codes:\n       ``='' indicates rights and procedures now applicable at the \n     instrumentality that would remain substantially the same if \n     alternative provisions were applied.\n       ``+'' indicates rights and procedures not now applicable at \n     the instrumentality that would apply if alternative \n     provisions were applied.\n       ``-'' indicates rights and procedures now applicable at the \n     instrumentality that would no longer apply if alternative \n     provisions were applied.\n       ``'' indicates other changes in rights and \n     procedures that would result if alternative provisions were \n     applied.\n       ``{  '' indicates the amendments to the CAA proposed in the \n     Board's three specific recommendations set forth in Part II \n     of this Report, which are--\n       (1) Grant the Office the authority to investigate and \n     prosecute violations of section 207 of the CAA, which \n     prohibits intimidation and reprisal. (2) Clarify that section \n     215(b) of the CAA, which makes applicable the remedies set \n     forth in section 13(a) of the OSHAct, gives the General \n     Counsel the authority to seek a restraining order in district \n     court in case of imminent danger to health or safety. (3) \n     Make applicable the record-keeping and notice-posting \n     requirements of the private-sector CAA laws.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ In Part II of the Report, in addition to these three \n     specific recommendations, the Board also made two general \n     recommendations, see Sections B.4 and B.5 of Part II, which \n     are not described in the tables in this Appendix. Also not \n     described in the tables are: the modifications that Members \n     Adler and Seitz believe should be made to the CAA, as applied \n     to GAO GPO, and the Library, in order to preserve certain \n     rights now applicable at those instrumentalities, see Section \n     D.2 of Part III of this Report; and the recommendations made \n     in Part I of the Report, see Sections C.1, C.2.(b), D.1.(b), \n     and D.2.(b) of Part I of the Report.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The comparisons in these tables address the substantive \n     rights afforded by the CAA or by the provisions of CAA laws \n     \\2\\ and other analogous provisions that apply to federal-\n     sector employers, private-sector employers, or the three \n     instrumentalities. Furthermore, in defining coverage under \n     each option, the Board decided that the application of the \n     CAA or of analogous federal-sector or private-sector \n     provisions should supersede existing provisions affording \n     substantially similar substantive rights or establishing \n     processes and procedures to implement, remedy, or enforce \n     such rights. Applicable provisions affording substantive \n     rights having no analogue in the CAA, and processes to \n     implement, remedy, or enforce such rights, would not be \n     affected by the coverage described in the three options.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ The term ``CAA laws'' refers to the eleven laws, \n     applicable in the federal and private sectors, made \n     applicable to the legislative branch by the CAA. The nine \n     private-sector CAA laws are: the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 201 et seq.) (``FLSA''), Title VII of \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e et seq.) \n     (``Title VII''), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et seq.) (``ADA''), the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 621 \n     et seq.) (``ADEA''), the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 \n     (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2611 et seq.) (``FMLA''), the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 651 et seq.) \n     (``OSHAct''), the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 \n     (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2001 et seq.) (``EPPA''), the Worker \n     Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2101 et seq.) (``WARN Act''), and section 2 of the \n     Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of \n     1994 (``USERRA''). The two federal-sector CAA laws are: \n     Chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code (relating to \n     federal service labor-management relations) (``Chapter 71''), \n     and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 701 et \n     seq.).\n\n                   APPENDIX III, TABLE 1.--GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE: TITLE VII, ADEA, AND EPA\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                            --Compared to Federal-      --Compared to Private-\n       Current Regime         --Compared to CAA Coverage        Sector Coverage             Sector Coverage\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS\n \nFederal-sector provisions    =Substantive rights under    =Substantive rights under   =Substantive rights under\n of Title VII (Sec.  717)     the CAA are generally the    federal-sector provisions   private-sector provisions\n and the ADEA (Sec.  15),     same as those at GAO         are generally the same as   are generally the same as\n as well as the EPA, apply                                 those at GAO                those at GAO.\n to GAO\n \n                                            ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES\n \nGAO management investigates  +Use of model ADR process    =The processes at GAO are   +The EEOC investigates and\n and decides complaints       under CAA is prerequisite    modeled generally on        prosecutes in the private\n initially                    to proceeding with           those in the federal        sector.
