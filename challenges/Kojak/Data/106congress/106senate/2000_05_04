Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request \nregarding debate on this amendment.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, my assumption is that the unanimous-\nconsent agreement that was entered into\n\n[[Page S3454]]\n\nand envisioned, we would alternate between sides if there are speakers \non each side, but that it would govern the order in which the \nDemocratic side speakers would address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding. The Chair, \nunder the unanimous-consent request, will alternate between sides. The \nspeakers on the Democratic side are Senator Kennedy, Senator Murray, \nand Senator Wellstone, in that order.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, title II of the bill before the Senate \ntoday includes a provision called the Teacher Employment Act--or TEA. \nThis provision combines the current ESEA, title II, Eisenhower \nProfessional Development Program and the class-size reduction program, \nfor a total of $2 billion, which is then made available to states and \nlocal education agencies for teacher development programs.\n  Our amendment would amend the TEA provision--and expand the scope of \nallowable uses of title II professional development funds to allow \nstates and local education agencies to use these funds for the \ndevelopment and implementation of teacher testing, merit-based pay, and \ntenure reform programs.\n  Mr. President, I believe that a qualified, highly trained, and highly \nmotivated teacher is the key to a quality education for America's \nchildren. Most of our colleagues would agree.\n  Teachers play a special and indispensable role in our children's \neducation. Nothing can replace the positive and long-lasting impact a \ndedicated, knowledgeable teacher has on a child's learning process.\n  The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future found that \nwhile class size reduction has the least impact on increasing student \nachievement and that teacher-education--teacher quality--has the most \nimpact on student achievement.\n  Our amendment is designed to improve the quality of our teachers. It \nputs into practice the common sense we all share--the sense that \nteachers should be trained in the area they teach, that outstanding \nteachers should be rewarded, and that a teacher's promotion should be \nbased not just on longevity but on performance.\n  Let me explain why I believe this amendment is important. First, I \nbelieve that teachers should know the subject matter they teach. \nUnfortunately, this is not always the case in many classrooms around \nthe country. According to the Department of Education, one-third of \nhigh school math teachers, nearly 25 percent of high school English \nteachers and 20 percent of science teachers, are teaching without a \ncollege major or minor in their subjects. Teacher testing allows school \ndistricts to better target those teachers in need of additional \nprofessional development. By pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses \nof teachers, schools will be able to place teachers in their area of \nspecialty and help those teachers in need of additional professional \ndevelopment.\n  A recent study, using student math scores on the Tennessee \nComprehensive Assessment Program for two large Tennessee metropolitan \narea school systems, at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville ranked \nteachers based on five objective rankings of effectiveness. By the \nfifth grade, students who had studied under ``highly ineffective'' \nteachers averaged 54 to 60 points lower on achievement tests than \nstudents who had spent the 3 years with ``highly effective'' teachers.\n  I believe that States and local districts should be allowed to use \nFederal funds for teacher testing programs to determine which teachers \nare effective, and for which teachers additional professional \ndevelopment would be of assistance.\n\n  Second, I believe that outstanding teachers should be rewarded with \nmerit-based pay increases. Teachers who motivate and inspire their \nstudents and put forth the extra effort to improve and expand their own \nskills should be rewarded. In the business world, employees who go the \nextra mile and exceed expectations are financially rewarded for their \ndedication and hard work. Are teachers, tasked with educating and \nshaping our children lives and futures, any less deserving of merit-\nbased pay rewards?\n  Merit-based pay would reward teachers for exceptional teaching--\nproviding added incentive to excel at a demanding and challenging \nprofession. A senior associate at the Educational Trust, an advocacy \ngroup for the poor, once referred to high-poverty schools as boot camps \nfor teachers.\n  Shouldn't there be the option of rewarding teachers who choose to \ntake the more difficult path or who inspire less advantaged students to \nperform at a level well above that of their peers? I believe every one \nof us understands that teachers do, indeed, deserve these rewards. And, \nwhat is more, our kids deserve the improved educational experience such \nrewards will produce. Finally, I believe that teachers should be \npromoted to higher positions based on performance and subject \nexpertise, not just on the longevity of their tenure.\n  Tenure reform ensures teachers will be held accountable for their \noverall performance in the classroom. According to U.S. News and World \nReport, the presiding officer's own State of Kentucky's tenure \nreforms--which includes exhaustive performance evaluations of teachers \nand schools and accountability for poorly performing teachers and \nadministrators--have dramatically improved many of that State's worst \nperforming schools. All of these reforms can vastly improve the quality \nof instruction in the classroom, which will provide students with the \neducational tools necessary to succeed in this new demanding economy \nthey confront. I believe we ought to permit the States and local \ndistricts to use federal funds to design, develop, and implement these \nreforms--should they decide to do so.\n  Now let me now explain what this amendment does and does not do. It \npermits--and I stress word ``permits''--states and localities to use \nthese funds for teacher testing, merit pay, or tenure reform programs. \nIt does not mandate or require them to set up these programs--nor does \nit penalize them if they choose not to. It gives States and localities \nthe freedom to decide precisely how these programs should be designed \nand how they should be administered. It does not require the States and \nlocal districts to do anything with the information gathered from \ntesting or which tests to be used. Nor would they be required to base \nmerit pay decisions on the outcome of the teacher tests. This amendment \ndoes not dictate that Federal funds must be used for tenure reform or \nestablish criteria for such reform. Again, it only permits States and \nlocal districts to use funds for those purposes if they choose, based \non how they choose.\n  While it could be argued that teacher testing, tenure reform, and \nmerit-pay programs are already permissible uses under the Teachers \nEmpowerment Act provision, we believe that explicitly listing these \nprograms would eliminate any uncertainty among the states and local \ndistricts, granting them the freedom to full develop and implement the \nprograms which will best target their specific needs in teacher \nprofessional development. This amendment is based in the same \nprinciples as the legislation that passed the Senate last Congress with \nbipartisan support by a vote of 63-35.\n  In conclusion, I would like to recognize a very simple fact. We in \nWashington too often focus on these issues from simply a national \nperspective. I think this debate we have had over the last few days \nclearly focuses on the important, critical role States and especially \nlocal school districts must play in the development of quality \neducation in our Nation.\n  This amendment is designed to give even more flexibility to the \nStates and the local districts to use these Federal funds for programs \nthat we believe can help to improve their quality. There are no \nmandates. This is simply a permissible use that we would be providing.\n  In summary, we think this legislation can be improved by the \namendment. We look forward to hearing discussion on it today. We \nbelieve it is important to reward quality teachers of this country for \ntheir commitment to ensure our children will be taught by the most \nqualified and knowledgeable individuals available.\n  I will have more to say on this as we go forward. I know there are \nother Senators wishing to address the issue. I note the presence of \nSenators Mack, Wellstone, and Kennedy, so I yield the floor and I will \nspeak again at a later point.\n\n[[Page S3455]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, generally around here if there is someone \nwho is proposing the amendment, they are recognized to make opening \ncomments. I understand there is a cosponsor on that. I think they \nshould be entitled to also make opening comments. We will be glad to \nhear from the other cosponsor of the amendment if he would like to \nspeak first.\n  Mr. MACK. I am glad to let my colleague go first.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just make a brief opening comment. \nI want to start off by mentioning where we are on the issue of teacher \ntraining and teacher enhancement that is being addressed by my good \nfriend from Michigan. Under the Republican bill, there is $2 billion \nfor teacher quality and class size--that is a total of $2 billion. \nIncluded in that, is $1.3 billion which is presently allocated for the \nclass size reduction program that has been implemented for 2 years in a \nrow. Therefore, the 29,000 teachers teaching today in grades 1, 2, and \n3, who are getting paid out of class size reduction program funds, will \neffectively be receiving pink slips because the Republicans are taking \nthat program's money and putting it into the Republican bill.\n  Second, part of that $2 billion is the $350 million that is currently \nbeing used in math and science professional development across the \ncountry. The $350 million program, named after President Eisenhower, \nhelps local schools to develop the capability of math and science \nteachers. It has been a good program and is working effectively around \nthe country.\n  So, the Republicans want to wipe out the new teachers who have been \nhired for the first, second, and third grade; they want to end the \nEisenhower math and science professional development program.\n  On the other hand, our total proposal on the Democrat side is $3.75 \nbillion. We have $2 billion which is for professional development, \nmentoring and recruitment, and $1.75 billion for class size reduction. \nWe had, as part of our debate yesterday, included our $3.75 billion in \nthe democratic substitute. Last evening, I reviewed what we did in our \nparticular proposal and the guarantees we provided for teacher quality \nand education. We made sure in our amendment that there was going to be \na guarantee of funds for professional development. The other side only \nmentions ``a portion of funds for professional development''. It is \nironic to hear my friends talk about the importance of professional \ndevelopment, when they barely target any funds in their existing bill \nfor professional development. ``A portion can be spent.''\n  Furthermore, their bill does not guarantee any funds for mentoring \nprograms, which we all know are so important and effective for \nretaining teachers.\n  We find the turnover of teachers serving in title I underserved areas \naverages 50 to 60 percent in 4 years as compared to those who have \nmentoring, which can make a great deal of difference to teachers. Their \namendment does not address the issue of how to resolve the high \nturnover rate issue. It does not guarantee that teachers are going to \nget special skills to help students with disabilities or limited \nEnglish proficiency. It does not give priority to developing math and \nscience training programs.\n  When all is said and done, our Republican friends have come up with \nnothing to ensure that a certain amount of these funds go for \nprofessional development, mentoring programs, recruitment programs--\nactivities we know are proven to improve teacher quality and retention.\n  We were anticipating, maybe unreasonably so, that in the areas that \nare tried, tested, and true, such as enhanced teacher training in the \nclassroom, that our friends were going to come up with something. \nBasically, what they came up with is merit pay and testing of teachers. \nWe have listened carefully to what the Senator stated. We are, as I \nmentioned, somewhat interested in the fact that these are the two \nareas.\n  In looking through the studies and reports of incentives for teachers \nto advance their capability of academic achievement and results, the \ncumulative studies are very compelling and are rather common sense.\n  Obviously, the academic background of the teacher's expertise is \nenormously important. But, we still are finding out that of the more \nthan 50,000 teachers who were hired this past year, the majority of \nthose serving in high-poverty areas are not fully qualified. We need to \ndo something about this. We find there is a higher turnover rate in \nhigh-poverty schools. We know that if the schools want to hold on to \nnew teachers, mentoring by experienced teachers, is effective. Studies \nhave shown this.\n  Also, it is very evident that there ought to be continuing education \nand professional development for all teachers. As the information comes \nin and more studies are conducted, it is clear that professional \ndevelopment ought to take place not outside the school but in the \nclassrooms and schools.\n  These are the models which have had the greatest success in ensuring \nall of our teachers are of the highest quality. For those who are not \ngoing to measure up, after evaluations and professional development, \nthey ought to be given their fair due in terms of a hearing, but then \nmoved out of the educational system.\n  That is what we believe, that is for what we stand, and that is \nincluded in our educational provisions. Those are the issues that we \nfeel are important.\n  I ask the Senator whether he knows of any States that have embarked \non a merit pay program.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. My understanding is States have experimented with merit \npay programs since the 1960s. I can recall in the late 1960s when I was \nan intern working in the education office of the Governor of Michigan, \nwe were looking at various experimental programs, learning from models \nfrom places such as North Carolina and other States that were \nexperimenting with those programs.\n  It seems to me this is not a new proposal at all. It is one with \nwhich various States have experimented and employed in different ways \nfor a long time. That was my first experience with it, I think in 1969, \n1970.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I asked the question because last night I tried to find \nout which States have merit pay programs, and I was unable to find any.\n  Currently, there is nothing prohibiting States from implementing \nmerit pay programs. If it is so successful, I would have thought we \nwould have had several States already doing it and demonstrated that it \nhas improved student achievement.\n  I can give the Senator a number of places where it has been tried and \ndropped. In Fairfax County, VA, they developed a merit pay program in \nthe last few years, but the program was dropped.\n  I am all for incentives for teachers who move ahead in their academic \nachievements and accomplishments. We ought to provide incentives to \nencourage professional development and more advanced degrees. I am all \nfor schools that are able to move ahead, and for giving flexibility to \nthe States and the educational districts to provide financial \nincentives to do that. But in the areas where we are talking about \nrifleshot programs, which this amendment does, for particular \nindividuals--I can, probably like the good Senator from Washington, \nMrs. Murray, think of teachers who are teaching in some of the toughest \nschools in Boston, in Holyoke, MA, and in a number of other \ncommunities, who are showing up every day, working hard, facing \nextraordinary challenges where almost a third of all the children \nattending those schools are coming from homes where there is either \nphysical abuse or substance abuse. They deserve combat pay.\n\n  But that isn't what this is really about. This is about individuals \nand principals giving individual financial incentives. What we want to \ntry to do is to make available--at least on our side--the kinds of \nfinancial resources available to local communities, for whole school \nreform.\n  I know the other side believes that States should have block grants--\nblank checks--but we want to support tried and tested programs that \nhave worked.\n  I have a very interesting study here that was just completed by the \nNational Commission on Teaching & America's Future, the Consortium for \nPolicy Research in Education. A review of 65 studies of science \nteaching concluded that teachers' effectiveness in\n\n[[Page S3456]]\n\nteaching science depends on the amount and kind of teacher education, \ndisciplinary training, and the professional development opportunities \nthey experience later in their careers.\n  That is what we should have, the continuing, ongoing availability and \nrequirement that there is going to be a continuing upgrading of the \nskills of teachers. That is what they want.\n  What we have seen to be a strong determinant of teacher effectiveness \nstems from the quality of the teacher's initial teaching education and \ncertification, and, second, later, professional development. Studies \ndone over the last few years have shown this to be true.\n  In listening to our colleague speak, I was just trying to find out \nwhere his programs have been effective.\n  I yield at this time and then will come back to the issue. There are \nothers who want to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, let me make just a couple of comments before \nI give my prepared remarks.\n  It is interesting how this debate is being engaged rather vigorously \nso quickly and so early this morning. I remind my colleagues that this \nis basically this same amendment that was adopted by the Senate 63-35 \nin the last Congress.\n  I imagine the reason for it is that all of my colleagues received a \nletter from the National Education Association, the teachers union, in \nopposition to this amendment. This letter from the National Education \nAssociation on behalf of its 2.5 million members strongly urges \nopposition to the amendment offered by Senator Abraham and myself. They \nare opposed to it because it authorizes ``federal funds for [the \npurpose of] testing of current teachers, tenure reform, and merit \npay.''\n  I find it interesting that the NEA previously came out in support of \ntesting--NEA President Bob Chase has said the NEA:\n\n       . . . wholeheartedly supports and endorses the \n     recommendations of the National Commission on Teaching and \n     America's Future's new report, ``Doing What Matters Most: \n     Investing in Quality Teaching.''\n\n  The report recommends: Teachers should be licensed based on \ndemonstrated performance, including tests of subject matter knowledge, \nteaching knowledge, and teaching skill.\n  The report recommends: To encourage and reward teacher knowledge and \nskill, we should develop a career continuum for teaching linked to \nassessments and compensation systems that reward knowledge and skill.\n  That sounds to me like a broad endorsement of the concept of testing \nteachers to understand where they are with respect to the knowledge \nthey have in the courses they are going to be teaching. I think it \nclearly indicates the idea of moving away from pay being based on \nsomeone's seniority to one based on merit--pay should be based on the \nability to teach, the ability to be able to show, in testing, that they \nhave the knowledge in the areas in which they are teaching.\n  So I make that comment to begin.\n  Further, with respect to questions about merit pay, again, my \ncolleague already referred to the fact there have been States \nexperimenting with this idea since the late 1960s. But Denver, CO, has \na merit pay system. Interestingly enough, the Secretary of Education, \nSecretary Riley, when he was Governor of South Carolina, endorsed merit \npay.\n  In Florida, we encourage teachers to participate in what I believe is \nthe National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. If a teacher in \nthe State of Florida successfully completes that process and becomes \ncertified by this board, they are going to receive a bonus. I think \nthat is merit pay.\n  So this idea that I think the Senator from Massachusetts tried to \nimply, that this is something no one is pursuing and there is no value \nto it, I would say, is not accurate.\n  Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, Senator \nAbraham, to offer this critically important amendment. It focuses on \nthe single most important, yet most overlooked, aspect of education--\nthe quality of America's teachers.\n  Education is the engine of social and economic progress, and the \nladder of opportunity. The rungs of that ladder must be supported by \nexceptional teachers. I have little doubt that the American spirit of \ningenuity and innovation will continue to lead the world in providing \nnew economic opportunities, expanding medical research and improving \nthe quality of life for everyone. But there is a catch. For our \nchildren and grandchildren to achieve the high standards we expect of \nthem, we must provide them with the tools they need to help them excel. \nThe economic security of our children depends upon the quality of their \neducation.\n  Each time we debate education reform in America, there is a growing \nsentiment that continued viability of the American dream could slip \naway simply because our children are unprepared to face tomorrow's \nchallenges. The academic performance of America's students in \ninternational exams can hardly be considered world class. In fact, the \nlonger our students attend American schools, the further behind they \nfall in performance. Consider these statistics:\n  While America's 4th graders score above the international average in \nmath tests, they continue to trail students in countries like Austria, \nthe Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, and \nSingapore. By the 8th grade, American students barely meet the \ninternational average, and by the 12th grade, American students lag far \nbehind their international peers.\n  In science, U.S. students score above the international average in \nboth 4th and 8th grades. But, in 4th grade, U.S. students are outranked \nby only one country--Korea. By the 8th grade, thirteen countries \noutrank U.S. students.\n  Again, that is an indication that the longer they are in school, the \nfurther behind they fall with other countries in the world.\n  In international physics tests, American 12th graders ranked \nsixteenth, and far behind countries like Russia, Slovenia, Latvia and \nthe Czech Republic.\n  In both math and science, the performance of U.S. 12th graders is \namong the lowest in the industrialized world. Of the 21 countries that \nparticipate, the United States placed 16th in science and 19th in math \nskills.\n  Our students will be denied basic opportunities because they have not \nbeen adequately equipped to face a new, competitive, and global \neconomy. We can and must do better.\n  Without qualified teachers in America's classrooms, all other \nattempts at reform are meaningless. We have long focused on the need to \nhire more teachers--as many as two million over the next decade. Our \nfocus shouldn't be on the number of teachers, but rather, on the \nquality of those teachers.\n  As long as students are compelled to attend school, we should be \ncompelled to staff those schools with the best and brightest teachers. \nParents all over the state of Florida, and I imagine the same is true \naround the country, are concerned that the success--or failure--of \ntheir child's entire academic year will be determined by the quality \nand expertise of their child's teacher. Studies show that the most \nimportant factor in determining student success on standardized tests \nis the teacher's ability to present the material. As States are taking \nimportant steps to challenge their students with high-stakes tests for \npromotion and graduation, we must encourage states to step up to the \nplate and provide students with teachers who are better prepared than \never before.\n\n  Further complicating the situation is the shortage of teachers \nnationwide, which has led many school districts to assign teachers to \nsubjects for which they have no formal training. Four million American \nstudents are currently being taught English, Math, or History by \nteachers who have neither a college major or minor in the subject they \nare teaching. Four million kids!\n  Mr. President, maybe I have a slightly different perspective in \nlooking at these numbers today than I would have, say, 5 or 6 weeks \nago. Priscilla and I were just blessed with our first granddaughter. We \nalready have three grandsons, but this is our first granddaughter. \nWhile all of us in the family are engaged in the early days of raising \nthat little baby and trying to get through the night, we are also \nconcerned about the future for little Addison. Is she going to be among \nthe one out of five students in America being taught English by a \nteacher who doesn't have a major or minor in English?\n\n[[Page S3457]]\n\n  Think about that for a moment. I think one out of four math students \nare being taught by teachers who do not have a minor or major in that \nsubject. So when I think about little Addison's future, and I realize \nthe competitive world in which we live today, and how much more \ncompetitive it is going to be in the future, I know she is not going to \nbe able to compete and have the same opportunities we all have enjoyed \nif she doesn't have an education second to none. Frankly, that can only \ncome about as a result of having high-quality teachers in the \nclassroom--teachers who my son and his wife, Ann, can be comfortable in \nknowing have the knowledge and expertise to provide that education.\n  Requiring secondary school teachers to earn a major or minor in their \nsubjects might make sense if there were not a clearly superior policy \nthat could be adopted instead, such as requiring teachers to pass a \nsubject knowledge test for the subject areas they teach.\n  Teacher testing is an important first step toward upgrading the \nquality of instruction in the classroom. Testing provides a valuable \nopportunity for teachers to demonstrate knowledge of subjects for which \nthey do not hold a major or minor degree. It will also enable \nprincipals to evaluate their staffing needs and to staff classrooms \nwith the most qualified teachers. You simply can not teach what you \ndon't know.\n\n  Common sense also dictates that we should not focus solely on under-\nperforming teachers. We must also recognize that there are many great \nteachers who are successfully challenging their students on a daily \nbasis. Teaching is one of the most important and challenging \nprofessions. While many excellent, enthusiastic, and well prepared \nteachers already work in America's schools, their work often goes \nunrecognized and unrewarded. Salaries for teachers lag far behind other \nprofessions for which a college degree is expected or required, and as \na result, many exceptional teachers leave the profession and others who \nwould be exceptional teachers never even consider teaching.\n  We have created a system of clear incentives for our best teachers to \nleave the classroom. Instead, we should be enacting policies to keep \nthe best and brightest teachers in the classroom. To do this, we need \nto evaluate and reward teachers with a compensation system that \nsupports and encourages them to strengthen their skills and demonstrate \nhigh levels of performance. That, in turn, will enhance learning for \nall children.\n  Today, schools compensate teachers based almost solely on seniority, \nnot on their performance inside the classroom. It rewards \nunderperforming teachers and penalizes exceptional ones by grouping \nthem together in a single pay scale based primarily upon length of \nservice. Merit-pay would differentiate between teachers who are hard-\nworking and inspiring, and those who fall short. It is true that good \nteachers cost money. But the fact is, bad teachers can cost more \nbecause they limit the education of a child and his or her ability to \ncontribute to society.\n  We hear quite often that merit pay won't work in public schools \nbecause it is too difficult to compare the accomplishments between \nteachers teaching smart, wealthy, well-disciplined, well-fed children \nversus those teaching poor, inattentive, hungry and unruly children. \nThese conditions are no different than the differences faced by other \nprofessionals like doctors or lawyers who face both unwinnable cases or \ndeadly diseases. Teachers should also be rewarded proportionately to \ntheir accomplishments in enhancing student learning, attitudes, and \nbehavior.\n  This is not to suggest that simply throwing more money at schools and \nteachers will rescue schools from mediocrity. Some suggest we try \nthrowing more money at the problem, although I would point out that we \nhave already tried that. The United States spends more money per pupil \nthan any other industrialized nation, and as I mentioned earlier, our \nchildren are not achieving high levels of performance on international \nstandardized exams. The reality is that no amount of money will save \nmismanaged, bureaucratic, red-tape ridden schools from failure. And no \namount of money will rescue a student who is placed in a classroom led \nby an unprepared, unenthusiastic, and uninspiring teacher. This debate \nis less about money and more about giving teachers a greater stake in \nthe education they provide. We can do this by offering them real \nincentives to do their best so that their dedication and expertise will \nbe recognized and rewarded. This will benefit all students.\n  Our amendment, known as the MERIT Act, will enable states to use \ntheir limited federal dollars on a number of initiatives to enhance \nteacher quality. First, this amendment provides funding for states to \ndevelop rigorous exams to periodically test elementary and secondary \nschool teachers on their knowledge of the subjects they are teaching. \nSecondly, this amendment provides funding to states to establish \ncompensation systems for teachers based upon merit and proven \nperformance. Finally, this amendment provides states with resources to \nreform current tenure programs.\n  This broad approach will enable states to staff their schools with \nthe best and most qualified teachers, thereby enhancing learning for \nall students. In turn, teachers can be certain that all of their \nenergy, dedication and expertise will be rewarded. And it will be done \nwithout placing new mandates on states or increasing the federal \nbureaucracy.\n  Last Congress, the Senate passed a similar amendment with bipartisan \nsupport by a vote of 63-35 during debate on the Education Savings \nAccount legislation. Unfortunately, the President vetoed that bill, \ndespite his previous support for teacher testing.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as we continue the fight \nto give dedicated professionals, who teach our children, a personal \nstake in the quality of the instruction they provide. I hope there will \nagain be broad, bipartisan support for this amendment. I thank the \nchair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I was going to ask a question of the \nSenator from Florida. I am not trying to speak. Will the Senator yield \nfor that?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will yield for a quick question.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. When the Senator from Florida brought this amendment \nto the floor, he was talking about an experience in Los Angeles at a \nschool. In deference to the Senator from Washington, I want to keep it \nbrief, but I wonder if he could allude to that briefly.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, that is a story I remember very well. To cut \nit short takes away, I think, the strength of its message. So maybe a \nlittle bit later on in the debate we can discuss it, but I would be \nglad to yield the time back to the Senator so she can continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, on our side, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWellstone be followed by Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senators from Michigan \nand Florida for addressing an issue I think all of us really need to \naddress; that is, how do we recruit and retain good teachers in our \nclassrooms today?\n  I think all of us whose kids are in public schools want to know our \nchild will go to school and get the best teacher in that school. The \nquestion before us is, How do we make that happen? How do we ensure \nevery one of our kids gets a really good teacher?\n  I have to say I am disappointed in the proposal our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle came up with on merit pay. We have heard a lot \nof slogans in this debate. So far, from the other side, we have heard \nabout private school vouchers, block grants, and now we are getting \nmerit pay and testing for teachers. They all sound really good.\n  But I assure my colleagues, as someone who has been a teacher, \nsomeone who has been a school board member, someone who served in the \nState legislature, slogans don't teach kids; they don't keep good \nteachers in our classrooms; they don't improve test scores.\n  We are right in looking at the question of how we assure that we have \ngood teachers. I was on a school board.\n\n[[Page S3458]]\n\n I have debated the issue of merit pay, which, by the way, school \ndistricts can now do and which State legislatures can now do.\n  As a Senator, I ask you to give us an example of a current school \ndistrict that has merit pay in place that is working. We have not heard \nof any. I will tell you why. Because when you get down to the question \nof what does merit pay really do and you start to look at it, you \nrealize that merit pay doesn't accomplish what we really want in \nensuring that all of our kids get a good education.\n\n  Good current educational policy and curriculum standards are what we \nwant to teach our kids today. It is not how to sit at a desk, listen to \nan adult, do everything right all day long, and not move but, rather, \nhow to work together in teams and how to work together with other \nstudents because that is what is required of them when they get into \nthe workforce. Very few jobs today have a single person sitting at a \ndesk doing the same task all day long.\n  Merit rewards an individual teacher pitted against another teacher \nrather than encouraging teachers to work together in their building to \nimprove the education of all of our children.\n  That is what we are trying to teach our children. The best way to do \nthat is by example--encouraging teachers in a building to work \ntogether. Certainly different teachers in every building have different \nskills. Certainly some of them do better with one child, or another \nchild, or another curriculum piece.\n  We must encourage everyone to work together rather than saying we are \ngoing to pick the best three or four of you and give you an extra \nincentive; we encourage a teacher to come and be the principal's pet, \nor to be there to work the longest, or to try to show that they are \nsomehow better than the other teachers. You start getting teachers \npitted against each other. That is not what we want in a good school \nbuilding. We want all the teachers supporting each other.\n  The best schools I have been in are ones where all of the first grade \nteachers get together after school, or support each other throughout \nthe day, or share their curriculum. Who is going to share their \ncurriculum, or share the good things that work in their classroom, if \nthat means they may not be the teacher who gets the merit pay? That is \nwhy school boards and States have not enacted merit pay. It is simply \nanother slogan we put out here.\n  I think we really need to concentrate on what works. How can we \nensure that we recruit the best and brightest? How can we ensure that \npeople want to go into the teaching profession, that we keep the best \nand brightest, and help those who need additional skills to be the best \nand the brightest?\n  Think back through your own education. I don't know how many Senators \nhave gone to public schools all their lives. I have, my kids have, and \nI have been in them. I know. When I look back at my education, or my \nchildren's education, and I think about all the teachers I had--think \nabout this: Which one would you pick to get merit pay? It is difficult \nto do because all of us have had really good teachers. Our kids have \nhad good teachers, and all of us have had good teachers.\n  I will tell you something. I remember well when my kids were in \nelementary school and my son had a teacher for whom I didn't \nparticularly care. I was at a meeting with some friends. I complained \nabout the teacher. And, surprisingly, another one of my friends said: \nYou do not like that teacher? That is the best teacher my child has \never had. Why? Because that teacher didn't connect with my son but did \nconnect with her son. Different kids learn different ways. Different \nkids connect with different adults. A teacher may do really well with \none child and not well with another.\n  Tell me, how are we going to pick which teacher gets the merit pay? \nBy the parents who like the teacher the best? By the teacher who is the \ntoughest, who may do well for some kids but not well for others? By the \nteacher who does the most testing in their classrooms? By the teacher \nwho passes a test, maybe?\n\n  I can tell you this. I have had teachers in my own life and in my \nkids' lives who were brilliant but who had no way of communicating with \nthe kids they were teaching or how to teach what they held in their own \nhead.\n  I ask my colleagues, and I ask those who are listening, how would you \npick which one of your very own teachers or which one of your kids' \nteachers should receive merit pay? Do you think you can do a fair job?\n  That is what we are doing in this amendment we are debating today. \nSomebody is going to have to pick. Somebody is going to have to choose \nthat curriculum. Instead of encouraging teachers to work together, \nwhatever that criterion is which some principal decides is going to be \nhow they choose a teacher to get merit pay is going to create \ndisincentives in their own building and antagonism in their own \nbuilding. I don't think that is what we need to be encouraging.\n  I think we need to address the issue of getting the best and \nbrightest teachers in our classrooms. We do not pay any teacher enough, \nI am here to tell you, particularly those teachers who are in our \ntoughest schools, who have the kids with 99-percent-free and reduced \nlunches in their elementary schools. I have been in those schools--kids \nwho come and hear 70 different languages in one school district, kids \nwho come to school who have not even lived in a home, or in the same \nhome for more than several weeks, kids who come to school whose parents \nmay not have come home last night, who may not have eaten last night, \nwho have seen tremendous difficulties in their own lives.\n  We need to make sure those kids get a good teacher. But those are \nincredibly difficult challenges, and those are the incredibly difficult \nclassrooms.\n  If we are going to provide extra pay for a couple of teachers only, I \nsay let's give it to those teachers who are teaching in the most \ndifficult circumstances. We should be giving them combat pay for their \ndifficult circumstances. Certainly, I will tell you that those teachers \nwho are in those classrooms are not likely to be the ones who get merit \npay if it is based on any kind of teacher testing, or testing of their \nstudents, because they have the toughest kids in their classrooms.\n  Merit pay, if you do it on testing, rewards those teachers whose kids \ncome to school ready to learn, whose parents are there helping them, \nand who come from the communities that have the resources in those \nschools.\n  Let's be very careful about what we are promoting. Let's be sure that \nwe tell kids in our high schools and colleges that we want them to \nteach; we need them to teach. We know we need the best and the \nbrightest in our classrooms, we know we need teachers who are \nprofessionals, and we know we must reward them.\n  I know that doesn't address the question my colleagues brought out \nabout: What about those poor teachers? What about those teachers who \naren't qualified?\n  I can tell you what we are asking teachers to do today is \ntremendously different from what we asked teachers to do 10, 20, or 30 \nyears ago.\n  If you got your teaching degree back in 1972 and you are teaching in \na classroom today, I assure you that no one in your college taught you \nhow to use a computer. No one taught you how to develop your curriculum \nto use technology. No one thought you would need the math skills our \nstudents need today. No one thought you would be teaching in a \nclassroom with many different languages or cultures. No one thought you \nwould have the discipline problems you have.\n  Let's take those teachers who got their degree back in 1970, 1975, or \n1980 and give them the professional development to get the skills they \nneed in today's classrooms.\n  I have talked to teachers who feel extremely frustrated. They tell me \nif I were in a private business and the requirements had changed as \ndramatically as our public schools had in the last 30 years, they would \nhave sent me to professional development.\n  We lack the resources and haven't provided the resources in our \npublic education system to give our teachers the professional \ndevelopment they need. Let's not condemn them for that now. Let's do \nwhat is right and help provide professional development for our \nteachers in a way that is constructive so we can keep people who want \nto be in the classroom but have not been able to keep up.\n  I think we can revise some of the systems of tenure; many districts \nhave\n\n[[Page S3459]]\n\ndone that. I think that is a good way to proceed.\n  It is pretty darn frustrating to be a teacher today. They listen to \nthe debate on the Senate floor and they hear about all the horrible \nteachers who cannot pass tests. These are people with college degrees \nwho chose to be in our classrooms with our young kids. These are people \nwho we should be supporting. We should be supporting them with \nincentives to be in the teaching profession. We should support them \nwith quality pay. When teachers work for $23,000 a year and are told \nthey have to go back and pay for a test to stay in this profession, or \npay to go back to school, how do they do that? I don't know how they do \nthat. I don't know how a single mom with a couple of kids who is \nteaching and earning $23,000 or $25,000 a year would ever be able to \ncontinue to be in our classroom, even if she were in the best \nclassroom, if we required her to go back to school to take tests.\n  There is one problem with this underlying amendment I have not \nmentioned, and I don't think anybody has. There is no money here. It \nrequires testing, and there is no money. That money will have to come \nfrom somewhere in the districts. The districts will not have the money, \nand likely they will require the teachers themselves to pay for it. \nThat has been the practice in the past.\n  I understand the motive behind the slogan. I understand the desire to \ntell the good teachers in our classrooms that we appreciate the work \nthey are doing. However, I think we should reward all teachers with \nbetter salaries. I think we should provide better training for \nteachers, more professional development for our teachers, give them the \nskills they need. If we want to come back and say we have done \neverything for these teachers to give them the best skills and they \nstill don't make the grade, then there is something to say about this \nunderlying amendment. We haven't done that yet. We have left our \nteachers behind. As a result, we have left our students behind.\n  In closing, there are tremendously good people in our schools today \nwho are trying their best and working very hard. I think they deserve \nthe most accolades we can give them. We should not be denigrating them.\n  We do have some excellent ways of rewarding good teachers today. On \nmy staff, I have a woman named Ann Ifekwunigwe, an Albert Einstein \nDistinguished Educator. She has been with me on my staff as a fellow \nfor the last year and has done an outstanding job. She is actually an \nelementary schoolteacher from the Los Angeles Unified School District. \nShe is a great example of what we are already doing. Ann worked very \nhard and received her national board teacher certificate in California. \nOnce you have done that in California, teachers then get a 15-percent \nsalary increase and a $10,000 bonus.\n  There are ways under current law to encourage and help pave the way \nfor teachers who want to get additional training which benefits all of \nour students. We should encourage those. I don't think we should be \njust using a slogan of merit pay, saying we will pick a couple of \nteachers out of our schools and tell them they are better than the rest \nof the teachers, without understanding the consequences of what may \nhappen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington has asked \nthe wrong question. She is looking for examples as to where merit pay \nis being used successfully and she just cited California. I am not \nfamiliar with that program, but it is a certification that led to a \nbonus and merit pay.\n  I remind the Senator of the remarks of the Senator from Florida. In \nDenver, CO, teachers earn additional bonuses if they show student \nimprovement. Secretary Riley, of this administration, previously \nendorsed merit pay when he served as Governor of South Carolina. \nFlorida law provides bonuses to teachers who are nationally certified \nby the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, and can earn \nadditional bonuses if they mentor another teacher in getting nationally \ncertified as an additional bonus.\n  The superintendent of education from the State of Arizona was \nrecently in our Capitol and lauded the concept of merit pay for \nteachers who have outstanding capabilities, pointing out this concept \nis important in order to retain people who are getting better and \nbetter. You need to be able to reward that teacher and keep that \nteacher in the system; otherwise, the individual is likely to leave.\n  Let me simply say I am quite taken with the argument given by the \nSenator from Washington which, in theory, runs against everything we do \nin this country--that there should be no reward for achievement; \neverybody has to be treated identically or they won't be able to work \ntogether.\n  That message is taught from elementary to high school to college to \nprofessional sports, where everybody has to work as a team--but is \neverybody treated the same way? What corporation in America could \nfunction that way? You would pay the salesman who sold 2 vacuum \ncleaners the same salary as one who sold 10. The American way is one of \nhonest, fair competition and reward. We do not have a system where \neverybody is dumbed down. Yet this is an argument that people won't be \nable to get along if one is more successful than the other. The way it \nhas always worked in this country is that person was a role model that \nmade everybody else try to reach that standard to be as successful, to \ndo as well.\n  Competition makes better products, better performers. The competition \nof ideas in our democracy makes ideas truer and more honest. \nCompetition is healthy, not detrimental. The whole country is built on \nthe back of it.\n  I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Florida. I think he is \nprobably somewhat stunned someone remembered something that was said \nmonths ago, but it was such a compelling story about the role of \nteachers in education, and he has been kind enough to stay.\n  As part of my remarks, I ask the Senator if he might relate to those \nin the center of this debate that great story of what he found in a \nvery special school when he went to Los Angeles.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator for the opportunity to do this. A \nnumber of years ago, my wife and I visited a school called the Marcus \nGarvey School in Los Angeles. I went there because I was trying to \nlearn more about the different types of schools in America--what works, \nwhat does not work. While I am going to be talking about the Marcus \nGarvey School, I am not endorsing or embracing everything the school \ndoes. But the thing that stood out to me was the role of the teacher in \nthis school. So this is what happened.\n  I went to the Marcus Garvey School and met the administrator, the \nprincipal, the owner of the school--all one person, Anyim Palmer, who \nwas in a room probably no bigger than 10 by 10, filled with furniture \nthat was probably 35 or 40 years old. The phone was on a stack of \npapers. There was no secretary. When the phone rang, he answered it. \nThe point I am making is there were not a lot of amenities. This is \nbasic stuff. This is a building with rooms in it, an administrator, \nteachers, and students.\n  He said: I want to take you down and show you what some of our \nstudents are doing. Unfortunately, the school is not filled today \nbecause of the time of the year it is.\n  Priscilla and I went down to a room where there were three different \ngroups of children being taught in the same room. The first group of \nstudents we saw were 2-year-old children. Again, I emphasize 2-year-\nolds, not second graders; 2-year-old children. There were eight of them \nsitting at a little table. The teacher said to the children: Show the \nSenator and Mrs. Mack how you can say your ABCs. You can imagine the \ncute little voices of those children as they recited their ABCs. When \nthey finished that, the teacher said: Now that you have done it in \nEnglish, do it in Spanish. So then these little 2-year-old children \nwent through their alphabet in Spanish. When they finished that, the \nteacher then said to them: Now do the alphabet in Swahili, and they did \nthat as well--2 years old.\n  We went across the room to where 3-year-old children were doing math \nproblems. The teacher said to me: Give one of the students a math \nproblem. As I would suspect most people would have done, I gave a \nproblem such as 5 plus 8--you know, pretty straightforward. But, again, \n3 years old. She\n\n[[Page S3460]]\n\nsaid: No, no, no, give them a tough problem. So I said something like \n325 plus 182. And this 3-year-old child, standing at the board, put \ndown little dots, wrote down a number, another series of dots, wrote \ndown a number and got the right answer at 3-years-old.\n  We went across the room where 4-year-old children were reading. We \nwere told that these children were reading at the second, third, and \nfourth grade level. They were 4 years old.\n  We went into another room in this facility where there were 5-year-\nold children. A little boy was asked to stand up and recite for me, in \nthe proper chronological order, every President of the United States. \nThat little fellow stood up, looked me right in the eyes, and he \nrattled right through every President of the United States in the \nproper order. I must admit I knew he did that because they gave me a \ncheat sheet to look at. He was 5 years old.\n  Every time we went to a different area and saw these students, these \nchildren at work, Priscilla and I would say to this person who was \ntaking us around: How can this be? How can this possibly be? What makes \nthis work? Every single time we asked the question, the answer was: It \nis the teacher. It is the teacher. It is the teacher.\n\n  Anyim Palmer challenged what was then considered the best private \nschool in Los Angeles County, their sixth grade against his third grade \nstudents. I think it was in math and English. You know who won--Anyim \nPalmer's third grade beat the sixth graders. How did he do it? What he \nsaid to me was: It was the teacher.\n  What I found out later is Anyim Palmer was a public school teacher in \nCalifornia who became so frustrated and angry that the system was \nfailing to teach children in his community that he quit the public \nschools and started his own school. Do you know what he did? He also \ntrained his own teachers. He said: Forget everything you have learned. \nI am going to train you. I am going to teach you how to teach.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for asking me to restate that story. It \nmade a major impression on me. We can talk about all these other \nthings, but we must focus on how to make sure that the teacher standing \nup in front of our children and grandchildren has the knowledge in the \nsubject they are teaching--this is not fancy. We are not asking for \nspecial degrees. I am asking a very simple question. If a teacher is \nstanding in front of my little granddaughter, Addison, a few years from \nnow, I want my son and his wife to know the person who is teaching \ntheir little daughter has the knowledge in the subject they are \nteaching. That does not seem to be an unreasonable request to make.\n  I thank the Senator for asking the question. I yield.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Florida. He has been at this \nsome time. But let me just ask him, he is a principal coauthor of the \nmeasure. Is there anything about this measure that is a mandate?\n  Mr. MACK. I say to the Senator he is exactly right, there is no \nmandate. As strongly as I feel about it, I would like to, but I do not \nthink that is our role. I think we can make some serious mistakes by \nmandating certain things, to say to a particular school district or a \nparticular State they have to do what I say. They might say, what if we \nput this kind of testing program into effect but our concern is we need \nmore computers. We need more books. We need--whatever.\n  This is not a mandate. It never has been a mandate. It never will be \na mandate, at least as far as the Senator from Michigan and I are \nconcerned. It is merely a statement of importance and it says to the \nschools if they want to, these dollars can be used for the purpose of \ndeveloping the concepts for creating tests, developing some merit pay \nprogram, or in reforming tenure, all three of which we think can in \nfact go to the heart of the matter about what is necessary to improve \nthe ability of the teacher.\n  The inference was made earlier that somehow or another those of us \nwho are talking about this are out to degrade the teachers in this \ncountry. That is absolutely a false challenge. Most of us can remember \nthose teachers who made a difference in our lives, who challenged us, \nwho demanded from us that we do better. Each of us responded in a \nlittle bit different way. But we understand the importance of having \ngood, quality teachers, and there are a lot of them. That is why we put \nthe merit pay in, to recognize that.\n  Again, as to this notion that somehow or another if we were to put in \nplace a merit pay system that, highlights teachers who are doing well, \nand encourages those who are not teaching our children to do better and \nsomehow or another people would know and there would be divisions that \nwould take place, let me tell you something. There is probably not a \nschool in America where every teacher doesn't know who is carrying the \nload and who is not. You do not need a merit pay program for students \nand teachers alike to know who the good teachers are. You can just hear \nthe kids talking about it: Boy, I hope I don't get in so-and-so's \nclass.\n  It doesn't take a merit program. Merit pay is not going to do that. \nChildren and parents already know the good ones and those who are not \ncarrying their load.\n  What we are trying to do is the right thing.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. My colleague would agree, would he not, that the merit \npay might keep that good teacher in that system longer than otherwise? \nAt some point, we know we are losing good teachers because outside \ninterests are seeking that kind of talent.\n  Mr. MACK. I certainly hope it would do that. I believe it would. As \nboth of us have indicated, the State of Florida has developed a program \nthat provides an incentive for teachers to get certification by a \nnational board. If they receive that certification, they get a bonus.\n  They also get a bonus if they encourage another teacher to do the \nsame thing.\n  What we are saying is, we are recognizing, not only through the \ndollars but through our interest, the importance of that individual \nteacher and the importance of the quality of that individual teacher. I \nbelieve it would encourage them to stay in the system longer. Most of \nthe teachers love the children they are teaching. They want them to do \nbetter. We just need to give more encouragement to those teachers.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Florida and the Senator from \nMichigan. I see the Senator from Minnesota is prepared to speak. He has \nbeen very accommodating. I have a few other things to say, but I am \ngoing to yield so he can proceed with his remarks. A little later \ntoday, I will have another opportunity, I am sure, to speak again. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I reserve my \nright to the floor and yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 3118 to Amendment 3117\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk on behalf of myself and the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself \n     and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 3118 to \n     amendment No. 3117.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1 of the amendment in line 4, strike all after \n     ``Reforming'' through the end of the amendment and insert the \n     following: ``and implementing merit schools programs for \n     rewarding all teachers in schools that improve student \n     achievement for all students, including the lowest achieving \n     students;\n       ``(B) Providing incentives and subsidies for helping \n     teachers gain advanced degrees in the academic fields in \n     which the teachers teach;\n       ``(C) Implementing rigorous peer review, evaluation, and \n     recertification programs for teachers; and\n       ``(D) Providing incentives for highly qualified teachers to \n     teach in the neediest schools.''\n\n  Mr. MACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota yielded \nwithout losing his right to the floor and is entitled to recognition.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I already recognized the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I will first \nrespond, to make this a debate format, to some of the points I heard \nraised. I also will speak to the second-degree amendment.\n  One of the points that was made is that the focus on teacher merit is \nimportant because it leads to retention of teachers. I want to cite the \nNational Commission on Teaching & America's Future, a report that came \nout in 1996 in which they spelled out the key elements for effective \nteacher retention: A, organize professional development around \nstandards for teachers and students; B, provide a yearlong inservice \ninternship; C, include mentoring and strong evaluation of teacher \nskills; and D, offer stable, high-quality professional development.\n  The second-degree amendment is about implementing merit schools \nprograms for rewarding all teachers in schools that improve student \nachievement for all students, including the lowest achieving students.\n  Over and over, we have been here making sure those students who come \nfrom difficult circumstances and do not do as well are the students to \nwhom we pay special attention.\n  B, providing incentives and subsidies for helping teachers gain \nadvanced degrees in academic fields in which the teachers teach;\n  C, implementing rigorous peer review, evaluation, and recertification \nprograms for teachers;\n  And D, providing incentives for highly qualified teachers to teach in \nthe neediest schools.\n  In many ways, what is in the second-degree amendment mirrors what the \nNational Commission on Teaching & America's Future tells us we need to \ndo to have the very best teachers and retain those teachers as well.\n  I speak on behalf of the second-degree amendment. I want to talk \nabout where I strongly dissent from the amendment my colleagues from \nMichigan and Florida have laid out: the emphasis on reforming teacher \ntenure systems and the emphasis on establishing teacher compensation \nsystems based on merit and proven performance. Then I will talk about \ntesting teachers periodically in the academic subjects in which they \nteach. I will talk about each one.\n  I am the first to admit that the tenure system does not always work \nthe way we want it. I am the first to admit there are some teachers, \nunfortunately, in our schools who do not add to children but subtract. \nSometimes they are tenured teachers, and that is when it gets tough. \nThere is a reason for tenure, and the reason for tenure is to make sure \nteachers are free to express their ideas.\n  Albeit, I taught at the college level, but I am a perfect example of \nsomeone who benefited from tenure. First, I had to fight to get it. \nThat is a 20-hour speech. The point is, there is no doubt in my mind \nthat tenure was what gave me the protection to freely express my ideas \non campus.\n  When we talk about education, we want students introduced to a \nvariety of ideas, and we do not want teachers put in a position where \nthey do not feel free to express their viewpoint, where they do not \nfeel free to teach the way they believe they should teach, to teach \nstudents the way they think they should teach students because they \nworry about capricious, arbitrary decisions that might be made.\n  I now will talk about compensation based upon merit and then talk \nabout teachers being tested periodically, and to give the example of \nDenver, CO, I think, raises yet another question. That has to do with \nthis path we are barreling down with all the emphasis on standardized \ntests.\n\n  It is unbelievable. We have a trend in the country--and thank \ngoodness people are now starting to look at it--where we are going to \nmeasure a student's academic performance on the basis of a single \nstandardized test when all the people who have developed those tests \ntell us we should never use a single standardized test, and when we \nhave not done what we should do to make sure every student has the same \nopportunity to do well on those tests. Let me do that parallel with \nteachers.\n  Let me give an example. I can see how this could very well happen \ngiven this proposal. If, for example, how well teachers are doing is \nbased on how well students are doing, which is, in turn, based upon \nstandardized tests given to students at as young an age as 8, if one is \nteaching in a school in an inner city, if one is teaching in a school \nin rural America, if one is teaching in a school where these kids come \nto kindergarten way behind, where they come from poverty homes, where \nthey come from pretty difficult circumstances, and they do not have the \nresources they need, it could be your students are not going to do as \nwell. Do we then argue the teachers do not show merit?\n  In addition, what kind of tests are we talking about using? The \npeople who have done the professional work on having the very best \nteachers have said that in addition to having the decent salaries, in \naddition to putting an end to the bashing of public school teachers, in \naddition to making sure teachers have the resources with which to work, \nin addition to making sure we invest in the infrastructure of the \nschools, that we have the technology programs, that we have a \nmanageable class size, in addition to all that, we want to have good \npeer evaluation, we want to have mentors, we want to have good programs \nduring the summer, such as the Eisenhower program which has been \neliminated in this block grant program which enables teachers of math \nand science to come together to compare notes and become revitalized \nand renewed. We want to do all of that. None of that is in this \nproposal. None of it is in the Republican bill, S. 2.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, not only does this amendment out here on the \nfloor reflecting S. 2 do precious little to, No. 1, attract the very \nbest into teaching, and, No. 2, to retain the very best in teaching--by \nthe way, we have some of the very best teachers right now in public \nschools.\n  You know what, colleagues. Here is my challenge. I will tell you one \nof the ways we can retain good teachers is to stop bashing public \nschool teachers. Some of the harshest critics of public school teachers \non the floor of the Senate could not last 1 hour, I say to Senator \nSchumer, in the classrooms they condemn.\n  When I go into schools and talk to the students--and I am in a school \nevery 2 weeks--I ask them: What do you think makes for good education? \nThe first thing they say is: Good teachers. That is the first thing, \neven before, I say to Senator Murray, lower class size.\n  Then I ask: What makes for good teachers? And then we get into this \ndiscussion about what makes for good teachers.\n  By the way, I never hear students say the really good teachers are \nthe teachers who engage in drill teaching, worksheet learning.\n  They hate it. They say the good teachers are the teachers who fire \ntheir imaginations, get them to connect themselves personally to the \nmaterial they are talking about--none of which is ever reflected in \nthese standardized tests.\n  Then, later on in the discussion--let's say there is an assembly of \n600 students--I ask: How many of you are interested in going into \npublic school teaching? I will tell you, I am lucky if it is 5 \npercent--maybe it is 10 percent--who say they are. This occurs at the \nvery same time we are talking about over the next 10 years needing 2 \nmillion more people to go into education to become teachers, at the \nvery same time we all say we care so much about education.\n  Then I ask the students: Why not? I want to tell you, colleagues, \nwhen these young people talk about whether or not they are going to go \ninto public school teaching, and why they do not want to go into public \nschool teaching, I guarantee you, they never say the reason they are \nnot going to go into public school teaching to become public school \nteachers is because they are not going to have these merit tests.\n  They do not say: If there were merit tests, and we would have \nstandardized tests to determine how we are doing to see if we are \nqualified to teach, then we would be really interested in becoming \npublic school teachers.\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\n  They say two things discourage them from becoming public school \nteachers. No. 1 is that salaries are too low. By the way, a lot of \nwomen say--they are very honest about it--there was a time when maybe \nthey would have had to go into teaching. They don't have to any longer \nin terms of opportunities for them.\n  The second thing they say--I think this needs to be said to some of \nour colleagues--is that they would be disrespected. I say to Senator \nMurray, who has probably had this discussion in Washington State, they \nhave put more of an emphasis on being disrespected than the salary. \nThey say there is just very little respect.\n  Then I say to them: Wait a minute. You are the students. Are you \ndisrespecting your teachers?\n  They say: Well, you know, on our part, we do not give the teachers \nthe respect they deserve. But it is a problem in the community as well.\n\n  So I say to my colleagues on the other side, rather than bringing \namendments to the floor of the Senate that do not speak to what it is \nwe should do to attract the very best teachers into public school \neducation, what we should do--some of which is in the second-degree \namendment that we now present--is put an emphasis on rewarding schools \nfor doing well with the students and providing subsidies to help \nteachers gain advanced degrees in academic fields--who could argue with \nthat?--and implementing good peer review. That really matters.\n  I say to Senator Murray, we were both teachers. Senator Murray, I \nthink, would agree to having good evaluation and also providing \nincentives for highly qualified teachers to teach in the neediest \nschools. I thank my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator Murray, for \nhaving that provision in the amendment. That makes a great deal of \nsense.\n  The Abraham amendment which basically talks about maybe trying to \nfigure out ways of ``reforming'' tenure systems, which I think means \ngetting rid of tenure--let's be clear about what we are talking--and \nthen talks about the teacher compensation systems based upon merit and \nproven performance, and then right away goes to periodic testing of \nteachers, is ridiculous. What kind of test are you going to use?\n  Now we are going to have standardized tests of students all over the \ncountry. Now we are going to have a single, standardized test for \nteachers all over the country. It is all going to become educational \ndeadening. It is all going to discourage really talented people from \nwanting to teach. It is going to lead to drill education. It is going \nto focus attention away from what we all should be doing to make sure \nkids do well in school. It does not represent a step forward.\n  So I say to colleagues, I come here as someone who views education as \nthe most important issue--that has been my adult life, education--to \nspeak strongly in support of our second-degree amendment and to speak \nstrongly in opposition to the Abraham-Mack amendment.\n  One final time I have to say this. I want to issue a warning. Albeit, \nthe language is ``may,'' but there is Federal money involved here. I \nwant to, one more time, say that we are, in the name of ``reform,'' \ntalking about standardized testing everywhere.\n  I tell you, we should just listen to the students. I ask every \nSenator--Democrat and Republican alike--over the next 6 months, to try \nto spend a good deal of time in the schools in your States. Maybe many \nof you do. I am not implying the Senator from Michigan does not.\n  I find very little interest in standardized tests as representing a \nreal indication of reform. I find the interest is in the discussion of \nsmaller class size, the discussion of how to get really good teachers, \nthe discussion of really good child care, prekindergarten, and the \ndiscussion of the decaying physical infrastructure of schools. I find a \nlot of the discussion, frankly, about what happens to kids when they go \nhome and what happens to kids before they go to school. I find a lot of \nthe discussion, in the best schools, about how teachers feel free to \nteach. They team teach. I heard Senator Murray talk about that. It is \nreally very exciting. I would say that is the direction in which we \nshould go, not in this other direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \nspeak because I believe the right participation by the U.S. Government \nin the educational process of our children is fundamental to our \nsuccess as a nation in the next century. It is important for us to \nunderstand that we have a limited role in this area.\n  Mr. President, 93 percent of all the funding for education--93 \npercent; that is basically $13 out of $14 spent in education--comes \nfrom State and local governments. Frankly, I think that is a positive, \nnot a negative. I think when people invest their own resources, when \nthey invest the resources they have control over, they are likely to do \nso very effectively.\n  But it is appropriate, and as a matter of fact beneficial, when the \nFederal Government decides to be of assistance in the area of \neducation. When we are involved, I think there ought to be some \nprinciples that we should follow in order to make sure we maximize the \npositive impact we can have in terms of the achievement standing of \nchildren. I use a term such as ``achievement standing'' or the \n``capacity to achieve'' because I think that is what we are interested \nin, in education.\n  The question is, What do we want out of education? I think we want \nchildren whose capacity to do things, whose capacity to learn, and the \nthings that they have learned, have been enhanced substantially.\n  It is nice to have school buildings. It is nice to have teachers. It \nis nice to have education programs. But ultimately, the purpose for \nwhich we develop resources and to which we devote the resources, is to \nelevate the capacity of children to learn.\n  How do we improve what happens to children?\n  I have had some opportunity to be aggressive and active in this area \nat the State and local level in government. Having spent 8 years as the \nGovernor of my State, and visiting many of Missouri's 550 or so school \ndistricts, I know it is the focal point of the community in almost \nevery setting. It is the objective of that community to elevate the \nstanding of students, asking how do we help students do more?\n  Different communities have found different ways of inspiring \nstudents, preparing students, building students, and elevating what \nhappens in the classroom. I think that is what we should be involved \nin.\n  During my time as Governor of the State of Missouri, the State board \nof education was so convinced about getting parents and teachers \ninvolved in the education of children, because it motivates children to \nbe achievers, that we had a slogan that said: ``Success in school is \nhomemade.''\n  Talking about localizing what we do in education, if you take it all \nthe way to the home, you have localized it about as much as possible.\n  As a matter of fact, during my time as the president, or chairman--I \nforget the designation I carried--for the Education Commission of the \nStates, it was an emphasis we agreed upon nationally that energizing \nparents and energizing the local community was the way in which we get \nthe most return for our school dollars, as study after study has shown. \nAnd the anecdotal evidence is incredibly strong that cultures that \ninvolve parents and local officials in making decisions for what can \nand will work are the cultures where education succeeds.\n  So the ingredients of public school success include the very \nimportant point of getting students motivated as a result of the active \nparticipation of their families.\n  The House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on \nOversight and Investigations answered this question about what are the \ningredients of educational success in a report released in July of \n1998. The report was called ``Education at a Crossroads: What Works and \nWhat's Wasted in Education Today.'' The subcommittee found that \nsuccessful schools and school systems were not the product of Federal \nfunding and directives but instead were characterized by--here are the \ningredients--parental involvement in the education of their children; \ntwo, local control; three, emphasis on basic academics; four, dollars \nspent in the classroom, not on distant bureaucracy and ineffective \nprograms.\n\n[[Page S3463]]\n\n  I believe these are the ingredients that are necessary for all of us \nto understand if we are going to talk about elevating the performance \nof students, which is why we speak about this issue today, because \nthere are noble objectives and there are programs that may sound novel \nand noble, but if they don't elevate the status of students, we will \nhave failed miserably.\n  I am concerned that too often the Federal program which finds its \nfirst consumption of resources in the administration of the program and \nthe bureaucracy at the Federal level very frequently then goes to the \nState bureaucracy at the State level, but it doesn't get all the way to \nthe student.\n  But there is more to my concern that the proposal just doesn't get \nall the way to the student. Frequently, when it gets all the way to the \nstudent, it directs an activity or a devotion of the resource which is \nnot called for in the circumstance of the student.\n  So there are two principles that are operative here: First, that we \nget the resource all the way to the student so that the resource is \nspent in the classroom and not in the bureaucracy. The second principle \nis, let the resource be spent, once it is at the level of the student, \non things that make a difference in terms of performance and student \nachievement in the classroom.\n  It would be appropriate, I think, to have some sense of satisfaction \nof getting a resource all the way to the classroom and not having the \nshrinkage of the bureaucracy that takes the resource away. But if the \nresource gets to the classroom and the expenditure can only be for \nthings that aren't needed or directly pertinent to student achievement, \nwe will have lost the battle anyhow.\n  Yesterday, I had the opportunity of addressing this body, and I had \nthe unhappy task of detailing the fact that for tens of thousands of \nindividuals at the State level in our educational effort their entire \nexistence is consumed with filling out Federal forms; that we are \nserving the bureaucracy with paperwork perhaps more effectively than we \nare serving the students with education.\n\n  If the active participation by parents, community leaders, teachers, \nand boards of education at the local level is what really energizes \nschools to elevate the level of student achievement, maybe we should \nnot have so much direction from the Federal level about how much and \nwhere the money should be spent.\n  I think that is pretty clear as a part of this bill which has been \noffered by our side; that we want to get the resources to individuals \nin the classroom, and not only deliver the resources to the classroom \nbut to make sure that the best use for those resources can be \ndetermined by those who know the names of the students and the needs of \nthe school rather than some hypothetical best use being developed a \nthousand miles away by bureaucrats who know, in theory, that generally \nthe country needs X or Y but do not have very much awareness of \nspecific needs in specific classrooms, in specific districts, in \nparticular towns, counties, or communities all across America.\n  So this principle is, one, to get resources to the classroom and, \ntwo, to let the people who know the names of the students and the needs \nof the schools make the decisions. That is of fundamental importance.\n  When you gather at the Federal level the character of the programs \nand say we will make all the decisions about what is done, and we may \nwant to get the resources to you but we will tell you what you have to \ndo, that is the equivalent of hanging a sign on the schoolhouse door: \n``Parents need not apply.'' It is the equivalent of saying to them, as \nmuch as we think you are an important part of education, you won't get \nto help make a decision about the way the resources are devoted, about \nthe kind of program that is conducted, because, as a matter of fact, we \nwill make those decisions for you in some remote bureaucracy.\n  I think the key to what we want to do is to empower those individuals \nat the local level by, first, sharing the resources with them as \nefficiently as possible, not shrinking it by running it through \nbureaucracy after bureaucracy and, second, empowering them by saying, \nonce you have the resources, you have the right and opportunity to \nspend it in ways you know will benefit the students in a specific \nsetting.\n  We have watched as we have lived with the sort of status quo in \neducation, with the Federal Government trying to impose its ideas on \nthe country, and we aren't showing the desired results. When you are \nnot getting the right results, if you keep doing the same things, you \nare asking for difficulty. The industrialist puts it this way: Your \nsystem is perfectly designed to give you what you are getting.\n  If we like what we are getting in education, we should just keep \ndoing what we are doing. But if we think we can do better --as a matter \nof fact, if we think we must do better for the next generation of \nAmericans, if we recognize that the world is exploding in a \ntechnological, developmental sense, and that for people to be at the \ntop of the list, they are going to have to be able to deal with \ntechnology and they will have to have high levels of achievement and \ncapacity in terms of education, I think we are going to have to confess \nthat we must do better. And in order to do better, we have to change \nwhat we are doing.\n  It is virtually impossible to do better if we just do the same thing \nover and over. I think State and local governments need the kind of \nflexibility that we provide, and I think when we try to restrict that \nflexibility, when we try to restrain the capacity of the people who \nknow best what their own children need, who witness what will motivate, \non occasion, success in those students, we tell them they can't use \nthat judgment, awareness, and knowledge, they can't use their proximity \nto the problem as a basis for developing a solution, as a matter of \nfact, we are hindering the process.\n  I stand to speak in favor of this measure which will not only move \nresources to the local and State level but will provide the authority \nand flexibility so those resources can be devoted to students in \nclassrooms in ways that are known by the individuals who know--teachers \nand students--and to the needs of the institution to improve \nperformance. I believe that is the key.\n  For us to persist in doing what we have done with the status quo, to \npersist with a system that finds more and more people disenchanted \nbecause they find their hands tied, and they want to do one thing they \nbelieve will help their students but the government says, no, they have \nto do something else, which isn't that helpful, or, even in order to do \nsomething else, they have to file a stack of papers that will take \npeople out of the classroom, moves people away from education.\n  For the Federal Government, according to a study in Florida, to \nadminister Federal dollars, it is about six times as expensive as it is \nto administer a State dollar. That is six times the paperwork volume \nthat is basically involved.\n  We ought to begin to wonder whether those individuals who actually \nhave the stake in the circumstances, their child in the school, why we \nshould distrust them and impose this sort of not only rigid set of \nrequirements but this rigid audit trail which requires six times as \nmuch administration as a State or local dollar does to deliver \neducational capacity to children. That is something we ought to be \nleery of. We ought to say, wait a second. Why would we want to spend \nall of that money in administration and second-guessing those who know \nbest about their own children, their own future, and who have a stake \nin this issue, which is the important stake, and that is \nthe achievement of the students?\n\n  I think we ought to ask ourselves what happens in education when \nthere is more nonteachers in the education system than there is \nteachers in the education system? When the administration of education \nand the tens of thousands of full-time equivalents across the country \nmandated by the Federal Government consume the resources instead of the \nresources getting to the classroom, we ought to ask ourselves: Is this \nthe way for us to really be achievers?\n  We know when people have the right opportunity to succeed and the \nright resources, they can get the job done--my colleagues and I have \ntalked about it over and over again--when they have the right \nopportunity in terms of resources and the right authority in terms of \nflexibility.\n  I think those are the two keys we have offered to the American people \nby this measure on our side as a way of allowing them to use the money \nthey\n\n[[Page S3464]]\n\nhave paid in taxes to elevate the capacity of the students who will \nchart the course of America in the next century.\n  We want for our children high levels of achievement. The children are \nthe focus. The classroom is the focus. It is the place where it happens \nto those on whom we focus--the children. The ingredients of success are \nnot great bureaucracies. They are great teachers, great classrooms, and \ngreat students. And it involves parents. When we tell parents the \nbureaucracy will make the decisions, we shunt them aside. We tell them \nthey need not apply. That is a dangerous strategy and damaging to our \nstudents.\n  Our Federal programs haven't worked, and just doing more of it won't \nimprove our performance.\n  My grandfather's admonition was, ``I sawed this board off more times, \nand it is still too short.'' If you keep sawing it will still be too \nshort. You have to change your conduct.\n  We should change the focus at the local level; States and local \ngovernments need the ability as it relates to teachers. As Senator \nAbraham said, we are not going to mandate that the States and local \ncommunities deal with teachers in any specific way. We want to \nauthorize them to be able--with the resources they earned and paid in \ntaxes--to devote those resources in such a way that they believe it \nwill result in elevated performance for the students.\n  That is the long and the short of what we ought to be doing. The \nstatus quo is unacceptable. America will not survive on a continuing \nbasis in the long term with our students being last on the list of \nthose among industrialized nations. It doesn't matter if we are first \non the list of expenditures. It doesn't matter if we have more \nresources devoted to the process that is eventually sucked into the \nbureaucracy or devoted to things that do not pay off. What matters is \nthat students achieve. We cannot long endure as the leader of the free \nworld if our students are the last on the list. Being the leader and \nbeing last doesn't fit.\n  It is time for us to focus our energies, resources, and authority to \nmake good decisions for the elevation of student capacity. That will \nmake a difference at the local level. That is why this measure is such \nan important measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in order to try to inform the membership, \nwe are attempting to establish a time situation so Members will know. \nWe wanted to have a very brief comment on this second degree to the \nunderlying amendment, and then to move ahead with an announcement which \nwill be agreed to by leaders that would spell out how we would proceed \nfrom that time. That is in the process of being worked out, as I \nunderstand it. But we are reasonably hopeful that in a very short \nperiod of time we will either have a vote on this, or perhaps we could \nset it aside and start considering other amendments. We are prepared to \ndo it. I will see what the mood is after I address the Senate for just \na few minutes at this time.\n  Mr. President, I will speak briefly about the second-degree amendment \nthat Senator Murray and I have offered. I think there has been a good \ndebate and discussion about the importance of well-trained teachers, \ncontinuing and ongoing professional development, and also incentives \nfor teachers who want to try to have a continued academic degree and \nwho go through various certification processes.\n  Our amendment, as Senator Wellstone pointed out, seeks to do the \nmerit program on a whole school level that rewards all teachers in the \nschools; improve achievement for all students, including the lowest \nachieving students; provide incentives and subsidies for helping \nteachers with advanced degrees; and implements a rigorous peer review \nevaluation recertification that takes in many considerations during the \ncourse of a year. It is a very rigorous program where teachers are \nevaluated by master teachers, where there is a video sample of their \nwork evaluated. We believe that is consistent with other provisions of \nthe Democratic alternative.\n  We are saying to the parents of this country that we are including in \nour educational program, recommendations that work--that have been \ntried and tested.\n  We differ with our Republican friends who say let's have a blank \ncheck and send it to the State capitals. Let's have block grants and \nlet the Governors make the decisions and judgments about what they are \ngoing to do.\n  We differ with that. That is why we offered this second-degree \namendment.\n  You could say: What is your evidence in terms of these particulars \nschoolwide? I want to correct the Record of my good friend from Georgia \nwho said Secretary Riley tried merit pay in North Carolina. It is true. \nHe did try it. It is also true he also decided that it failed after the \nState spent $100 million. They changed their program to the merit \nschools program, which is working, which is exactly what we are doing \ntoday. You now have probably the most successful school district in the \ncountry, which is in North Carolina, which is using just the kind of \nprogram that we are talking about. We are seeing the development of the \nsame kind of program in the State of Kentucky.\n  In North Carolina, the State focuses on whole school achievement and \noverall student achievement for reward. The State doesn't believe that \nindividual activities can be isolated to determine what produced the \nimprovements in student achievement--it's a whole school effort. \nTherefore, the focus is rewarding the whole school. Rewards are given \nto the school, and all teachers and the principal benefit.\n  If any State wants to use their 93 cents out of any dollar for the \nobjectives that the Senator from Michigan points out, they are free to \ndo so. We don't prohibit it. If they want to do it, they can do it. We \nare saying with our 7 cents of the money that is going out in the local \ncommunity, we are going to support tried and tested programs that have \nbeen successful.\n  I asked earlier in the day what States permit individual merit pay, \nand we still do not have an answer. What we know on our side, for \nexample, is supported by a CRS Report dated June 3, 1999, \n``Performance-Based Pay for Teachers.'' It states that many individual \nmerit-pay plans were adopted as a means to increase teacher \naccountability and improve classroom performance. But, these plans not \nonly failed to improve student achievement, but also destroyed \nteachers' collaboration with each other and teachers' trust in the \nadministrators.\n  Instead, the more recent shift toward group-based, whole school \nincentive pay plans, allows teachers to focus on fostering overall \nstudent learning. These plans encourage teachers to work together \nwithin a school in a noncompetitive environment.\n  We support States that have merit pay with regard to whole school \nprograms, merit pay for enhanced academic accomplishment, merit pay for \nevaluations and the recertifications. All of those are very worthy and \nare permitted and encouraged in our amendment.\n  We listened earlier about an excellent school in New Haven, CA, one \nof the poorer districts in California. Classroom teachers, while still \nworking with children, have opportunities to have their knowledge and \nskills rewarded both financially and by returning something to the \nprofession.\n  In New Haven, classroom teachers carry out internship programs, \ndevelop curriculum, design technological supports, and create student \nstandards, assessments, and indicators of student learning.\n  Using a combination of release time, afterschool workshops, and \nextensive summer institutes, the district involved more than 100 \nteachers--nearly two-fifths of K through 4-- on the language arts and \nmath standards committee during 1996-1997 year.\n  During the summer of 1997, nearly 500 teachers, approximately 65 \npercent of the certified teachers, participated in district-sponsored \nstaff development activities. The district had 24 different workshops \nin technology alone, offering a wide variety of different areas, \nincluding math and science instruction, bilingual programs, and many \nothers.\n  The district pays the teachers for the courses leading to the \nadditional certification in the hard-to-staff areas, such as special \neducation, math, science, and bilingual. If the district does not pay \nthe teachers for their time directly, the work counts toward increments \non their salary scale.\n\n[[Page S3465]]\n\n  The district provides free courses that reap ongoing financial \nbenefits for teachers.\n  The district is bringing the salary incentives for those who have \nsuccessfully passed the National Board for Professional Training \nStandards. The NBPTS for teachers was instituted in 1987. Achieving the \nnational board certification involves completing a year-long portfolio \nthat illustrates teacher practices through the lesson plan, with \nsamples of student work over time and analyses of teaching.\n  They found that this school district--one of the poorest and neediest \nin all of California, the New Haven Unified School District, in a low-\nwealth district--now has an excellent reputation in education. Twenty \nyears ago, it was one of the poorest in education, as well as \nfinancially. Today, they have closed their doors to out-of-district \ntransfers and moved up into one of the highest achieving schools in \nCalifornia.\n  This is how it was done with regard to the teachers. There are other \nelements necessary in terms of classrooms.\n  Finally, I mention in Charlotte, NC, Mecklenburg, they ran an annual \nachievement goals-bonus cycle. This is how they consider their school \ndistrict. Based on the degree to which the schools attained a set of \ngoals, including improvement in academic performance, advanced course \nenrollment, dropout rates, and student attendance, there were two \nlevels of bonus awards--100 percent and 75 percent. Schools that earned \n75 to 100 percent of the possible goal points were designated \nexemplary, and bonuses of $1,000 and $400 were awarded to teachers and \nclassified staff. Schools earning 60 to 74 percent of the possible goal \npoints were designated as outstanding, and the bonus amounts were $700 \nand $300 for teachers and staff, respectively.\n  We are for it. But we ought to do it in ways that work. That is what \nour amendment does. That is why it deserves to be accepted by this \nbody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to commend my friend from Michigan \nfor his amendment. I endorse the amendment. I think it is only common \nsense that we deal with this issue. I will make some comments about the \nunderlying bill and what I have heard in this debate and try to put it \nin some kind of context.\n  First let me outline what credentials I have to comment on this. \nAbout a dozen years ago, I was approached by the chair of the Utah \nState School Board and asked to chair the Strategic Planning Commission \nthat was being followed by that school board to create a strategic plan \nfor Utah schools.\n  Frankly, that was the experience that got me back into public life. I \nwas very comfortably ensconced as CEO of a profitable company and \nthinking that would be my career for the rest of my life. Getting \ninvolved in educational issues, becoming chairman of that planning \ncommission, and laying out a strategic vision for Utah schools got me \nimmersed in the whole education issue.\n  What I discovered 12 years ago--a depressing thing, by the way, and \nnothing has changed in the intervening 12 years--was that the school \nsystem was focusing on the wrong issue. Indeed, we named our report ``A \nshift in focus'' because we said that was what was going to be \nnecessary to solve the educational problem in this country.\n  All of the focus of the professional educators and people involved in \neducation was on the system: How can we tweak, fine-tune, fund, change, \nsomehow manipulate the system?\n  As we got into it, we said no, the shift should be from focusing on \nthe system and how it works, to focusing on the student and what he \nneeds.\n  I offered this analogy going back again to my business roots. In the \nautomobile world, at one time General Motors focused entirely on the \nway they made automobiles. They said: These are the automobiles we \nmake. Now, sales department, you go out and sell the automobiles to the \npublic.\n  Toyota came along, a very small company, and said: We are going to \nask the drivers what they want in a car, and we are going to focus on \ndrivers rather than cars. As a result, Toyota came up with an entirely \ndifferent kind of car from those General Motors was producing. The \nfocus was on the driver and not the car. The focus was on the customer \nand not the company. The company that focused on the customer and on \nthe driver did exceedingly well. Toyota grew from a tiny company to the \nsecond largest in the world making automobiles and became, for a time, \nmore profitable than General Motors, until General Motors discovered \nthey had to shift their focus.\n  Instead of saying, this is what we produce, you go buy it; like \nToyota, they started asking the question: What do you want? We will go \nmake it. Saturn, a General Motors venture, came out entirely of that \nactivity.\n  That is the analogy I used when I wrote that strategic plan for Utah \nschools: Instead of focusing on the school system and how it works, \nfocus on the students and what they need. We were asked to come up with \na mission statement for education as we did that commission. The \nmission statement we came up with terrified the superintendent of \nschools in the State of Utah. He said: You can't say that because if \nyou say that, we will get sued.\n  We went ahead and said it anyway. What we said was: The mission of \npublic education is to empower students to function effectively in \nsociety. That is what we are here for, to empower students to function \neffectively in society.\n  No, no, no, say the professionals; the mission of education is to \nconstruct a system that does the following things.\n  We do not measure the system. We measure the ability of the students \nto function in society. If they cannot function effectively in society, \nthey are not getting a decent education. That was a radical notion 12 \nyears ago. As I say, 12 years have passed and very little has changed.\n  Those are my credentials. That is the background I had coming in and \nlistening to this debate. As I listen to this debate, I have some very, \nfor me, interesting reactions.\n  First, from our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle, we have \nhad an eloquent, continuing, and unrelenting defense of the status quo. \nAny suggestion that we try to do anything different is met with a \nstonewall of criticism and fear that somehow something will change. \nThere is an unrelenting defense of the status quo that has been the \nunderlying theme of this entire debate, as far as my friends on the \nother side of the aisle are concerned.\n  Interestingly enough, an overwhelming defense of the status quo is \nnot what the American people want to hear. So if we go out on the \ncampaign trail for just a moment, we find the Vice President saying we \nneed revolutionary changes in education. There is an article that ran \nin this morning's Washington Post, which I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed at the end of my remarks, written by George Will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. He is talking about the Vice President's recent talk on \neducation, and he quotes the Vice President as saying:\n\n       Today, I am proposing a new national commitment to bring \n     revolutionary improvements to our schools--built on three \n     basis principles. First, I am proposing a major national \n     investment to bring revolutionary improvements to our \n     schools. Second, I am proposing a national revolution--\n\n  And so on. According to Mr. Will, the Vice President used \n``revolution,'' ``revolutionary,'' or ``revolutionize'' 8 times in his \nspeech and ``invest,'' a word we know means spending, 14 times.\n  As Mr. Will concludes in his article:\n\n       The basic Gore position is that the public schools are \n     splendid, and at the same time desperately in need of \n     revolutionary investments.\n\n  I find a disconnect between the Vice President's rhetoric out on the \ncampaign trail and what we are hearing on the floor today because any \nattempt on the part of the Republicans to produce something that is \ndifferent is attacked. Anything we say let's experiment with is \nattacked. The overwhelming defense of the status quo is underlying \neverything our friends on the other side of the aisle are saying.\n  From the prospect of the position I had as chairman of that strategic \nplanning commission, I want to look at this fearsome, frightening, \nRepublican proposal that would go into such new ground as to somehow \nthreaten the status quo. It is the most timid, it is\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\nthe most small, tiny, incremental kind of revolution I have ever seen.\n  The bill the Republicans are putting forward is, to put a number on \nit, something like 98-percent status quo. It funds the programs we have \nnow, and it funds them generously. It supports the programs we have \nnow, and it supports them solidly. But it says, putting the smallest \ntoe at the very edge of the smallest possible body of water: Couldn't \nwe just try a couple of things? Couldn't we give 10 States the chance, \nif they want to--no mandates, no requirements--just 10 States the \nchance, if they might want to, to try something out? In another area, \ncouldn't we just try 15 States? Boy, that is bold and revolutionary and \ngoing to upset the whole world--15 States, if they decide they want to, \nmight be able to try a few things a little differently.\n  These are the threatening kinds of Republican proposals that are \ncoming along that are causing our friends to be so excited about \nanything that might in any way upset the status quo. If a State finds \nthe Republican proposal is so revolutionary and threatening that it \nwill destroy the State's ability to deliver education to its children, \nthe State does not have to accept it. There is no mandate in this bill \nat all that says any State has to do any of the things we are giving \nthem the opportunity to do. This is just the first tiny step. From my \nposition as chairman of that strategic planning commission, I would \nlook at the Republican proposal and say: This is timid. This is not \nnearly what is needed.\n  But I come here and discover it is denounced as somehow so \nthreatening that it is going to bring down the entire educational \nedifice of the United States. But I repeat, at the same time, there is \nthat kind of attack on Republican willingness to innovate and to even \nallow States to try a few things. At the same time that kind of attack \nis going on, the Vice President is going up and down the country \ndemanding revolutionary improvement with major investments. I would \nlike to know what those revolutionary improvements are. I would like to \nknow, in the context of this bill, what changes in the status quo in \nrevolutionary fashion the Vice President has in mind. If you get to the \ndetails, the only revolution he is calling for is spending more money \non programs that already exist.\n  Let's take a look for just a minute at some past history. I want to \nread an excerpt from the Washington Post, talking about schools in the \nDistrict of Columbia. It says:\n\n       Alarmed by the crises confronting Washington youth, a group \n     of community leaders is urging sweeping changes in D.C. \n     public schools.\n\n  That does not sound like the status quo is so wonderful.\n  And another:\n\n       A new consumer guide to the nation's public school system \n     ranks only two urban school systems lower than the D.C. \n     schools.\n\n  Again, the status quo is not so wonderful. The interesting thing \nabout these quotes from the Washington Post is that they appeared there \nin 1988, 12 years ago. For 12 years, Republicans have been trying to \nbring about some changes in the D.C. public schools. I have stood on \nthis floor and debated this issue in the context of the D.C. \nappropriations bill. Every time we try to try something different in \nD.C., we are told no, we cannot upset the status quo.\n  Here is another quote from the Washington Post:\n\n       The malaise that infects the District of Columbia public \n     schools runs deep. . . . There are problems in every phase of \n     the educational process. There are school system employees \n     who display no interest in the advancement of students, while \n     excellent teachers and administrators are smothered by \n     confusing and contradictory directives. . . . Instruction is \n     inconsistent. At many schools, the audit said, test results \n     have not been shared with parents and teachers. . . . The \n     teacher appraisal process has been a joke. In the 1988-1989 \n     school year, not one teacher received a conditional or \n     unsatisfactory rating. On average, 22 percent of the teachers \n     received no evaluation at all. While some excellent teaching \n     was observed, the audit said, the predominant classroom \n     activity involved students copying exercises and directions \n     from books while teachers graded papers at their desks.\n\n  This appeared in the Washington Post in 1992, some 4 years after the \nfirst articles appeared in the Washington Post.\n  What revolutionary changes are we talking about? Every time the \nRepublicans come to the floor and ask for an incremental change, we are \ntold, no, you are undermining the confidence in public schools.\n  For over a dozen years now, in at least the Nation's school district \nwhere we have some degree of influence, the public school system has \nfailed the children of the public schools.\n  As I listen to this debate and relive my experiences from memory as \nbeing chairman of the Strategic Planning Commission for the Utah State \nboard of education, I realize how timid public policymakers really are, \nhow anxious they are to talk about revolutionary improvements when they \nare running for office, and how anxious they are to stifle any attempt \nto bring to pass any sort of revolution when they have the opportunity \nto make a policy decision.\n  We must recognize, as I said before, this bill as what it is. The \nunderlying bill is not a revolutionary bold attack on the status quo. I \nwish it were. There are many things that can and should be done. This \nis just the most timid kind of probing into possibilities, and yet even \nthat is too much, even that is too fearful for those defenders of the \nstatus quo.\n  I go back to my original analogy. When it was first suggested to \nGeneral Motors that they might produce some smaller cars, that they \nmight try to go after the market that Toyota was beginning to discover, \nthere was a mantra that ran through General Motors and Ford and the big \nthree generally, and it was: Small cars mean small profits. It was \nrepeated over and over.\n  By repeating that mantra to themselves, these auto executives \nconvinced themselves that the status quo was just fine, and they \nwatched the Japanese come into this country and take market share away \nfrom them to a degree that, to some extent, threatened their existence.\n  It was only after the marketplace told them they should be focusing \non the driver and what the driver wanted rather than on their own \nsystems and what they were comfortable producing that they finally \nbegan to compete in the world marketplace for automobiles and began to \nproduce the kinds of cars Americans wanted to drive.\n  Now American manufacturers are competitive, and we drive American \ncars with the understanding that they are well built, they have good \nfuel economy, and they give us the value for the money, an \nunderstanding that, frankly, 15 or 20 years ago, Americans did not \nhave.\n  Why can't we have that same understanding with respect to education \ninstead of being so overwhelmingly concerned with the system and how do \nwe tweak the system and how do we defend the system and this is the way \nwe teach and, by George, the students have to sit there and take it.\n  Why can't we say: What do the students need to function effectively \nin society? Why can't we assess the student needs, the student \nchallenges in the future, and the student responsibilities and then \nsay, OK, if that is what the student needs, we will provide it? If the \nstudent needs skill in the English language, to a degree that he or she \ndoes not have it now, we better figure out a way to get it to them.\n  The main problem with our school system is this: Our school system is \nbuilt on the industrial model. Indeed, it was created as we went \nthrough the Industrial Revolution. Stop and think about it for a \nmoment.\n  Our schools are factories. That is, the model on which they are built \nis the factory model, with the student as product and the teacher as \nworker. Indeed, we organize the workers into unions, which is just the \nsame thing that happens in a factory.\n\n  Here is the product. The product is wheeled into the English room \nwhere the English worker pours English into the product for 45 minutes. \nThe factory whistle blows, and the product is wheeled into the math \nroom, where the math worker pours math into the product for 45 minutes. \nThe factory whistle blows, and the product is wheeled into the social \nsciences room where the social science worker pours social science into \nthe product for 45 minutes, and so on.\n  It is organized along the industrial model, student as product, \nteacher as worker.\n  After the product has gone through enough class time exposures, we \nstamp a certificate on it, which we call a diploma, and send the \nproduct out into\n\n[[Page S3467]]\n\nthe world saying: You are now educated, and the certificate we have put \nupon you proves it. We spend more attention to seat time than we do to \nthe ability of the student to perform.\n  If I may digress for a moment and give you an example of how \npervasive this whole mentality is from my own State, I want to talk \nabout one of the members of our commission. We had a professor in \neducational psychology at Brigham Young University who was a member of \nthe Strategic Planning Commission, which I chaired. I will not give you \nall of this history, except to tell you he made a commitment early in \nhis life that he would return some day to the tiny rural community in \nUtah where he grew up and give something back to that community. It was \nan emotional kind of commitment made as a teenager when the people in \nthat community raised enough money to send him to the University of \nUtah to get a college education, something he never could have afforded \non his own.\n  As I say, he is a professor, graduated Ph.D. from Stanford, one of \nthe Nation's leading authorities on small school problems. The position \nof superintendent of the school district in which his old hometown was \nlocated became vacant. He said to his wife: I am going to apply for \nthat position.\n  She said: Come on, that's so far below what you do and what you are \nqualified for professionally.\n  He said: No, I made a commitment years ago that I would someday \nreturn to my hometown and give back to that community, and here is a \nway I can do it. I can go there, be the superintendent of schools, try \na whole bunch of innovative things, and make a major difference. I can \nfulfill that age-old commitment I made as a teenager to go back to my \ncommunity.\n  He applied for the position. He was told that he was not qualified \nfor the position because there were certain gaps in his academic record \nthat were required for that particular assignment. All right, he said, \nI will fill those gaps.\n  He went around to his colleagues in the School of Education at \nBrigham Young University and said: Give me the test. I have to have \nthis particular class on my transcript. Even though I am a Ph.D. from \nStanford, I have to have this particular class. Give me the test. I \nwill take the test and demonstrate proficiency.\n  They said: No, no, no, no, no, no. You have to take the class. We \ncan't give you an examination to find out whether you are proficient. \nYou have to take the class.\n  He said: Some of these classes I teach.\n  They said: It doesn't matter. You have to sit in the classroom for \nthe prescribed number of hours or we will not certify you as being \neducated.\n  He did not become the superintendent of schools in that particular \nrural district. This demonstrates the commitment that runs through the \nentire educational community, to seat time as the ultimate measure of \neducational ability.\n  What we are saying in this bill is, let's take a tiny, incremental, \nvery tentative step towards looking at the needs of the student instead \nof focusing on the structure of the system, toward saying if somebody \nteaches a class, let's just assume that he knows what is in that \ncurriculum and does not have to sit through it in order to acquire the \nrequirements of the system.\n  Let's move from the industrial model paradigm that has the student as \nproduct and teacher as worker to a system with the student as worker--\nstudent, you are responsible for your own education--and teacher as \ncoach. Teacher, help the worker understand where to go to get this \ninformation, to look for that skill, and so on.\n  In the process that means, ultimately, we will have a system that \nfunds the student rather than the system. We will have a funding system \nwhere the money follows the student wherever the student, as worker, \ndecides he or she needs to go, with the teacher, as coach, saying: You \nmay have made a wrong decision. Look at the options. Look what you \ncould do over there. Let me help you. Let me coach you. Let me support \nyou. But understand, the ultimate responsibility for your education is \nyours, not mine.\n  That kind of a paradigm shift in thinking throughout the entire \neducational system would be truly a revolutionary improvement rather \nthan the kind of changes or improvements that the Vice President has in \nmind when he uses those phrases.\n  I thank the Chair and the other Members of the Senate for your \nindulgence. As I have gone on this trip down memory lane of my own \ninvolvement with schools, I close with this one last anecdote.\n  When we were laying out, for an employee of the Utah board of \neducation, some of the things we wanted to do and wanted to see happen \nin Utah's schools, he looked at me with great horror and said: We can't \ndo that overnight. He said: Understand, we are trying to make these \nsorts of improvements. We are trying to make this a better situation \nfor kids. But we can't do it overnight. You are too impatient. You come \nout of the business world where you can make a decision and then have \nit implemented. We can't do that. He said: But give us credit for \nmoving. We will move in this direction, but we won't get there for 15 \nyears.\n  I said to him: Now, wait a minute. Fifteen years?\n  Think of that in terms of the life of the student. That means the \nstudents who are entering this system as kindergartners, this year, \nwill not see any improvement in their entire career because they will \ngraduate before 15 years as seniors from high school.\n  If you think it is salutary that we can get changes moving slowly, \nand they will be effective in 15 years, you are just saying that a \nkindergartner entering school today is doomed to stay in the status quo \nhis or her entire career through elementary and secondary education.\n  As the quotes I have read indicate, I was right. Students who entered \nas kindergartners, at least in the District of Columbia, are now \ngraduating as seniors with no improvements, no changes. That is tragic.\n  To condemn a youngster as a kindergartner to no changes, no \nimprovements, no experimentation at all, just to defend the status quo, \nand say, we are moving towards these changes, and they will come 15 or \n20 years from now, is not something with which I want to be associated.\n  The Republican bill is not threatening. The Republican bill is not \nrevolutionary. The Republican bill is the tiniest kind of incremental \nopportunity for States to experiment. We ought to pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         A Lesson Plan for Gore\n\n                            (George F. Will)\n\n       If Al Gore keeps talking incessantly about education, \n     someday he may slip and say something interesting. But he \n     avoided that pitfall--anything novel would offend his leash-\n     holders, the teachers' unions--in his Dallas speech last \n     Friday, unless you find interesting this unintended lesson, \n     drawn from his speech, about how schools are failing to teach \n     future speech-writers how to write:\n       ``Today, I am proposing a new national commitment to bring \n     revolutionary improvements to our schools--built on three \n     basic principles. First, I am proposing a major national \n     investment to bring revolutionary improvements to our \n     schools. Second, I am proposing a national revolution in . . \n     . ''\n       By November the salient issue may be not education but: Can \n     Americans bear a president who talks to them as though they \n     are dim fourth-graders? Whoever writes Gore's stuff knows his \n     style, the bludgeoning repetition of cant, as in his almost \n     comic incantations about Republicans' ``risky tax schemes.'' \n     In Dallas, Gore used ``revolution,'' ``revolutionary'' or \n     ``revolutionize'' eight times and ``invest'' (a weasel word \n     to avoid ``spending'') or some permutation of it 14 times. \n     And--it is as reflexive as a sneeze--he used ``tax scheme'' \n     three times, ``risky tax cut'' once and threw in another \n     ``scheme,'' referring to vouchers, for good measure.\n       Gore's grating style in Dallas suited his banal substance, \n     which was Lyndon Johnson redux. The crux of Gore's plan is \n     more spending of the kinds that are pleasing to teachers' \n     unions. Such as: ``My education plan invests in smaller \n     schools and smaller classes--because we know that is one of \n     the most effective ways to improve student performance.''\n       Actually, we know no such thing. Pupil-teacher ratios have \n     been shrinking for a century. In 1955 pupil-teacher ratios in \n     public elementary and secondary schools were 30.2-to-one and \n     20.9-to-one respectively. In 1998 they were 18.9-to-one and \n     14.7-to-one. We now know it is possible to have, \n     simultaneously, declining pupil-teacher ratios and declining \n     scores on tests measuring schools' cognitive results. If \n     making classes smaller is such an effective route to \n     educational improvement,\n\n[[Page S3468]]\n\n     why, after 45 years of declining pupil-teacher ratios, are \n     schools so unsatisfactory they need to be ``revolutionized'' \n     by Gore's ``investments''?\n       Gore's Dallas speech proves the need for remedial classes \n     not only in prose composition but in elementary arithmetic, \n     too. He says that George W. Bush's ``tax scheme, if enacted, \n     would guarantee big cuts in spending for public schools.'' \n     Well.\n       Bush's proposed tax cut over 10 years would involve just 5 \n     percent of projected federal revenues. And federal money \n     amounts to just 7 percent of all spending on public \n     elementary and secondary education. Tonight's homework \n     assignment, boys and girls, is to calculate how trimming 5 \n     percent of federal revenues could necessitate ``big cuts'' in \n     education, 93 percent of which is paid for with nonfederal \n     funds.\n       Gore's vow that every new teacher hired under his program \n     would be ``fully qualified'' probably is an encoded promise \n     that all new teachers would be herded through the often \n     petty, irrelevant and ideologically poisoning education \n     schools that issue credentials to teachers. Education schools \n     feed their graduates into, and feed off, the teachers' \n     unions. Those unions sometimes push for state legislation \n     that keeps the education schools in business by requiring \n     teachers to pass through them.\n       ``There are,'' says Gore, ``too many school districts in \n     America where less than half the students graduate, and where \n     those who do graduate aren't ready for college or good \n     jobs.'' Washington has lots of public schools that fit that \n     description, which is why none of Gore's children attended \n     one.\n       Most failing schools serve (if that is the word) poor and \n     minority children, whose parents increasingly favor \n     meaningful school choice programs--programs that give parents \n     resources to choose between public and private schools, \n     thereby making the public school system compete. Gore is \n     vehemently opposed to that. The ``dramatic expansion of \n     public school choice'' he promises would enable students to \n     choose only among public schools, thereby keeping students \n     from low-income families confined to the public education \n     plantation.\n       What would be ``revolutionary'' would be a Gore education \n     proposal that seriously offended the teachers' unions. But he \n     is utterly orthodox in his belief that public schools are \n     splendid--and desperately in need of revolutionizing \n     investments.\n       ``Fundamental decisions about education have to be made at \n     the local level,'' said Gore at the beginning of last week's \n     litany of proposals for using federal money, and the threat \n     of withdrawing it, to turn the federal government into the \n     nation's school board. To the classes Gore needs in remedial \n     composition and arithmetic, add one on elementary logic.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to alert the membership of what we are \ntrying to do, we have been in touch, of course, with the majority. We \nwould like to finish the pending amendments the Abraham and Kennedy \namendments, in the near future. Then what is anticipated by the \nleadership, as I understand it, is to go to the Murray amendment.\n  Senator Murray has graciously agreed to the time agreement of an hour \nand a half, evenly divided. Then we would go to the Lieberman \namendment. I have spoken to Senator Lieberman. He agrees to 2 hours on \nhis side, and the majority could take whatever time they believe \nappropriate on that amendment. Then we would go to the Gregg amendment.\n  The only thing we are waiting on is a copy of the Gregg amendment. We \nhave not seen that. As soon as that is done, with the concurrence of \nthe majority--which we have kept advised during the entire morning--we \nwould be able to enter into an agreement. It is up to the majority \nleader, of course, as to when the votes would take place.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor. What we would like to do, \nprior to an agreement--we have had Senators waiting here most of the \nmorning. They would like to speak. Senator Dorgan would like a half \nhour; the two Senators from New York would use 10 minutes of Senator \nDorgan's time to speak about the death of Cardinal O'Connor. Senator \nFeingold wants 12 minutes to speak on some matter. I really don't know \nwhat that is.\n  I did not know the majority leader was on the floor. I was just \ntrying to alert everyone as to what we are trying to do.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I did not hear \nall of what he said. I was back in the Cloakroom preparing to come to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would yield, what we would like to do when \nwe finish this, which should be momentarily--either having a vote now \nor setting it aside--is to go to the other amendments after Abraham, \nKennedy. Senator Murray, who has the next amendment in order on our \nside, will agree to an hour and a half on her class size amendment. \nFollowing that would be Senator Lieberman. There has been agreement his \nwould be the next amendment. He has agreed to 2 hours on his side on \nthat. He indicated he did not know if the majority would need that much \ntime. But whatever the majority wants, that would be the case.\n  Then it is my understanding we would go to the Gregg amendment, with \nno time agreement as far as we are concerned. We have not seen the \nGregg amendment. We have been waiting for some time now. It is on its \nway. But the route sometimes is circuitous to get here. I did indicate, \nI think we have some Members who have been wanting to speak all \nmorning.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if Senator Reid would yield, I understand \nthat you are waiting to see the Gregg amendment. Of course, we would \nlike to see the Lieberman alternative also.\n  Do we have that?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. It is my understanding that Senator Lieberman has been \nin touch with members of the majority for the last several days.\n  Mr. LOTT. But I do not know that we have seen the language. That is \nwhat I have to make sure of, just like you need to see----\n  Mr. REID. I think you have. But if you haven't, that is certainly \navailable.\n  Mr. LOTT. Of course, as far as the timing, we have Senators that are \nvery interested in speaking on the pending matter, in addition to the \nones you have mentioned.\n  I must confess, I was a little surprised that there was a second-\ndegree amendment offered to Abraham-Mack. I thought when we entered \nthat earlier agreement we would have the four that were agreed to. \nWhile there was language in there that said that, I guess, relevant \nsecond degrees would be in order--or perfecting amendments--I had the \nimpression we were kind of not going to do that.\n  So the fact that there is now an amendment to the Abraham-Mack \namendment I think puts a different spin on things. Our people need to \nbe able to review that and speak on the second-degree amendment.\n  In addition, I see Senator Abraham, who is the sponsor of the \nunderlying amendment. Basically, what I am saying is, I think it is \ngoing to take more time than we had earlier thought that it might take. \nAnd then we would want to look at, are we going to have a second-degree \namendment or second-degree amendments on the Murray amendment? That \nwould certainly change the mix once again.\n  We need to make sure we have enough time on both sides for people to \nspeak on Lieberman and Gregg once we have seen those. Everybody is \nworking in good faith, and it is a little complicated. We could have \nobjections on either side about what might be offered as second-degree \namendments. We have some people on both sides who are now saying they \nwant to offer noneducation, nonrelevant amendments, and we have been \ntrying to stay on the education issue. It has been a very healthy \ndebate, and everybody has stayed in close touch. We would like to \ncontinue that.\n  I have to work with some people on our side who want to offer some \namendments sort of out of line. I think people not even on the \ncommittee who want to offer amendments at this point would be pushing \nthe envelope. We ought to at least give the chairman and ranking member \nand people with education amendments a chance to make their pitch.\n  So rather than take up a lot of time, I would like to talk with the \nSenator from Nevada about the amendments and the time that might be \nneeded. We will try to get something worked out and come to the floor \nsoon to get something agreed to. In the meantime, continue with the \ndebate and we won't be losing time--valuable time, as a matter of fact.\n  Mr. REID. If the leader will yield, the purpose of this was to try to \nmove a number of amendments along. From what the leader has said, it is \ngoing to be very difficult today to go beyond the Murray amendment. We \nwill certainly try to cooperate, but it may be difficult.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. It may be difficult, but we can see what might be able to \nbe done.\n\n[[Page S3469]]\n\n  Mr. REID. The one thing I would like to do is make sure that the--we \nhave had Senators over here waiting literally all morning to speak for \na short period of time. I know Senator Abraham wants to speak on his \namendment and that of Senator Kennedy. I would like to propound a \nunanimous consent agreement that Senator Dorgan be recognized for a \nhalf hour, that 10 minutes of that time be allotted to Senators Schumer \nand Moynihan to speak about the death of the New York Cardinal, and \nthat Senator Feingold be allowed to speak for 12 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the majority leader if he would yield \nfor a question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am relatively new to the Senate. The House rule used to \nsay committee members could offer only germane amendments. Do I \nunderstand the majority leader is suggesting that as a standard in the \nSenate?\n  Mr. LOTT. No, I didn't suggest that. I am saying that members of the \ncommittee have education amendments and would like to have them \noffered. We have some members on both sides of the aisle now who are \nsaying, ``I want my amendment to be next,'' and I am not inclined to be \nimpressed with that suggestion. We need to go forward with the way we \nhave been trying to proceed and get our work done. But, no; the way it \nworks around here is, if you can horn your way into a debate that is \nunderway, then that is the way it is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how about my request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, just to \nfacilitate the flow here, let me make sure we have some sort of a \nsharing of time, alternating back and forth. The Senator's proposal was \n30 minutes for Senator Durbin, 10 minutes for Senators Schumer and \nMoynihan, and 12 minutes for Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator repeat the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. REID. What I proposed is that Senator Dorgan be recognized for 30 \nminutes, with 10 minutes of his time being allotted to the Senators \nfrom New York, and that 12 minutes be allotted to Senator Feingold. \nThey have been here literally all morning.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the block of time for those speakers, an equal amount of time \nbe allocated to Senator Abraham and to myself, or my designee. I know \nthe Senators from New York are going to talk about the Cardinal's \ndeath.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to speak after Senator \nAbraham.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I amend my request that Senator Abraham be \nrecognized first, and then Senator Sessions, and any remaining time \nwill be used by myself or my designee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Reserving the right to object, although I would like to \nspeak on the amendment, as well as the second degree, because of a \nceremony taking place in the Capitol rotunda now, of which I am to be a \npart, I may not be in a position to immediately follow the final \nspeaker. I suggest that perhaps we might slightly modify the Senator's \nproposed unanimous consent agreement to allow for the fact that I may \nbe unable to be here right at that time.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we will make it simple. I ask unanimous \nconsent that when this block of time is completed, as outlined by \nSenator Reid, there be an equal amount of time on this side for me or \nmy designee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield to the two Senators from New York \nto use their 10 minutes of time now to speak about the death of \nCardinal O'Connor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3469-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3469-S3470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JOHN CARDINAL O'CONNOR\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will use 5 minutes and then yield to my \nsenior colleague from New York for 5 minutes.\n  It is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the memory of His \nEminence, John Cardinal O'Connor. As you know, His Eminence was a man \nof immense honor and conviction, a man who dedicated his entire life in \nservice to our Nation and the betterment of humanity. He was completely \nloyal to Catholic doctrine but was able to reach out to New Yorkers of \nall races, religions, and ethnic and economic backgrounds. His loss is \nNew York's loss, America's loss, and humankind's loss.\n  Today, all New Yorkers mourn this profound loss. And while today will \nbe one filled with great sorrow, I believe that during this period of \ngrief, many will find moments of joyous reflection in thinking about \nthe innumerable ways this servant of God was able to touch the lives of \nmillions.\n  Earlier this year, I rose alongside a number of my colleagues in the \nSenate and called upon this body to support legislation to honor the \nenormous contributions made by the Cardinal to religion, humanity, and \nservice to America, by bestowing upon him the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  The measure passed unanimously, and I had the honor to personally \npresent His Eminence with a framed copy of that legislation, and \nalthough he was weakened, you could see a man of peace. He believed he \nhad accomplished much of his life's goal and was proud of what he had \ndone, although in his own modest way. It is my prayer that all of us, \nwhen our time comes, may feel just that way.\n  The Cardinal cared about the poor, the sick, and the elderly. He \nwould be giving a speech on Catholic doctrine at the cathedral one hour \nand the next hour would quietly slip off and minister to an AIDS victim \nin a hospice. He was a man of great intelligence and of great passion. \nHe was a man who believed and didn't flinch from those beliefs but at \nthe same time had a unique ability to reach out to others who might not \nbelieve what he did. He served, of course, as a military chaplain and \nat the same time was a voice for the poor. He cared about working \npeople and spoke up for the union movement repeatedly.\n  He loved all of God's children, and he will be forever cherished and \nremembered by people of the Jewish community for bringing Jews and \nCatholics closer together. I truly believe that much of the Vatican's \nrapprochement with the Jewish community worldwide started with His \nEminence Cardinal O'Connor. He served as an international ambassador, \ntraveling the world over, to: Israel, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, and Russia, as a messenger of peace, humanity, and \nfreedom. Wherever war, oppression, and poverty have threatened to \nweaken the human spirit, he has been there--a tireless servant of the \nRoman Catholic Church and as an American citizen.\n\n  John Cardinal O'Connor was an institution in New York, a beacon of \nhope and inspiration who, from our cherished St. Patrick's Cathedral \nchampioned the simplest of causes--the betterment of humanity. He was a \nman that I respected a great deal because of his unwavering commitment \nto his convictions, even when we disagreed.\n  So, last night, Mr. President, New York, America, and the entire \nworld lost one of our greatest treasures. This morning, the earthly \nworld is a bit poorer for the passing of this great man and the \nheavenly world a bit richer. I thank you and my colleagues for allowing \nme to express, on behalf of all New Yorkers, the profound sense of \nsorrow we feel today with the loss of Cardinal O'Connor.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the senior Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on February 22, my beloved colleague, \nthe junior Senator from New York, introduced legislation to authorize \nthe President to award a gold medal on behalf of the Congress to John \nCardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York, in recognition of his \naccomplishments as\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\na priest, a chaplain, and a humanitarian.\n  Congress finds that His Eminence, John Cardinal O'Connor, was a man \nof deep compassion, great intellect, and tireless devotion to spiritual \nguidance and humanitarianism.\n  I think it is a special note that the Cardinal joined the Navy \nChaplain's Corps in June of 1952 during the Korean conflict. He served \nwith elements of both the Navy and the Marine Corps and saw combat \naction in Vietnam.\n  He later served as chaplain of the United States Naval Academy and \nwas appointed Chief of Chaplains of the Navy with the grade of rear \nadmiral, from which position he retired 4 years later.\n  In May 1979, he was ordained a bishop by Pope John Paul II. He then \nserved as Victor General of Military Ordnance--now the Archdiocese for \nMilitary Services--until 1984.\n  This son of a working-class laborer, a union man from Pennsylvania, \nfound himself, on the one extreme, in the jungles of Vietnam saying \nmass in foxholes and asking himself, as he saw the deaths on all sides \nof all the combatants, why?\n  He came back with that same courage to the Archdiocese of New York. \nThere are 2.37 million of us, and we have been rancorous from the \nfirst, and continue so. He quickly adapted to that environment and \nadopted some of those characteristics.\n  But he was a wonderful priest. As my friend, Senator Schumer, said, \nhe was a healer and a man who reached out to others.\n  He is in his heaven now. As we mourn his passing, we celebrate his \nlife.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3470-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3470-S3471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this has been an interesting and certainly \na thoughtful debate about education. This is exactly the topic we ought \nto be discussing in the Senate. We have a lot of folks in this country \nwho care about the state of education and the condition of America's \nschools. They say America's schools are failing its children. What \nshall we do about that?\n  Before us is the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. We debate this law every 6 years, and at that time we \ntalk about what kind of policies we believe will work for America's \nschools and what kind of policies will give us the kind of education \nsystem we can have pride in. Are our children walking through classroom \ndoors that give them the best opportunity for a good education?\n   Let me also say that I am a little tired--not only in Congress but \nin politics and in discussions generally--of the notion in this country \nof blaming America's teachers first.\n  I visit a lot of classrooms. I see a lot of teachers and a lot of \nstudents. In most cases, the teachers I see in America's classrooms are \nextraordinary men and women who do a wonderful job with our children in \nAmerica's schools. They have a very tough job. Their students come to \nschools all over this country with problems that affect how well they \nwill learn. There are children who are hungry, without a caring parent, \nwho are regularly faced with violence, guns, behavior issues. All sorts \nof issues come to school with children. We have to respond to those and \ndeal with those issues. But this notion of somehow blaming America's \nteachers is wrong.\n  Let me talk for a moment about who has new ideas. I was listening a \nwhile ago to a speech that I thought was interesting. But the notion \nwas that only the majority party had new ideas, and somehow the \nDemocratic caucus in the Senate was offering proposals that are just \nthe same old thing.\n  The majority party offers, as its version of how to fix our education \nsystem, to provide block grants. Is there anything new about block \ngrants? Block grants aren't new. In fact, this is the oldest idea in \npolitics, and it is an idea that doesn't work.\n  We have very serious problems with our schools that we need to help \nsolve. A lot of schools are in radical disrepair.\n  I was at a school Monday in North Dakota. It is a school whose \nstudent population is almost exclusively Native American. These young \nIndian children are attending a school that is not in good repair. They \nknow it. I know it. The teachers know it. The school board knows it. \nThis is a school that doesn't have much of a tax base because it is on \nan Indian reservation. It is a public school district, but does not \nhave much of a tax base.\n  This is a school that doesn't even have an athletic field. Is there a \nplace for these children to go out and run? Is there a place for them \nto play football or to practice soccer? No. This is a school without an \nathletic field.\n  As we were going through the classrooms in this school, the principal \nsaid to me: Senator, is there any chance you could help us try to get \nan athletic field for these kids? They have too much energy. They have \nso much energy and want the opportunity to go out on an athletic field \nto play football, or play soccer, or perhaps run track. But we don't \nhave the money.\n  Again, this is a school without a tax base so they don't have the \nmoney.\n  As I was touring the school, the teacher said: Now, children, are \nthere any questions you would like to ask the Senator?\n  One little kid in the third grade raised his hand real high, and he \nsaid: Yes. Mr. Senator, I would like to know how many bathrooms there \nare in the White House.\n\n  I thought: Gosh, that is a funny question. How many bathrooms are \nthere in the White House?\n  One little kid on the other side of the room said: I think there are \n18.\n  Another little boy said: I think there are 46.\n  I said: You are both probably right. It is probably between 18 and \n46.\n  Do you know in that school, with 150 kids, they have only two \nbathrooms, a boy's bathroom and a girl's bathroom? I guess he was \nthinking it would be a luxury to have a lot of bathrooms.\n  That is the sort of question that comes from a third grader. But it \nrelates to the condition of the school. The third grader knows that he \nis not walking into the same kind of school that other kids are. This \nschool needs repair.\n  One of the new ideas we proposed--that has been opposed, \nincidentally, by the majority party--is to provide the opportunity to \nrepair, renovate, and rebuild America's schools that are in disrepair \nall around this country. But there is not much interest in that. \nInstead, the response is, let's send them block grants, and then pray \nthat someone will use it for the right thing.\n  We have some experience with block grants. In fact, title I started \nout as a block grant a long time ago. However, Congress quickly learned \nthat the funding was not helping the poor children who were intended to \nbe the beneficiaries.\n  Let me give just a couple of examples of what title I was used for: \nThey bought three tubas in one school. Another one used it for band \nuniforms. Another bought 18 portable swimming pools. That is block \ngrants.\n  Of course, these block grants won't go directly to the schools. The \nblock grant funds will go to the Governors. Then the school districts \nare going to have to go begging to the States asking: Can we get some \nof that Federal money you have back there in block grants?\n  We think maybe a new idea would be to say, let's renovate, remodel, \nand rebuild those schools that are in disrepair around this country, \nand let's help the local governments that do not have the resources to \naccomplish that task. We think a new idea might be to say, let's help \nthose schools that are radically overcrowded, with kids sitting with an \ninch between their desks in a classroom, with 35 students taught by 1 \nteacher. We know better teaching goes on in the classroom when you have \n1 teacher and 15 students or 1 teacher and 20 students, so let's decide \nto help schools reduce the size of their classes.\n  When someone says there are no new ideas, it is just that they have \nnot heard them. We have talked about them. They have not heard them. \nThey have not been willing to vote for them.\n  There are a lot of things we can do to improve education. I agree \nthat we cannot throw money at problems, but I also believe we cannot \nwithhold the resources necessary to fix this country's schools. We \ncannot send kids to inferior schools and ask why we didn't get a good \nstudent out of that school. We\n\n[[Page S3471]]\n\ncannot send kids into crowded classrooms and wonder why test scores are \nnot higher.\n  As I said before, some of the most wonderful, dedicated people I have \nmet are the teachers in classrooms, spending their days with our \nchildren. We can and should make some changes on the question of the \nteacher certification process. We ought to have alternative \ncertification programs for people who later in life want to go back \ninto a classroom and teach kids. They shouldn't have to go through a \nteacher's college or a curriculum that is long and difficult.\n  Let me give an example. There was a rather wonderful major league \noutfielder who played ball for the Baltimore Orioles who was going to \nteach physical education at a school in New York. Wouldn't you want \nyour kid being taught how to hit by a major league outfielder? But he \ndidn't have the proper teacher certificate so he wasn't kept in the \nschool system.\n  What if Bill Gates decided he wanted to come into your school and \nteach a class on computers? He doesn't have the certification. What if \nMichael Jordan was willing to teach your child to play basketball in a \nphysical education program? Do you think Michael Jordan and Bill Gates \nare not qualified? Of course they are.\n  We can find mechanisms by which we provide alternative certification \nfor professionals and others who want to go into the classroom to help \nin this country. We can and should do that.\n  But to those people who spend all of their time beating up on \nAmerica's schools, I wonder how they think we got to where we are in \nthis world with our education system? How on Earth did we do that? Is \nthere a place in the world anyone wants to trade places with? I don't \nthink so. Do we want to trade our education system for the one in \nHaiti, Zambia, or Bangladesh? I don't think so. How about Germany? How \nabout France or Italy? Do we want to trade it? I don't think so.\n  This country has invested a substantial amount of money in something \ncalled universal education. We did it because we don't believe in \nsegregating kids and deciding some kids have talent to go here and \nother kids have the talent to go there. We decided all kids ought to \nhave the opportunity to make the most of their education.\n  I have two children in school this morning. They are both the most \nwonderful children in the whole world. I love them to death. I want \nthem to have the best education possible. I don't know what they will \nbe when they grow up. My son, when he was 10 years old and we were \ngoing over an English lesson together, that he didn't need to study \nEnglish because he was going to be a miner. I said: A miner? He said: \nI'm going to mine gold and I don't need to read and spell. I said: When \nmining gold, you have to be able to read and sign contracts. Over time, \nhe changed his occupation choice, and he has had several other choices \nsince then. We spend time every night with our children doing homework \nbecause we believe education is a priority for them. I want them to go \nthrough a classroom door I am proud of. I want them to go into a school \nI am proud of. I want them to have teachers I am proud of.\n  Dating back to my great-grandmother who homesteaded on the prairies \nof North Dakota and raised children who raised children who raised me, \nthis education system has been a wonderful boon to most Americans, \nincluding our family. My father had to quit school in the sixth grade \nbecause his mother died and his father was in an institution for \ntuberculosis. In sixth grade, he quit school in order to go to work to \nhelp his uncles raise his sisters. The proudest day of his life, it \nseems to me, is one day when, without ever having given us a hint, he \ntold us at the supper table that he had, at age 55, just passed the GED \ntest. Then he gave us a big smile. He didn't even tell us he was taking \nit. This meant a lot to him.\n\n  Education has enormous value. Every American family who cares about \nits kids understands that. This debate is not about two sides, one of \nwhich has new ideas and the other which has no ideas. It is a \ndiscussion about a range of approaches with respect to the education \nsystem and how we make it better.\n  I don't think our public school system is awful. I disagree with \nthose who do. Go to school. I have been to schools that are awful \nschools, but do you know why? Because of all the other influences from \nwhich those kids come. I have been to schools with metal detectors at \nthe front door. Shortly after I visited one of those schools, a kid was \nshot at the water fountain because another kid bumped him. The student \nwho shot him got a gun through the metal detector, even though a \nsecurity guard was sitting there.\n  That school has a crowd control problem as much as it has education \nproblems. It is not because they are bad people running the school. It \nis because that school inherits all of the other problems of its \nsurroundings. I think we need to understand that and help change it.\n  We can do better in education. I am not suggesting everything is \ngreat. We can do better in education. But I know my kids do more \nhomework than I did. I graduated from a tiny high school class of nine \nin Regent, North Dakota. I am enormously proud of the education I \nreceived in that school. Are the kids there getting a better education \ntoday than I did? Yes, of course they are--more homework, more \nopportunities, bigger libraries, the Internet. They have access to any \nlibrary in the world through the Internet.\n  As we look at what we do to improve our schools, I think the most \nimportant thing is to improve those crumbling facilities, reduce class \nsize, and then require accountability. I am all for accountability.\n  There is a provision in Senator Daschle's substitute, which I will \nalso offer as a separate amendment, to provide parents with a school \nreport card. I get a report card about how my son and daughter are \nperforming. I want a report card for the public school they attend, a \nreport card that every parent and every taxpayer in this country should \nget, comparing their school to other schools in their district, in \ntheir state, and in other States. How is that school doing? Is it \npassing or failing based on a series of criteria--student performance, \ngraduation and retention rates, professional certification of teachers, \naverage class size, school safety, parental involvement--which is \ncritically important--student dropout rates and student access to \ntechnology. How is that school doing? We deserve a school report card \nas parents and as taxpayers.\n  That ultimately will provide the accountability we should get. Yes, \nwe ought to hold our education system accountable. We will have an \nopportunity to vote on school report cards as part of the Bingaman \namendment, and if the Bingaman amendment fails, on an amendment I will \noffer separately.\n  The secret to education is not such a secret. Successful education \ncomes from teachers who know how to teach, students who want to learn, \nand parents who are involved in their child's education. When all three \nof these elements are present, education works and works well.\n  Evaluate this country--where it has been, where it is now, and where \nit is going--and ask yourself if we have accomplished things through \nour education system of which we are proud? You bet we have. We have \nspliced genes, we have invented plastic silicone and radar, built \nrockets, and developed vaccines to prevent polio and small pox. Have we \ndone something significant, all of it coming from our education system? \nYou bet your life we have. Can we improve it? Sure. But we will improve \nit with new ideas--not tired old ideas called block grants.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3471-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3471-S3472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AIDS AS A SECURITY ISSUE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment in the failure of the conferees to the African Growth \nand Opportunity Act to accept the Feinstein-Feingold amendment \nregarding HIV/AIDS drugs in Africa. When the Senate was debating that \nlegislation last year, Senator Feinstein and I offered our amendment, \nwhich was accepted by the bill's managers, Senators Roth and Moynihan, \nto address a critically important issue--an issue relating to Africa's \ndevastating AIDS crisis; an issue that has cast a dark shadow on U.S.-\nAfrican relations in the past.\n  Our amendment was simple. It prohibited the United States Government\n\n[[Page S3472]]\n\nor any agent of the United States Government from pressuring African \ncountries to revoke or change laws aimed at increasing access to HIV/\nAIDS drugs, so long as the laws in question adhere to existing \ninternational regulations governing trade. Quite simply, our amendment \ntold the executive branch to stop twisting arms of African countries \nthat are using legal means to improve access to HIV/AIDS \npharmaceuticals for their people.\n  The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \nRights, or TRIPS, allows for compulsory licensing in cases of national \nemergency. Approximately 13 million African lives have been lost since \nthe onset of the crisis. According to the Rockefeller Foundation's \nrecent report, ``on statistics alone, young people from the most \naffected countries in Africa are more likely than not to perish of \nAIDS.'' Consider that: more likely than not to perish. If these do not \nconstitute emergency conditions, then I don't know what does.\n  This was a very modest amendment to begin with, but the final version \nof the amendment discussed by the conferees was a true compromise. It \nwas not as strong as I would have liked it to be. But it did push our \npolicy closer to the right thing. I want to take this opportunity to \nthank Senator Feinstein, Senator Moynihan, Senator Roth, and their \nstaffs for working so hard on this amendment. Senator Feinstein was a \ntireless advocate on this issue, and I have no doubt that she will \ncontinue to fight, as will I, for the right thing when it comes to \naccess to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals. And Senator Roth, in particular, \nmade it a priority to hammer out this issue, and I thank him for that.\n  But despite these efforts, despite the concessions that Senator \nFeinstein and I made, despite the fact that this is the right thing to \ndo, the Feinstein-Feingold amendment was stripped in conference. The \nopposition to our amendment is baffling. How do the conferees who \nkilled this provision justify pressuring these countries, where in some \ncases life expectancies have dropped by more than 15 years, not to use \nall legal means at their disposal to care for their citizens? Without \nbroader access to these drugs in Africa, more people will suffer, more \npeople will die--that is a simple fact.\n  As I said on this floor not long ago, I cannot imagine that ordinary \nAmericans are urging their representatives to oppose the Feinstein-\nFeingold amendment. I cannot imagine that anyone would try to prevail \nupon my colleagues to oppose this measure--except perhaps for \npharmaceutical companies. The pharmaceutical industry does not fear \nlosing customers in Africa, because they know that Africans simply \ncannot afford their prices. But they do fear that taking this modest \nstep in this time of crisis could somehow, in some ill-defined scenario \nin the future, cut into their bottom line. This is the same \npharmaceutical and medical supplies industry that gave more than $4 \nmillion in PAC money contributions and more than $6.5 million in soft \nmoney contributions in 1997 and 1998.\n  How could this irresponsible and callous decision to strip the \nFeinstein-Feingold amendment from the conference have been made? I have \nsome idea. Some may have bowed to the pressure of the pharmaceutical \nindustry. And some members just don't get it.\n  In particular, some of the public comments about this issue made over \nthe weekend by a leading Member of this body demonstrated such a \nmisunderstanding of the problem that they cannot go unanswered.\n  Over the weekend, some troubling remarks were made about the \nadministration's recognition that HIV/AIDS, an infectious disease that \ncurrently affects 34 million people worldwide, is a security issue.\n  First, a leader of this body disputed the fact that AIDS is a \nsecurity issue. He is wrong. Anyone who believes that a dramatic drop \nin population, a massive reversal in economic growth, a societal \ndisruption of unprecedented proportions, an entire generation of \norphans growing up on the streets--anyone who believes that those \nthings are not destabilizing is terribly misguided. Anyone who does not \nunderstand that the U.S. will be profoundly affected by the terrible \nconsequences of AIDS in the developing world had better think again.\n  But it didn't stop there. It went further. It was suggested that the \nadministration is using the issue cynically to appeal to ``certain \ngroups'' who were not identified.\n  Is it pandering to ``certain groups'' to stand up and say that a \ndisease that infects more than 15,000 young people each day is an issue \nof grave concern? Is it political posturing to get serious about the \nmassive destabilization that can occur when the most productive segment \nof a society is wiped out by disease? Is it only some mysterious narrow \nconstituency that is concerned about the prospect of millions of \norphans growing up on the streets, without any guidance or education? \nAfter witnessing the shocking violence that resulted, in large part, \nfrom the masterful manipulation of disenfranchised youth in West Africa \nover the last decade, I think we all have to take this threat \nseriously, and acknowledge that the threat is fueled each day by the \nwithering scourge of AIDS that today is galloping through so much of \nthe developing world.\n  Let me just paint a portrait of the region most affected by AIDS--\nsub-Saharan Africa. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nAfrica, I have always felt very strongly about the issue of AIDS in \nAfrica. I have raised it in meetings with African heads of state. I \napplauded the U.N. Security Council's decision to address the crisis \nearlier this year. I support the administration's call to increase the \nresources directed at the crisis, and I am glad that the U.S. is \nfinally getting serious about this threat.\n  Thirteen million Africans have been killed by AIDS since the onset of \nthe crisis, and according to World Bank President James Wolfensohn, the \ndisease has left 10 million orphaned African children in its wake.\n  In Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, 25 percent of the people \nbetween the ages of 15 and 19 are HIV positive.\n  By 2010, sub-Saharan Africa will have 71 million fewer people than it \nwould have had if there had been no AIDS epidemic. That is why we must \nacknowledge that the AIDS epidemic is becoming a crucial part of the \ncontext for all that happens in Africa and for all of our policy \ndecisions about Africa.\n  Until this week this Senate has been moving in the right direction on \nthese issues. I have been pleased to work with many of my colleagues in \na bipartisan effort to raise the profile of the epidemic and to work \ntoward a comprehensive package aimed at addressing this crisis. It \ndisturbs me a great deal to think that Members of this body have \nsomehow failed to hear us, or perhaps refused to listen.\n  This is not a partisan issue. It is deadly serious. I plead with all \nof my colleagues to look again at the AIDS epidemic in Africa and to \nconsider its global implications.\n  Those implications are fast becoming strategic and economic realities \nthat will kill millions and drag down all of our efforts on \ninternational development and the promotion of freedom and stability \naround the world. We need to get our heads out of the sand right now, \nresist the impulse to gain partisan advantage, and join together to \nseek solutions to the AIDS crisis before we reap global disaster.\n  U.S. policy on access to HIV/AIDS drugs will come up again in this \nbody. All of the complex issues relating to this crisis--prevention \nstrategies, care for orphans, mother to child transmission--none of \nthese issues is going away. And while this Congress fails to do the \nright thing, while some fail to grasp the magnitude of the epidemic and \nits consequences, AIDS will continue to take its terrible toll on \nfamilies and communities, on economies, and on stability around the \nworld.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3472-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3472-S3496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as I understand it, our leader, or his \ndesignee, has balancing time to that which is used on the other side. I \nbelieve Senator Sessions' name was even evoked, that he would utilize \nsome portion of that. How much time does the leader have?\n\n[[Page S3473]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has 32 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield from the leader's time to the \nSenator from Alabama 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am excited and pleased about the \ndirection this Senate is attempting to go in reforming Federal \ninvolvement and participation in education today.\n  I have been traveling my State since January. I have been in 15 \ndifferent schools. I have been impressed with what the teachers and \nprincipals are trying to do. There are a lot of good things happening \nin a lot of schools all over America. But I hear more and more \nfrustration from those people who are dealing with our children in our \nclassrooms, who know our children's names, who are answerable to our \npeople in our communities to run education. They are very frustrated \nthat what we are doing in Washington complicates their lives, makes \nthem more difficult, and frustrates their ability to actually teach \nchildren.\n  I know some of my friends on the other side of the aisle so \nfrequently use the word ``accountability.'' They say ``we need \naccountability--accountability.'' I have been listening to that. Not \ntoo long ago it finally dawned on me--I have been in this body for just \nover 3 years, on the Education Committee just over 1 year--what they \ndefine as accountability. They define accountability as a Federal \nprogram that mandates precisely how the money is spent.\n  That is not accountability. Accountability is, when money is coming \nfrom the Federal Government, the State government, the city government, \nand the county government: Is learning occurring? Are children \nlearning? We need to determine in America if children are learning. In \nsome schools they are and in other schools they are not, or there is so \nlittle learning as to be, in effect, a waste of our money. To pour more \nmoney, even with targeted rules from the Federal Government, into a \nschool system in Alabama, Texas, Pennsylvania, or New York is not the \nway to improve learning. That is not accountability.\n  We need to ask ourselves, after 35 years of this basic Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act--and it is a primary Federal act; there are \nsome 700 programs for education. ESEA is the biggest. We have been \ngrowing it for 35 years. It is now up to 1,000 pages of rules and \nregulations and paperwork that fall on our teachers and principals.\n  I have been talking intensely to those people. They do not believe it \nis necessary. They believe many of the things we are doing complicate \ntheir lives, make it more difficult for them to teach, and frustrate \nthem. In fact, we are, as many people know, losing a lot of good \nteachers. Discipline problems, paperwork problems, lack of appreciation \nfor the work they are doing, no difference between a great teacher who \nworks at night, does his homework, meets with students after school, \nprepares carefully written tests--there is no difference in what they \nget paid from a teacher who has no interest in their work, just comes \nto class, presides over it, does not do a lesson plan, gives weak or \nalmost insignificant tests, and does not worry about whether the \nchildren are learning or not.\n  I was in Selma, AL, last Friday, visiting the Selma City School \nSystem. Selma has 45,000 people. They created a sixth grade school. \nThey call it the Discovery School. The teachers and principals got \ntogether and developed a program on how to improve learning for the \ncity of Selma. All the sixth grades were there. Every student has to be \ninvolved in an artistic endeavor. I saw their ballet performance. I saw \ntheir tap dance performance. They have music, art, and other forms of \nartistic endeavor. They believe, as national statistics show, that \nmusic and art can enhance learning in other courses. That is their \ndecision, and they have teachers who are committed to it and excited \nabout it. They were very proud of the performance of those kids.\n  I went into a class called sports math. Sports is big in Alabama and \nin a lot of States. Kids are interested in sports. When one talks about \nbatting average, that includes people's weight, height--all these \nfactors. This is a good way to take children's natural interest in an \nevent such as sports and convert that to a learning process of math. It \nis an extra class they can do.\n  I met a teacher who had gone to Russia with our NASA program. She \ntaught a special class on space, and they were excited about that.\n  They had some great teachers there. I met the mother of Doc Robinson. \nDoc Robinson--of course, sports fans might know him--is the senior \ngraduating guard from Auburn University, one of the top teams in the \ncountry this year. He will probably go in the first, second, or third \nround of the NBA draft. His mother teaches in Selma. She is a wonderful \nlady and excited about education in that school.\n  What is it that makes us think we can develop some plan for teaching \nsixth graders in Selma, AL, better than those people? That is a \nquestion we need to ask ourselves. What is it that makes us think we \ncan mandate more effectively than they can? They care about their \nchildren. They are their own children. Doc Robinson graduated from that \nSelma school system, just as other children did.\n\n  That is an important factor for us to consider. I know there has been \na lot of thought about how we are going to handle other issues people \nthink are important. One of the issues that has been talked about a lot \nis class size. They say class size is the most important thing. Numbers \ndo not show that to be the most important thing. They do not show that. \nThere is a lot of debate about that. Maybe it is extremely important \nunder certain circumstances. It may not be so important in other \ncircumstances.\n  Maybe the Selma school system would rather create this new Discovery \nSchool and work on funding it for the next 2 or 3 years, get it \nstraightened out, and then add a new teacher to reduce class size the \nthird year down the road. I am not prepared to say what it is.\n  Why do we not think we ought to trust the people who elected us to \nrun the school system? They elected the school system. There is a lot \nthat has been said about this.\n  There has been a study by Michigan Professor Linda Lim who did \ncomparative studies of U.S. and Asian schools and found that class \nsizes of 50--and we are down around 20 or fewer now--50 plus in places \nsuch as Taiwan have not kept those schools from performing better than \nours. The basics of Professor Lim's findings are that nothing--not \nspending per student, not class size, not computer access--makes the \ncritical difference in the end. Rather, motivation is what matters. We \nneed parental involvement, plus teachers who want to teach and are \nskilled and children who are prepared to learn. They must all work \ntogether to achieve results.\n  We talk a lot in our State about improving textbooks. I think we \nought to improve textbooks. I am very concerned about the quality of \nour textbooks. A year or so ago, Senator Robert Byrd delivered one of \nthe most impressive speeches I ever heard on education. He called the \nmodern textbooks ``touchy-feely twaddle.''\n  Regardless, what difference does it make if we have a $500 textbook \nfor every child in the classroom and those students will not read it? \nThat is what I ask students when I talk with them. Alabama has a tough \ngraduation exam. If a student does not meet this exam, they will not \nget their diploma. It is considered to be the toughest exam in America. \nThe children are worried about it. A substantial number may not pass.\n  When I talked with these students, they expressed their concerns to \nme, to which I enjoyed listening. I asked them: Do you come to school \nin the morning, and do you get a good night's rest? Do you pay \nattention in class? Do you do the homework your teacher assigns? Do you \nread your lesson at night? Oh, you don't? Do you know students who do \nnot do that? And they all agreed that they do. I said: Why do you think \nyou should get a diploma from high school if you do not at least put in \nyour part?\n  What we are finding, and what a lot of experts believe, is that a \nteacher who can motivate a child is more important than whether he is \nteaching 18 people or 25 people. That is a key factor.\n\n[[Page S3474]]\n\n  There is a study by the University of Rochester economist Eric \nHanushek. He studied 277 separate published studies on the effect of \nteacher-pupil ratios and class-size averages on student achievement.\n  We ought to get a pretty good result from this. They published this \nall over America. He found this: That only 15 percent of those studies \nsuggested there is a statistically significant improvement in \nachievement as a result of smaller classes; 72 percent of the studies \nfound no effect at all. That is surprising to me. I would not have \nthought that. But that is what he found. And he found that 13 percent \nfound reducing class size had a negative impact on achieving. That was \nreported in the Education Week, a journal of professional educators.\n  The Department of Education, under President Clinton, reports that \nalthough American students lag behind other students in international \ntesting, American classrooms have an average size of 23 students. That \nis very few students compared with the averages of 49 in South Korea, \n44 in Taiwan, and 36 in Japan.\n  I am not saying we ought to increase our class sizes. I think having \na small class size is fine. But for this Congress to mandate to \nprofessional educators, Governors, State superintendents, county \nsuperintendents, and principals all over America that we are going to \ngive you money only for reducing class size is not wise. I am telling \nyou, America, that is not a good thing for us to require, to mandate. \nIn a particular community, that may not be the most important thing. \nThere are some real numbers that question that policy.\n  Washington, DC, this city of which we are a part, has an average \nclass size below the national average. Yet it ranks near the bottom in \nacademic achievement. Furthermore, we should not forget that class size \nin American schools dropped from 30 in 1961 to 23 in 1998 without any \nimprovement in standardized test scores.\n  So I would suggest maybe having superior teachers and motivating \nschools are the things we need to be looking for. That is not going to \ncome from some Senator in Washington or the President of the United \nStates but from actual teachers in classrooms who know our children's \nnames, who care about them as human beings.\n  Indeed, in 1988, the U.S. Department of Education concluded that \nreducing class size would be expensive and probably ``a waste of money \nand effort.'' I do not know if it is a waste of effort. I just say \nthis. It may not be the most important part of our budget dollar.\n  We are trying to do that in Alabama. We are working hard to reduce \nclass sizes. We are actually getting down within this national goal \nrange already. But it does come at great cost.\n  What if you have 18 classrooms in a school, and they are averaging 25 \nstudents per classroom, and you want to bring it down to 20 students \nper class or 18 students per class? How many more classrooms do you \nhave to build? How many more teachers do you have to hire? How much \nmore air-conditioning and structure and upkeep is required? I am just \nsaying, we do not know enough to mandate that. That is all.\n  I know the polling numbers look good. You go out and ask the American \npeople: What would you like to do about schools? You give them a bunch \nof choices, one being: Reduce class size. They say: Yes, I would like \nto reduce class size.\n  Before I looked at these numbers, I would have thought there would be \na much greater correlation between smaller class size and learning in a \nclassroom than there apparently is shown by all the statistical data.\n  I am just saying, we do not need to be reacting to polling data. We \ndo not need to run a poll and ask what is the No. 1 idea somebody might \nhave to improve education, and then do only that, after looking at the \nnumbers and finding out that might not be the best approach.\n  Of course, teacher quality is something about which Senator Mack and \nothers have been talking. How can we nurture that? I taught 1 year in a \nsixth grade class in the public schools of Alabama. My wife taught a \nnumber of years. Our kids have gone through schools in the State and \nhad a good experience. My two daughters graduated from a major public \nhigh school in the city of Mobile. We have been to the PTA meetings at \nMurphy High School. We named our dog Murphy. We loved our high school \nand participated in it. My daughters were editors of The Annual. They \nalso attended other schools in the city. We were involved in that.\n  We want to see the quality of education improve, but it is not always \nwhat somebody might say in response to a polling question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 15 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, with regard to the quality of teachers, \nthat is where we need to focus. Senator Mack has offered this amendment \nas a breakthrough to try to have some merit pay. I am telling you, I \nhave taught. My wife has taught. We have been active in schools. \nEverybody who knows anything about education, who has had children in \nschool, knows that some teachers give so much more and are so much more \nvaluable than others who have maybe lost their enthusiasm or just do \nnot have the capability. That is quite clear.\n  To say to those exceptional teachers, who are being sought by high-\ntech computer companies and chemical firms, that we cannot pay them any \nmore money, that they have to receive the exact same pay as somebody \nwho does not perform as well, is not good policy, not if we care about \nlearning.\n  But if we care about bureaucracy, if we care about the educational \nestablishment in Washington--if we care about that --if that is who is \njerking our chain, then we do not give more pay to people who do \nbetter, then we do not give more pay to people who give their heart and \nsoul to it, as I know they do.\n  I have been a member of a supper club in the city of Mobile for a \nlong time, over 25 years. Three of those people are full-time career \nteachers. I know how hard they work. I know how concerned they are for \ntheir children. Some teachers are just not that way.\n  So why is that proposal so threatening? It would not be mandated. It \nwould allow a certain amount of this money to be used for special merit \npay. What is wrong with allowing a school system to do that? I think \nthat is an important matter. I am delighted that amendment has been \noffered. It will be adopted and become law. We need to do that.\n  According to a Fordham Foundation study called ``Better Teachers: \nBetter Schools,'' we know that if students have teachers who have \ncollege degrees and have been specifically certified to teach math, \nthose students score significantly higher on standardized tests than if \nthe teacher did not have those credentials.\n\n  Why shouldn't we pay more? Do you know what we do for the military? \nWe are finding we need pilots, so we give them special bonuses to \nreenlist. We find we need special skills in certain computer areas, so \nwe are allowing the military to pay more money for that.\n  How are we going to keep math teachers who are in such demand in the \nprivate sector today, if they are exceptionally well trained and \ncapable? How can we deny them any additional pay when we need them so \ndesperately in the schools?\n  I think we ought to look at that and improve on that.\n  The Fordham study also points out that approaches focusing on inputs, \ncourses taken, time requirements met, time spent, and activities \nengaged in, rather than on outputs, student achievement, how they are \nlearning, and what their scores are on tests, are counterproductive.\n  Do you see what that is saying? That is saying we should not put our \nmoney just on going through the motions of education. We should not \ninvest our money in that. What we need to do is identify the kind of \neducation in which learning occurs, where students are improving in \ntheir knowledge and support that--output, not input, issues.\n  So if our bill were to pass and become Federal law, we would begin to \nfocus on the outputs of academic achievement by poor students because \nESEA is primarily focused on the poor, low-income schools and low-\nincome students instead of focusing on inputs.\n  The Teacher Empowerment Act--and Senator Gregg will speak about \nthat--\n\n[[Page S3475]]\n\nis so important in that regard. I will mention one more point, and I \nsee the Senator from Oklahoma is prepared to speak.\n  Let me mention this. I have been in, as I said, 15 schools, and I am \nfamiliar with public schools in this country. I will tell you, one of \nthe most significant problems we face is the ability of teachers to \ndiscipline children. They have been denied that by lawyers--Federal \nrules and regulations--and it is disrupting the classrooms and making \nit difficult to teach.\n  I have a stack of probably 40 letters here, some of which would break \nyour heart, from teachers who tell me stories. I intend to read some of \nthem before the debate is over, perhaps a lot of them. I want people to \nhear what is happening in schools in America today. You may say it is \nthe teacher's fault. What we will find out is that a lot of the reasons \nthey can't maintain discipline in school is because of Federal law, \nwhat we do here under the Disability Act. We were supposed to fund 40 \npercent of the cost of that when the law was mandated; we were supposed \nto pay 40 percent. The truth is that the Federal Government now is \npaying 11 percent of the cost. Yet it is a full mandate on our schools \nin America.\n  Schools have met the challenge. They are doing what we tell them to \ndo, at a great cost. We had the superintendent of a school system in \nVermont testify at an education hearing that 20 percent of his school \nsystem costs--20 percent at least--was focused on disability students. \nWe have gone beyond what we meant by that.\n  Originally, our goal was to make sure that children who were deaf, \nblind, or in a wheelchair would be allowed to participate fully, \nmainstreaming them in the classrooms in America. I certainly support \nthat.\n  What has happened now is under the Federal regulation, children \ndeclared disabled are not allowed to be disciplined, and the children \nare learning this; they know it. It is really a problem, which these \nletters will show.\n  Unfortunately, it has now been twisted beyond its original intent. \nTeachers and principals are faced with regulations and laws that must \nbe utilized before a disruptive or even violent child may be removed \nfrom a classroom--even for a short period. We should not continue these \nkinds of rules and regulations that keep schools from dealing with \ndisruptive, aggressive, violent, gun-toting students.\n  I have continually received complaints about the problem in every \nschool I go to. They say it is the No. 1 problem with the Federal \nGovernment. My friend, David Whetstone, in Baldwin County--and I have \nknown Dave for a long time from when I was a former U.S. Attorney and \nState attorney general. He came to Washington personally to talk to me \nabout this story. We discussed a case which received national attention \nin both Time Magazine and on ``60 Minutes,'' in which a student was \ndescribed as the ``meanest kid in Alabama.''\n  My friend, Dave Whetstone, told me of the circumstances in which this \nviolent, disruptive young man was kept in the classroom under these \nFederal laws. I want to tell you what happened to this young man and \nsee if you don't understand why teachers and principals are concerned \nabout what we do here.\n  The school had to assign an aide to this young man because he was \ndeclared emotionally conflicting. That is a disability, apparently. He \nhad to stay with him all day long throughout the school day. The aide \nwould get on the schoolbus with him in the morning, sit with him in \nclass all day, and go home on the schoolbus at the end of the day \nbecause of his disruptive behavior. The aide had to be paid by the \nschool board, of course, and the taxpayers of the community. Can you \nimagine what it was like being a teacher in that situation? The student \nused curse words in class on a regular basis and to the principal on a \nregular basis and was continuously disruptive. But our Federal law \nsaid, basically, he had to stay in the classroom.\n\n  Eventually, the young man was going home one afternoon on the \nschoolbus and reportedly attacked the bus driver. When the aide tried \nto restrain him, he attacked the aide.\n  My friend, the prosecutor, brought a creative legal action against \nthe student to try to stop it. He was shocked to find out that was a \nlaw in the public schools of America. He found that there were at least \nsix other students in that one school system with the same type \nproblems.\n  I have received letters from experienced educators all over the State \nof Alabama expressing their concern about this Federal regulation.\n  Let me mention a few other experiences. None of these come from the \nsame school. This is a quote from a letter:\n\n       We have a student who is classified emotionally conflicted, \n     learning disabled, and who has Attention Deficit Disorder. \n     While this student has been enrolled, students, teachers and \n     staff have been verbally threatened with physical harm. Fits \n     of anger, fighting, and outbursts of verbal abuse have been \n     commonplace. Parents and students have expressed concern over \n     the safety of their children due to the behavior of the young \n     man. Teachers have also become extremely apprehensive toward \n     the presence of the student due to his explosive behavior. \n     His misbehavior has escalated to the point that the \n     instructional process of the entire school has been \n     jeopardized.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       I have taught for 25 years. I plan to continue teaching, \n     but the problems with discipline are getting out of hand. We \n     are not allowed to discipline certain students. Any student \n     labeled as ``special needs'' must be accommodated, not \n     disciplined. A student recently brought a gun to my school. \n     He made threats to students and teachers, which he claimed \n     were jokes. I was one of the teachers.\n\n  The teacher was threatened with a gun.\n\n       This student has been disruptive and belligerent since I \n     first encountered him in the ninth grade. Now he is a senior. \n     After bringing a gun to school, he was given another ``second \n     chance.'' He should have been expelled. What was his \n     handicap? He has had problems with mathematics. While this \n     may be an extreme situation, it is not isolated. Teachers are \n     told to handle discipline in the classroom. The Government \n     has taken most of the teachers' rights away, our hands are \n     tied.\n\n  Talk to teachers. Many special education teachers have told me that \nthe discipline proceedings are going to drive them out of the \nprofession. I believe it will be a tragedy if we lose proven, dedicated \nteachers because of shortcomings of a Federal law that is not \nfulfilling its purpose.\n  That is not the purpose of the Disabilities Act--to keep violent, \ndisruptive kids in the classroom when they are disrupting the teacher's \nability to teach and learning isn't occurring. This is not restricted \nto any State; it is all over the country. That is why in the past, \nSenators Ashcroft, Frist, Gorton, and others have worked hard to end \nthis problem. We must continue to do so.\n\n  Mr. President, I know others would like to speak at this time. There \nis so much that we need to talk about. I would like to, and will, share \nin a few minutes, perhaps, a letter from a young teacher in an \nelementary school class who talks about the day she walked out of that \nclassroom, walked through the parking lot, got in her car, never to \nreturn--because of this kind of stuff. It is happening. We need to put \nan end to it, and we can do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me address something \nthat the Senator from Alabama was talking about. He gave so many good, \nconcrete examples of the discipline problem we have in our public \nschool system. It is a very real thing. I appreciate him bringing this \nup and the fact that we know why we are having this, with all the \nmandates and requirements.\n  I want to tell you a story. You talk about the discipline problems. I \nwant to give a concrete example of how one ended up in doing a great \ndisservice to the children of Oklahoma and other places.\n  I have kind of a unique situation at home. I have a wife and two \ndaughters, all three of whom teach or have taught. My wife taught back \nin the fifties, when we were first married. As our four children were \ngrowing up, I remember so well the youngest one--I call her the runt of \nmy litter--Katie, always wanted to be a schoolteacher just like her \nmom, and her mom's discipline was accelerated math.\n  So Katie was in school. She got her degree and got her master's in \nmath education. She is really an accomplished teacher, because she \nloves the kids. She was active in Young Life because she liked to be \naround troubled\n\n[[Page S3476]]\n\nkids and help them with their problems. When someone is a dedicated \nperson like that, that means they are a much better educator.\n  To make a very long story short, little Katie had wanted to teach the \nsame thing her mother did. When she finally got all of her degrees, she \ncame to the school where her mother taught and where Katie and her \nbrothers and sisters all went to school. After she got the job, it \nwasn't only that she got a job in the same school as her mother, but \nshe taught the same course in the same school in the same classroom \nthat her mother had taught in 30 years before. She was rejoicing. It \nhad just been a few years before that that she had gone through that \nschool.\n  She taught there for 4 years, and she came to me one day literally in \ntears. She said, ``Daddy, I feel like a traitor because I have to leave \nto go to another school district.'' I said, ``Why? This is where your \nmother taught. This is where you went to school. Our whole family went \nto school there. It is a tradition.'' She said, ``I teach math, and the \nkids are so disruptive and not listening. There is no discipline. When \nyou send them to the principal's office, the principal says, `Our hands \nare tied. We can't do anything about it.' '' So it continues. \nConsequently, these kids are not getting an education.\n  This is in the fourth week of the beginning of the school term. She \nsaid, ``I told the kids, `If you do not get the basics right now at the \nbeginning of the school term, you are going to fail the class.' They \nall shrugged their shoulders in unison, and said, `We don't care.' '' \nAnd the parents didn't care. There is no way that the school was going \nto discipline those children.\n  Katie quit. She went to a private school. She is now involved in \nteaching and is an accomplished teacher. The public school system lost. \nI am a prejudiced daddy. I admit that. But they lost one who is \nconsidered by the parents and fellow teachers and certainly students as \none of the best math teachers that taught, including my wife, in that \nschool. It is all for one reason: There is no discipline.\n  That is what local emphasis is all about. I think we can untie the \nhands of the local school districts and let them do it. On the bill we \nare considering today, I would like to go further with vouchers in \ngetting into more choice. But this is certainly a good personal first \nstep.\n  I would like to mention one other thing before the Senator from \nAlabama leaves the room because I want to make one comment about a \nprogram that works and one that we are going to try to change and get \nfully implemented. That is called impact aid.\n  I know the Senator from Alabama is interested in this because Alabama \nwould qualify for $12 million of impact aid. Last year they got $2.4 \nmillion. They are at 20 percent of where they should be.\n  Impact aid is a Federal program that really works. By and large, it \nis not something that is giving something to somebody. It says to go \nthe Federal Government, you have come in here with your military \ninstallations, with your Indian reservations, or any other Federal type \nof program, and because of that those lands on which you are working \nare off the tax rolls. So there is no property tax coming in. Yet while \nyou are doing that you have brought in with you a large number of \nchildren. Those children have to be educated in our educational system. \nYet there is no funding there to offset the cost of not being able to \ncollect revenues from those lands that are on various installations. \nThis as one of the rare programs we can talk about that is not just \nsomething good for students, but it is an obligation that we have to \nthese students. Oklahoma, I might add, is in a very similar situation.\n\n  What we are proposing in a letter that we encourage people to sign, \nand which the Senator from Alabama has already signed, is that we need \nto phase in full funding for impact aid. Over a 4-year period of time, \nwe start with 6 percent. Then we move on up until we have 100 percent.\n  This is a program that I think of as a moral responsibility to keep \nour word with local school districts because when we don't do that the \namount of money they have to spend to educate that child is taken away \nfrom other programs such as computers and teacher-pupil ratios. This is \nsomething I think is an obligation and something that we should strive \nfor. Hopefully, we can get the language in here.\n  I don't care if it ends up being an entitlement, as much as I hate to \nsay that. This is a responsibility that we have.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as the Senator knows and as I \nunderstand, the Government said it desires to fully fund this. It is \nnot meeting the commitment that it made. Is that correct?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In terms of the overall education budget, it is small \nin cost. But for those schools impacted, it is a very big deal for \nthem.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership. I think this is an important \nissue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is a big deal, because in my State of Oklahoma there \nour five major military installations. I hear from people all the time \nin Lawton, OK, and Fort Sill. Of course, we have a very large number of \nchildren who are being educated in the public school system, but there \nis no money coming from the tax base. This is a Government \ninstallation.\n  The local districts sometimes have ideas that are better than those \nideas emanating from Washington. I will share one personal experience. \nI can remember many years ago when I was in the State legislature; I \nmade it a practice to always come back to Tulsa from where we met when \nthe kids had some kind of a function, a school play or something. I \nremember coming in one time and seeing my oldest son, Jimmy. At that \ntime he was in the fourth grade. He was beaming. He said, ``Dad, guess \nwhat?'' He said, ``You know I am in the fourth grade.'' I said, ``Yes. \nI know that, son.'' He said, ``Guess what. In reading I am in the fifth \ngrade.'' I said, ``How in the world did that work?'' He said, ``It is a \nbrand new, something that has never been tried before. But they are \ntaking me at the level where I am because I am better than the rest of \nthe fourth graders. So I am in the fifth grade.''\n  I thought back to when I was in grade school. I went to a little \ncountry schoolhouse where they had a wood-burning stove in the middle \nof the room. There were eight rows of seats and eight grades. I was in \nthe first row because I was in the first grade. My brother was in the \nsecond row because he was in the second grade. My sister was in the \neighth row because she was in the eighth grade. We had one school \nteacher. I think back now and wonder if he was really the giant that I \nremember.\n  When you needed discipline, as the Senator from Alabama was talking \nabout--at that time they had a great big board. If you messed up, you \nwere disciplined the right way. Anyway, when they would teach the \nclasses, they would line you up. I would go with the first graders. In \nspelling, for example, when you missed a spelling word, you had to go \nup there and get a swat on the rear with this great big paddle. I have \nto tell you that I was a very good speller. I was in the third row. \nThat taught me a lesson.\n  So I thought about that program that Jimmy talked about. This \nprobably happened 30 years before then. It was a brandnew and \ninnovative program. Programs that emanate from the Federal Government \nare not always the right ones.\n  We need to unshackle the hands of the teachers, the parents, and the \nlocal school districts to give them greater flexibility and greater \nopportunity to do a better job of teaching our children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, from our side we have had a good \ndiscussion of the Abraham amendment. We had a brief discussion, but I \nthink a good exchange, on the second-degree amendment with regard to \nthe best way to provide incentives that will have a direct result in \nenhancing academic achievement and accomplishment for students. We are \nunder the strong impression, based upon the best experience and the \nrecord to date, that is the best way to go.\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\n  Of course, as we all know, the 93 cents out of every dollar spent \nlocally is within the domain of the State. If the Governors want to go \nahead with a program outlined by the Senator from Michigan, they will \nstill be able to do it. While the legislation represents a small \npercentage of the dollars that will be expended, at least on our side, \nwe feel very strongly we want included in the legislation, programs \nthat are tried, true, and tested and have had a sound record of \nperformance. That is expressed by our second-degree amendment.\n  We are prepared to move toward the consideration of the Murray \namendment that dealt with the class size. I think it is appropriate \nfollowing this discussion on teachers. As I mentioned earlier today, of \nthe $2 billion from S. 2, the Republican teacher proposal, $1.3 billion \nof that comes from the class size program which they effectively \neliminated. Mr. President, $300 million is from the Eisenhower math and \nscience program which is in existence now, which I think is a pretty \ngood program. They are ending that program. They are only adding some \n$300 million to do all of the things they talked about in terms of \nenhancement of academic achievement for teachers and teacher support. \nThis is in contrast to the amount we are proposing on the Democrat \nside, $3.75 billion, that we have outlined in the debate and discussion \nyesterday.\n  We hoped we would be able to go ahead with the Murray class \namendment. We are prepared after that to move to the Lieberman \nproposal. There aren't any real surprises in the Lieberman proposal. \nSenator Lieberman and others have outlined that in considerable detail. \nThe language has been passed over to the other side. We wanted to go on \ngiving the Senate the option to be able to consider the alternatives in \nS. 2 just on the teacher programs, both the recruitment and mentoring, \nand the academic enhancement and achievement for teachers. We wanted \nalso to have a good debate on the proposal of Senator Harkin on \nmodernization of our schools. We wanted to debate the afterschool \nprograms. We wanted to debate the excellent proposal of Senator \nMikulski on the digital divide. We wanted to debate our strong \naccountability proposal of Senator Bingaman.\n  There are no real mysteries about where we are. I imagine we will get \nan opportunity to talk about safety and security in schools. There is \nvery little surprise about the programs and our amendments.\n  We understand we want to go back and forth, but we are quite prepared \nto move ahead. We have been virtually free of any quorum calls since \nthis legislation was laid down. That is rare. On Monday, we had seven \nspeakers from our side, seven speakers from the other side. We went \nuntil almost quarter to 7, starting debate at 1 o'clock, and free from \nany quorum calls. That was true Tuesday evening and yesterday as well \nand has been true up until now. We are getting close to 2 o'clock. We \nare not in tomorrow. On this side we are prepared to get into debates \nand discussions on these items. They are at the heart of education \nreform. They have been demonstrably effective in helping and assisting \nthe schoolchildren of this country.\n  I listened to my colleagues before 1 o'clock talking about all of the \nchallenges we are facing educating children in underserved areas--all \nof which is true. What I didn't hear is how they believe they felt \ntheir bill would solve it. That is the question. Everyone can come to \nthe floor and talk about the challenges we are facing with children in \nunderserved areas. We all understand that. But when I hear time after \ntime, speech after speech, we have a problem out there and we have to \ndo something about it, I think it is beginning to sound empty.\n  Generally speaking, we identify a problem and we try to identify the \nsolution to the problem. That is not being done here. The reason it is \nnot being done is because the Republican proposal is basically a blank \ncheck, a block grant to the Governors.\n  When we find out we don't have well-qualified teachers, what is the \nanswer? Blank check to the Governor. We have trouble and difficulty in \novercrowded classrooms and we have dilapidated schools. What is the \nanswer? Blank check to the Governor. We have new technologies that are \ncoming down the pipe, and we want to make sure we will have a balance, \nthat we are not going to get into a digital divide using technologies \nthat will separate the haves and the have-nots in our schools. What is \ntheir answer? Give it to the Governor.\n  We have tried that before and we have not gotten very satisfactory \nanswers. We have not gotten satisfactory answers in the time from 1965 \nfrom 1970 when we had block grants. We found how the money was diverted \nfor football uniforms and band uniforms and swimming pools, for a wide \nrange of different kinds of activities that were distant and remote and \nunrelated to children who had very important needs.\n  We had the other side, with all due respect, that took the position, \nas we started off in the 1990s, that the best answer in solving these \nproblems is to close down the Department of Education. That was their \nposition: We do not want any Federal participation. We do not want any \npartnership. Close it down. That was their position in the early 1990s. \nThat, and the rescission of funding that had been appropriated and \nsigned into law by the President of the United States during that time.\n  I, for one, as I have said a number of times on the floor, I think \nmost parents would agree, that at every single meeting the President of \nthe United States has with his Cabinet, there is going to be someone \nthere who is going to say to the President: What about education for \nthe children of this country? When they are going to be meeting at the \nCabinet table and deciding priorities in the expenditure of our $1.8 \ntrillion, you want someone there who says: What about education, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The Republicans do not want that voice in the room because they do \nnot want any Federal participation on that. That has been their \nhistoric position.\n  Now we have the time to have this debate. As others reminded us, we \ndo not do it every year. We do it every 5 or every 6 years. We are \nhaving this debate now, just after the turn of the century. What is \ntheir answer? Instead of no more Department of Education, instead of \ncutting back even more in terms of the education budget, they say let's \ngive it all to the States. Let's give it all to the States and let them \nmake a judgment about it, virtually free from much accountability. All \nStates have to do to get the money is to have an application and \ngeneral outline of what the State intends to do to enhance educational \nquality. Then there is a long list of things that can be included in \nthat effort. But also included are the words ``for any educational \npurpose.'' Who decides that? The Governor decides that.\n  This is their ``Uses of Funds Under the Agreement.''--Funds that may \nbe available to a State under this part shall be used for educational \npurposes.\n  Every Governor can just make a decision that this is for educational \npurposes and then they are not accountable until after 5 years. Then \nthere has to be a finding by the Secretary of Education that they have \nnot made substantial progress in the area of education.\n  So their position is: Blank check, block grant, give it to the \nStates, let the Governors do whatever they do. That in spite of the \nextraordinary record of the efforts of serious Governors, Republicans \nand Democrats alike, in the period of the 1980s and the 1990s, who said \nwhat we have a responsibility for is for the underserved schools in our \nStates. There were eloquent calls for action by the Governors \nthemselves. The National Governors' Conference, time in and time out, \nwe found were asking for it, going back to 1986.\n  Governors Alexander and Clinton and Keene and Riley, urging they give \ngreater focus and attention to underperforming schools and districts, \nand that States take over the academically bankrupt districts. Those \nwere speeches being made in 1986. I am glad to hear they are being made \nby our Republican friends now.\n  Then, in 1987, 9 States had authority to take over, annex \neducationally deficient schools--only 9 out of 50. The call went out \nagain in 1990, and again in 1998. The National Governors' Association \npolicy: Support the State focus on schools, reiterating the position \nfirst\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\ntaken in 1988 in the National Governors' policy:\n\n  The States should have the responsibility for enforcing \naccountability and including clear penalties in cases of sustained \nfailure to improve student performance.\n  Now we find there are 20 States that provide assistance to low-\nperforming schools; 18 States apply some type of schoolwide sanction \nout of those 20. Now we have 20 States. It will take another 50 years, \nif we were going to get all the States to do what 20 States are doing \nnow. But that is not good enough. Our Republican friends say give the \nmoney to the States, in spite of the facts. You have the record about \nwhat the deficiency has been at the gubernatorial level.\n  There are some notable exceptions, Republicans and Democrats alike. \nWe are glad to recognize it. We pointed some of those out during the \ndebate. But that has been the record. They have not measured up, done \nthe job; they have not taken that responsibility.\n  We are not prepared, with the scarce resources here, to try to turn \nthat over to the Governors one more time and expect they are going to \ndo the job. No. We are going to insist that there will be incentives \nand disincentives for performance. That is what we do.\n  As I mentioned, whether you are talking about dedicating resources to \nturning around schools--in our particular program we have the resources \nto be able to do that. We make sure we are going to allocate scarce \nfunds that each year are going to be set aside that can be utilized and \nwill be effective in turning around failing schools. The schools are \ngoing to have to show annual gains for student performance.\n  We are to the point where we are going to insist there will be a \nreport card that is given to every parent in this country about how \ntheir child's school is doing, every year. I think parents would like \nto know how their child's school is doing. We are guaranteeing that.\n  We asked our good friends on the other side how their bill is going \nto solve the issue of accountability. They cannot do it. We have been \nchallenging them since the beginning of the debate. They cannot do it. \nWe can. We are glad to go through these various provisions we have \noutlined about the assurance of real accountability of failing schools. \nIf they fail, there are real consequences. After a period of time they \nare closed down. There is a whole new leadership for those schools if \nthey are going to be reopened. Otherwise there is support for the \nchildren to go to other schools.\n  We also have a strong commitment to try to reach out to those \nchildren who are so often left out and left behind. We are talking \nabout the homeless children. We have over a million homeless children \nin this country. We have over 700,000 children who are migrant \nchildren, who travel through this Nation at the various harvest times. \nThere is a similar number of immigrant children who eventually are \ngoing to be American citizens. It is in our interest that they get \neducated. It is in our interest that they get educated, not cast aside.\n  Now, what does this Republican bill do? What it does is eliminate all \nthose kinds of protections which have been out there now, guaranteeing \nthose needy students are going to have their interests addressed. It \nsends the money back to the States, which prior to 1987 had not given \nthose populations their attention.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor. If he wishes to address the \nSenate, I will be glad to withhold.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to wait until the Senator completes his \nremarks. I was going to try to bring the Chamber up to date on our hope \nof how to proceed. Senator Daschle is here.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will withhold.\n  Mr. LOTT. We are not ready to do that at this moment because we have \nto be sure everybody accedes, and so I will be glad to withhold.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. At any time the majority leader wants to propound the \nconsent request, I will be glad to yield.\n  I wanted to read the 1987 report. In March of 1987, the Center for \nLaw and Education sent a questionnaire regarding State practices and \npolicies for homeless students to the chief State offices in the 50 \nStates and the District of Columbia, and received 23 responses. The \nmajority of the respondents, however, had no statewide data, so out of \nthe 50, you got 23, and out of the 23, the majority had no statewide \ndata on the number of homeless children within their jurisdiction, or \nwhether these children were able to obtain an education.\n  The majority of States had no uniform plan for ensuring homeless \nstudents received an education--the poorest of the poor. Can those who \nwant to give this money directly to the States tell us about programs \nthat had been developed by the States prior to 1987? I have searched. I \nhave looked. I cannot find them. Why? Because they were not a priority \nbecause they did not vote. Children do not vote, and the parents did \nnot vote. We know the reasons, and that has been true with migrant and \nimmigrant students as well.\n  As for the homeless children, we made marginal increases in the \nenhancement of those programs annually during the appropriations \nprocess, but we maintain our commitment. I wish we could be out here in \na bipartisan way trying to find ways to strengthen these programs, to \nhelp those kids, to find out how we can be more effective. But oh, no, \ndo my colleagues know what we are going to do? We are going to take \nthose three programs, which is millions of dollars, and instead of \ncontinuing to target the homeless and neediest children, we are going \nto send that money to the Governors, to the State capitals to let them \ndecide whether they want to be bothered by this.\n  The record is very clear: They have not historically, and there is \nlittle indication that they will today. If one looks over what is being \nallocated at the State level versus what the Federal Government is \ndoing with programs in these areas, one will find they are begrudging \nsupport for these programs. There are certain exceptions, and we are \nalways glad for that.\n  We enable students in failing schools to transfer to higher-quality \nschools. We say you cannot use more than 10 percent of the title I \nmoney for transportation. We let the local communities make the \njudgment of what they will do. Under the Republican bill, there is \nabsolutely no cap. They can use the whole title I program for \ntransportation.\n  On accountability, we find there continues to be a deficiency.\n  I will take a couple of minutes to go through the merit pay issue \nagain and our particular proposal. Since we knew this was coming up, we \ntried to find out what different States have done and what has been \nsuccessful.\n  We were reminded by the Senator from Georgia about a merit pay \nprogram that Secretary Riley instituted. It cost the State of South \nCarolina $100 million, and it was abandoned. I am sure my friend from \nGeorgia does not realize it was abandoned. Probably those last words or \nlast couple of sentences were missing in his presentation. They have \nswitched to more of a school-based program.\n  In looking over the use of merit pay incentives for teachers across \nthe country, one of the most successful has been in Dallas, TX. In \n1991-1992, they implemented one of the most sophisticated \naccountability systems in the Nation. The centerpiece of it was that \nall staff in schools which increased student achievement received \nmonetary awards. A 1996 study found when the scores were evaluated \nagainst the comparable school districts, the Dallas program had a very \npositive impact on test results. That is our amendment--schoolwide, \nwith regard to that aspect.\n  In North Carolina, a State in which great progress has been made in \neducation--I do not know why, but when we find out that some things \nwork, as in the State of North Carolina, we do not try to share that \nwith other parts of the country. We have tried to do that in this \nlegislation.\n  North Carolina, in 1997, implemented its incentive program for whole \nschool merit programs, and the legislature recently budgeted $75 \nmillion for the awards. More schools met their performance goals than \nexpected. The second year required $125 million rather than scale back \nthe level of the award. The legislature increased the budget to \nincrease this successful program. It is working. We have no problem \nwith our friend from Michigan on this type of merit pay program, but \nlet's get it correct.\n\n[[Page S3479]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. First, I commend Senator Kennedy for his comments. The \nalternative of rewarding schools as opposed to individual teachers is a \nvery sound way of approaching this--the team environment, the team \neffort.\n  I find it somewhat ironic that the authors of S. 2 want to have the \nFederal Government stop dictating to the States and communities how the \n7 cents on the dollar the Federal government provides for education is \ngoing to be used, yet in this amendment they have offered, they ask \nthat this body to decide what certification or merit pay will be \nprovided for teachers across the country. What works best is a decision \nthat ought to be left to the States or the local communities. For the \nSenate to go on record to decide what will work best in the 50 States \nis in direct contradiction to the arguments I hear being made in \nsupport of the underlying bill, and that is: We do not know what we are \ndoing here; we ought to leave this up to the local governments. Now we \nare going to decide, apparently, that teachers ought to get a pay \nincrease rather than leaving that decision to the local level. It seems \nthey have it backwards. Those decisions are best left at the local \nlevel.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts has accurately pointed out, in \nState after State where it has been tried--it is not as if it has not \nbeen tried--it has not worked very well.\n  Instead of disregarding what is occurring at the local level, why not \ngive them the chance in this area to decide what works best instead of \ntrying to micromanage the pay or compensation of teachers based on some \ntest that, as the Senator from Massachusetts said, would pit one \nagainst the other.\n  As he pointed out, there was an effort in Fairfax County, VA, to try \nthis scheme. Maybe the Senator from Massachusetts can tell me again \nwhat was the experience in Fairfax, VA. They tried merit pay as a way \nto improve student performance, and what were the results of that \nexperiment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. They dropped that after a \nvery short period of time because it was so ineffective in the outcomes \nfor the students.\n  Mr. DODD. When they dealt with teacher merit pay for the whole school \nin New Haven--I gather it was New Haven, California, not New Haven, \nConnecticut----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. What was the experience there? Did the entire school \nbenefit?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There was a dramatic outcome in one of the poorest \ncommunities in California where they had schoolwide summer programs and \nthey took all of the teachers--500 teachers--and gave bonuses to the \nwhole school as the academic achievement went up. They also supported \nteachers if they wanted to obtain professional development or work \ntowards advanced degrees. Finally, they gave encouragement for \nrecertification, which is a very rigorous program of examination by \nsenior teachers and review of the skills and talents of these teachers. \nBut most of all, they gave support for the classes and the schools that \nwere increasing academic achievement. It went from one of the poorest \nschools, in terms of academic achievement, to one of the best in \nCalifornia in a period of 7 years.\n  Mr. DODD. Lastly, I ask my colleague, does he know of any example, in \nhis tenure in the Senate, where we have ever required merit pay for \nphysicians, attorneys, architects, or any other profession you can \nthink of? Has the Senate of the United States ever gone on record and \nsaid that as a condition of receiving Federal support, such as for \nhealth care plans or for legal issues, that we, as a matter of Federal \npolicy, would require, in those professions, that they be required to \nbe certified midcareer?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Quickly, my answer would be no. Secondly, I think that--\nperhaps the Senator would agree with me--if we are going to give some \nextra pay, perhaps those teachers who are working in these combat \nconditions in underserved areas, whether they are rural or urban areas, \nmight seem to be ones who could be deserving of it. That could be a \ndecision that is made by the State.\n  But what I want to mention to the Senator, is that the States can do \nwhat the Senator from Michigan is proposing today, out of their 93 \ncents.\n  Mr. DODD. Correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have challenged the proponents of this to give us one \nState that is doing an effective merit pay for individual teachers \nprogram. We have not heard one. It would be nice if they said, oh, we \nhave 15 States doing it and these are the results of it in academic \nachievement. They cannot give us one example.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague would yield, we have a number of former \nGovernors here, some of whom support this amendment. I wonder if when \nthey were Governors they supported this.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor. The minority leader and I \ncertainly yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for allowing us to \nproceed with what I think is a fair agreement on how to proceed for the \nremainder of the afternoon.\n  We have had good debate this week on both sides of the aisle. There \nis a difference of opinion. When we get our unanimous consent \nagreement, or when we get it propounded and hopefully get an agreement, \nI do want to comment on some of the things I have heard over the past \nhour during debate and on the pending Abraham-Mack amendment.\n  But I think, first, it is important we get an understanding and \nagreement on how to proceed. Basically, the consent we would like to \npropound would be that the pending second-degree amendment be laid \naside, and that Senator Murray be recognized to offer her amendment \nrelative to class size, with no second-degree amendments in order, that \nwe would ask consent for the votes to occur at 5 p.m. on the pending \namendments, and the time between now and that hour be equally divided, \nand the votes would occur on or in relation to the amendments in the \norder they would be offered or have been offered. That sequence, of \ncourse, is the Kennedy second-degree amendment, the Abraham-Mack \namendment, as amended, if amended, and then the Murray amendment.\n  Then we would ask consent that the next amendments in the sequence be \nbasically in the following order: Lieberman, as an alternative; Gregg, \nwith regard to Teachers' Bill of Rights; and McCain, regarding sports \ngambling.\n  We will see if we can get an agreement on that. If we cannot, then we \nwill modify it in a way we hope we can get an agreement.\n  That is basically how we would like to proceed this afternoon. I \nthink it is a fair way to proceed. We will be able to have another 2\\1/\n2\\ hours, hopefully, of good debate. Then we can have some votes.\n  Then we will have things lined up for debate on Monday. I hope that \nwe can get in several hours of debate on the amendments that would be \npending at that point--the Lieberman amendment, the Gregg Teachers' \nBill of Rights, and other education-related issues about which Senators \nmay want to talk. Then we would move toward votes on Tuesday and/or \nWednesday and Thursday, if necessary. That is basically the outline of \nhow we would like to proceed.\n  As soon as I hear further from Senator Daschle, we will propound that \nUC.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, then, that the pending \nsecond-degree amendment be laid aside and that Senator Murray be \nrecognized to offer her amendment relative to class size, and no \nsecond-degree amendments be in order. I further ask consent that votes \noccur at 5 p.m., with the time between now and then to be equally \ndivided, and that the votes occur on or in relation to the amendments \nin the order in which they were offered, with no second-degree \namendments in order.\n  The voting sequence is as follows: Kennedy, second-degree amendment; \nAbraham amendment, as amended, if amended; and then the Murray \namendment.\n  I further ask consent that following these votes, the next amendments \nin the sequence be the following, in the following order, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order prior to a vote on or in relation to \nthe amendments. They are as follows: The Lieberman amendment, which is \nan alternative; the\n\n[[Page S3480]]\n\nGregg amendment, dealing with Teachers' Bill of Rights; and the McCain \nsports-related gambling issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator McCain and I have discussed this \nmatter. I understand he will be here momentarily. But I indicated to \nhim that there might be an objection. We have now heard an objection. \nTherefore, I modify my consent to reflect the next two amendments be \nlimited to the Lieberman and Gregg amendments as outlined above.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nMissouri to withhold his objection, and in order for one other Senator \nto arrive, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to say again, if I didn't say \nit sufficiently a moment ago, that I appreciate Senator McCain's \ncooperation in agreeing for us to proceed even without an amendment he \nhad hoped to get in the next sequence. But there was objection to that. \nHe has agreed for us to proceed without an objection.\n  The same thing is true with Senator Ashcroft. He has had a chance to \nreview the situation. And our colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nhave had an opportunity to look at the substance of the amendment. \nThere are a number of Senators who have amendments they want to have \nconsidered. We hope as we go forward they will be in the lineup at some \npoint.\n  For now, we are just trying to get the rest of the afternoon agreed \nto and debate amendments that we will also be debating on Monday. Then \nwe will take it from there.\n  Mr. President, let me propound the unanimous consent request again \nand see if we can get it cleared at this point.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending second-degree amendment be \nlaid aside, that Senator Murray be recognized to offer her amendment \nrelative to class size, and that no second-degree amendments be in \norder.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that votes occur at 5 p.m. with the \ntime between now and then to be equally divided, and the votes occur on \nor in relation to the amendments in the order in which they were \noffered, with no second-degree amendments in order.\n  The voting sequence is as follows:\n  Kennedy second-degree amendment;\n  Abraham amendment, as amended, if amended;\n  Then the Murray amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following those votes the next \namendments in the sequence be the following, in the following order, \nwith no second-degree amendments in order prior to a vote on or in \nrelation to the amendments and the second-degree amendments must be \nrelevant to the first degree they propose to amend. They are as \nfollows:\n  Lieberman, which is an alternative;\n  Gregg, Teachers' Bill of Rights.\n  I believe that would be the request.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot, provided it is all right with the distinguished Senator from \nWashington State, would the leader be willing to amend that so I would \nbe allowed to proceed for 5 minutes just prior to the distinguished \nSenator from Washington State on an entirely unrelated matter not \nrequiring a vote or an amendment?\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I am not sure exactly when that would come.\n  Mr. President, we always try to accommodate Senators on both sides. \nBut let me just say I would like to amend the request beyond what we \nhave already asked to the effect that I be recognized to speak for 5 \nminutes to be followed by 5 minutes by Senator Leahy. I had been \nwaiting to try to respond to some of the things that had been said on \nthe debate before we reached this point. If I could just get 5 minutes \nfollowed by Senator Leahy, then we would go on with the regular order, \nif that is all right with Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will not ask for time. As the majority \nleader has indicated, this does not in any way reflect what we have \nattempted to do beyond this agreement. We have some amendments on \neither side. Senator Dodd has a very important afterschool amendment \nthat will come shortly after this lineup.\n  We also have Senator Bingaman, dealing with accountability; Senator \nHarkin on construction; Senator Mikulski on digital divide; and Senator \nDodd's amendment will likely come up after this agreement. I know there \nare Senators on the other side who will be in the mix as well. No one \nshould think this limits their ability to be heard and to offer their \namendments.\n  I appreciate very much the cooperation of everybody.\n  I will not object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to say \nI objected to the McCain amendment not because of the content of his \namendment, per se. He wants to bring up the NCAA college amendment at \nsome subsequent time. That is his privilege. That is part of the Senate \nbusiness.\n  One of the things I have tried to do, following the direction of the \nminority leader in consultation with the majority leader, is to keep \nthis debate on this education bill on education. We worked very hard on \nour side to keep other matters off this bill--Patients' Bill of Rights, \nprescription drugs, minimum wage, and all kinds of other things. I \ndon't want Senator McCain or anyone supporting Senator McCain's \namendment to think I am doing this simply because it deals with the \nNCAA. It is because we are trying to move this education bill along. At \nsome subsequent time on this bill or at some other time, if he offers \nthat, I will be prepared to do whatever is necessary to put my views \nforward. But I just want the Record to reflect that it is not because \nof the content of this amendment. It is just an attempt to move \neducation matters along with this bill.\n  I withdraw any objection I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Daschle, Senator \nReid, Senator Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, Senator Ashcroft, and Senator \nMcCain for their cooperation.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield for a second? I want to make sure the \nRecord reflects that I withdraw my objection as to this unanimous \nconsent and not the other ones propounded regarding Senator McCain.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, along the lines of what Senator Reid just \nsaid, both sides have been working to try to keep our amendments and \nour debate on the underlying bill, the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. This is a very important bill. Of course, its title is \nEducational Opportunities Act.\n\n  There is a lot that needs to be said. There is a lot that needs to be \ndone to make sure our education and elementary and secondary schools \nare improved, that it is quality education, that it is safe and drug \nfree.\n  We don't have to be out looking for amendments involving China, \nagriculture, or higher education, guns, prescription drugs, tax cuts, \nor anything of that nature, all of which may be or may not be \nmeritorious. We have plenty to do and plenty we need to think about to \nimprove, hopefully, elementary and secondary education.\n  I agree to an extent with what Senator Reid was saying. I appreciate \nhis cooperation and that of Senator McCain, who agreed to go along with \nthis request.\n  Let me respond in the broader sense to some of the things that have \nbeen said on this bill this afternoon. I have listened to the \ndiscussion by Senators. I think it is very important to note once and \nfor all that this is education opportunity--not for 1965, not for 1985 \nor 1987, because I have heard that date used in some of the debate \nearlier, and\n\n[[Page S3481]]\n\nnot even for 1995. This is about education in the new millennium. This \nis about how we improve the quality of education and how we improve the \nlearning of our children for the remainder of this century.\n  We know there are many indicators that show our children's education \nis not safe, that it is not drug free, that it is not improving in many \nareas. In fact, many test scores are static or declining.\n  We have to do something different. We are not debating 1956, we are \nnot debating what happened in 1985, and we certainly are not debating \nwhat happened in the early 1990s.\n  It has been alleged that all Republicans want to do is eliminate the \nDepartment of Education. Let me just make the Record clear why there \nare many of my colleagues who do not agree with me on this.\n  I am the son of a schoolteacher. I worked for a university, and I am \nnot for, nor have I ever been for, eliminating that Department. I stood \nin the House of Representatives and voted for its creation. The \nmajority leader and the Republican leader in the Senate certainly do \nnot have that position. Let's not talk about the past. It is prolog. \nThere have been good efforts. Some of them helped. Some of them didn't \nwork.\n\n  It is time we think a little differently. Education is in this box \nbecause there are certain groups in this country that say this is the \nway it is going to be, this is the way it has been, failed or \nsucceeded, and it is going to stay.\n  I don't agree with that. We have to start using some innovative \nconcepts. We have to have more flexibility. We must have more \naccountability. We must have results. It has to be child centered, as \nwe have been saying.\n  Some people say we must have mandates from Washington, DC; We know \nbest in Washington, DC, in the Senate and the bureaucrats at the \nDepartment of Education, many well-intentioned and good people.\n  I don't accept that. I have faith in the parents at the local level. \nI have faith in the teachers and the administrators, yes, in the State \ngovernments. So it happens that more Governors right now are Republican \nthan Democrat, but in the past the reverse has been true and test \nscores were not any better then. We have to try to find some solutions.\n  By the way, many of the good solutions in America for creating jobs, \nimproving education, charter schools, improving health care, are \nhappening in the States because we have given them a little more \nflexibility from the Washington level. My own State of Mississippi, \npoor though it is, just voted 2 weeks ago, and the Governor signed into \nlaw, a 5-year teacher pay increase to bring Mississippi up to the \nsoutheastern average. That is monumental legislation. It is a big \nfinancial commitment from a small, poor State. But they are doing the \njob. They are trying to make some progress with teacher pay raises. I \nknow certainly they deserve it.\n  It is time for a change in education. We have to do better. Our \nscores as parents and leaders are not what they should be for improving \neducation. If you want the status quo, go ahead and vote for title I, \ntitle II, all the programs as they are. Leave them as they are. I don't \nbelieve they are working the way they can; we don't give enough \ndiscretion as to how best to use them at the local level. If our \ndistricts and States are using them for pools, Heaven forbid, we should \nmake sure that does not happen.\n  We have thoughtful ideas and I think this Abraham-Mack amendment is a \ngood amendment. First of all, this amendment is optional. Shouldn't we \nencourage good teachers? Shouldn't we have merit pay for the really \ngood teachers? Shouldn't we encourage them? The alternative is, if the \noverall school does good and improves, give all teachers a pay raise. \nThat means that the worst of the worst get the pay raise along with \neverybody else, in spite of the job that he or she has done. That is \nnot the solution.\n  It is not a mandate. Again, it is a choice for the States and the \nlocal education agencies to pursue quality teaching, a very important \ncomponent in learning. It is optional.\n  Let me reframe the debate a little bit. I think there is fundamental \ndisagreement. However, I think the American people agree with the \napproach we are taking, an approach of more flexibility, more choice at \nthe State and local levels, accountability, encouraging quality \nteachers so that they won't leave teaching as my mother did after 19 \nyears. She didn't get rewarded when she did a good job or spent extra \ntime. She couldn't make a decent wage in that job.\n  I believe we have a good package. I commend the work. Let's continue \nto have debate on the amendments. I certainly hope the Kennedy \namendment is defeated and the Abraham-Mack amendment is passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for my clarification, I understand my \namendment is in order and the time between now and 5 o'clock is equally \ndivided, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3122\n\n           (Purpose: To provide for class reduction programs)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3122.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, classrooms across America are less \ncrowded today than they were a year ago, because this Congress made a \ncommitment to hiring new teachers to reduce classroom overcrowding.\n  The progress has been overwhelming. Today, 1.7 million students are \nin less crowded classrooms--where they can learn the basics in a \ndisciplined environment.\n  That is the type of progress we should continue. Unfortunately, this \nRepublican bill abandons our commitment to helping students learn in \nless crowded classrooms.\n  At a time when we should be ensuring that every student can benefit \nfrom an uncrowded classroom, this Republican bill makes no guarantee \nthat smaller classes will become a reality.\n  That is why I am on the floor today--to make sure that no student is \nstuck in an overcrowded classroom in grades 1-3.\n  I am offering an amendment which would authorize the class size \nreduction program in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  As a former teacher, I can tell you, it really makes a difference if \nyou have 18 kids in a classroom instead of 35--parents know it, \nteachers know it, and students know it. By working together over the \npast 2 years, we have been able to bring real results to students.\n  With the first year of class size reduction funding, we have been \nable to hire 29,000 teachers across the country. Approximately 1.7 \nmillion students across the country are learning in classrooms that are \nless crowded than they were the year before. The average class size has \nbeen reduced by more than five students in the grades where these funds \nhave been concentrated.\n  Forty-two percent of the teachers hired are teaching first grade. In \nthese schools, the average class size fell from approximately 23 to 17 \nstudents, 23 percent of the teachers are in 2nd grade, and 24 percent \nare in third grade. In both of these grades, the average class size, \nwhere these funds were used, dropped from 23 to 18 students. In \naddition, districts are using approximately 8 percent of this money to \nsupport professional development so we can have teachers of the highest \nquality.\n  Let me take a moment to share a list of some of the benefits of class \nsize reduction. Class size reduction produces better student \nachievement, something every Senator has been out here to say they \nsupport. It brings about fewer discipline problems. When there are \nfewer kids in your classroom you can maintain discipline; there is more \nindividual attention, better parent-teacher communication--an essential \nto a\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\nchild's education--and dramatic results for poor and minority students.\n  Those are some of the ways smaller classes help students reach their \npotential. Those are the results we should be giving all students in \nthe early grades. But today, there are still too many students in \novercrowded classrooms.\n  Today, the average classroom in grades 1-3 has 22 students in it, \nstudents who are fighting for the time and attention of just one \nteacher, students who might not get their questions answered because \ntheir classmates are creating disruptions, students who aren't learning \nthe basics.\n  Those students would be helped dramatically if we gave them a less \ncrowded classroom with a fully-qualified, caring teacher.\n  Go out into your local school districts and talk to any teachers, and \nI believe they will tell you classes are overcrowded. It is not easy \nfor local school districts to hire teachers on their own.\n  Believe me--I served on a local school board. This is one area where \nthe Federal partnership really makes a dramatic difference for \nstudents.\n  I understand, as a former school board member, the pressure the \nschool boards and others involved with the budget face in allocating \nscarce resources.\n  The pressure on how to spend these funds are immense, and in most \ndistrict budgets, there is not money to reduce class size.\n  The Federal funds for the purpose of reducing class size are \nincredibly important for supplementing district budget to address the \nclass size.\n  Let me share an example of how one of the districts in my State is \nusing these funds. The Tacoma School District in Washington State \nreceived a class size reduction grant of a little over $1 million, and \nthe district started a program called ``Great Start.'' That's one of \nthe best things about this program. School districts can use this money \nto meet the unique challenges their students face. We know that not \nevery school district is the same. We know that some schools need more \nhelp hiring teachers, and others need more help training teachers. That \nis why this program that we created 2 years ago is flexible.\n  So the educators in Tacoma decided they would focus the money on \nfirst grade. And, they decided that--in addition to reducing over-\ncrowded classrooms--they were going to make sure that those new \nteachers had the best strategies for helping students. They set clear \ngoals. For example, they set the goal that every student be able to \nread and write by the spring of their first grade year. They hired an \nadditional 20 fully-qualified new teachers. And the difference has been \ndramatic.\n  Today, as a result of this program, those classrooms have an average \nof just 16 students. Those students are now better able to learn the \nbasics with fewer discipline problems.\n  I am proud to say I have visited schools in Tacoma. I have seen the \ngreat strides those dedicated educators are making. But do not take my \nword for it. Listen to what one of the teachers wrote to me.\n  I received this letter from Rachel Lovejoy, a first grade teacher at \nWhittier Elementary School in Tacoma.\n  She writes:\n\n       I knew first graders could make great gains, and this year \n     they are.\n\n  Rachel is the type of teacher who goes out and visits every child's \nhome in August before the school year begins. She meets their family \nand learns about that student's unique needs and challenges.\n  As Rachel told me:\n\n       With 16 families, I can fit the visits into my room \n     preparation with greater ease. What a great start to building \n     that family atmosphere in my class.\n\n  Rachel tells me that because she has fewer students in each class she \nis better able to keep track of how each student is progressing.\n  Rachel also says there are fewer discipline problems in her classroom \ntoday:\n\n       It is much easier to build a familial, caring community in \n     the classroom with fewer children.\n\n  Rachel knows what makes a difference in the classroom, and she has a \nmessage for all of us about reducing class size:\n\n       The research is there. Accept no excuses. Gives us lower \n     class size and training, and let us do what we do best . . . \n     teach.\n\n  That is what we should be doing and that is what the amendment I am \noffering today does. It shows teachers like Rachel that we will stand \nwith them and help them create effective classrooms.\n  I was fortunate to receive a letter from Lori Wegner--the parent of \none of the students in Rachel Lovejoy's classroom. She writes:\n\n       With 16 children, Rachel is able to interact with each \n     child on an individual basis throughout each day. Rachel is \n     able to go above and beyond the basic requirements for \n     testing the students' achievements and focus on each child's \n     development in a way that is appropriate to the individual \n     child.\n\n  Lori closes her letter to me by saying:\n\n       Please give our teachers the opportunity to facilitate the \n     development of each individual student to their fullest \n     potential during these critical years of learning.\n\n  Not only do the parents and teachers in my community tell me it \nworks, but national research proves smaller class size helps students \nlearn the basics in a disciplined environment.\n  A study conducted in Tennessee in 1989, known as the STAR Study, \ncompared the performance of students in grades K-3 in small and \nregular-sized classes. This important study found that students in \nsmall classes--those with 13 to 17 students--significantly outperformed \nother students in math and reading. The STAR study found that students \nbenefitted from smaller classes at all grade levels and across all \ngeographic areas.\n  The study found that students in small classes have better high \nschool graduation rates, higher grade point averages, and they are more \ninclined to pursue higher education.\n  I repeat, students who are in smaller class sizes in first, second, \nand third grade have higher graduation rates, higher grade point \naverages, and are more inclined to go on to higher education. Isn't \nthat what all of us want?\n  According to research conducted by Princeton University economist, \nDr. Alan Kruger, students who attended small classes were more likely \nto take ACT or SAT college entrance exams, and that was particularly \ntrue for African American students.\n  According to Dr. Kruger:\n\n       Attendance in small classes appears to have cut the black-\n     white gap in the probability of taking a college-entrance \n     exam by more than half.\n\n  Three other researchers at two different institutions of higher \neducation found that STAR students who attended small classes in grades \nK-3 were between 6 and 13 months ahead of their regular class peers in \nmath, reading, and science in each of grades 4, 6, and 8.\n  In yet another part of the country, a different class-size reduction \nstudy reached similar conclusions. The Wisconsin SAGE Study--Student \nAchievement Guarantee in Education--findings from 1996 thru 1999 \nconsistently proved that smaller classes result in significantly \ngreater student achievement.\n  Class-size reduction programs in the SAGE study resulted in increased \nattention to individual students. This produced three main benefits:\n  No. 1, fewer discipline problems and more instruction,\n  No. 2, more knowledge of students, and No. 3, more teacher enthusiasm \nfor teaching.\n  The Wisconsin study also found that in smaller classes, teachers were \nable to identify the learning problems of individual students more \nquickly.\n  As one teacher participant in the SAGE class-size reduction study \nsaid:\n\n       If a child is having problems, you can see it right away. \n     You can take care of it then. It works a lot better for the \n     children.\n\n  Parents of children in smaller classes notice the difference as well. \nThe mother of a child who moved from a class of 23 students to a class \nof 15 students discovered that--she wrote this to me:\n\n       The smaller class makes it possible for the teacher to get \n     to know the kids a lot faster, so they can assess their \n     strengths and weaknesses right away and start working from \n     those points right away.\n\n  Discipline problems were also greatly reduced in smaller classes. One \nteacher said:\n\n       In a class of thirty students, you're always redirecting, \n     redirecting--spending most of your time redirecting and \n     disciplining kids where you're not getting as much \n     instructional time in.\n\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\n\n  Those are not my words, they are hers.\n  By contrast, another teacher said:\n\n       Having 15 [students], I'm so close to them. Generally, I \n     don't have to say a thing; I just look at them and they shape \n     up and get back to work . . . So I don't spend a lot of time \n     with discipline anymore.\n\n  The empirical support for smaller class size is compelling. Smaller \nclasses in SAGE schools produced high levels of classroom efficiency; a \npositive classroom atmosphere; expansive learning opportunities; and \nenthusiasm and achievement among both students and teachers. The SAGE \nstudy concluded that the main effect of smaller class size was greater \nstudent success in school.\n  Today we have the opportunity to authorize the class-size reduction \nprogram in this bill and ensure we do not abandon our school districts \nin their efforts to reduce class size, which have been so successful.\n  It is our opportunity to make a commitment to improving America's \npublic schools.\n  I am offering this class-size reduction amendment to give Members of \nthe Senate the opportunity to show parents, teachers and students that \nwe understand that it's important to reduce the class size.\n  My class size amendment will continue the progress we have made over \nthe past 2 years in dedicating funding to class-size reduction. It will \nbring us to a total of more than 43,000 fully qualified teachers \nnationwide.\n  Here are the specifics of my amendment:\n  This amendment would use $1.75 billion to reduce class size, \nparticularly in the early grades, grades 1 through 3, using fully \nqualified teachers to improve educational achievement for regular and \nspecial needs children.\n  It targets the money where it is needed within states.\n  Within States, 99 percent of the funds will be disbursed directly to \nlocal school districts on a formula which is 80 percent need-based, and \n20 percent enrollment-based.\n  Small school districts that alone may not generate enough Federal \nfunding to pay for a starting teacher's salary may combine funds with \nother dollars to pay the salary of a full or part-time teacher or use \nthe funds on professional development related to class size.\n  This amendment ensures local decision-making.\n  Each school district board makes all decisions about hiring and \ntraining new teachers. They decide what their needs are. They decide \nhow many teachers they want to hire. They decide which classrooms to \nfocus their efforts on. They decide what goals they want those students \nto reach. It is local decision making.\n  This amendment promotes teacher quality.\n  Up to 25 percent of the funds may be used to test new teachers, or to \nprovide professional development to new and current teachers of regular \nand special needs children.\n  The program ensures that all teachers are fully qualified.\n  School districts hire State certified teachers so students learn from \nfully trained professionals.\n  This amendment is flexible.\n  Any school district that has already reduced class size in the early \ngrades to 18 or fewer children may use funds to further reduce class \nsizes in the early grades; reduce class size in kindergarten or other \ngrades; or carry out activities to improve teacher quality, including \nprofessional development.\n  The flexibility for these funds is seen throughout my State.\n  In Washington, the North Thurston school district is using all of \ntheir funds to hire teachers to reduce class size. At the same time, \nthe Pomeroy school district, which is a rural district in eastern \nWashington, was able to use 100% of their funds to improve teacher \nquality through professional development. The Seattle school district \neven used a portion of their funding to recruit new teachers.\n  The Class-Size Program is simple and efficient. School districts fill \nout a one-page form, which is available on-line. Here is a copy of the \none-page form from my State.\n  This is a copy. We hear from the other side about bureaucracy and \npaperwork. This is an example of how targeted Federal funding for a \nprogram really works. This is a one-page form. School districts fill it \nout, and they get the money. It is at their request. They do not have \nto ask for the money, but if they do, they fill out a one-page form and \nthe money is available to them.\n  Teachers have told me, by the way, they have never seen money move so \nquickly from Congress to the classroom as they have seen with these \nclass-size reduction funds.\n  Linda McGeachy in the Vancouver school district, recently commented, \n``The language if very clear, applying was very easy, and there funds \nreally work to support classroom teachers.''\n  Finally, this amendment ensures accountability. In Addition, the \nlanguage clarifies that the funds are supplementary, and cannot replace \ncurrent spending on teachers or teacher salaries. Accountability is \nassured by requiring school districts to send a ``report card'' in \nunderstandable language to their local community--including information \nabout how achievement has improved as a result of reducing class size.\n  Before I close, I just want to make one final point. This class size \nprogram was a great idea when we passed it 2 years ago, and I was \nespecially pleased that we had the support of so many of my colleagues \nfrom the other side of the aisle.\n  In fact, I have a press release from the Republican Policy Committee \nwhich was put out on October 20, 1998. It listed class size as one of \nthe accomplishments the Republican Party had at that time. It says, \n``Teacher quality initiative cleared by the President,'' and it lists \nclass-size reduction funding as one of the major accomplishments during \nthe 105th Congress. So this was a bipartisan proposal.\n  Throughout the last 2 years, we have worked together to make sure the \nlanguage works for everyone involved.\n  We have seen the results come in. Mr. President, 1.7 million students \nhave benefited from this policy. That really is why I find it so \nsurprising that in this underlying Republican bill we back away from \nthat commitment that 2 years ago we were touting as the way to go and \nas an accomplishment for both sides.\n  I am offering this amendment today to give both the Democrats and the \nRepublicans an opportunity to show that they care about the students in \nAmerica's classrooms and to keep that commitment we made 2 years ago.\n  Parents, teachers, and students across America want students to be in \nclasses that are not crowded. Working together over the past 2 years, \nwe have been able to help 1.7 million students learn the basics with \nfewer discipline problems. The results are in. Smaller classes are \nmaking a positive difference. The research proves it. Parents, \nteachers, and students have seen the results. We should be committed to \ncontinuing that effort and not abandoning it in the underlying bill.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment today, to make sure we \ncontinue the progress in reducing class size. Our children deserve the \nbest. America deserves the best. This amendment gives it to them. I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think my colleague from Ohio is going \nto go next.\n  I am only going to take 5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that I \nfollow the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield the time to the Senator from \nMinnesota after the Senator from Ohio speaks.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask the Senator from Ohio, how long does he intend \nto speak? However long is fine with me.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I am sorry, I can't hear the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague how long he may be speaking on the \nfloor. It is fine with me however much time he uses.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I think I will probably be finished in 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am not sure what happened in that last \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Simply, the Senator from Washington said she \nwould yield to the Senator from Minnesota after the comments by the \nSenator from Ohio.\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. However, that time would be from the minority's time? I \nbelieve we are allocated time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Half the time to one side, half the time to the other \nside; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in the last couple of days I have had \nan opportunity to preside over the Senate. I feel compelled to make \nsome overall comments about what I have heard and the difference \nbetween the Republican approach and the Democratic approach on this \neducation reauthorization bill.\n  First of all, I think it is important everyone understand that the \nFederal Government only provides about 7 percent of the money for \neducation in the United States of America. Sometimes when I listen to \nmy colleagues, I think they think they are members of the ``School \nBoard of America'' and do not understand that the overwhelming majority \nof contributions for education come from State and local government.\n  I have also listened to Senators depicting the Republican approach as \na ``revolution'' that will change the way the Federal Government is \ngoing to be dealing with our schools. In fact, it was depicted by one \nMember of the Senate as giving ``a blank check to the States to conduct \nbusiness as usual.''\n  I want to let you know that the States are not conducting ``business \nas usual.'' As the former chairman of the National Governors' \nAssociation, I worked with my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--to \nreform education in this country. I think it would be wonderful if the \nMembers of the Senate would really become familiar with what is going \non throughout this country as State and local government change the way \nthey deliver education and recognize the improvements that have been \nmade.\n  The Republican approach that has been titled as ``revolutionary'' is \nthe Straight A's Program. So that everyone understands, it basically \nsays: Straight A's, of which I am a cosponsor, builds on Ed-Flex and \nallows up to 15 States to enter into a 5-year agreement with the \nSecretary of Education where the State can consolidate their formula \ngrant programs, including title I, and use them for the educational \npriorities set by the State. In return for this flexibility, States \nwill be held accountable for academic results. States that reduce the \nachievement gap will receive additional funds.\n  In effect, this is a waiver, given by the Department of Education, to \n15 States that want it, for 5 years, to use education money differently \nfrom what is provided in the current categorical programs.\n  Now, another issue is title I portability. It applies to 10 States \nplus 20 school districts. The States and districts will apply if their \neducation communities desire it. No district will be required by the \nFederal Government to have this portability. In other words, these are \nvoluntary programs where States would come to the Department of \nEducation and say: We would like to use this money differently from how \nit is now allocated under the categorical titles.\n  This is not what I would refer to as ``revolutionary.'' This sounds \nto me like the waiver program we had many years ago where the States \ncould go to the Department of Health and Human Services and say: We \nwant a waiver to do welfare a little differently in our State.\n  What I am hearing on the floor of the Senate is ``block grants are \nawful.'' I will tell you something. As a former mayor, I fought for the \nCDBG Program, Community Development Block Grant Program, which is one \nof the most successful block grants in the United States of America.\n  I hear some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say some \nof the same things I heard when I was Governor and I was down here with \nsix or seven other Governors to reform the welfare system. I heard \n``it's going to be a race to the bottom. The Governors do not care. The \nlocal government doesn't care. We in Washington, we in the Senate, care \nmore about the people than the Governors and the local government \nofficials.''\n  I would like to remind this body that on October 4, 1998, the \nPresident of the United States said:\n\n       This great new experiment that we launched 2 years ago has \n     already shown remarkable signs of success. Two years ago, we \n     said welfare reform would spark a race to independence, not a \n     race to the bottom. And this prediction is coming true.\n\n  Many Members of this Senate said it would be a race to the bottom, \nthat this was not the right thing to do.\n  Again, on December 4, 1999, the President said:\n\n       Seven years ago, I asked the American people to join me in \n     ending welfare as we know it. In 1996, with bipartisan \n     support, we passed a landmark welfare reform bill. Today, I \n     am pleased to announce we have cut the rolls by more than \n     half. Fewer Americans are on welfare today than at any other \n     time since 1969. We are moving more than a million people a \n     year from the welfare rolls to payrolls, 1.3 million in 1998.\n\n  He goes on to say what a great program it is.\n  How did it come about? It came about because we gave the people \nclosest to the problem the opportunity to use money in a different way. \nWe ended the entitlement, and we had a block grant for the States and \nsaid: You use the money the best way you can to make a difference in \nthe lives of our welfare recipients.\n  That is fundamentally what we are asking for in our approach to \neducation reform. We want to try something different.\n  We have had Title I for years and in the title I schools, we are not \ngetting the job done. That is one of the reasons we passed Ed-Flex \nearly this year. We want to build on that, give the schools the \nflexibility to use those dollars in the way they can make the most \ndifference for our boys and girls.\n  I have heard: ``Build new schools, hire more teachers.'' We are \nbuilding more schools. We are providing more teachers on the local \nlevel. I heard about ``a digital divide.'' In almost every State in the \nUnion, the States have put fiber optics out to the schools, and put \ncomputers in the schools that the States have paid for. In my State, we \nhave wired classrooms for voice, video, and data.\n  Parents ought to know how their child's school is doing. Most States \nhave report cards now, so people can compare their kids' performance in \ntheir school versus another school down the block.\n  Let's take the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards. We \nare talking about rewarding teachers. I am a former member of the \nNational Board of Professional Teaching Standards. In our State, people \nwho apply and receive their certificate from the National Board of \nProfessional Teaching Standards receive another $3,000 a year from the \nState of Ohio to recognize their extra professional competence. In the \nState of North Carolina, Governor Jim Hunt gives them $5,000.\n  We've talked about all kinds of new things Members of this Senate \nwould like to see happening at the local level. I am saying most of it \nis happening on the local level. We talk about building new schools. \nLet me say that once you get started with building new schools, it is a \nnever ending process.\n  The American public ought to understand that the backdrop of what we \nare doing here is shown on this chart. We are paying 13 percent of each \nfederal dollar on interest; we are paying 16 percent on national \ndefense; nondiscretionary is 18 percent; mandatory spending is 53 \npercent.\n  We have some real problems in this country. We have to take care of \nSocial Security and Medicare. We have a problem with readiness in our \nDefense Department. And we have people saying: Let's get into new \nprograms. Let's get into areas that are not the responsibility of the \nFederal Government. I am saying that the States have more of a capacity \nto deal with it. I went through the numbers. The National Governors' \nAssociation says there isn't one State in debt like we are--not one. \nMost of them have surpluses. If you talk about capacity to get the job \ndone, they have more capacity to get it done than we have.\n\n  It is hard for me to believe that when you are in debt this much, \nwhen you are paying out 13 cents in interest on every dollar, you are \nsaying we are going to get involved in some programs that fundamentally \nare the State's responsibility, and where the States have\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\nmore capacity to deal with the problems. So what I am saying today is \nthat we must change our approach to education. All we are saying is \ngive the States an opportunity to apply for a waiver, to use the money \ndifferently than what is in the categorical programs. They can use it \nfor teachers. In my State, we have reduced class size in urban \ndistricts down to 15 students per class, and we have done a lot of the \nthings in the states that we are talking about here. Let's just fund \nIDEA and make the money available so States can do that on their own.\n  We need to understand we have a role to play in education, but \nfundamentally it is a State and local responsibility. Our job is to \nbecome a better partner to the State and local governments, give them \nthe flexibility to get the job done and then hold them accountable. \nThat is what this is all about. I think that should be the debate. I \nhope that maybe by the time we get through with this bill, we can come \ntogether on a bipartisan basis and do something so we walk out of here \nand say to the American people that we have done something this year in \neducation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will try to respond to the comments \nof my colleague from Ohio because I like it better when we go back and \nforth. He is a Senator I certainly respect.\n  I have two points. I want to get back to Senator Murray's point. On \nthe whole general question of the Federal role, let me say to my \ncolleague from Ohio that it is absolutely true that much of K through \n12 is at the State level, no question about it. But going back to the \nhistory of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--and I have said \nthis three or four times--there is a reason why we have certain streams \nof money and targeting of programs, especially toward the most \nvulnerable children, because whereas the Senator from Ohio--and I have \nno doubt about the Senator's commitment to children, but the fact is, \nin too many parts of the country the verdict was very harsh at the \nState and local level. We decided, look, as a national community--and \nwe reflected that--we are going to make sure we make a commitment to \nthe poorest and most vulnerable children. I don't want to see us \nabandon that commitment. That is what this debate is about.\n  On welfare, with all due respect to the President--and my colleagues \nquoted the President--we have reduced the rolls by half. Anybody can do \nthat. You just tell people they are off. The question is whether or not \nwe met the goal of the bill, which was to move families from welfare to \neconomic self-sufficiency. Guess what. Just about every single study I \nknow of--and maybe you know of another one--has pointed out that in the \nvast majority of cases these mothers barely make above minimum wage, \nand many families have no health care coverage.\n  Families U.S.A. pointed out that we have 675,000 citizens who don't \nreceive any health care coverage any longer because of the welfare \nreform bill. We had a study from Harvard-Berkeley that in all too many \ncases--they looked at a million children --because of this welfare \nbill, children were getting dangerous to inadequate, at best, child \ncare. These are small children. Guess what. We have not made sure that \nthere is good child care. We haven't made sure these families have \nhealth care coverage, and the States are sitting on $7 billion. Some \nStates are supplanting that and using it to replace existing State \nprograms and using that money for tax cuts. So we have some reasons to \nbe concerned about how poor children will fare without some kind of \nFederal Government national commitment to them. That is my first point.\n  My second point has to do with this amendment. I thank Senator Murray \nfrom Washington for introducing this amendment. She pointed it out--and \nI will say it again--that across the country this year--and we did this \nin a bipartisan way--1.7 million first through third graders now attend \nclasses with an average of 18 students because we were able to provide \nfunding for 29,000 new teachers; 519 of them are in my State of \nMinnesota.\n  Now, the President's request for 2001 will bring Minnesota over $23 \nmillion more. I will say this again. I can give many examples. I will \nforget all the statistics. My daughter, Marcia, is a Spanish teacher. \nHey, I am a Jewish father, so I think she is the greatest teacher in \nthe country; and she is a darn good teacher from what I hear. She told \nme what it was like when she had 40 students. She teaches at the high \nschool level.\n\n  Every time I am in a school, which is every 2 weeks in Minnesota, I \ntalk to the students about education. They always talk about good \nteachers and about respecting teachers. They think teachers are \ndisrespected. We talked about that this morning. They also talk about \nsmaller class sizes. I tell you, it makes all the sense in the world. \nTalk to people in our States. They know it. With a smaller class size, \nthey know that a teacher can give students the individual attention \nthey need.\n  When you ask students: Who are the teachers you like, they say: They \nare not just the teachers who teach us the formal material; they are \nthe teachers who get to know us; they are the teachers who relate to \nus; they are the teachers who we can come and talk to; they are the \nteachers who can give us special help; they are the teachers who can \ngive us special attention; they are the teachers who know something \nabout what we hope for in our lives.\n  Do you want to know something? There are a lot of young people who \ncry out for that kind of teacher and cry out for that kind of \neducation. Do you want to know something else? One of the best ways we \ncan get there is through smaller class sizes.\n  Yes, we have said through this amendment, as Democrats who represent \npeople in our States, but I think it should be a bipartisan amendment. \nWe believe it should be a decisive priority for the Senate to say that \nwe are going to make a commitment--most of the funding is at the State \nlevel, but with the money we have and what we do to support school \ndistricts and to support principals and parents and teachers and \nstudents, let's make the best use of the money, and that is exactly \nwhat this amendment does.\n  I think this is a great amendment. I think it should receive 99 to \n100 votes. Before it is all over, for all I know, it will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to \nthe debate over the days and the hours of this week. It has been \nparticularly interesting to me to listen to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who have, in glowing terms, defended the status quo \nand have spoken in very rosy descriptions of the status of American \neducation.\n  I will not recite once again all the very gloomy statistics and the \nvery real statistics and the very undeniable reality of where we stand \nin American education and how we compare internationally with our \ncompeting young people around the world.\n  I believe one statement from the Vice President of the United States, \nAl Gore. His plans for education basically say enough about the status \nof American education. Vice President Gore, in unveiling his education \nplans, said:\n\n       I am proposing a major national investment to bring \n     revolutionary improvements to our schools. I am proposing a \n     national revolution in education.\n\n  Now, the question I ask is, If you have to propose a ``revolution'' \nin education, does that not imply that there is a problem? If the \nstatus quo is as good as the Democratic side has said during the debate \nthis week, then why is it necessary to say we are going to have a \nrevolution in education?\n  The reality is that it is not good. The picture is not good, and that \n``a nation in crisis,'' as it was called a few years ago, is still the \ntruth when you look at American education, and a defense of the status \nquo is not satisfactory. The American people deserve more and deserve \nbetter.\n  Now, what we have from time to time are fads in education. We have \nthe fad of the day or the fad of the year. That is what we are facing \nright now with the whole idea of class size reduction. Let me clarify. \nI think class size reduction is a wonderful thing. I think if teachers \nhave fewer papers to grade and smaller classes, they have a lot of\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\nadvantages. My sister is a fourth grade teacher. I know she would love \nfewer students at times in that classroom. But I want to challenge the \nbasic premise of what the Senator from Washington laid out before us in \nthis amendment. I don't question her sentiment, her goals, her \nobjectives, or her sincerity. But I think the research that is out \nthere is far less conclusive than what we have been led to believe.\n  Class-size reduction is not the magic elixir that its proponents \nwould like us to believe. The fact is pupil-teacher ratios have been \nshrinking for half a century in this country.\n  In 1955, pupil-teacher ratios in public elementary and secondary \nschools were: Elementary, 30.2; secondary, 20.9 to 1 respectively.\n  In 1998, they were 18.9 in elementary, and 14.6 in secondary.\n  That is a dramatic drop in the size of classes in this country.\n  Yet the fact is test scores went down for many years, and have \nleveled over to some extent. But they have leveled off at an absolutely \nunacceptable level.\n  Eric Hanushek of the University of Rochester has been one of the \noutstanding scholars in looking at the effects of class-size reduction. \nHe concluded--and I think we should conclude that:\n\n       A wave of enthusiasm for reducing class size is sweeping \n     across the country. This move appears misguided. Existing \n     evidence indicates that achievement for the typical student \n     will be unaffected by instituting the types of class size \n     reductions that have been recently proposed or undertaken. \n     The most noticeable feature of policies to reduce overall \n     class sizes will be a dramatic increase in the costs of \n     schooling, an increase unaccompanied by achievement gains.\n\n  That is the sad reality.\n  Between 1950 and 1995, pupil-teacher ratios fell by a dramatic 35 \npercent.\n  We are trying to cure a problem with this amendment. That is being \ncured already in the States.\n  We have seen a dramatic 35-percent decrease. While we don't have all \nof the information for the last 50 years that we would like to have on \nstudent achievement, we have enough to conclude that the performance \nhas been at best stagnant.\n  According to the National Assessment of Education Progress, our 17-\nyear-olds are performing roughly the same in 1996 as they did in 1970. \nWhile we have seen this dramatic drop in class size, we continue to see \na stagnant student performance.\n  The article ``The Elixir of Class Size'' concludes:\n\n       There's no credible evidence that across-the-board \n     reductions in class size boost pupil achievement. On this \n     central point, the conventional wisdom is simply wrong.\n\n  Look at the Asian nations today that trounce us on international \nassessments. Those Asian countries have, on average, vastly larger \nclasses with many times 40 and 50 youngsters per teacher. Yet in every \nevaluation, they are leading us on international comparisons of scores.\n  If lowering class size were the elixir that its proponents claim, we \nwould be seeing a dramatic increase. We would be seeing an improvement \nin these academic scores.\n  If this were health care, and if this were a new tonic being brought \nbefore the Food and Drug Administration, I assure you additional \nexperiments would be warranted; additional experiments would be \nrequired. But no scientist would say that efficacy has been proven. It \nsimply has not.\n  There is a simple reason why smaller classes rarely learn more than \nbig classes. Their teachers don't really do anything much different. \nThe same lessons, textbooks, and instructional methods are typically \nemployed, whether the class size is in the teens or whether the class \nsize is 25. It is just that the teacher has fewer papers to grade and \nfewer parents with whom to confer, but getting any real achievement \nbounce from class shrinking hinges on teachers who know their stuff and \nuse proven methods of instruction.\n  Of course, knowledgeable and highly effective teachers would also \nfare well with classes of 30 or 35. Jaime Escalante, renowned worldwide \nas the ``best teacher in America,'' packs his classroom every year with \n30-plus ``disadvantaged'' teenagers and consistently produces scholars \nwho pass the tough advanced placement calculus exam. But such teaching \nis not the norm in U.S. schools, and adding more teachers to the rolls \nwon't cause it to be.\n  Much of the current enthusiasm for reduction in class size is \nsupported by references to the experimental program in the State of \nTennessee that Senator Murray made reference to in her comments. The \ncommon reference to this program, Project STAR, is an assertion that \nthe positive results there justify a variety of overall reductions in \nclass size.\n  By the way, this report is cited so frequently because there are so \nfew studies on the academic impacts of smaller classes.\n  The study is conceptually simple, even if some questions about its \nactual implementation remain. Students in the STAR experiment were \nrandomly assigned to small classes of 13 to 17 students, or large \nclasses of 21 to 25 students with or without aides. They were kept in \nthese small or large classes from kindergarten through third grade. \nTheir achievement was measured at the end of each year.\n\n  If smaller classes were valuable in each grade, the achievement gap \nwould widen. But that was not the fact in the STAR study. In fact, the \ngap remains essentially unchanged through the sixth grade.\n  While there may be some evidence that in kindergarten the smaller \nclass sizes improved academic performance, as you go through grades 2, \n3, 4, 5, or 6, the gap between the advantaged and disadvantaged \nstudents did not narrow. It remained the same.\n  Apart from all of that, I think we should be concerned about the \nMurray amendment because of the unintended consequences. I know what \nSenator Murray wants to accomplish. She wants to see improved \nschooling. She wants to see improved academic performance. She believes \nsmaller classes will inevitably result in that, and that her amendment \nwill achieve that.\n  So often is the case as we pass amendments for legislation in the \nSenate that they end up being consequences that we never imagined.\n  I want to share with you four of them which I believe will occur if \nthe Murray amendment is adopted.\n  Teachers will leave the worst schools in the State to fill the newly \ncreated affluent slots.\n  That is what happened in many States where they have implemented \nthese kind of programs.\n  There will be the unintended consequence of exacerbating the problem \nof less-qualified teachers being hired.\n  In California, Governor Wilson shrank California's primary classes. \nWhat happened was the veteran teachers fled the inner-city schools in \ndroves lured by the higher paid, cushier working conditions of suburban \nsystems that suddenly had openings. This exodus forced city schools to \nhire less qualified teachers, threatening the one ingredient that \nresearchers agree is the most important to good education-- teacher \nquality. In fact, in California they sacrificed teacher quality in \nhiring more teachers, and the schools that were hurt the most were \nthose with disadvantaged students.\n  The West Education Policy Brief is the regional education lab for \nArizona, California, Nevada, and Utah. This is what they said about \nclass-size reduction. This is funded by the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n\n       A fundamental condition for the success of the Class Size \n     Reduction is good teaching. Class size reduction can \n     exacerbate teaching shortages and lead to the hiring of \n     unqualified teachers. In California, for example, since the \n     implementation of the state's class size reduction program, \n     the percentage of teachers without full credentials has \n     jumped from 1% to over 12%, while the proportion of teachers \n     with three or fewer years of experience rose by 9% and the \n     proportion of teachers who had the least education, a \n     bachelor's or no degree, increased by nearly 6% statewide.\n\n  Those are unintended consequence.\n  A second unintended consequence is driving us, if we adopt such an \namendment, toward nationalizing education.\n  I didn't want to interrupt Senator Murray when she was making her \npresentation. But what I wanted to ask is, What does she anticipate \nhappening when this authorization expires?\n  I am not sure whether it is 5 years or 7 years. Originally it was a \n7-year proposal. At some point the authorization ended. Does the \nSenator anticipate the Federal Government will reauthorize and make \nthis a permanent entitlement that the Federal Government will be \nfunding teachers at the local level?\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\nOr does Senator Murray anticipate that the States, the local \ngovernments, and the local school districts will be required to pick up \nthe tab for the teachers hired during this 7-year authorization? It is \none or the other. We will continue to fund them or they have to pick up \nthe tab.\n  We had an experiment in the COPS Program, which has done a lot of \ngood, by the way. When we funded the 100,000 policemen on the street, \nwe funded it from Washington, DC. The State police and local law \nenforcement were calling me saying the money had run out on the COPS \nProgram, the Government had to fund it again. We can't pay for the \npolicemen we hired under the COPS Program.\n  My friends, that is exactly what will happen on the Federal teaching \nprogram. When the authorization ends, when the spending ends, somebody \nhas to pick up the tab or we will exacerbate the condition we have now \nin the schools. I think this is an unintended consequence and a very \nserious consequence.\n  I have a serious problem with the idea of handing this over to the \nU.S. Department of Education. I see Senator Kennedy on the floor. I am \nnot among those who want to eliminate the Department of Education. I \nbelieve we are going to talk about accountability, making certain the \nDepartment of Education is accountable.\n  The most recent 1999 audit of the Department of Education showed the \nfollowing: The Department's financial stewardship remains in the bottom \nquarter of all major Federal agencies. The Department sent duplicate \npayments to 52 schools in 1999 at a cost of more than $6.5 million. \nNone of the material weaknesses cited in the 1998 audit had been \ncorrected in the 1999 audit. Yet we want to turn over to the Department \nof Education the hiring of thousands of teachers? That ought to be done \nand funded at the local level.\n  A 1,150-student district in East Helena, MT, hired 2 teachers with \nthe $33,000 Federal grant. The educators make about $16,000. The \nsuperintendent said: We have tremendous fear about whether this is \ngoing to be funded on an annual basis. But we have learned if you don't \ntake advantage of whatever is available at the time, somebody else gets \nthose dollars.\n  That is the attitude we are promoting. I don't blame that \nsuperintendent for wondering what will happen. Will the Federal \nGovernment pick this up as an entitlement or will they have to pick up \nthe tab? What will be the long-term and the unintended consequences of \nsuch a program?\n  Bringing 100,000 teachers onto direct Federal support creates another \npermanent program of virtual entitlement. We are going to create a \npermanent entitlement if we go down this route.\n  The third unintended consequence in passing this amendment is moving \neducation away from flexibility toward rigidity. I know Senator Murray \ninsisted this preserves flexibility at the local level and local \ndecisionmaking. We heard a lot of anecdotes in Senator Murray's \npresentation, and I will relate an anecdote heard this week.\n  An anonymous principal--I don't want to get her in trouble with the \nDepartment of Education or title I police, but she encouraged me to \nshare this--is working on her Ph.D. She is very bright. She made a \ngrant application with the Department of Education. Her title I \nsupervisor suggested it be changed, and the title I supervisor wrote \nthe application to apply for the classroom reduction program. And, as \nSenator Murray suggested, it was quickly approved. So much for local \nflexibility.\n  The title I supervisor said: You must take this teacher you have \nhired and move that teacher from one class to another class to another \nclass to another class--90 minutes in each classroom with about 24 \nstudents in each classroom. The teacher who was hired would go into the \nclassroom for 90 minutes. They would divide the class of 24 into 2 \nclasses of 12. The new hire was supposed to keep separate grade books, \nseparate grade reports. Every 90 minutes, they moved on to the next \nclass.\n  The principal said to the title I supervisor: That is not what I \nneed. We have 24 students, which is not a problem for us. Our teachers \nwould prefer to do remediation: Rather than postponing remediation \nuntil summer school, have that teacher they hired do the remediation at \nthe point of time the problem developed. The title I supervisor said: \nYou can't do that. We will audit you. You will be turned in and lose \nyour funding and lose that teacher.\n  That is not flexibility. That is the typical kind of prescriptive \nrigidity you expect from any kind of Federal education program. That is \nthe unintended consequence. We move exactly away from what we intend to \ndo with this legislation, which is to provide greater flexibility.\n  The fourth unintended consequence is to increase the inequality \nbetween rich and poor school districts. I will return to the example of \nCalifornia. A one-size-fits-all allotment per student, from the WestEd \nPolicy Brief of January 2000 and a rigid 20:1 ratio cap on class size \nled to uneven implementation. Early evaluation findings support the \nconcern that the very students who stand to benefit from class size \nreduction, poor and minority students, are least likely to have the \nopportunity to do so.\n  Schools serving high concentrations of low-income, minority English \nlanguage students learned more slowly due to lack of facilities. They \nget the teacher and there is no place to put the teacher. Teachers are \ngoing into poor school districts with poor facilities. They have the \nclassroom reduction personnel. They hire the teacher and they have no \nplace for the teacher. The schools that need the help the most are \nthose least likely to benefit. That is the WestEd Policy Brief \nconclusion funded by the U.S. Department of Education.\n  Let me reiterate. It will increase the number of less qualified \nteachers in the classroom. It will drive us toward a national control \nof education by creating a permanent entity. It will move education \naway from flexibility, which ought to be exactly the direction we are \nmoving. It will increase the inequities between the wealthy and the \npoor school district.\n  Our bill allows true classroom reduction by providing flexibility and \nallowing funds to flow between programs. In so doing, the school can do \nwhat is most needed, whether it is classroom reduction, buying \ncomputers, hiring tutors, finishing that building if they need to, or \nwhatever that local need is. If there is an elixir, that is a far \nbetter elixir than the illusionary classroom reduction magic potion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the example that was given was \nentertaining to listen to, but this amendment we are offering is \nincredibly flexible. It appears the example he is using is reflective \nof local ineptness, not Federal inflexibility in this amendment.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Murray's amendment \nand commend her.\n  I begin by talking about this issue of status quo that has been \nbandied about. Let me suggest what the status quo is in America. The \nstatus quo is that Governors and mayors and school committees \nfundamentally decide educational policy in this country. In fact, the \nSenator from Arkansas gave a good example of how a Governor really \nscrewed it up. He decided he wanted smaller class size, but he didn't \nunderstand or recognize that you also had control for the quality of \nthe teachers, so the result is in poor districts there are lots of \nunqualified teachers.\n  Is that an example of a Federal program run amok? No, it is an \nexample of a Governor who got it wrong. What is the Republican \nproposal? Let's give Governors, including Governor Wilson, carte \nblanche to do what they will with educational policy. I can't think of \nany example that more closely undercuts this Straight A approach to \neducation than the example of what was done in California.\n  It is much different than what Senator Murray is advocating. One of \nthe reasons why there were problems in California, I suspect, is they \ndid not have the extra resources necessary to ensure both smaller class \nsize and teacher quality. That is why this program is adding Federal \ndollars to State resources and local resources, so we control both size \nof the class and the quality of teachers.\n  I also think it is interesting to note when talking about the \ncollapse and\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\ndecline of American education, people point to international \nexperiences. Frankly, most international systems are nationally based \neducational programs. Japan is one which has strong national standards \nwhich do not give money away to the head of the prefecture or the head \nof the province. They have national curricula. They have national \nteacher certification. So if you are going to have a comparison between \nwhy we are failing vis-a-vis other nations, recognize the approach the \nRepublicans are proposing is diametrically opposed to what is done in \nmost of the leading industrialized nations of the world. They are not \ntalking about national anything. They are talking about vesting in \nevery little State, every little community, the authority.\n  Sometimes, frankly, I guess this has been a useful debate. The \nSenator from Arkansas recognizes that Governors really mess it up \nsometimes. So I do not think we have to take that approach.\n  I think we can rely, not only on statistics and studies--and the \nTennessee example has not been refuted--but just common sense. Ask any \nteacher. Ask any parent. Would you prefer to teach 30 children or 18? I \nsuspect anyone in the Senate with children of school age, when asked \nwhether they would prefer to have their child in a class of 30 or a \nclass of 18, would say, unhesitatingly, 18. That is common sense.\n\n  That is what we are about here and that is what this amendment is \ndoing. For the last 2 years we have actually embarked on this program. \nWe are providing assistance and it is flexible, not in the abstract but \nin the particular. The Providence, RI, Superintendent of Schools wanted \nto engage in this approach, using extra resources to augment her \nteaching staff and reduce class size. She received from the Department \nof Education a waiver which allowed these resources to fund literacy \ncoaches to co-teach in elementary schools 50 percent of the time and to \ndeliver school-based professional development for the balance of the \ntime. It was a flexible approach meeting local needs under the context \nof the existing legislation. So these theoretical concerns about a lack \nof flexibility are disproved when you actually look at what systems are \ndoing and what they can do.\n  All of this goes to the real, fundamental issue. Are we going to \ncontinue our commitment to lower class size supported both by common \nsense and by the statistical reviews done already, particularly in \nTennessee, or are we going to embark on a carte blanche check to \nGovernors?\n  We have a good example in the previous discussion about a Governor \nwho really got it badly wrong. It illustrates the status quo. The \nstatus quo is that Governors and local communities control the quality \nof teachers. They control fundamental policies. They get it wrong \nsometimes. Yet the whole Republican approach is give them more \nresources, give them a list of things they can do, as the menu in a \nChinese restaurant, and then that is it.\n  There is also before us now an amendment by Senators Abraham and Mack \nwhich would add to this list and diffuse even further our focus on \ndisadvantaged children; programs and policies we know, based upon \nlistening to teachers and parents and looking at research, could work \nto improve performance of schools. They want to add to the list merit \npay and tenure reform and others, which I presume is their approach to \nprofessional development. But that is not going to directly improve the \nquality of teaching in the United States.\n  We know from research, from listening to witnesses at our hearings, \nthat professional development today, in the States, is generally \nrecognized by teachers as inadequate. They feel unprepared to deal with \nthese issues. Is that a Federal problem? No. That is because of State \npolicies, local policies. But we can help. In fact, if you look at most \nprofessional development across the United States, it is ad hoc, one-\nshot lectures or seminars or sessions. In fact, in 1998, participation \nin professional development programs in the United States typically \nlasted from only 1 to 8 hours during the course of a school year. That \nis absolutely insufficient.\n  We know from research and analysis that good professional development \nhas to be in the school, embedded in the program. It has to be content \nbased. It has to give teachers facility and mastery of the topic and \nthe ability to relate with their children. That is not done with 1 to 8 \nhours. It is done constantly, persistently throughout the school year. \nThat is what is done by an amendment that Senator Kennedy and myself \nwill be offering later. It provides support for that type of \nprofessional development which we know works, which will deepen \nteachers' knowledge of content, which will allow teachers to work \ncollaboratively.\n\n  That is another failing in our system of professional development. \nTeachers come in in the morning; they rush from class to class. They \nmight see the other teachers in the lunchroom for 20 minutes. They rush \nfrom class to class, go back in, and then they have to go home and take \ncare of their families just as the rest of us. We need more \ncollaboration. That is not in this bill, not even a hint of it.\n  We have to also provide the kind of opportunities for mentoring and \nreview and coaching which we know work--not just rhetorically but \nactually give resources to the States if they want to do it, and to \nlocal communities if they want to do it. That is the approach I think \nwill work. That is the approach that was a large part of the \nlegislation I submitted, the Professional Development Reform Act.\n  I hope we can go ahead and not only support Senator Murray's well-\nthought-out, well-crafted proposal to reduce class size, but also to \nreject the Mack-Abraham approach and support, later in our debate, \nafter deliberation, Senator Kennedy's approach and my approach, which \nis for professional development that has been proven by practitioners \nto work to the benefit of children. I hope we can do that.\n  I think we have seen, perhaps inadvertently, what could go wrong. \nTalk about unintended consequences. I add, these are probably \npredictable consequences. There will be Governors who did what Governor \nWilson did because of political pressures and other pressures: Embark \non a program--maybe it is class size or maybe something else--that \nresults in poor policy, poor results, and poor education for children.\n  Why do we assume, as the Republicans do, that it is all right to put \nthose forces in train, in motion, by giving them money without \naccountability? I suspect what we have to do, and what we should do, is \nconcentrate on those areas where we know we make a difference--\nparticularly supporting disadvantaged children--and also supporting \nthose efforts that have a basis in research and a basis in common \nsense: Lowering class size, improving the quality of professional \ndevelopment in teaching in America so you do not have the situation \nthat they had in California. Smaller class size, perhaps, but poor \nteaching.\n  If we support the Democratic approach, we would help have both, \nsmaller class size and better teachers, which I believe will result in \nbetter education.\n  I commend Senator Murray for her efforts. I hope in the course of \nthis debate we can support the approach for professional development \nthat Senator Kennedy and I are promoting and in such a way make a real \ncontribution to educational policy in the United States.\n  I yield back to Senator Murray such time as I have not consumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington has brought \nforward her amendment on class size on a number of occasions, and it \nhas been well debated already. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nhave expressed their view on it. But I do think there are still some \npoints that need to be made.\n  Of course, the fundamental problem is one of philosophy. The \nessential theme of the proposal is that Washington knows best. It is a \ntop-down proposal, a straitjacket to the local school districts and to \nthe States. It is a demand. If you, the States, want to have education \ndollars coming to you from Washington, then you, the States, must do \nexactly as we tell you here in Washington. Flexibility or ideas which\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\nyou may want to pursue at the State level are stifled.\n  This, of course, is different than the philosophy which we have \nproposed in our bill. Our bill, relative to teachers, says: Yes, if the \nlocal community feels it needs more teachers to reduce class size, it \ncan hire teachers with the money to do that. But if the local community \nfeels it needs to educate its teachers to do a better job, it can use \nthe money to do that also. Or if it feels it has some teachers who are \nuniquely capable and need to be kept in the school system because there \nis a private sector demand for them that maybe will attract them out of \nthe school system as a result of higher compensation in the private \nsector, then they can use the money to pay bonuses to assist keeping \nthe teachers in the school system.\n  It is an attempt to say to that local school district: Here is the \nmoney you can have available to you from the Federal Government to \nassist you with making classrooms work better relative to the teachers' \ninvolvement in the classroom. You make the decision--you, the local \nschool district--as to whether you need a smaller student-teacher \nratio, whether you need better teachers, better trained teachers, or \nwhether you need to keep your best teachers in your school system. We \nin Washington do not know the answer to that question. That is the \nopposite view.\n  I note, however, the problem we confront as a society is not \nnecessarily that our classroom ratios are fundamentally out of skew. As \nsome of my fellow colleagues have said, maybe it polls well to say, \n``Class size, class size, class size, that's what improves education.'' \nBut study after study has shown us that is not necessarily the case. \nClass size is not necessarily the driver of a quality education. In \nfact, if you look at it in historical perspective--people who look back \non the old days as education working better in this country say in the \n1960s or 1950s, you will see the class size ratio was really rather \ndramatically worse than it is today. In 1960, the class size ratio was \n26 to 1 average in the nation. Today, for most States it is around 18 \nto 1.\n  Or if you look at our fellow competitors in the international \ncommunity such as Japan or Germany or China or Singapore, where their \nstudents are performing much better than our students in the area of \nmath and science, those class size ratios are in the 50-to-1 regime.\n  It is not necessarily the number of students in the classroom \nrelative to the number of teachers. In fact, the study by the gentleman \nfrom Rochester which has been recited a number of times, Mr. Eric \nHanushek, an economist at the University of Rochester, who looked at \nalmost 300 different studies of the effect of class size on the \nacademic achievement of students concluded it really was not class size \nthat affected the students' achievement. It was--and this should not \ncome as too big a surprise--it was the quality of the teacher.\n  If one looks around the country today, one will notice, especially in \nour low-income school districts, that teaching quality is in question \nbecause many of the teachers are teaching out of their discipline. For \nexample, we know that in the area of math, almost a third of our \nsecondary teachers did not major in math and yet they are teaching \nmath. They did not even minor in math.\n  In the area of English, almost a fourth of our teachers did not major \nor minor in English, reading education, literature, speech, or \njournalism.\n  The same statistics hold true for science and languages, in many \ninstances. The fact is that our teachers have not been trained in the \nsubjects which they are teaching. If a local school district knows \nthat, then they are going to try to improve the teacher's ability to \nteach that subject. They do not think there has to be more teachers in \nthe classroom; they think the teacher in the classroom has to know the \nsubject better in the discipline they are teaching.\n  Our bill gives that option to the local school district. It says they \ncan improve the teacher's ability in that area of activity the teacher \nis teaching. That makes much more sense.\n  We also know that a poor teacher teaching in a class does tremendous \ndamage to students. In fact, arguably, a poor teacher in a class can do \nmore damage to students than a good teacher in a class does good. Bill \nSaunders, who headed the Tennessee study, determined that 3 years of \nhigh-quality teaching versus 3 years of poor-quality teaching can mean \nthe difference between a student being enrolled in remedial classes \nversus a student making it in honor classes.\n  We know from a Dallas study that a low-quality teacher actually \nstunts the academic performance of the students in that classroom.\n  So it is the quality of the teacher we should be stressing, as well \nas the ratio of teacher to student. The only thing that is stressed in \nthe President's proposal, as brought forward by the Senator from \nWashington, is teacher-student ratio. There is no emphasis on quality \nat the level that gives the schools the flexibility they need to \naddress quality.\n  In fact, the whole program is a little skewed because, even relative \nto school districts, the program is designed not to reflect class size; \nit is designed more to reflect the level of income of the school system \nas to whether or not they qualify for the funds. There is a problem \nthere.\n  We also know in our high schools, where 40 percent of the students \nqualify for free lunches, that 40 percent of the classes are taught by \nunqualified math teachers. That is even a higher statistic than we see \nhere.\n  It means essentially that when one is in a low-income school \ndistrict--and this chart shows that--they have even a higher likelihood \nof getting an unqualified teacher or at least a teacher who is not \nexperienced or has not been trained in the area they are teaching.\n\n  The green bar reflects school districts where more than 49 percent of \nthe kids receive free lunches, and in those school districts 40 percent \nof the teachers do not have math as their primary area of \nqualification. Yet they are teaching math. Thirty-one percent of the \nteachers in English fall into that category; 20 percent of the science \nteachers fall into that category.\n  We know from looking at what has been happening in the educational \ncommunity, therefore, if we are concerned about low-income kids, we \nshould not be so focused on class size as we should be on getting \nsomebody teaching the math who actually understands math.\n  Today, unfortunately, that is not the case. In the low-income high \nschools across this country, many of the teachers simply do not have \nthe math background they need.\n  What are we suggesting in our bill? Rather than saying to that high \nschool, you must put the money into hiring a new teacher, we are \nsuggesting the teachers they have maybe are not trained well enough in \nmath, and if that is their decision, they can send them out to get \nbetter training or bring in people to help them get better training in \nthat area.\n  We also know putting in place a compulsory class size ratio can \ncreate significant negative, unintended consequences because that is \nexactly what happened in California. When California went down this \nroute, they ended up getting a large number of unqualified teachers and \nteacher assistants teaching students. This was especially true in the \nrural and low-income school districts in California.\n  As a result, we saw in California that they may have gotten better \nratios, but they got poorer teachers. The only advantage to a poor \nteacher teaching a smaller class size is that fewer kids are subjected \nto that teacher. That is the only advantage of a reduced class size if \na school has a poor teacher. It makes much more sense to follow the \nproposal we put forward, which is to give flexibility to the States as \nthey address this issue.\n  Another point that needs to be made is that almost 42 States today \nmeet the ratios which the President is requesting, an 18-to-1 ratio. \nForty-two States already have that ratio as an average across their \nschool districts. Of course, the President's proposal, as brought \nforward by the Senator from Washington, will not allow an average to \nget out from underneath the requirements in their bill. Every school \ndistrict must have an 18-to-1 ratio before they can get out from \nunderneath using the money for the purposes of hiring a teacher to \nreduce the class size ratio.\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\n  Even though the State, as a whole, may have reached 18 to 1, it does \nnot matter. The fact is that most States in this country have reached \nthe 18-to-1 ratio and, therefore, they probably have other things they \nwould rather do with this money to assist the teachers they already \nhave in place. Those other things include giving the teachers more \nopportunity to be better at the job they are doing, which should be our \ngoal.\n  In addition to allowing teachers to be better at the job they are \ndoing, our bill allows the school districts to do other things with \nthis money. This chart reflects that. Under current law, which this \namendment is essentially an attempt to expand, we have $1.6 billion \ncommitted to basically two purposes: professional development for math \nand science teachers. That is the Eisenhower grant which is not \nactually involved in this amendment. Class size is this amendment.\n  Under our bill, we take the Eisenhower grant and class size and we \nend up with $2 billion. We allow it to be used for a variety of areas \nwhere local school systems are in need of improving their educational \nand professional development for science, for math, for history, for \nEnglish, and for reading; technology training for teachers; teacher \nmentoring, which is something that has worked very well, getting a \nhigh-quality teacher into a community of teachers and having that \nteacher pass on his or her knowledge; alternative certification, \nteacher recruitment, which is also critical in our society today, \ngetting quality teachers into the profession; teacher retention, as I \nmentioned is important because of competition today; hiring special \neducation teachers; or class size reduction.\n  If the local school district comes to the conclusion that it needs \nmore teachers to reduce the ratio of teachers to students, then there \nis absolutely no limitation in our bill on them. They can do exactly \nthat.\n  They can take all the money they receive under the TEA Act, Teacher \nEmpowerment Act--which the amendment of the Senator from Washington \nwould basically replace--they can take all the money, and they can use \nit for the purpose of reducing the student-teacher ratio.\n  If they decide, as many school districts will--because you saw the \nstatistics. It is not necessarily ratio relationships which develop \nquality teaching; it is more likely to be a quality teacher who \ndelivers quality teaching. So many school districts are going to choose \nto make their teachers better. We are going to give them that \nopportunity, that flexibility to do that.\n  Regrettably, the amendment of the Senator from Washington, which is \nessentially a restatement of the President's proposal, does not do \nthat. I ask, How can there be resistance to a proposal which says, \nessentially: All right, school districts, if you want to reduce class \nsize, you can use the money to do that. That is your choice. But, if, \non the other hand, you have some other concerns that you, the \nprincipal, that you, the parent, that you, the teacher, that you, the \ncommunity, believe is important to make that school work better \nrelative to the teachers' ability to deliver a better education to the \nkids, then, in certain limited areas, you can pursue those \nopportunities. You can train teachers. You can make them better. You \ncan keep teachers who are of high quality.\n  How can you resist an idea which gives those options to the State? \nThe only way you can resist that idea is if you do not have any \nconfidence in the local schools and the people who are running those \nlocal schools.\n  We have heard it again and again from the other side of the aisle \nthat they do not trust the Governors--the Senator from Rhode Island \nessentially said that--that they do not trust the local school \ndistricts, that they do not trust the local teaching community, and \nthat they do not trust the parents in those communities. Why? Because, \naccording to the other side of the aisle, those folks failed with 93 \npercent of the money, and we in Washington had better tell them how to \nuse the 7 percent we send them and manage the life of the local school \ndistrict for them because they certainly cannot do it themselves, \nbecause there is some bureaucrat down here in downtown Washington, \nsitting in a building on the third floor in a room you cannot find, and \nI cannot find, who knows a heck of a lot better how to run Johnny \nJones' educational opportunities up in New Hampshire than his parents \nin Epping, NH, his teacher, his principal, the school board in Epping, \nNH, or the Governor of New Hampshire.\n  It is an attitude of complete arrogance, an attitude that says, we \nknow so much more about education in Washington than the people who \nhave dedicated their lives to this issue and more than the Governors, \nwho, by the way, have the primary responsibility for education. They \nare not going to turn to the African trade bill tomorrow. They are \ngoing to be turning to education tomorrow. They work on it every day, \nnot just one week out of every year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for an additional minute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator for his generosity.\n  They say they know so much more than the Governors, the boards of \neducation, the principals, the superintendents, the teachers, and, most \nimportantly, the parents. They say they can run the school systems from \nhere in Washington.\n\n  As I have said before, it is as if the folks on that side of the \naisle want a string. They want to run a string out to every school \nsystem in America, every classroom in America, from the desks on the \nother side of the aisle. They want to have hundreds of thousands of \nstrings running out, and they are going to pull the strings and tell \nAmerica how to run their classrooms.\n  It is an attitude which I cannot accept. It is an attitude which we \nhave tried to avoid in this bill, by giving flexibility--subject to \nachievement, subject to accountability--to the local school districts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back my time to the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side has 22 minutes; the \nRepublican side has 14 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank Senator Murray for yielding me this time on the \ndebate of this most important issue, of whether or not our kids are \ngoing to learn in a better environment by reducing class size, or \nwhether we are going to go into some opposite direction.\n  I must say this debate on class size sort of reminds me of the movie \n``Ground Hog Day.'' We keep having this debate over and over and over \nagain, even though we know what the reality is.\n  We have already had 2 years of funding, and 1 year of the money has \ngone out. All you have to do is go out and ask the teachers. Just go \nout to your schools, where they have used the money for class size \nreduction, and simply ask them: Do you like it? Is it working? That is \nall you have to do. It is very simple. If you do that, you will find \nthat teachers and principals and superintendents like this. They want \nour assistance to reduce class sizes.\n  What we did is we set a goal of no more than 18 students in grades 1 \nthrough 3. We have already provided funding for the first 2 years. Are \nwe going to stop now and turn the clock back? That is what the \nRepublicans want to do.\n  I must say that I listened to the remarks made by the Senator from \nArkansas, Mr. Hutchinson, when he was talking about this issue. Quite \nfrankly, the more I listened to him, the more I came to realize his \nargument is not against what we are doing, his argument is against \nlocal control because, obviously, it was either the principal or the \nsuperintendent who made the decision to float a teacher from class to \nclass to class at 90-minute periods of time. That is certainly not in \nour legislation. They have the flexibility to do that.\n  I have visited many schools in my State and have talked about \nreducing class sizes. The teachers, parents, and students are thrilled \nwith the results they are seeing after just 1 year. But instead of my \ntalking about it, let me read what some of my constituents had to say.\n\n[[Page S3491]]\n\n  I visited Starry Elementary School in Marion, IA. I spoke with Reggie \nLong, a first grade teacher for 30 years. She told me she appreciated \nthe smaller classes. She said:\n\n       It's nice because I can give individual attention to the \n     kids. We just give them so much academically now. If you \n     don't give them individual help, they can't succeed and we \n     can't succeed as teachers.\n\n  The superintendent of this school district said:\n\n       The key to effective teaching is getting to know the \n     students and parents.\n\n  William Jacobson said that it is easier when teachers have fewer \nstudents in their classes.\n  Last year, Angie Borgmeyer, a teacher in Indianola had 27 students in \nher second grade class. This year she has 21. She said 27 was too many. \nShe said:\n\n       It's very difficult with that many students. When you're \n     trying to teach them to read and give them basic arithmetic, \n     you need to be able to do it in a small group and give them \n     individual attention.\n\n  So this program is simple. It is eminently flexible. It is very \npopular. It is time to stop playing politics with it. We heard about \nthere being problems with applying for it, and the burdensome \npaperwork.\n  I have here in my hand an application from the Des Moines Independent \nCommunity School District, for an application they sent in for class \nsize reduction. It has 1 page, 2 pages, a signature page and a letter. \nThat is burdensome? For that they got $854,693.56 to reduce class \nsizes.\n  In closing, I will share some comments from students. I thought this \nwas illustrative. I visited the McKinley Elementary School in Des \nMoines and Mrs. Kloppenborg's second grade class. These kids already \nknow what is going on. I thought I would bring these. I will leave them \non my desk. These are pretty pictures. Last year there were 34 students \nin each second grade classroom. This year, they have about 23. So this \nis what the second grade kids were saying about how they felt about \ntheir new class size. I am going to read just some of the letters they \nwrote. They drew these wonderful pictures.\n  This one by Alicia says:\n\n       I can spend more time with the teacher.\n\n  Leydy says:\n\n       I can learn more about reading in a small group.\n\n  Daniel says:\n\n       We learn more and get better grades.\n\n  He has a great picture. There is a kid in a desk saying, ``Hi, \nSenator Harkin.'' I guess that is me saying hi because I have a necktie \non. There is a kid in front of the teacher's desk and he is kneeling--\nit looks like with a report card. If I could, I would tell him it \ndidn't work for me in the old days, and it is not going to work for him \ntoday, either.\n  Here is another one, but there is no name on this. It says:\n\n       I can make friends.\n\n  Another one says:\n\n       We have more space to do things like reading.\n\n  It is a nice picture of the bookshelves with all the books on there.\n  This one by Jessica says:\n\n       I can learn more because the teacher can help me.\n\n  This next one says:\n\n       I can learn more because I get more help.\n\n  He drew a picture of his hand on here.\n  If you look at all these, every kid they draw is smiling. Every kid \nis smiling. So, you see, these kids--and I visited this class--they \nknow it. They can sense it. They feel it. They have more space and more \ntime with the teacher. They get more individual help, and the kids love \nit.\n  When I was there, a few parents came over to the school. What they \nsaid to me was amazing. ``The difference between my child this year and \nlast year is incredible,'' they said. ``They are getting more work done \nand learning better and they are happier; they come home happier.''\n  So, for the life of me, I can't understand what the argument is on \nthe other side against our involvement in sending money out, no strings \nattached, with a lot of flexibility for teacher training. We have \ndistricts in Iowa that got the waiver because they already had class \nsize reduction; they had reduced classes down to about 20, close to 18. \nThey applied and got a waiver for teacher training. That is precisely \nwhat the Murray amendment does.\n  So it seems to me all of the arguments on the other side just boils \ndown to politics. For some reason--perhaps because this was started \nunder a Democratic administration, or perhaps because the amendments \nwere offered by a Democrat--they are opposed to it. That should not be \nthe way it is around here. It should be judged on the merits. We know \nfrom experience in the field that the merits justify this amendment to \nreduce class size and make sure our kids get the attention and \neducation they need.\n  I commend Senator Murray, especially, for her long and stalwart \nsupport in class size reduction. I must say, Mr. President, around here \na lot of times we defer to those who are experts. A lot of times when \nwe have medical issue that come up, we defer to Bill Frist because he \nis a doctor. I say to my friends, let's defer to a teacher. Senator \nPatty Murray is a teacher. She was a teacher before she came here. \nQuite frankly, I think she knows a lot about what we need in public \neducation. So I commend Senator Murray for her leadership on this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains on the Murray amendment for the \nproponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes remain under the control of the \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes remain under the control of \nthe majority.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, here we go again. Fourteen pages of the \nstatute set out precise and detailed requirements to be imposed on \n17,000 school districts around the country, the bottom line of which is \nthat we know what they need better than any of them do. Fourteen pages \nof statute that, if the precedent has any value, will turn into 114 \npages of regulations from the U.S. Department of Education, all under \nthe mantra of smaller class sizes.\n  Well, in spite of conflicting views on the precise impact of smaller \nclass sizes in various parts of the country, one may even start by \nadmitting that in many cases this is a good idea. But this amendment \nsays not only is it a good idea, it is the only idea; it is the only \nway to spend a very considerable amount of money in every single school \ndistrict around the country, no matter what its own priorities. No \nmatter what its own parents, teachers, superintendents, and elected \nschool board members think, we are telling you right here--100 of us in \nthis national school board--this is what you need.\n  Will it naturally put any more money into the schools? I doubt it. It \nis a large authorization, but we have already passed the budget \nresolution, and we pretty much know how much money there is going to be \navailable for education. So, essentially, if it is passed and if it is \nappropriated for, it will come out of other educational priorities.\n  Let's just take one. Thirty years ago, and again 3 or 4 years ago, we \npassed 150 pages of a law for special education. Most of the Members \nwho are voting today were Members of the Senate then. We promised we \nwould pay 40 percent of those costs. Due primarily to efforts on this \nside of the aisle, we have gone from 8 percent to 11 percent. In \nanother 30 or 40 years, we might get to the promise that we made with \nrespect to education for the disabled. But that was a priority of 3 \nyears ago. What we need now are another bunch of new programs which \nhave one thing, one feature alone, in common. They say school board \nmembers, superintendents, principals, teachers, and parents all across \nthe United States are not the best judges of what they need to provide \na better education for our children.\n\n  The Senator from Arkansas, who is on the floor, has pointed it out, \nand the Senator from New Hampshire has pointed out that the bill before \nus, which will end up supplying as much money as the other bills will, \ncertainly allows any school district with a primary goal of more \nteachers to use\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\nmuch more money for hiring new teachers. It differs in the fact that it \ndoesn't mandate that as the No. 1 priority for every school district. \nMaybe most will want to hire new teachers, and some will want to keep \ntheir best teachers in place by paying them more money. Some may want \nto use the money for physical infrastructure. Some may want to use it \nfor specialized teachers and specialized courses that are not allowed \nunder this amendment. Some may want to train their teachers better. \nSome may wish for more computers. But the most difficult virtue to \npractice in this body is the practice of letting go, saying we don't \nknow it all; we can't set the absolute priorities for every school \ndistrict in the United States.\n  Let's stick with what we have on the table at the present time. Let's \nstick with the bill that dramatically says the present system of more \nand more statutes and more and more requirements has not been a \nstriking success over the last 35 years. Let's try, at least in a few \nplaces in this country, to let our schools' own people, our \nprofessional educators, those who care most, those who know our \nchildren, make the decisions that will affect their lives and their \neducation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nbeing offered by the Senator from Washington. A recent study by the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee confirms what common sense should \nhave been telling us all along--our children learn better when they are \ntaught in smaller classes.\n  With enrollment at the nation's schools continuing to increase, and \nmany of those currently in the teaching profession nearing retirement \nage, the fact of the matter is simple--we need more teachers. Under \nSenator Murray's leadership, we in the Senate began the class size \nreduction initiative a little over two years ago with the goal of \nhiring 100,000 teachers over a seven-year period and reducing class \nsizes in the early grades to a nationwide average of 18 students. Yet \nhere we are today, faced with a bill which abandons this goal.\n  In 1998, my home state of Delaware recognized the need for more \nteachers and smaller class sizes. In July of that year, our governor, \nTom Carper, signed legislation requiring all school districts in the \nstate of Delaware to cap class sizes in kindergarten through third \ngrades at no more than 22 students. That same legislation included a \nprovision which increased state funding to help pay for one teacher for \nevery 18 students. And with the help of the federal funding provided \nunder the class size reduction initiative, Delaware was able to hire \nover 100 new teachers in 1999.\n  These teachers are in the classroom today. That means roughly 1,800 \nchildren are likely to get far more out of the hours they spend in \nschool, and that they will move into the higher grades far better \nprepared. For these children in Delaware, and all the other children \nwho are in smaller classrooms because of this initiative, this is \nliterally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get started on the right \npath. Yet this bill, without the Murray amendment, makes no promise of \nsmall classrooms.\n  We can fund all the education programs we want, but without enough \nquality teachers in every classroom to teach our children the basic \nskills necessary to succeed, these programs means nothing. We need to \ncontinue to promote smaller classrooms in grade school by continuing to \nhelp schools hire up to 100,000 additional qualified teachers to reduce \nclass sizes.\n  The more individual contact our children have with their teachers, \nthe more they are able to learn, and the better they perform on tests. \nThose are the facts. At a time when we are just beginning to make \nprogress, now is not the time to abandon our children's future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator be good enough to yield \n8 minutes?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would be happy to yield 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes of that 8 minutes at the \npresent time.\n  Mr. President, just to review very quickly, there has been some \nsuggestion about the fact that in so many different underserved \ncommunities teachers are unqualified. We recognize that. That is why we \nhave a very vigorous program in terms of recruitment and training and \nenhanced professional development. Everyone ought to know that in the \nMurray amendment there are requirements to carry out effective \napproaches to reduce that through the use of fully qualified teachers \nwho are certified or licensed within the States. The comments about the \nMurray amendment earlier about qualifications and being unqualified \njust are not relevant to this debate and discussion.\n  I will not take the time to review the obvious, but studies have been \ndone. The Tennessee study of some 7,000 children in 80 different \nschools says it all. It was done recently. In grade 4, students who \nattended small classes K through 3 were 6 to 9 months ahead of the \nregular class students in math, reading, and science. By grade 8 these \nadvantages grew to over 1 year.\n  In Wisconsin, a similar study called the Sage Study had similar kinds \nof results. Their report had the analysis that suggests the teachers in \nSage classrooms have greater knowledge of each of their students, spend \nless time managing their classes, and have more time for individualized \ninstruction, utilizing a primary teacher incentive approach. It is \nunquestioned. It is unchallenged.\n  We have been waiting to hear from the other side a challenge of the \nbasic and fundamental results of the smaller class size with good \nteachers. That is out there.\n  We are strongly committed. Senator Murray, who has been fighting this \nfight for the past year, is committed to make sure we are going to have \nthat availability to school districts across the country.\n  That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, I can understand the anguish that our Republican friends are \nhaving about teacher quality, and also about the expenditures. Under \nthe Republican bill, there is $2 billion. They effectively wipe out the \ncurrent class size. That is 30,000 teachers they take out of K through \n6th grades. They take them out. Those are lost. They get pink slips in \na program that is supposedly providing quality teachers. These are \nquality teachers. They get the pink slips because they are using $1.3 \nbillion of the President's program. They wipe out the $350 million in \ncurrent Eisenhower math and science. They only have $300 million new \nmoney.\n  I can understand their frustration as compared to our program which \nis $3.75 billion.\n  Finally, I would like to remind our Republican friends that when this \namendment was first passed here, we had Bill Goodling on this the first \ntime we had the negotiations. Senator Murray was there during the early \nparts of the negotiation and was our leader.\n  This is what Bill Goodling, who is the chairman of the House \ncommittee, said the first time we had the smaller class size.\n\n       This is a real victory for the Republican Congress, but \n     more importantly, it is a huge win for local educators and \n     parents who are fed up with Washington's mandate, red tape, \n     and regulation.\n\n  Goodling said:\n\n       We agree with the President's desire to help classroom \n     teachers, but our proposal does not include a big, new, \n     Federal education program. Rather, our proposal will drive \n     dollars directly to the classroom and give local educators \n     options to spend Federal funds to help disadvantaged \n     children.\n\n  Interesting.\n  Here is the Republican Policy Committee, a dictionary of major \naccomplishments during the 105th Congress. Here is the Republican \nPolicy Committee. They list 14.\n  Number 9: Teacher quality, initiative--cleared, cleared for the \nPresident.\n\n       The omnibus FY99 funding bill provides $1.2 billion in \n     additional education funds--funds controlled 100-percent at \n     the local level--to school districts to recruit, hire, train \n     and test teachers. This provision is a major step toward \n     returning to local school officials the ability to make \n     educational decisions for our children.\n\n  Here they are taking credit for the same proposal, the Murray \nproposal. Three years ago it was the Republican proposal. They are the \nones issuing the press releases. They are the ones taking credit for \nit. All Senator Murray is\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\ndoing is continuing that program. It is the same program. The President \nis putting up the money. It is the same program. It was good enough at \nthat time for Mr. Goodling, and it was good enough for the Republican \nleadership to take credit.\n  Here is what former Speaker Newt Gingrich said about it at that time. \nHe called it ``a victory for the American people. There will be more \nteachers, and that is good for all Americans.''\n  Here is what Dick Armey said.\n\n       Well, I think, quite frankly, I'm very proud of what we did \n     and the timeliness of it. We were very pleased to receive the \n     President's request for more teachers, especially since he \n     offered to provide a way to pay for them. And when the \n     President's people were willing to work with us so that we \n     could let the state and local communities take this money, \n     make these decisions, manage the money, spend the money on \n     teachers as they saw the need, whether it be for special \n     education or for regular teaching, with a freedom of choice \n     and management and control at the local level, we thought \n     this was good for America and food for the schoolchildren.\n\n  The same program today, the same program that we are going to be \nvoting on, the same one, endorsed by Armey and endorsed by Gingrich and \nGoodling.\n  What is it with our Republican friends that they were so enthusiastic \nfor this program 3 years ago, taking credit for it, putting it on the \nlist of major achievements of the Congress? Now we hear out here: No, \nno; we can't; Oh, Lord, we cannot have this new program. We can't have \nit. It has all kinds of problems. Oh, Lord. It has problems. It has \nproblems.\n  Come on. We have been making an attempt in this area. You ought not \nbe out taking credit for it if that is what you are interested in. And \nI am sure Senator Murray would be glad to offer you cosponsorship on \nthis program and go with you up to the gallery when we have the \ncelebration. I will go with Senator Hutchinson, with Senator Gorton, \nand the rest of our friends.\n  This is something that is basic and fundamental and successful. We \nhave heard more speeches around here about the problems that we are \nfacing at the local level. This program is tried and tested with good \nresults and excellent outcomes for children. Teachers themselves \nembrace it. It was endorsed by Republicans 3 years ago. It is the same \nprogram. It was good enough for them then; it ought to be good enough \nfor them now because mostly all of it is good for the children of this \ncountry.\n  We hope this amendment will be successful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Jeffords.\n  I say to Senator Kennedy that I never shared the enthusiasm that some \ndid. But, fortunately, there is a better way for class size reduction. \nIt is in this underlying bill.\n  Earlier in my remarks, I made a reference to an example in Arkansas \nin which a class size reduction grant was given. The title I supervisor \nsaid to the principal that against her wishes the hired teacher would \nhave to be rotated among classes for 90 minutes in each class, even \nthough the principal thought that was not the best use. She wanted to \nuse that person for a point of time for remediation to help these who \nneeded remediation in their school work.\n  After I spoke, Senator Murray and Senator Harkin both said that it \nsounded to them as if my beef was with local control. I simply want to \nclarify that my beef is not with local control. My beef is title I \npolice. My beef is with a rigid, inflexible Federal program that \noverrules what is best for the children so as to comply with the \nprescriptions of the Federal U.S. Department of Education. That is why \nwe have a better way.\n\n  I want to clarify for Senator Murray and Senator Harkin. It was not \nthe principal's decision, not the superintendent's decision, not the \nclassroom teacher's decision. It was the decision of the title I \nsupervisor in what she said was compliance with the Class Size \nReduction Program. My beef is not with local control. My beef is with \nthe program that has that kind of rigidity built into it.\n  I thank the chairman for yielding me 2 minutes of the remaining time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 15 seconds to Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to respond to the Senator from Arkansas. This \namendment has nothing to do with title I, but this amendment has to do \nwith class size reduction.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will speak about my amendment and the \nsecond-degree amendment to it which I did not address earlier.\n  The amendment Senator Mack and I have offered today essentially \nallows title II funds to be used for three purposes not specified in \nthe underlying bill: First, for teacher testing programs, to ensure \nthat teachers teaching our kids have the skills and knowledge about the \nsubject matter they are teaching; second, for merit pay programs that \ncould identify and reward teachers who perform exceptionally; third, \ntenure reform programs that shift the focus on teacher advancement and \npromotion to a broader subject of categories beyond mere longevity.\n  We believe these will make a difference in terms of improving the \nquality of teaching. As I speak to parents in my State, there is no \nquestion they want teachers conversant with the subject matter they are \nteaching their kids. They want to reward and acknowledge exceptional \nteachers and make sure the process employed with respect to the schools \nand their communities is based on ability and merit.\n  We were criticized during the debate on only one of these, the merit \npay proposal. That was the extent of the criticism leveled at this \namendment earlier today. There then was a second-degree amendment \noffered. Interestingly, the second-degree amendment wiped away the two \nareas that were not subjected to any criticism--the teacher testing and \nthe tenure reform proposals--in their entirety. It then replaced our \nmerit proposal with a different one, one that rewards all teachers in \nschools that showed an increase in achievement by students.\n  Interestingly, I find it odd that the two areas that were not \ncriticized earlier were eliminated from the secondary amendment, and I \nquestion the approach taken in the second amendment with respect to \nmerit pay programs.\n  Our approach is a permissive approach we are offering as an option \nfor the possible use of title II funds. No school will be mandated to \ndo this. No school will be forced to do it. Under no circumstance will \nthe Federal Government outline, identify, design, or in any way dictate \nthe types of programs that would be used.\n  In the second-degree amendment, however, only one type of program of \nmerit pay is proposed, and it has an odd component to it. It says all \nteachers in any school that shows certain types of improvement, to be a \npresumably later identified, would benefit from enhanced salaries or \nbonuses.\n  That means the worst teacher, in a school that showed overall \nachievement, would receive some sort of merit award. Meanwhile, the \nvery best teacher who might be producing tremendous increases in \nachievement among his or her students in another school would not \nqualify. I see an inconsistency. I also question why the two sections \nof our amendment that were not criticized or even commented on earlier \ntoday have been entirely eliminated by the second-degree amendment.\n  The choice is simple. Our approach permits districts and State \neducation agencies to use title II funds for programs they would design \nwith respect to teacher testing, merit pay, and tenure reform. I \nbelieve that is a wise course to follow if our goal is to increase the \nquality of the teaching of our children in America today. I sincerely \nhope our colleagues will choose to follow that course by rejecting the \nsecond-degree amendment and supporting the Abraham-Mack proposal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our amendment focuses funds on what \nworks. If the States want to use their 93 cents out of the dollar for \npurposes that Senator Abraham has mentioned, they can do it. We are \nfocused on what works: School-based merit programs for improving the \nachievement of all students in a school, incentives and subsidies for \nhelping teachers earn advanced degrees, implementing and\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\nfunding vigorous peer review evaluation and recertification programs \nfor teachers, and providing incentives to help the most fully qualified \nteachers to teach in the lowest achieving schools.\n  These are the programs that are tried, tested, and that work. That is \nthe second degree to the proposal of the Senator from Michigan. I hope \nit will be accepted.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in response, I don't know how anyone can \nsay that a program proven to work is one that rewards the worst teacher \nin a school that may, in fact, be producing a decrease in the \nachievement level of their students. I don't think that could possibly \nbe argued to be an effective way to use Federal dollars. Yet that is \nwhat would happen under the proposed second-degree amendment.\n  Our amendment, on the other hand, opens the way for school districts \nand State education agencies to use these funds in the most effective \nway they deem possible to improve the quality of teaching. I look \nforward to the vote on this.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for his debate today.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield myself the remaining time.\n  I back up the statements of the Senator from Michigan. What we are \ndealing with on the first vote is whether or not to make more flexible \nthe options with respect to the schools. The Abraham-Mack amendment \ndoes that. The second-degree is a strike of that and puts one option in \nand does not add but detracts from what we would have without that \namendment.\n  The Murray amendment, again, restricts the availability of the class \nsize money to one option--class size. In my State and many other \nStates, that is not the problem. The problem is the quality of the \nteaching. We would rather spend that money to enhance the qualities of \nthe teachers we have rather than to have it available for things we \ndon't need.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the second degree, a ``yes'' vote on the \nAbraham amendment, and a ``no'' vote on the Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We are about to have three very important votes. One \nwill be on the class size amendment. First, the Senator from Arkansas \nmentioned in his remarks the WestEd Policy Briefing and spoke \neloquently about the challenges, but he failed to talk about the \ntremendous benefits that were also in the report, including achievement \ngains and greater individual attention. The list goes on.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the entire study printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Policy Brief\n\n\n                     great hopes, great challenges\n\n       Numerous states have enacted or are considering measures to \n     reduce class size. Additionally, as part of a seven-year \n     program to ensure an average class size of 18 for grades one \n     through three, the federal government has committed more than \n     $2.5 billion to a national class size reduction (CSR) \n     initiative. These efforts stem from research findings on \n     CSR's achievement benefits, as well as from its enormous \n     popularity with parents, administrators, and teachers.\n       However, not all efforts have proven equally successful. In \n     designing CSR programs, careful assessment of specific state \n     circumstances should help states adopting or modifying CSR \n     efforts avoid the unintended consequences that some programs \n     have experienced and ensure greatest benefit from what is \n     usually a considerable financial investment.\n\n                                Benefits\n\n       Research in the primary grades shows that as class size \n     shrinks, opportunities grow. Successful implementation of CSR \n     has led to numerous benefits, which appear to last into the \n     high school years, including:\n       Achievement gains, especially for poor and minority \n     students.\n       Greater individual attention and teacher knowledge of each \n     student's progress.\n       Improved identification of special needs, allowing earlier \n     intervention and less need later for remediation.\n       Fewer classroom discipline disruptions.\n       Faster and more in-depth coverage of content; more student-\n     centered classroom strategies, such as special-interest \n     learning centers; more enrichment activities.\n       Greater teacher-parent contact and parent satisfaction.\n       Reduced classroom stress and greater enjoyment of teaching.\n\n                               Challenges\n\n       Challenges for policy design arise in three major areas:\n\n                  Teaching supply and teacher quality\n\n       A fundamental condition for the success of CSR is good \n     teaching. CSR can exacerbate teaching shortages and lead to \n     the hiring of underqualified teachers. In California, for \n     example, since the implementation of the state's CSR program, \n     the percentage of teachers without full credentials has \n     jumped from 1% to over 12%, while the proportion of teachers \n     with three or fewer years of experience rose by 9% and the \n     proportion of teachers who had the least education, a \n     bachelor's or no degree, increased by nearly 6% statewide.\n\n                               Facilities\n\n       Inadequate facilities can impede schools' ability to \n     implement CSR and/or compromise CSR's benefits. Whole schools \n     or programs may also suffer if, for example, libraries, music \n     rooms, special education rooms, or computer rooms are \n     converted into classrooms, as has happened in some places. \n     Many space-strapped schools have combined two ``smaller'' \n     classes into one large one with two teachers. Wisconsin \n     reports positive results from such team teaching; in Nevada, \n     however, concern exists that team teaching has compromised \n     CSR's success.\n\n                                 Equity\n\n       CSR policies can inadvertently worsen inequities. In \n     California, for example, a one-size-fits-all allotment per \n     student and a rigid 20:1 cap on class size led to uneven \n     implementation. Early evaluation findings support the concern \n     that the very students who stand to benefit most from CSR--\n     poor and minority students--are least likely to have full \n     opportunity to do so. Schools serving high concentrations of \n     low-income, minority, and English language learner (ELL) \n     students implemented more slowly due to lack of facilities. \n     These same schools have the hardest time attracting prepared, \n     experienced teachers and, thus, suffered a far greater \n     decline in teacher qualifications than other schools. \n     Finally, for many of these schools, the cost of creating \n     smaller classes exceeded their CSR revenues, and to make up \n     the deficit they diverted resources from other activities.\n\n                            Recommendations\n\n       Crafting a successful CSR program is no simple matter. As \n     knowledge from state and local experience continues to \n     evolve, lessons are emerging that suggest important design \n     elements for policymakers to consider, including:\n\n                               Targeting\n\n       Since research shows that children in the primary grades \n     and, especially, poor and minority children benefit most from \n     smaller classes, it makes sense to direct CSR monies toward \n     these children. Such targeting can also offset some of the \n     difficulties inner-city and poor, rural schools face in \n     attracting well qualified teachers and finding sufficient \n     classroom space.\n\n                            Teacher support\n\n       Schools will need to hire a number of new and, possibly \n     inexperienced teachers to enact CSR policies. If the teachers \n     are unprepared, resources for support, such as mentorship and \n     training programs, will need to be considered. Research, \n     experience, and a policy climate of higher expectations also \n     suggest that novices and veterans alike will need support to \n     learn new teaching strategies that capitalize on the \n     opportunities smaller classes present.\n\n                            Facility support\n\n       CSR initiatives require adequate facilities. If facility \n     issues are not attended to at all levels, expensive \n     investments in smaller classes are likely to be compromised.\n\n                              Flexibility\n\n       CSR policies that allow flexibility in the use of funds \n     help keep the focus on improving learning, teaching, and \n     student achievement. In exchange for accountability, \n     policymakers may consider options that allow schools and \n     districts latitude to tailor decisions to the needs of their \n     own circumstances and students--for example, allowing a \n     class-size average rather than mandating a cap or encouraging \n     creative scheduling.\n\n                           Program evaluation\n\n       CSR programs should build in evaluation and research \n     components, particularly focused on unanswered questions, \n     such as the outcomes of creative approaches to CSR.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we came together several years ago in a \nbipartisan manner, both sides of the Senate, Republican and Democrat, \nand said we have made a great accomplishment, we have targeted Federal \nfunds to a program that we know will work, reducing class size. Studies \nshow it, from the Educational Testing Service in 1997 to the Star study \nin 1989, to the Wisconsin State study, to the New York study which I \nwill read to you very quickly. A teacher said:\n\n       Now that I have seen the difference a small class makes, I \n     don't want to go back to being a policeman.\n\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\n\n  I think that says it for all of us. We know in first, second, and \nthird grades, if we reduce the class sizes, our kids will learn the \nbasics--math, reading, and science--that they will go on to college, \nthere will be fewer discipline problems, and we will have accomplished \nsomething great.\n  Senator Harkin has been out in his State, as many of us have, in the \nclassrooms that are a direct recipient of our class size money. I \nchallenge my colleagues to do the same because when you do, you can \nthen walk away and say: I did something realistic and I can see it in \nthe faces of these kids.\n  We have the opportunity now to continue that program, and I urge this \namendment's adoption.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I hope we can continue to work in a \nbipartisan way and agree to an orderly process. We have had good debate \nand good amendments. I hope we can continue to do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that with respect to the next sequence of \namendments in order to S. 2, the offering of the amendment by Senator \nLieberman be temporarily postponed and that I be recognized to offer \nthe Lott-Gregg amendment on Monday beginning at 3 p.m. I further ask \nconsent that the Lott-Gregg amendment be temporarily laid aside when \nthe Senate reconvenes on Tuesday in order for Senator Lieberman to \noffer his amendment. I finally ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate conducts the votes with respect to the two first-degree \namendments, the votes occur in the original order as outlined in the \nconsent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, we will be voting on Tuesday. On our side--and the leader can \ncorrect me--there are probably seven substantive amendments. As the \nleader knows, having talked with all of us, we are willing to enter \ninto time agreements on this so we can move the process forward. We \nwant to try to do that in the early part of the week.\n  I know the leader has other matters for consideration by the Senate. \nTonight we cannot make that request, but I hope both Senator Daschle \nand the majority leader can, at least in the first part of the week, \nsee if we can enter into a time sequence.\n  We had good discussions and debate today. I believe with the debate \nwe had on the substitute, plus on S. 2, we have covered the ground \npretty well. There are some areas we perhaps need to give additional \nfocus. There was no time indicated by the majority leader for \ndisposition of those two amendments. I am trying to find out the \nintention of the leader so we can at least tell our people when they \ncan expect some followup.\n  Mr. LOTT. If Senator Kennedy will yield under his reservation so I \nmay respond, Senator Daschle and I have been talking about this and \nother issues. We do not have votes scheduled on Monday because we have \nsome Senators who have commitments they cannot change. That is the \nreason we rearranged the order. Plus, we do have some Senators who want \nto attend the services for Cardinal O'Connor in New York City on \nMonday.\n  Next week, we need to take up and consider, if possible, the Africa \nfree trade and CBI enhancement conference report, which the House \npassed today by an overwhelming vote. We have to figure that into the \nmix during the day Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.\n  Having said that, I believe we do have some additional amendments to \nwhich we can agree. I hope Monday during the day--I assume the managers \nwill be here--Monday afternoon we can work on those amendments, and \nMonday morning, if we work toward having the vote or votes, if \nnecessary, by noon on Tuesday, then we will have the next tranche of \namendments worked out.\n  Let me say on Senator Daschle's behalf and mine, it is not easy \nbecause there are a lot of Senators on both sides who are anxious to \nparticipate, so we have to come up with some order. I got into that a \nlittle bit today with a couple of my colleagues on this side, and I \nknow the Senator from Massachusetts was doing it on his side. We need \nto work with those Senators and get the next two, four--whatever we can \nget--agreed to and look forward to doing some of those Tuesday \nafternoon, and then we may have to look at moving Tuesday afternoon, \nperhaps, to the Africa-CBI conference report. We are going to make a \ngood-faith effort on both sides, I am sure, to get the next tranche of \namendments and look to have a vote Tuesday morning if at all possible, \nand I think it will be.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, section 302(a) of the Congressional \nBudget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 provides that the statement \nof managers accompanying a conference report on a concurrent resolution \non the budget contain allocations, consistent with the resolution, of \ntotal new budget authority and total outlays among each committee of \nthe House and Senate.\n  Allocations must cover the first year covered by the resolution and \nthe sum of all years covered by the resolution. Unfortunately when we \nwere preparing the statement of managers to accompany the fiscal year \n2001 budget resolution, (H. Con. Res. 290, H. Rpt. 106-577) the table \nindicating the five-year allocation to the committees of the Senate was \ninadvertently omitted. The table indicating the first year allocation \nwas included as well as both the first and five-year allocation for the \nHouse committees.\n  I have discussed this matter with the ranking member of the Committee \non the Budget, Senator Lautenberg, and we have agreed that we would \ninsert the appropriate table here in the Record and ask unanimous \nconsent that this table serve as the 5-year allocation under section \n302 of the Budget Act as if it had been included in the statement of \nmanagers at the time the conference report was filed in the House of \nRepresentatives. I therefore make that request now of the Presiding \nOfficer.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  SENATE COMMITTEE BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAY ALLOCATIONS PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET\n                                          ACT; 5-YEAR TOTAL: 2001-2005\n                                            [In millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Direct spending jurisdiction          Entitlements funded in annual\n                                     --------------------------------------          appropriations acts\n              Committee                                                    -------------------------------------\n                                       Budget authority       Outlays        Budget authority       Outlays\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry             61,372             43,745            114,319             67,436\nArmed Services......................            267,298            266,974                  0                  0\nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.             32,946            -10,841                  0                  0\nCommerce, Science, and                           58,896             38,339              4,061              4,040\n Transportation.....................\nEnergy and Natural Resources........             11,570             11,364                200                232\nEnvironment and Public Works........            178,735              8,662                  0                  0\nFinance.............................          3,750,519          3,746,218            968,539            969,101\nForeign Relations...................             58,705             52,862                  0                  0\nGovernmental Affairs................            324,981            318,539                  0                  0\nJudiciary...........................             26,693             25,704              1,265              1,265\nHealth, Education, Labor, and                    49,020             46,534              6,985              7,007\n Pensions...........................\nRules and Administration............                462                451                  0                  0\nVeterans' Affairs...................              6,705              6,665            133,540            133,181\nIndian Affairs......................                921                941                  0                  0\nSmall Business......................                  0               -745                  0                  0\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3497-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3497-S3499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n              FOR CONTINUED U.S. ENGAGEMENT IN THE BALKANS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, next week the Appropriations Committee is \nexpected to mark up several bills that will incorporate the \nAdministration's supplemental request for this fiscal year. Included in \nthis request is two point six billion dollars for peacekeeping and \nreconstruction in Kosovo and the surrounding region.\n  In that context, I rise to examine the rapidly changing conditions in \nthe Balkans and to argue for continued vigorous American involvement in \nthe region, including meeting the Administration's supplemental \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, since the end of the Cold War few, if any other parts \nof the world have commanded as much of our attention as the Balkans, \nparticularly the area of the former Yugoslavia. This is no accident. \nThe Balkans were the crucible for the First World War, played a pivotal \nrole in the outcome of the Second World War, and persist as the only \nremaining major area of instability in Europe.\n  As every thoughtful political leader in London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, \nMadrid or other capitals will attest, if the movements in the countries \nof the Balkans toward political democracy, ethnic and religious \ncoexistence, and free market capitalism do not succeed, the resulting \nturmoil will endanger the remarkable peace and prosperity laboriously \ncreated over the past half-century in the countries of the European \nUnion and in other Western democracies.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, for Americans warning of this possibility is \nnot merely an academic exercise. In political, security, and economic \nterms, the United States is a European power. We are tied to the \ncontinent through a web of trade, investment, human contacts, and \nculture to a degree unequaled by relations with any other part of the \nworld. Instability that spread to Western Europe would directly and \nadversely affect the United States of America in a major way.\n  In other words, Mr. President, we do not have the luxury of being \nable to distance ourselves from the Balkans, no matter how emotionally \nappealing such a policy may appear at times.\n  As someone who visits Southeastern Europe on a regular basis, I fully \nunderstand how frustrating dealing with Balkan issues can be. Much of \nthis stunningly beautiful area, with its jumble of ancient peoples, has \nseemingly intractable problems. Americans accustomed to quick solutions \nnaturally become frustrated, especially since we have built up a large \npresence on the ground in several Balkan countries in the last few \nyears and, therefore, know first-hand the complexities involved.\n  But the very diversity of the Balkans means that even if human \nhistory moved in a linear fashion--which it certainly does not--\nprogress toward democracy, human rights, and free markets in \nSoutheastern Europe would necessarily be uneven, moving forward in some \ncountries, stagnating in some, and even regressing in a few.\n  Mr. President, this is precisely what has been happening; the region \nis experiencing ``ups and downs.'' Contrary to popular belief, \nundoubtedly influenced by the proclivity of the mass media to emphasize \nthe negative, there have been several positive developments in the \nBalkans.\n  Slovenia, the northernmost country of the Balkans, is the region's \nsuccess story. It has already established a solid democracy, and its \ntransition to a free-market economy has been so successful that its per \ncapita gross domestic product now exceeds that of a few members of the \nEuropean Union. Slovenia seems certain to be in the next round of NATO \nenlargement, and it is one of the strongest candidates for EU \nmembership.\n  Croatia, which suffered for a decade under the authoritarian rule of \nFranjo Tudjman, elected a new parliament this past January with a \nmoderate, democratic coalition gaining a solid majority. The winner of \nthe February presidential election, Mr. Mesic, is also a democratic \nreformer.\n  Already there has been signs of positive movement from the new regime \nin Zagreb, both domestically and in foreign policy. For example, the \ngovernment has begun investigating corruption from the Tudjman era in \nthe banking and communications sectors. In the international realm, the \nCroatian government has signed an agreement on cooperation with the \nInternational War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. Moreover, the new \ngovernment has closed down illegal television transmission towers in \nBosnia and Herzegovina, which had spread ultra-nationalist programming \nfrom Croatia.\n  In fact, the hard-line obstructionist nationalist Croat leadership in \nBosnia and Herzegovina is running scared, knowing that it has lost its \npatron, the former HDZ regime, in Croatia. It appears that the new \ngovernment in Zagreb has pledged itself to full Dayton implementation, \nincluding a commitment to the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a \nstate.\n  It is debatable whether the ``good example'' set by Zagreb will soon \ninfluence the situation in Serbia; but it is already clear that the \nchange of government in Zagreb is causing Bosnian Croat leaders to re-\nthink their strategy.\n  The local elections in Bosnia last month provided mixed results. In \nthe Republika Srpska, Prime Minister Dodik's coalition lost ground, but \nthere is still hope that the new government being formed will \naccelerate the pace of implementation of the Dayton Accords.\n  In the Federation, reformist Bosnian Croats did not have sufficient \ntime to organize strong opposition to the entrenched HDZ nationalists. \nAs the withdrawal of subsidies from Zagreb to the Bosnian Croat HDZ \ntakes effect, however, the moderate Bosnian Croats may be able to \nincrease their strength in the upcoming national elections.\n  The most heartening developments concern the Bosnian Muslims, the \nlargest of the three major communities in the country. The Muslims have \ndemonstrated an accelerating move away from the nationalist SDA party \nto non-nationalist alternatives, as demonstrated by their electoral \nvictories in several of Bosnia's largest cities.\n  Mr. President, the southern Balkans also show several positive \ntrends, some of them quite remarkable. At the Helsinki Summit of the \nEuropean Union in December 1999, Turkey for the first time was granted \nthe status of candidate for membership. To be sure, any realistic \nanalysis of Turkey's chances would make them long-term, but the \ndevelopment in Helsinki is nonetheless a real breakthrough and is being \nreceived as such by the majority of Turkey's population.\n  Moreover, the devastating earthquakes that rocked both Turkey and \nGreece last summer elicited mutual expressions of popular sympathy from \nboth peoples and have led to a significant warming of relations between \nthese two long-time rivals.\n  Both Bulgaria and Romania are governed by Western-looking, democratic \nfree-marketeers. The closing of the Danube by the NATO bombing in the \nair war last year has had an extremely damaging effect on their already \nshaky economies. Both countries, though, have embarked upon painful, \nbut necessary reforms. The reformers will be sorely tested in upcoming \nnational elections.\n  Macedonia, perhaps the most fragile country in the region, has \nsurvived the trauma of the Kosovo war, with its massive influx of \nhundreds of thousands of refugees, without the violent destabilization \nexpected by many observers, and certainly intended by Milosevic. A \nnewly elected conservative government includes an ethnic Albanian \nparty, but the raw material for an ethnic conflagration persists.\n  The ``downs'' in the Balkan picture, which have been getting the \nlion's share of the publicity, are Serbia proper, Montenegro, and \nKosovo.\n  Certainly the principal negative fact of life in the region is the \ncontinuing presence in power in Serbia of Slobodan Milosevic. My \ncolleagues know well my feelings about this man. In 1993, six years \nbefore the Hague Tribunal made public its indictment, I called \nMilosevic a war criminal to his face at a meeting in his office in \nBelgrade.\n  Milosevic, quite simply, has been a disaster for the Serbian people. \nHe has destroyed Serbia's economy, eviscerated its body politic, and \ndebased its reputation internationally. It is not easy to start--and \nlose--four wars in eight years, but Milosevic has managed to do it. He \nis a man of only one ideological conviction: that he must hold\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\nonto power in Serbia. To retain power he is ready to use any means, \nincluding ruining the lives of the people he theoretically represents.\n  Unfortunately, Milosevic clings to power through a combination of \nruthlessness, tactical cunning, and the inability until now of the \nSerbian opposition to forge a permanent anti-Milosevic coalition that \ncould be compelling for the Serbian electorate. There is some basis for \ncautious optimism that the political opposition in Serbia may be \nunifying in its opposition to Milosevic. Last month the opposition was \nable to bring out to the streets of Belgrade a massive crowd of more \nthan two hundred thousand demonstrators against Milosevic.\n  The gangland quality of life in contemporary Serbia is demonstrated \nby the recent public machine-gun slayings of ``Arkan,'' the Yugoslav \ndefense minister, and other ultra-nationalist figures. Most recently \nindependent journalists in Serbia have been given implicit death \nthreats--from no less a personage than Mr. Seselj, the deputy prime \nminister! These moves, however, bespeak the increasing weakness and \nfear of the Milosevic regime, not any strength.\n  I should add that another reason that Milosevic has been able to \nsurvive this cold winter is assistance from like-minded dictators. Over \nthe past few months, China made a gift of three hundred million \ndollars, and Iraq contributed much needed oil. It is also extremely \nlikely that Russia and Belarus have funneled assistance to Milosevic.\n  The United States Government is actively supporting the creation of a \ncivil society in Serbia through targeted grants to a variety of \nindependent media, citizens' groups, independent trade unions, and \ntowns controlled by the democratic opposition.\n  Despite Milosevic's malevolent and unscrupulous behavior, I remain \nconvinced that ultimately the pressure from below--and from within his \ngovernment, party, and armed forces--will result in his fall from \npower. What is key is that we not lose our patience or our nerve. I \nwill not put a date on Milosevic's fall, but fall he will, and the \nlong-suffering Serbian people will begin to regain their dignity.\n  Montenegro, the junior partner in the Yugoslav Federation, is \ngoverned by a multi-ethnic, democratic coalition led by President Milo \nDjukanovic. The reformist government of this little republic of less \nthan seven hundred thousand citizens is struggling to avoid being \noverthrown by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who is currently \nscheming about how to undermine Montenegro's democratically elected \ngovernment. His tools are the Yugoslav army and shadowy paramilitary \nforces loyal to him, plus economic pressures applied to its vastly \nsmaller neighbor.\n  We have seen Milosevic starring in this movie before--- in Slovenia, \nin Croatia, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in Kosovo. Milosevic lost \neach time, in the process sacrificing hundreds of thousands of lives \nand causing untold material damage. I can only hope that he has learned \nhis lesson.\n  Kosovo is another ongoing challenge for American policy and \nfortitude. Eleven months after the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops, \nSerbian police, and paramilitaries, the province is still struggling to \nregain a semblance of normalcy. The task is enormous: by the estimate \nof the U.N., some eight hundred ten thousand residents who fled during \nlast year's war have returned to a province in which approximately two-\nthirds of the housing stock was destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Not \nan appealing base on which to rebuild a traumatized society.\n  In that context, the herculean efforts of the international civilian \nand military authorities have had a good measure of success. Despite \nthe understandable headlines detailing revenge killings of Serbs and \nRoma by ethnic Albanians, and of Kosovar Albanians by other Kosovar \nAlbanians, the fact is that the incidence of homicide has dropped \ndramatically over the last several months.\n  The serious upsurge in ethnic violence in the town of Mitrovica \nearlier this year shows that universal security in the province has yet \nto be achieved. The response of KFOR to Mitrovica was to send in \nadditional troops, from different sectors. Also a special prosecutor \nwas appointed by the United Nations to handle Mitrovica. Things boiled \nover there; now the flame has been doused and the lid is back on. We \nwill have to keep an eye on Mitrovica and northern Kosovo.\n  Similarly, the Presevo Valley in southeastern corner of Serbia \nproper, which has a strong ethnic Albanian majority population, is a \npotential flashpoint. Radical elements have been training in the \ndemilitarized zone between Kosovo and Serbia proper, occasionally \nstaging hit-and-run raids on Serbian police. Their motive is clearly to \nprovoke a larger conflict, and then to appeal to KFOR to bail them out. \nWe should not fall for this trap. I am pleased that the Administration \nhas made clear to the radicals that they are on their own, and has \nenlisted the help of responsible Kosovar Albanians to rein them in.\n  With respect to security in Kosovo, however, the overall trend is in \nthe right direction. The drop in the murder rate is due largely to the \nexcellent work of the forty-two thousand, five hundred KFOR troops in \nKosovo, and increasingly to the more than three thousand, one hundred \ninternational police deployed by the U.N. Interim Administration \nMission in Kosovo--known as UNMIK. Eventually four thousand, four \nhundred UNMIK police are to be deployed.\n  Our government must be sure to make its pledged payments to UNMIK on \ntime and to pressure other donor countries to do the same. Cooperation \nbetween UNMIK's chief, Dr. Bernard Kouchner, and KFOR's commander has \nbeen superb. If Dr. Kouchner is given all the tools the way KFOR has \nbeen, then I believe he will be able to do his job successfully.\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, KFOR's commanders have been, in order, \nan Englishman, a German, and now a Spaniard--all under NATO's Supreme \nCommander in Europe, an American.\n  While profound mistrust of KFOR and UNMIK exists among much of the \nSerbian community in Kosovo, a hopeful sign is that observers from the \nSerb community recently joined the power-sharing system UNMIK has set \nup with a broad spectrum of Kosovar Albanian leaders.\n  Much of the Serbs' mistrust--and of widespread unease among the \nKosovar Albanians--stems from the fact that although the homicide rate \nin the province has dropped, other forms of criminality are increasing. \nParticularly worrisome is the influx of organized crime elements from \nAlbania across the porous, mountainous border into Kosovo.\n  We must not allow Kosovo to descend into gang-infested semi-anarchy. \nThis is the principal reason that the promised international funding \nfor UNMIK simply must be delivered promptly. I cannot stress this \nrequirement enough. Our government must pressure the Europeans--who \nhave assumed the primary responsibility for KFOR, UNMIK, and the \nStability Pact for Southeast Europe--immediately to live up to their \npledges.\n  Because of excellent work by the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment and other national and international organizations, there \nare high expectations all over Kosovo that this spring and summer there \nwill be reconstruction on a mass scale all over the province. We must \nbe certain that the international funding is delivered in time, so as \nnot to deflate the Kosovars' and the Kosovo Serbs' hopes and damage our \ncredibility and that of our allies and other cooperating nations.\n  Mr. President, the more I delve into the details of the American and \nother international efforts to rebuild the Balkans--in Kosovo, in \nBosnia and Herzegovina, in Albania, and elsewhere--the more respect I \nhave for our outstanding men and women serving in often difficult and \ndangerous circumstances in our diplomatic service, our armed forces, \nand our aid missions. They are bright, they are dedicated, and they are \ngetting tangible results. This is a side of the story that the American \npublic should hear more about.\n  It is also important that the American public understands that the \noverwhelming majority of KFOR troops, the overwhelming majority of \nUNMIK personnel, and the overwhelming majority of development \nassistance are all being provided by our European allies and other \nfriendly governments. Mr. President, one bright spot of the Kosovo \nstory is that it shows that\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\nburdensharing not only can work, but is working.\n  In Kosovo, perhaps more than anywhere else in the Balkans, however, \neven as we analyze serious current problems, we must never lose sight \nof what the situation would be if we had not acted militarily last \nyear. Milosevic would have gotten away with vile ethnic cleansing on a \nscale unprecedented in Europe for decades, causing untold human misery, \ndestabilizing Macedonia and Albania, irreparably harming the \ncredibility of NATO, and possibly even fracturing the alliance.\n  No, the situation in Kosovo is far from good, but it is incalculably \nbetter than it would have been, had NATO, under President Clinton's \nleadership, not intervened.\n  In early February, at the Munich Conference on Security Policy, the \nU.S. Congressional delegation had breakfast with Lord Robertson, the \nSecretary General of NATO. As he so aptly put it, ``no one should \nexpect a Balkan Switzerland to be created in a few short years.'' But \nthat should not blind us, either to the significant progress already \nachieved, or to the continuing importance to the United States and to \nthe rest of Europe of the struggle for lasting security in the Balkans.\n  We must keep our eye on the prize and redouble our efforts to rebuild \nand stabilize Southeastern Europe. So, once again, I urge my colleagues \non the Appropriations Committee to fully fund, without conditions, the \nAdministration's supplemental request for peacekeeping and \nreconstruction in Kosovo. The stakes are simply too high to do \notherwise.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3499-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3499-S3500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PARK SERVICE SNOWMOBILE BAN\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to talk \nabout the Department of Interior's recent decision to ban snowmobiling \nin most units of the National Park System.\n  While the Interior Department's recent decision will not ban \nsnowmobiling in Minnesota's Voyageurs National Park, it will impact \nsnowmobiling in at least two units of the Park System in my home \nState--Grand Portage National Monument and the St. Croix National \nScenic Riverway. In addition, this decision will greatly impact \nMinnesotans who enjoy snowmobiling, not only in Minnesota, but in many \nof our National Parks, particularly in the western part of our country.\n  When I think of snowmobiling in Minnesota, I think of families and \nfriends. I think of people who come together on their free time to \nenjoy the wonders of Minnesota in a way no other form of transportation \nallows them. I also think of the fact that in many instances \nsnowmobiles in Minnesota are used for much more than just recreation. \nFor some, they're a mode of transportation when snow blankets our \nstate. For others, snowmobiles provide a mode of search and rescue \nactivity. Whatever the reason, snowmobiles are an extremely important \naspect of commerce, travel, recreation, and safety in my home state.\n  Minnesota, right now, is home to over 280,000 registered snowmobiles \nand 20,000 miles of snowmobile trails. According to the Minnesota \nUnited Snowmobilers Association, an association with over 51,000 \nindividual members, Minnesota's 311 snowmobile riding clubs raised \n$264,000 for charity in 1998 alone. Snowmobiling creates over 6,600 \njobs and $645 million of economic activity in Minnesota. Minnesota is \nhome to two major snowmobile manufacturers--Arctic Cat and Polaris. And \nyes, I enjoy my own snowmobiles.\n  People who enjoy snowmobiling come from all walks of life. They are \nfarmers, lawyers, nurses, construction workers, loggers, and miners. \nThey are men, women, and young adults. They are people who enjoy the \noutdoors, time with their families, and the recreational opportunities \nour diverse climate offers. These are people who not only enjoy the \nnatural resources through which they ride, but understand the important \nbalance between enjoying and conserving our natural resources.\n  Just 3 years ago, I took part in a snowmobile ride through a number \nof cities and trails in northern Minnesota. While our ride didn't take \nus through a unit of the National Park Service, it did take us through \nparks, forests, and trails that sustain a diverse amount of plant and \nanimal species. I talked with my fellow riders and I learned a great \ndeal about the work their snowmobile clubs undertake to conserve \nnatural resources, respect the integrity of the land upon which they \nride, and educate their members about the need to ride responsibly.\n  The time I spent with these individuals and the time I have spent on \nmy own snowmobiles have given me a great respect for both the quality \nand enjoyment of the recreational experience and the need to ride \nresponsibly and safely. They have also given me reason to strongly \ndisagree with the approach the Park Service has chosen in banning \nsnowmobiles from our National Parks.\n  I was stunned to read of the severity of the Park Service's ban and \nthe rhetoric used by Assistant Secretary Donald J. Barry in announcing \nthe ban. In the announcement, Assistant Secretary Barry said, ``The \ntime has come for the National Park Service to pull in its welcome mat \nfor recreational snowmobiling.'' He went on to say that snowmobiles \nwere, ``machines that are no longer welcome in our national parks.'' \nThese are not the words of someone who is approaching a sensitive issue \nin a thoughtful way. These are the words of a bureaucrat whose agenda \nhas been handwritten for him by those opposed to snowmobiling.\n  The last time I checked, Congress is supposed to be setting the \nagenda of the Federal agencies. The last time I checked, Congress \nshould be determining who is and is not welcome on our Federal lands. \nAnd the last time I checked, the American people own our public-lands--\nnot the Clinton administration and certainly not Donald J. Barry.\n  In light of such brazenness, it's amazing to me that this \nadministration, and some of my colleagues in Congress, question our \nobjections to efforts that would allow the Federal Government to \npurchase even larger tracts of private land. If we were dealing with \nFederal land managers who considered the intent of Congress, who worked \nwith local officials, or who listened to the concerns of those most \nimpacted by Federal land-use decisions, we might be more inclined to \nconsider their efforts. But when this administration, time and again, \nthumbs its nose at Congress and acts repeatedly against the will of \nlocal officials and American citizens, it is little wonder the some in \nCongress might not want to turn over more private land to this \nadministration.\n  I cannot begin to count the rules, regulations, and executive orders \nthis administration has undertaken without even the most minimal \nconsideration for Congress or local officials. It has happened in state \nafter state, to Democrats and Republicans, and with little or no regard \nfor the rule or the intent of law. I want to quote Interior Secretary \nBruce Babbitt from an article in the National Journal, dated May 22, \n1999. In the article, Secretary Babbitt was quoted as saying:\n\n       When I got to town, what I didn't know was that we didn't \n     need more legislation. But we looked around and saw we had \n     authority to regulate grazing policies. It took 18 months to \n     draft new grazing regulations. On mining, we have also found \n     that we already had authority over, well, probably two-thirds \n     of the issues in contention. We've switched the rules of the \n     game. We are not trying to do anything legislatively.\n\n  That is a remarkable statement by an extremely candid man, and his \nintent to work around Congress is clearly reflected in this most recent \ndecision. Clearly, Secretary Babbit and his staff felt the rules that \nthey've created allow them to ``pull the welcome mat for recreational \nusers'' to our national parks.\n  As further evidence of this administration's abuse of Congress--and \ntherefore of the American people--Environmental Protection Agency \nAdministrator Carol Browner was quoted in the same article as saying:\n\n       We completely understand all of the executive tools that \n     are available to us--And boy do we use them.\n\n  While Ms. Browner's words strongly imply an intent to work around \nCongress, at least she did not join Secretary Babbit in coming right \nout and admitting it.\n  Mr. President, I for one am getting a little sick and tired of \nwatching this\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\nadministration force park users out of their parks, steal land from our \nStates and counties, impose costly new regulations on farmers and \nbusinesses without scientific justification, and force Congress to \nbecome a spectator on many of the most controversial and important \nissues before the American people.\n  It is getting to the point where I am not sure what to tell my \nconstituents. I have been on the phone with snowmobilers in Minnesota \nand they ask what can be done. I start to explain that because of the \nfilibuster in the Senate and the President's ability to veto, it will \nbe difficult for Congress to take any action. I have found myself \nsaying that a lot lately. Whether it is regulations on Total Maximum \nDaily Loads, efforts to put 50 million acres of forests in wilderness, \nor new rules to regulate a worker's house should they choose to work at \nhome, this aAdministration just doesn't respect the legislative process \nor the role of Congress. Nor does this administration respect the jobs, \ntraditions, cultures, of lifestyles of millions of Americans. If you \nare an American who has yet to be negatively impacted by the actions of \nthis administration, just wait your turn because you were evidently at \nthe end of the list. Sooner or later, if they get their way in the next \nfew months, they're going to kill your job, render your private \nproperty unusable, and ban you from accessing public lands that have \nbeen accessible for generations.Regrettably, many of us in Congress are \nnow left with the proposition of telling our constituents that we must \nwait for a new administration. I have to tell them that this \nadministration is on its way out the door and they're employing a \nscorched earth exit strategy. And I have to warn them that the \nsituation could get worse if a certain Vice President finds himself \nresiding at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue next year.\n  I have to admit, there is nothing pleasurable about telling your \nconstituents to wait until next year. I think it is important to \nremember that, as Senators, we are the representatives of every one of \nour constituents. When I have to tell a constituent that Congress has \nlost its power to act on this matter, I am actually telling that \nconstituent that he or she has lost their power on this matter. When I \nhave to tell a snowmobiler that the administration doesn't care what \nCongress has to say about snowmobile in national parks, I am really \ntelling him or her that the administration doesn't care what the \nAmerican people have to say about snowmobiling in national parks. Well, \nI doubt any of us could've said that any better than Donald J. Barry \nsaid it himself.\n  When forging public policy, those of us in Congress often have to \nconsider the opinions of the state and local officials who are most \nimpacted. If I'm going to support an action on public land, I usually \ncontact the state and local officials who represent the area to see \nwhat they have to say. I know that if I don't get their perspective, I \nmight miss a detail that could improve my efforts. I also know that the \nlocal officials can tell me if my efforts are necessary or if they're \nmisplaced. They can alert me to areas where I need to forge a broader \nconsensus and of ways in which my efforts might actually hurt the \npeople I represent. I think that is a prudent way to forge public \npolicy and a fair way to deal with state and local officials.\n  I know, however, that no one from the Park Service ever contacted me \nto see how I felt about banning snowmobiling in Park Service units in \nMinnesota. I was never consulted on snowmobiling usage in Minnesota or \non any complaints that I might have received from my constituents. \nWhile I've not checked with every local official in Minnesota, not one \nlocal official has called me to say that the Park Service contacted \nthem. In fact, while I knew the Park Service was considering taking \naction to curb snowmobile usage in some Parks, I had no idea the Park \nService was considering an action so broad, and so extreme, nor did I \nthink they would issue it this quickly.\n  This quick, overreaching action by the Park Service, I believe, was \nunwarranted. It did not allow time for federal, state, or local \nofficials to work together on the issue. It didn't bring snowmobile \nusers to the table to discuss the impact of the decision. It didn't \nallow time for Congress and the Administration to look at all of the \navailable options or to differentiate between parks with heavy \nsnowmobile usage and those with occasional usage. This decision stands \nas a dramatic example of how not to conduct policy formulation and is \nan affront to the consideration American citizens deserve from their \nelected officials.\n  I hope we take a hard look at this decision and call the \nadministration before Senate Committees for hearings. I have long \nbelieved that we can have an impact on these matters by holding strong \noversight hearings and by forcing the Administration to account for its \nactions. We cannot, however, simply stand by and watch as the \nAdministration continues its quest for even greater power at the \nexpense of the deliberative legislative processes envisioned by the \nfounders of our country. Secretary Babbit, Administrator Browner, and \nDonald J. Barry may believe they're above working with Congress, but \nonly we can make sure they're reminded, in the strongest possible \nterms, that when they neglect Congress they're neglecting the American \npeople.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3500-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3500-S3501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONTINUING SENATE STALL ON JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I, again, urge the Senate to take the \nresponsible action necessary to fill the 80 judicial vacancies around \nthe country. The Senate has confirmed only seven judges all year. We \nare in our fifth month and have only confirmed seven judges. We have 80 \nvacancies. There are six nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar, \nincluding Tim Dyk, who has twice been reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. Mr. Dyk's nomination has been pending over 2 years. Does \nthis all sound familiar? It is because the Senate continues to fail in \nits responsibility to the American people and the Federal courts to \ntake action on judicial nominations.\n  The stall has been going on since 1996, with a few brief burst of \nactivity when the editorial writers and public attention has focused \nattention of these shortcomings. When there is scrutiny, then the \nmajority puts through a few more.\n  The Judiciary Committee is not doing any better. It has held the \nequivalent of two hearings all year. In 5 months, it has held the \nequivalent of just two hearings on judicial nominations. We heard from \nonly two nominees to the courts of appeal and only nine to the district \ncourts. The committee has reported only six nominees all year, just \nsix.\n  I know the Senate has built in to the schedule a lot of vacation and \na number of recesses. Maybe we ought to take a day or two out of one of \nthose vacations and have some hearings and some votes on the \nconfirmations of the scores of judges that are needed.\n  We have seen the majority announce with great fanfare that the Senate \nwould have more hearings in the Judiciary Committee on Elian Gonzalez \nthis year. The American public responded so loudly and correctly to \nthat proposal for senatorial child abuse that the majority quickly \nbacked off, trying to find some face-saving way to cancel the hearings. \nWell, without those hearings we had a whole day this week available. \nInstead of senatorial child abuse, why not have hearings on judges? We \ncould have done that.\n  The committee markup scheduled for this morning was canceled. We \ncould have used that time for a Judiciary hearing or proceeded and \nreported a few judicial nominees.\n  Most afternoons are free around here this year. We could have \nhearings a few afternoons a week and start to catch up on our \nresponsibilities.\n  Over the last weekend, the President again called upon us to do our \njob and complete consideration of these nominations without additional \ndelay. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, a Republican, has \nscolded the Senate in this regard.\n  I have urged the Senate time and time again to fulfill our \nresponsibilities. I wish we would do this, take a couple days less \nvacation time, work a few afternoons, and confirm the judges that we \nneed around the country.\n  A couple of years ago, I compared the Senate pace of confirming \njudges with\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\nthe home run pace of such players as Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Ken \nGriffey, Jr. Over the past couple of years when I have used this \nexample of how much better they do hitting home runs than we do at \nconfirming judges, my friend from Utah and I have gone back and forth \nwith regard to this kind of comparison. He has said I should not be \ncomparing the Senate to some of the greatest home run hitters of all \ntime. I understand his reluctance since this Senate certainly has not \nbeen a home run hitter as far as confirming judges.\n  But when I looked at the sports pages today I was struck by how \npoorly we are doing. Keep in mind, that the Senate has been in session \na couple of months longer than the baseball season, that we had a 2-\nmonth head start. Nonetheless, as of today, there are 27 baseball \nplayers who have hit more home runs than the Senate has confirmed \njudges. These are not just the stars. The Senate does not fail in \ncomparison to just McGwire and Sosa, but in comparison to--I know these \nare names you will not all recognize and I see the pages coming to \nattention and see how many they know--the White Sox' Paul Konerko; the \nCubs' Shane Andrews; the Rockies' Todd Helton; the Brewers' Geoff \nJenkins; the Angels' Troy Glaus; the Royals' Mike Sweeney. Not legends \nyet, but fine people and players who have all hit more home runs than \nthe Senate--even with a 2-month head start.\n\n  In fact, I may be doing a disservice to these major-leaguers by \ncomparing them to the Senate. Why? Because these ballplayers are acting \nprofessionally and doing what they are paid to do. We are not acting \nprofessionally. We are not fulfilling our constitutional \nresponsibilities. We are not doing what we are paid to do. We are \nrefusing to vote yes or no on these judges.\n  The vacancies on the courts of appeals around the country are \nparticularly acute. Vacancies on the courts of appeals are continuing \nto rob these courts of approximately 12.3 percent of their authorized \nactive strength, as they have for the last several years. The Ninth \nCircuit continues to be plagued by multiple vacancies. We should be \nmaking progress on the nominations of Barry Goode, Judge Johnnie B. \nRawlinson and James E. Duffy, Jr., as well as that of Richard Tallman.\n  I am acutely aware that there is no one on the Ninth Circuit from the \nState of Hawaii. I know that federal law requires that ``there be at \nleast one circuit judge in regular active service appointed from the \nresidents of each state in that circuit,'' 28 U.S.C. 44(c), and I would \nlike to see us proceed to comply with the law and confirm Mr. Duffy, as \nwell as the other well-qualified nominees to that Court of Appeals \nwithout further delay.\n  The Fifth Circuit continues to labor under a circuit emergency \ndeclared last year by its Chief Judge Carolyn Dineen King. We should be \nmoving the nominations of Alston Johnson and Enrique Moreno to that \nCircuit to help it meet its responsibilities.\n  Earlier this year I received a copy of a letter from Judge Gilbert \nMerritt, formerly Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit, concerning the \nmultiple vacancies plaguing that Circuit. Judge Merritt was disturbed \nby a report that the Judiciary Committee would not be moving any \nnominees for the Sixth Circuit this year. We should be moving on the \nnominations of Kathleen McCree Lewis, Kent Markus, and Helene White. \nJudge Merritt wrote to us two months ago, stating:\n\n       The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals now has four vacancies. \n     Twenty-five per cent of the seats on the Sixth Circuit are \n     vacant. The Court is hurting badly and will not be able to \n     keep up with its work load due to the fact that the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee has acted on none of the nominations to \n     our Court. One of the vacancies is five years old and no vote \n     has ever been taken. One is two years old. We have lost many \n     years of judge time because of the vacancies.\n       By the time the next President is inaugurated, there will \n     be six vacancies on the Court of Appeals. Almost half of the \n     Court will be vacant and will remain so for most of 2001 due \n     to the exigencies of the nomination process. Although the \n     President has nominated candidates, the Senate has refused to \n     take a vote on any of them.\n       Our Court should not be treated in this fashion. The \n     public's business should not be treated this way. The \n     litigants in the federal courts should not be treated this \n     way. The remaining judges on a court should not be treated \n     this way. The situation in our Court is rapidly deteriorating \n     due to the fact that 25% of the judgeships are vacant. \n     Each active judge of our Court is now participating in \n     deciding more than 550 cases a year--a case load that is \n     excessive by any standard.\n       In addition, we have almost 200 death penalty cases that \n     will be facing us before the end of next year. I presently \n     have six pending before me right now and many more in the \n     pipeline. Although the death cases are very time consuming \n     (the records often run to 5000 pages), we are under very \n     short deadlines imposed by Congress for acting on these \n     cases. Under present circumstances, we will be unable to meet \n     these deadlines. Unlike the Supreme Court, we have no \n     discretionary jurisdiction and must hear every case.\n       The Founding Fathers certainly intended that the Senate \n     ``advise'' as to judicial nomination, i.e., consider, debate \n     and vote up or down. They surely did not intend that the \n     Senate, for partisan or factional reasons, would remain \n     silent and simply refuse to give any advice or consider and \n     vote at all, thereby leaving the courts in limbo, \n     understaffed and unable properly to carry out their \n     responsibilities for years.\n\n  Likewise, the Fourth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit and the District of \nColumbia Circuit continue to have multiple vacancies. Shame on the \nSenate for perpetuating these crises in so many Courts of Appeals \naround the country.\n  By this time in 1992, the Senate had confirmed 25 judges and the \nCommittee had held 6 confirmation hearings for judicial nominees. By \nthis date in 1988, the Senate had confirmed 21 judges and the Committee \nhad held 7 hearings. By this time in 1998, the Senate had confirmed 17 \njudges and the Committee had held 5 hearings. This year we remain \nleagues behind any responsible pace.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate has not built upon the progress we had made \nfilling judicial vacancies following Chief Justice Rehnquist's remarks \nin his 1997 report on the state of the federal judiciary. Last year, \nfaced with 100 federal judicial vacancies, the Senate confirmed only 34 \nnew judges. This year we will again be facing 100 vacancies. Already we \nhave seen 87 vacancies and have so far responded with the confirmation \nof only 7 judges.\n  I have challenged the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to \nreturn to the pace it met in 1998 when we held 13 confirmation hearings \nand confirmed 65 judges. That approximates the pace in 1992, when a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate acted to confirm 66 judges during \nPresident Bush's final year in office.\n  There is a myth that judges are not traditionally confirmed in \nPresidential election years. That is not true. Recall that 64 judges \nwere confirmed in 1980, 44 in 1984, 42 in 1988 when a Democratic \nmajority in the Senate confirmed Reagan nominees and, as I have noted, \n66 in 1992 when a Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed 66 Bush \nnominees.\n  Our federal judiciary cannot afford another unproductive election-\nyear session like 1996 when a Republican majority in the Senate \nconfirmed only 17 judges. These 17 confirmations in 1996 were an \nanomaly that should not be repeated. Since then we have had years of \nslower and lower confirmations and heavy backlogs in many federal \ncourts.\n  Working together the Senate can join with the President to confirm \nwell-qualified, diverse and fair-minded judges to fulfill the needs of \nthe federal courts across the country. I urge the Republican leadership \nto join us in making the federal administration of justice a top \npriority for the Senate for the rest of the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3501-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3501-S3502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the National \nDay of Prayer, Thursday, May 4. Today is a special and exceptional \nopportunity for all citizens of our country to join together in prayer.\n  Days of prayer have been a fundamental part of our American heritage \nsince 1775, when the Continental Congress, recognizing the need for \nguidance as it undertook the enormous challenge of forming a new \nNation, designated a time for prayer. President Abraham Lincoln \ncontinued this tradition. In 1863, in the midst of the Civil War, he \nproclaimed a day of ``humiliation, fasting, and prayer.''\n  The National Day of Prayer has been celebrated formally since its \nenactment by Congress in 1952. In 1988, President Reagan signed a bill \nsetting the\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\nNational Day of Prayer on the first Thursday of every May. Now, each \nyear, the President signs a proclamation encouraging all Americans to \npray on this day.\n  The theme for this year's National Day of Prayer is ``PRAY2K: \nAmerica's Hope for the New Millennium.'' During the times of both \ntriumph and adversity that surely lie ahead, I know prayer will help \nAmerica's leaders and citizens to direct our country on the right path \nfor the new millennium.\n  In the 1st Century A.D., the apostle Paul wrote to the Philippians, \ntelling them, ``Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and \nsupplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to \nGod.''\n  It is my hope the citizens of my home state of Minnesota, and people \nacross this Nation, will take that advice and present the concerns of \nthe country in prayer not only on May 4, but every day of the year. I \nknow many thousands of students will gather today at the State Capitol \nin Minnesota, to pray for their leaders and their peers in an event \nentitled ``Share the Light 2000.'' I applaud their efforts and commend \nthem in their commitment to this important day.\n  I thank everyone involved in making this day possible year after year \nand all those who will take part in the National Day of Prayer. May the \nspirit that fills our hearts this day remain strong always.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today we celebrate the National Day of \nPrayer, set aside as a day to humbly come before God, seeking His \nguidance for our leaders and His grace upon us as a people. I would \nlike to take this occasion to implore my fellow Americans to remember \nwhy it is that prayer is so important for our nation.\n  Since the earliest days of America's heritage, we have been richly \nblessed by God. We have been granted liberty, prosperity, and a measure \nof peace unknown to most nations throughout history. Even during \nperiods of hardship, God has given us strength to endure, and has used \nour tribulations to mold us into a better nation.\n  While we daily enjoy God's bountiful provisions, we need only look at \nour nation's history to realize that His blessing has not been granted \nto us by accident. America has been blessed as a result of our historic \nreliance upon Him. From the moment that Christopher Columbus first set \nfoot in the New World until today, Americans have trusted God and \nsought to follow His direction. Columbus prayed to God for strength and \nguidance to help his companions endure the difficult voyage to the New \nWorld. Our founding fathers looked to God in prayer for wisdom to \ncreate a government that would ensure freedom and liberty. Through war \nand depression, America called out to God for strength and courage. In \ntimes of prosperity, we praised God for his many blessings.\n  God's blessing does not come without expectations, however. God \ncommands us to obey Him and follow His laws. When calling for a day of \nnational humiliation, fasting and prayer in 1863, President Abraham \nLincoln admonished our nation in the following statement:\n\n       We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of \n     Heaven. We have been preserved these many years in peace and \n     prosperity. We have grown in numbers, wealth and power as no \n     other nation has ever grown.\n       But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious \n     Hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched \n     and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the \n     deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were \n     produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own.\n       Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-\n     sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving \n     grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us!\n       It behooves us then to humble ourselves before the offended \n     Power, to confess our national sins and to pray for clemency \n     and forgiveness.\n\n  Those words are as true today as they were when spoken by Abraham \nLincoln many years ago. God has given us commands to follow so that we \nmight be able to fully enjoy His creation and receive the benefit of \nHis blessing. When our nation has turned our back on God's commands, we \nhave been plagued by such tragedies as slavery, crime, drug abuse, and \nabortion. If our nation is to continue to be blessed by God, we must \nrenew our commitment to God daily through prayer.\n  President Ronald Reagan designated the first Thursday in May to \ncelebrate the National Day of Prayer. My challenge is to make every day \na day of prayer, so that we might follow God's will and continue to \nreceive His blessing into the 21st century and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3502-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SAFE SCHOOLS AND SENSIBLE GUN LAWS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the year that has passed since the tragic \nevents at Columbine High School has been a time of soul searching for \nmany Americans. We have had to ask ourselves some troubling questions. \nHow did we let this happen? Why have we failed to pass sensible gun \nsafety measures? Why doesn't the safety of our children count as much \nin Congress as the lobbying muscle of the National Rifle Association, \nNRA? Why did it take 15 deaths at Columbine to get us to take notice? \nWhy wasn't a single death of a school child enough to make us realize \nthe danger to which we have exposed our children in schools across the \nland?\n  Speeches alone will not turn the tide in the battle over sensible gun \nlaws. But those of us who believe we must do more to close the \nloopholes in the law which give minors access to guns have to match the \nsingle-mindedness of a single issue group like the NRA with our own \nfocused determination.\n  Just a few weeks ago, knowing that Congress was about to recess after \nagain failing to take action on gun safety legislation, I offered these \nwords:\n\n       For the students of Columbine, every day is a struggle, \n     every day takes another act of courage. There is nothing we \n     can do in Congress to change that, but there is something we \n     can do to protect other students from the nightmares, the \n     anger, and the pain, as told by these students. Congress owes \n     it to Columbine and to the American people to try to end \n     school shootings and reduce access to guns among young \n     people. As of the one-year anniversary, Congress has failed \n     to do so.\n\n  Over the last year, many Americans have decided to speak out on this \nissue. They are fed up with the intolerable level of gun violence in \nthis country. They are outraged by the sight of a chain of preschoolers \nfleeing hand-in-hand from a deranged gunman. And, they are disheartened \nby the thought of a first grader shooting another first grader.\n  On Mothers' Day, May 14, they will bring a powerful message to \nWashington and to 30 communities across the Nation, including Lansing: \nit is time for Congress to pass commonsense gun legislation. What began \n9 months ago, with two mothers and unparalleled dedication, has become \nthe Million Mom March, the first-ever national march for gun safety. As \na Dad who supports this march, I plan to walk along side Michigan \nmothers, future mothers, and all those willing to be ``honorary \nmothers'' calling for sensible gun laws and safe kids.\n  In a few weeks, another school year will come to an end, but the push \nto enact sensible gun legislation will continue during this Congress, \nand every one thereafter, until we get it done. And, because of the \nefforts of the Million Mom Marchers and other Americans who are \nspeaking out on this issue, I believe we will prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3502-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3502-S3506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       INCREASING FEDERAL INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues an important letter dated March 22, 2000 sent to our \nSenate leadership by forty-seven leaders of our high technology \ncompanies, universities and labor organizations who are members of the \nhighly-respected Council on Competitiveness. The letter argues for a \nsignificant increase in federal Research and Development funding as key \nto our economic future. It also points out that much of the current \ntechnology talent shortage Congress has been spending so much time on \ncould be alleviated through increased R support, since that funding \nsupports our technology education and training system. It is frankly \nunique in my Senate experience to see a letter signed by such a \nsignificant segment of our nation's technology leaders and I hope the \nSenate will heed its counsel.\n  This letter comes to us in the context of the recently passed Budget \nResolution which calls for a small increase in federal investments in \nscience and technology over last year's levels. I believe that a strong \nbipartisan majority\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\nof the Senate would agree that more is needed. Past investments in \nresearch, made in all scientific disciplines and supporting work \nperformed in universities, industry, and government labs, have been the \ndriving force for creating the technologies that have driven our high \ntech economic boom, preserved our national security, and created \nfantastic new advances in medical care. The Senate has recognized this, \nand last year passed the Federal Research Investment Act (S. 296) \nunanimously--legislation which had 42 bipartisan cosponsors and which \ncalls for a doubling of funding for civilian science and technology \nover the next decade.\n  I note that this year the Administration has submitted an aggressive \nprogram for civilian science investments for many key agencies, \nconsistent with both the spirit and text of the Senate's legislation, \nand with the points made in the letter. In particular, I want to call \nattention to the Administration's efforts to restore balance to the \nfederal research portfolio by aggressively funding work in the physical \nsciences and engineering, through programs at the National Science \nFoundation and Department of Energy. Consistent with the March 22nd \nmessage sent to us by our country's technology leadership, I hope the \nCongressional Appropriations Committees will be able to support \ncritical civilian federal Research and Development programs at least at \nthe levels called for in the FY01 Administration Budget Request. This \ninvestment, administered by the National Science Foundation, National \nInstitutes of Health, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, and other agencies, funds university, government \nlab, and industrial efforts to develop the technologies that energize \nour economy and protect our health.\n  I also hope the Congress will increase funding for the Department of \nDefense's Science and Technology program--whose products are critical \nto our security. Defense science and technology has in the past given \nus the technologies--including stealth, advanced computing, the Global \nPositioning System, and precision munitions--that have provided our \ndefense technology edge and led to our victories in the Gulf and \nKosovo. These investments have been drastically reduced over the \nyears--risking both our national security and our technological \nleadership in a variety of key physical sciences and engineering \ndisciplines.\n\n  On April 5th, I and the other members of the Senate Science and \nTechnology Caucus had the opportunity to learn about an example of \nexcellent federally-funded science--the fantastic new world of \nnanotechnology--from a group of world renowned academics and industrial \nresearchers. Investments in nanotechnology will help create the systems \nthat will shrink microelectronics down to the scale of atoms and \nmolecules and create entire chemistry labs on a single computer chip, \npotentially leading to a technology revolution along the lines of those \ngenerated by the transistor and the Internet. One of my constituents, \nProfessor Mark Reed of Yale University, is already taking steps to turn \nfederal investments in fundamental nanotechnology research into \ntechnologies that will enhance our nation's productivity. He recently \nannounced the creation of a single molecule electronic switch, using a \nchemical process called ``self-assembly.'' A nano-scale switch is a \nbreakthrough that may lead to huge performance improvements in digital \nelectronics. Professor Reed has just established a new company aiming \nto move the integrated electronics world into the era of molecular \nmanufacturing, by making the building blocks of computer circuits out \nof single molecules.\n  But these kinds of commercial ventures and the resulting gains in \nproductivity and economic growth that result will only occur if the \nfederal government maintains and increases its investments in science \nand technology. The Internet, the Human Genome Project, the Space \nShuttle, miracle drugs, and global telecommunications networks are but \na few examples of what previous investments by the federal government \nin science and technology have generated. Current work in \nnanotechnology and other fields supported by sufficient and stable \nfederal investments can also lead to developments that will affect and \nimprove our lives in ways we cannot imagine today. Congress will soon \nenter the annual Appropriations cycle and I hope that our \nAppropriations Committee and Subcommittee leaders over the course of \nthis session can work together in a bipartisan fashion to insure that \nwe adequately invest in our nation's technological future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the March 22nd letter from the Council \non Competitiveness members be printed in the Record in full immediately \nfollowing my remarks. The letter demonstrates to the Congress that our \nconstituents and the leaders of our high-tech industries and \ninstitutions are calling for more far aggressive action in increasing \nFederal support for science and technology research.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Council on Competitiveness,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: As you and your colleagues shape \n     America's budget priorities for 2001, the undersigned members \n     of the Council on Competitiveness urges you to strengthen \n     America's science and technology enterprise.\n       Decades of bipartisan congressional investments have \n     contributed decisively to the current U.S. economic boom. \n     These investments created the advances in knowledge as well \n     as the pool of technical talent that underpin America's \n     competitive advantage in information technology, \n     biotechnology, health science, new materials, and many other \n     critical enablers.\n       Nevertheless, public-sector investments in frontier \n     research have declined sharply relative to the size of the \n     economy. An additional $100 billion would have been invested \n     if the federal share of such research had been maintained at \n     its 1980 level. Physical sciences, math, and engineering have \n     been particularly affected. The recent ramp up of private \n     sector investment in R, while vitally important, is no \n     substitute for the federal role in creating next generation \n     knowledge and technology.\n       We are also training fewer and fewer American scientists, \n     engineers, and mathematicians despite soaring demand for \n     these skills. Education and training of scientists and \n     engineers are tied to federally sponsored research performed \n     in the nation's laboratories and universities. When federal \n     R commitments shrink, so too does the pool of technically \n     trained talent, forcing industry and academia to look abroad \n     for skilled knowledge workers.\n       In this time of prosperity, we ask that you use this year's \n     budget resolution, authorization and appropriations process \n     to start America down the path toward significantly higher \n     long-term investments in our national science and technology \n     enterprise. Your commitment to continued U.S. technological \n     leadership will generate high-wage jobs, economic growth, and \n     a better quality of life for all Americans for decades to \n     come.\n         Raymond V.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nhighlighting a powerful call to action on science and technology \nfunding issued by our nation's high technology, academic, and labor \nleaders.\n  On March 22, 2000, forty-seven CEOs of high technology companies, \nPresidents of our leading universities, and representatives of labor \norganizations came together in an unprecedented Council on \nCompetitiveness letter petitioning Congress for ``significantly higher \nlong-term investments in our national science and technology \nenterprise.'' This investment, they stated, should come in the form of \nincreased ``public-sector investments in frontier research'' such as \nresearch in the ``[p]hysical sciences, math, and engineering.'' This \nletter also includes a clear warning--Congressional failure to \nappropriate more funding for science and technology research will \nthreaten America's competitive advantage in information technology, \nbiotechnology, health science, new materials, and other critical \ntechnology-intensive fields. As we all know, many economists, including \nAlan Greenspan, have asserted that our country's leadership in these \nareas is an important reason for our current economic success. A \nrefusal to support America's dominant position with adequate \nappropriations today threatens our economic success tomorrow.\n  The Council on Competitiveness letter also reveals that increased \nfederal funding to science and technology will positively affect \nanother key policy issue--the scarcity of technologically skilled \nworkers. The debate over whether to raise the number of H1-B visas has \nalerted all of us to the technology industry's critical need for more \nhighly skilled workers. In the New Economy large numbers of \n``knowledge-based'' workers are essential to economic growth. Because \nwe are not training enough American knowledge-based workers, high-tech \ncompanies have asked Congress to increase the number of H1-B visas \ngranted to skilled workers who are willing to immigrate from other \ncountries.\n  Appropriating more funding for science and technology research will \nincrease the number of technologically trained Americans, thus \naddressing the current scarcity of knowledge-based workers. The letter \nexplains that: ``Education and training of scientists and engineers are \ntied to federally sponsored research performed in the nation's \nlaboratories and universities. When federal R commitments shrink, so \ntoo does the pool of technically trained talent, forcing industry and \nacademia to look abroad for skilled knowledge workers.'' I therefore \nurge all my colleagues who support increasing the H1-B cap to support \nincreased federal science and technology funding--we must develop more \nAmerican technology workers.\n  It is important to understand that this letter's signatories are not \nalone in their recommendation for more substantial funding for science \nand technology research. The House Science Committee wisely wrote in a \n1998 study titled ``Unlocking Our Future: Toward a New National Science \nPolicy'' that ``[t]he federal investment in science has yielded \nstunning payoffs. It has spawned not only new products, but also entire \nindustries. To build upon the strength of the research enterprise, we \nmust make federal research funding stable and substantial, maintaining \ndiversity in the federal research portfolio, and promoting creative, \nground breaking research.''\n  Similarly, a Business Week editorial on July 26, 1999 stated that \n``[b]ecause of productivity gains, the economy can now operate at a \nhigher speed without inflation. . . . [P]romoting the New Economy also \nrequires wise policy from Washington. We need to support basic research \nand education at all levels, the seed corn of innovation.''\n  These arguments are supported by noted MIT economist Lester Thurow in \na June, 1999 Atlantic Monthly article, where he comments that: ``[a] \nsuccessful knowledge based economy requires large public investments in \neducation, infrastructure, and research and development. . . . Private \nrates of return on R spending (the financial benefits that accrue to \nthe firm doing the spending) average about 24 percent. But societal \nrates of return on R spending (the economic benefits that accrue to \nthe entire society) are about 66 percent. . . . This result, never \ncontradicted in the economic literature, provides powerful evidence \nthat there are huge positive social spillovers from research and \ndevelopment . . . Because the government doesn't care exactly which \nAmericans reap the benefits, it has a very important role to play in \nR Rates of return on R spending are far above those found \nelsewhere in the economy. Government now pays for about 30 percent of \ntotal R, but with a 66 percent rate of return it should be spending \nmuch more.''\n  In recognition of this need for greater public support of science and \ntechnology research, last year the Senate unanimously passed the \nFederal Research Investment Act (S. 296). This bill would double our \ninvestment in civilian science and technology over the next decade. The \nAdministration also understands how critical publicly funded R is to \nthe country's vitality. Its budget includes a strong and balanced \nprogram which will begin to recharge our sagging R portfolio. The \nadministration's program is consistent with the spirit and the text of \nthe Federal Research Investment Act and the Council on Competitiveness \nletter.\n  Unfortunately, our Congressional Budget Resolution calls only for a \nsmall increase in federal investments in science and technology. We \nhave a chance to make an important investment in our country's future \nand to lay the groundwork for continued American high-tech leadership. \nI urge my colleagues to heed our high-tech, academic, and labor \nleaders' call to action on federal R support and work together to \nachieve more substantial appropriations for science and technology.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join with a \nnumber of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to call attention to \nthe remarkable letter sent to our Senate leadership by the nearly fifty \nmembers of the Council on Competitiveness. The letter points out the \nimportance of basic scientific research to our economy, and shows how \nsuch public-sector investments have been on the decline. When so many \nprominent leaders agree on an issue of public policy, it is incumbent \nupon us to pay attention to their views.\n  I believe that the recent increases in private-sector research are no \nsubstitute for the government's traditional role in funding the most \nbasic research that may or may not yield important discoveries. It is \nthis so-called ``market failure'' in basic research--those making the \ninvestments are not assured of positive outcomes, and cannot \nrealistically capture all of the economic gains from new discoveries--\nthat makes the government's role so vitally important. What's more, the \nprivate sector's new investments have been increasingly focused on \nbiotechnology and product development, while investment in basic \nsciences such as math, chemistry, and physics has experienced sharp \ndeclines. This has important implications for today's workforce, as \nwell as the rate of innovation that will drive future increases in \nliving standards.\n  While advances in the health sciences, such as the Human Genome \nProject, are extremely exciting, there are areas in the physical \nsciences that are on the verge of generating important discoveries, and \nwhere government ought to be focusing additional\n\n[[Page S3505]]\n\nresources. One area in which I am keenly interested is the area of \nnanotechnology. This groundbreaking area--which examines structures \natom-by-atom and molecule-by-molecule, on the scale of just a few \nbillionths of a meter--may lead to discoveries that will change the way \nalmost everything, from building materials to vaccines to computers, \nare designed and made. Neil Lane, the President's science advisor, says \nthat this area of science and engineering will most likely lead to \ntomorrow's breakthroughs. It's a very important new area, but one where \nthe practical applications are a few years away. Basic research is the \nkey to pushing the envelope forward.\n  Yet despite the potential applications of these and other \ndiscoveries--and President Clinton's half-billion-dollar National \nNanotechnology Initiative--recent trends do not bode well for the \nphysical sciences. The Senate voted last year to double our investment \nin basic scientific research over the next decade, but the budget \nrecently passed by this Congress places a higher priority on tax cuts \nand therefore will make such increases very difficult without forcing \nimportant cuts in other areas. Nevertheless, I hope that my colleagues \nunderstand that basic research is an appropriate role for government, \nand that such investment is clearly in the national interest.\n  To be sure, the R picture as a whole--public and private sectors \ncombined--has been improving. R had reached a peak of nearly three \npercent of GDP in the early 1960s, and the number has recently risen \nclose to its 1960s peak. But the overall federal investment in R is \nstill relatively flat, because much of the recent gains have come from \nprivate industry. And as I already mentioned, much of that is in \nproduct development, rather than the most basic research.\n  If we look exclusively at the federal role in basic research, the \nnumbers show the trend even more clearly. The federal R budget as a \npercent of GDP was nearly two percent in the mid 1960s, and it is less \nthan eight-tenths of one percent today. These declines have not been \nshared equally. Funding for the National Institutes of Health is much \nhigher, and funding for the National Science Foundation is up slightly. \nBut the other traditional big science agencies are significantly lower, \nwith defense R cuts playing a central role. Defense R is down \nthirty percent over the past six years.\n\n  Again, some claim that this problem is overstated, because the \nprivate sector has picked up the slack. But there are two problems. \nFirst, with such a short time horizon for corporations, the private \nsector often looks to short-term projects like product development, \nrather than long-term projects with unsure real-world applications. \nThis makes basic research more dependent on the federal government.\n  Second, public and private investment is only increasing in two \nareas, information technology and biotech/pharmaceuticals. Math, \nchemistry, geology, physics, and chemical, mechanical, and electrical \nengineering are all declining. The United States risks falling behind \nin the area of innovation, as other nations such as South Korea, \nTaiwan, Singapore, Israel, and even Japan increase their investments in \nnew ideas and new technologies.\n  The shift in federal R resources to health and biotech is a major \nreason we see so many talented people in the life sciences, but fewer \nand fewer mathematicians, chemists, physicists, and engineers. You \ncould make a very strong argument that the stagnation in U.S. degrees \nin physical sciences and engineering is related to the decline of \nfederal research dollars in these areas, because R funds not only \nscience projects, but also the graduate students and researchers who \nwill be tomorrow's scientists, technical workers, and teachers.\n  Consider the upcoming debate over increasing the number of H-1B \nvisas, a special visa that allows foreign workers with special skills \nto work in the United States. Our national talent pool is being raided \nso heavily by the life sciences--in large part because the research \nmoney is there, meaning more opportunities for students--that the high \ntech industry desperately needs workers. By some estimates, hundreds of \nthousands of well-paying high-tech jobs remain unfilled because the \nU.S. talent pool is stretched so thin. While some in Congress--\nincluding myself--are willing to allow more H-1B workers if there is \nadditional money for job training and science scholarships, we also \nknow that job training alone is not the answer to the high-tech labor \nshortage. We must put more research money into the physical sciences so \nthat more young people are attracted to these fields of work.\n  Another problem that we must deal with is entitlement reform. The \nconstant growth of entitlement programs like Social Security and \nMedicare squeezes other areas of the budget and puts every program on \nthe discretionary side in direct competition with each other. All \ndiscretionary programs, including research, are coming out of a smaller \nand smaller share of the pie.\n  The numbers here are telling. In the early 1960s, discretionary \nspending--where all of the research money comes from--was two-thirds of \nthe budget, while mandatory spending and entitlements accounted for \nonly one-third. Today, this is completely reversed, with discretionary \nspending now accounting for only one-third of all spending. Some \nestimates show that if we don't make changes soon, the entire budget \ncould go to entitlements just a few decades from now. We must all \nrecognize that future increases in science and research will suffer if \nentitlements are not reformed.\n  Michael Porter of Harvard University has done a great deal of \nresearch on what makes countries competitive in the global economy. He \nwrites that continuous innovation is the key--but innovation requires \nresearch. For example, where will tomorrow's Internet come from? No one \ncould have known that government's investment in this area would have \nsuch a huge impact on all of our lives. If we fail to shift our \nbudgetary priorities to make investments in the future, we cannot \npromise our children an ever-growing economy.\n  In closing, I am encouraged that the Council on Competitiveness has \nrecognized the importance of basic science research to our economic \nwell-being. I hope that the Senate, in a bipartisan fashion, will \nrecognize that such investment is an appropriate role for government \nand is without question in the national interest, and that we will find \nways to make the ``doubling bill'' a reality.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief remarks \nabout an usual letter I received on behalf of forty-seven leaders of \nthe nation's premier high technology companies, universities, and labor \norganizations. This is the first time in its history that the Council \non Competitiveness, a non-profit organization dedicated to \nstrengthening U.S. innovation, has sent such a letter to Congress on \nbehalf of its outstanding membership. The message is loud and clear: \nsubstantially increased funding for R is necessary to continue our \nnational economic success and our international leadership.\n  Michael Porter, noted professor at the Harvard School of Business \nstated, ``the key to U.S. competitiveness is innovation--the ability to \ndeliver products, processes, and services that cannot be easily or \ninexpensively produced elsewhere. Data shows that the U.S. is strong, \nbut that a number of other countries are successfully making the \ntransition from imitator to innovator.'' Economists argue that such an \ninvestment in innovation, through its impact on economic growth, will \nnot drain our resources, but will actually improve our country's fiscal \nstanding.\n  Current economic expansion and growth, however, cannot be maintained \nif we do not provide the necessary funds and incentives to perform \ncritical R throughout the scientific disciplines. During the 1990s, \nthe funding for math has declined 20 percent, physics has declined 20 \npercent, chemistry has dropped by 10 percent and engineering has \ndropped 30-40 percent. These reductions have the combined effect of \neroding the base from which new technologies can be derived.\n  The Government plays a critical role in driving the innovation \nprocess in the United States. The majority of the federal government's \nbasic R is directed toward critical missions to serve the public \ninterest in areas including health, environmental pollution control, \nspace exploration, and national defense. Federal funds support nearly \n60 percent of the nation's basic research, with a similar share \nperformed\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\nin colleges and universities. It is this fundamental research, combined \nwith a strong talent pool, that ultimately drives the innovation \nprocess.\n  Throughout my career in the Senate, I have spent a considerable \namount of time advocating for greater funding levels for civilian R \nTogether with many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, I \nhave been trying to educate others on the value of the federal \ngovernment's role in funding merit-based and peer-reviewed programs. \nOne only has to look at lasers, mechanical cardiac assist devices, and \nautomatic internal defibrillators to find an examples of prudent \nfederal investments in R\n  The Federal Research Investment Act, which I authored with Senators \nRockefeller, Domenici, and Lieberman, passed the Senate last July for \nthe second year in a row. Yet it has unfortunately languished in the \nHouse. The bill would double the amount of federally-funded civilian \nR over an eleven year period, while at the same time, establishing \nstrong accountability mechanisms. I believe that a balanced portfolio \nof research across all scientific disciplines will enable our national \neconomy to continue to grow and to raise our standard of living.\n  We rally around increased federal funding for basic R, yet we are \nfaced with daunting prospects each year of drastic cuts in the federal \ninvestment. Somehow, we are stuck in the same position each year of \ntrying to convince Congress of R's necessity to the well-being of our \nnation, as we confront very real budgetary limitations. We must set \npriorities. While I strongly believe that Congress must strive to stay \nwithin the budget caps, I also firmly believe that funding for R \nshould be allowed to grow in fiscal year 2001 and beyond.\n  As a result of the current fiscal environment in Congress and the \ndesire to utilize the surplus prudently, I am confident that investing \nin basic R, and in turn the technological innovation of the future, \nis a proper use of the federal taxpayers dollars. This pivotal need for \na resurgence in basic R investments is evident when we further \nconsider our nation's increased dependency on technology and the global \ncompetition that threatens our sustained leadership position. R \ndrives the innovation process, which in turn drives the U.S. economy. \nNow is not the time to turn our backs on the nation's future \nprosperity.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the Council on Competitiveness again \nfor it poignant statement and strongly encourage each of my colleagues \nto consider its message as we continue to make budgeting decisions this \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3506-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3506-S3507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK 2000\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today during Public Service \nRecognition Week 2000 to encourage my colleagues to take a moment to \nhonor the many selfless actions and outstanding accomplishments of our \nnation's state, local, and Federal public servants. As the ranking \nmember on the Senate Subcommittee on International Security, \nProliferation, and Federal Services, with direct jurisdiction over the \nFederal civil service, I take particular pride in honoring the millions \nof dedicated men and women who work around the clock on our behalf.\n  Their responsibilities are as varied as the challenges presented by \ntheir jobs. Our armed forces and civilian defense workers keep us out \nof harms's way--both domestically and abroad--our public school \nteachers instruct our children, and the U.S. Postal Service provides \ndelivery to every address in the nation. Our public servants safeguard \nour food supplies; support our social services infrastructure, oversee \nand protect our economy; and so much more. These men and women are the \nbackbone of what makes America great. We often take them for granted \nand in certain instances subject them to scorn and ridicule. With \nlittle recognition from the public they serve, these employees are \nunwavering in their dedication, honor, purpose, and ability to serve \ntheir cities, counties, states, and Federal Government.\n  I am heartened that so many school districts are fostering public \nservice by requiring their students to serve as volunteers prior to \ngraduating high school. As a former school teacher and administrator, I \nbelieve that voluntary service is useful and appropriate in developing \na sense of community and fellowship, and I am hopeful that as each \ngeneration matures it will see the value of continuing their public \nservice by working in state, local, or Federal Government. However, I \nam aware that Congress must play a role in supporting public service.\n  At a Governmental Affairs Committee hearing this week on the \neffectiveness of Federal employee incentive programs it became evident \nthat the lack of sufficient funds to support viable and much-needed \ncompensation, recognition, and incentives program for Federal employees \nwas hampering efforts to recruit, retain, and relocate Federal workers.\n  Federal agencies, if given adequate funding, would be better \npositioned to utilize incentive programs that are already available. \nFlattened budgets and the pressure to reallocate limited resources do \nnot benefit Federal employees or the ultimate end-user: the American \ntaxpayer.\n  Our Nation's Federal civil servants have given much to their country, \nespecially when Congress was balancing the budget during times of \ncrunching deficits. Now that the country is enjoying record-breaking \nsurpluses, I believe Federal employees should be rewarded for their \ncontributions, and I will continue to push for realistic budgets and \nsalaries for Federal agencies and their employees.\n  I proudly join all public service workers in observance of the 16th \nannual Public Service Recognition Week, and I heartily salute the past \naccomplishments, outstanding service, and future contribution that \nthese outstanding men and women make to our Nation's greatness.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to spotlight the \nsignificant achievements of all those who make up our Nation's public \nworkforce.\n  This week, from May 1st to the 7th, is Public Service Recognition \nWeek, organized by the Public Employees Roundtable. The Public \nEmployees Roundtable was formed in 1982 as a nonpartisan coalition of \nmanagement and professional associations representing approximately one \nmillion public employees and retirees. The mission of the Roundtable is \nto educate the American people about the numerous ways public employees \nenrich the quality of life throughout our Nation and advance the \ncountry's national interests around the world.\n  I am indeed proud to join the Public Employees Roundtable in their \nongoing efforts to bring special attention to the dedicated individuals \nwho have chosen public service as a career. While we should all \nappreciate the efforts of public employees throughout the year, this \nweek-long celebration is an invaluable opportunity to honor their \ncontributions and learn about the vast array of programs and services \npublic employees provide every day. For four days, starting today, a \nwide variety of organizations will sponsor exhibits on the Mall to \nspotlight the work public employees perform. This year, among the \nnumerous agencies represented, will be the Animal and Plant Health \nInspection Service; the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; \nthe Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps; and the Social Security \nAdministration.\n  These exhibits sponsored by civilian and Department of Defense \nagencies will showcase the amazing variety of public employees that \nmake ours the greatest Nation in the world--at the Federal, state, and \nlocal government levels. This year, I was also pleased to join with \nseveral of my House and Senate colleagues in circulating to every \nCongressional office a videotape entitled ``Salute to Excellence,'' \nproduced by the Public Employees Roundtable. In a brief 10 minutes, the \nvideo clearly demonstrates that our Nation's public servants are hard-\nworking individuals who perform vital work for the country each and \nevery day.\n  The total impact of the work of public employees is impossible to \nmeasure. Without them, senior citizens would wait in vain for Social \nSecurity checks, cities would not have the funds and assistance to \nimprove their highways, and our entrepreneurs could not protect their \nnew inventions. In short, all of our citizens would suffer.\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\n  Initiatives to improve government services have encouraged the \ndevelopment of creative solutions and programs to better serve our \ncitizens. Several of these innovative ideas were recognized at the \n``Breakfast of Champions'' held this Monday honoring winners of the \n2000 Public Service Excellence Awards. These honorees--and public \nemployees everywhere--are finding ways to do their work better, more \nprofessionally, and in a way that meets the community's needs.\n  As I have said on many occasions, I believe very much that the United \nStates will only continue to be a first-rate country if we have first-\nclass public servants. Our Nation is experiencing unprecedented growth \nand unemployment rates, and has unquestionably benefited from the many \nachievements of Federal employees. In setting aside this week to \nacknowledge our Nation's public servants, we all have an opportunity to \ngive these employees the thanks and recognition they so greatly \ndeserve. I am very pleased to extend my appreciation to such a worthy \nand committed group of men and women and encourage them to continue in \ntheir efforts on behalf of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3507-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

RICHARD J. HALIK\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. \nRichard J. Halik, who is retiring after 34 years of dedicated service \nto the Lansing, Michigan, School District. A graduate of Eastern High \nSchool in Lansing himself, Dr. Halik has enjoyed a successful career as \na student, teacher, and administrator in the Lansing School District, \nand his efforts as Superintendent have played a large role in bringing \nthe Lansing Public School system into the new millennium on a \nsuccessful note.\n  After receiving his Bachelor of Arts Degree from Western Michigan \nUniversity in 1966, Dr. Halik took a position as a seventh grade \nscience teacher at Otto Middle School. In 1970, he was named Supervisor \nof federally funded Title I programs operating in the district at the \ntime, and in 1972 he became Director of Federal and State Programs for \nthe Lansing School System. After serving as Principal of Gardner Junior \nHigh School in 1979-80, Dr. Halik was promoted to the position of \nElementary Education Director in 1981, and the following year became \nAssistant Superintendent for Instruction. On July 1, 1985, he was named \nSuperintendent of the Lansing School District, and he has held this \npost ever since.\n  Dr. Halik has been an active member of the Lansing community his \nentire life. He currently serves as Vice Chair of the Sparrow Health \nSystem Board of Directors, and as Vice President of the Hinman \nEndowment Fund Board of Directors. In addition, he sits on the Board of \nDirectors of several other local organizations, including the Greater \nLansing Area Advisory Council, the Lansing Area Safety Council, the \nEstes Palmer Foundation, the Urban Education Alliance, and Junior \nAchievement. He is also on the Advisory Board of the Lansing Area \nSafety Council, the Corporate Board of the Boys and Girls Club of \nLansing, and is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Lansing \nEducational Advancement Foundation.\n  Dr. Halik is a member of Mt. Hope Presbyterian Church and the Lansing \nHost Lions Club, and has served as President of the latter group. He \nhas also served as President of the Middle Cities Education Association \nand the Lansing Association of School Administrators. In 1978, he \nrepresented the State of Michigan at the National Institute of \nEducation as advisor on the relationship of the Michigan Compensatory \nEducation Program to ESEA Title I, and in 1993 he was a recipient of \nthe National Leadership Award from the Institute for Education \nLeadership.\n  Dr. Halik's contributions to the Lansing School District, and to \nMichigan's education community in general, are truly immeasurable. I \nwould like to thank him for his dedication and many efforts over the \nlast thirty-four years. His leadership during this time has been \nexceptional and will be dearly missed. On behalf of the entire United \nStates Senate, I congratulate Dr. Richard J. Halik on a wonderful and \nsuccessful career, and wish him the best of luck in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3507-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3507-S3508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO EDWARD J. LISTON\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise \ntoday to acknowledge a truly distinguished Rhode Islander, Edward J. \nListon, who after having diligently served for 22 years will be \nretiring as the President of the Community College of Rhode Island on \nMay 7th, 2000. President Liston currently resides in the town of \nWarwick, Rhode Island, with his wife Judith, where he is a proud father \nto six wonderful children: Christina, Edward, Jennifer, Judith, Mark, \nand Nancy.\n  Throughout his tenure as President, Edward Liston worked hard to \nprovide both educational and job training opportunities for Rhode \nIslanders of all walks of life. Upon his arrival on campus in 1978, to \nmore accurately reflect his mission for the institution, President \nListon immediately set out to change the name of what was then known as \nthe Junior College of Rhode Island, to its present name of the \nCommunity College of Rhode Island (CCRI). In order to further expand \nCCRI's programs into the community, President Liston established a \nsystem of satellite campuses in various local high schools that would \noffer evening courses in such towns as Woonsocket, Westerly, and \nMiddletown. In addition, he successfully made inroads to provide \neducational courses at the Adult Correctional Institution in Cranston.\n  President Liston strongly believes that CCRI should have a presence \nin Rhode Island's inner city communities. In 1990, he opened a downtown \nProvidence Campus which started with a total enrollment of 650 \nstudents. Today, over 2,000 students are taking classes at that campus, \nand plans are underway for an expansion funded by a 1998 bond issue. To \nacknowledge this achievement, the state has renamed the Providence \ncampus the Edward J. Liston Campus.\n  Immediately after opening the Providence campus, President Liston \nworked to make CCRI the first higher education institution in Rhode \nIsland to offer television courses through the public broadcasting \nsystem on Channel 36. To no surprise, this initiative also flourished, \nand has led to an increase in viewer enrollment from 100 students, to \n1,200 students per semester. In 1989, PBS ranked CCRI the number one \nschool in the country for deliverance of telecourses. Still pushing \nforward, President Liston then worked to establish a series of \npartnerships with business and industry leaders to improve the Rhode \nIsland workforce through customized training designed for a particular \ncompany. One of the first partnerships was with General Dynamics' \nElectric Boat Division. This initiative involved a combination of on \nthe job apprenticeship training, and classroom instruction that \nresulted in an associate degree. This first step led to the creation of \nthe Center for Business and Industrial Training, now a part of the \ncollege's Office of Workforce Development. This center was also \ndirectly responsible for the creation of the successful Dental Hygiene \nprogram at the college, due to its partnership with the Rhode Island \nDental Association.\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\n  On behalf of all Rhode Islanders, I would like to take this \nopportunity to personally extend my deepest thanks and gratitude to \nEdward Liston for his continued hard work and dedication over the years \nto improving the lives of so many Rhode Islanders and their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3508-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO YEOMAN (SS) SECOND CLASS MATTHEW C. HAWES, UNITED STATES \n                                  NAVY\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Yeoman \nSecond Class Matthew C. Hawes, United States Navy, for his unsurpassed \ndedication to duty, professionalism, and public service. As Petty \nOfficer Hawes transitions from the active duty Navy to the civilian \nwork force and the Naval Reserve, I am privileged to recognize his \nachievements and to commend him for the exemplary service he has \nprovided to the Senate, the Navy and our great nation.\n  Petty Officer Hawes enlisted in the Navy in January 1991 and was \nassigned to the U.S.S. Cincinnati (SSN 693) after completing Yeoman \n``A'' school and Basic Enlisted Submarine School. While aboard the \nCincinnati, he made several overseas deployments which contributed to \nthe security of our nation and earned his ``Silver Dolphins,'' the \nenlisted submarine warfare qualification insignia. He was then assigned \nto Joint Task Force 160 in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as the Non-\nCommissioned Officer-in-Charge of the J1 Division.\n  After his six-month deployment to Cuba, Petty Officer Hawes was \nassigned to the Bureau of Naval Personal as the Administrative \nAssistant to the Enlisted Nuclear Power Programs Manager. He served in \nthis position until he was selected for assignment to the Navy's Office \nof Legislative Affairs. Petty Officer Hawes reported to the Navy's \nSenate Liaison Office in April 1996 as a Liaison Officer and \nAdministrative Assistant. In this capacity he has been a major asset to \nthe Navy and to the United States Senate. He has been key to the smooth \ncoordination of all Navy leadership visits to the Senate, as well as \nfor the accurate and prompt management of a wide variety of Navy-\nrelated Senate constituent casework. Petty Officer Matthew Hawes has \nbeen extremely helpful to me and to my staff in numerous actions, as I \nknow he has been for many of you.\n  The Department of the Navy, Congress, and the American people were \nwell served by this dedicated Navy Petty Officer. Members of this \nCongress will not soon forget the service and dedication of Petty \nOfficer Hawes. He will be missed. We wish Matthew, his lovely wife \nBlairlee, and their daughter Kathryn, Fair Winds and Following \nSeas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3508-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          2000 NATIONAL FINALS\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, on May 6-8, 2000, more than 1,200 \nstudents from across the United States will be in Washington, D.C. to \ncompete in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen \nand the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that the class \nfrom Basic High School from Henderson will represent the State of \nNevada in this national event. These young scholars have worked \ndiligently to reach the national finals and through their experience \nhave gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental \nprinciples and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  The names of the students are; Katie Bair, Joshua Bitsko, Ryan Black, \nDaniel Croy, Scott Devoge, Danielle Dodgen, Courtney England, Starlyn \nHackney, Jill Hales, Alia Holm, Janae Jeffrey, Ryan Johnson, Aimee \nLucero, Nathan Lund, Jessica Magro, Jasmine Miller, Holli Mitchell, \nGary Nelson, Krystaly Nielsen, Mark Niewinski, Amanda Reed, Jeni \nRiddle, Leslie Roland, Landin Ryan, Alena Sivertson, Ashley Stolworthy, \nSarah Strohm, Tyler Watson, Kara Williams, and Ricky Zeedyk. I would \nalso like to recognize their teacher, John Wallace, who deserves much \nof the credit for the success of the class.\n  The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is \nthe most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after \nhearings in the United States Congress. These hearings consist of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges. \nThe students testify as constitutional experts before a panel of judges \nrepresenting various regions of the country and a variety of \nappropriate professional fields. The students' testimony is followed by \na period of questioning by the simulated congressional committee. The \njudges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability to \napply their constitutional knowledge. Columnist David Broder described \nthe national finals as ``the place to have your faith in the younger \ngeneration restored.''\n  Administered by the Center for civic Education, the We the People . . \n. program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, \nmiddle, and high school levels for more than 26.5 million students \nnationwide. The program provides students with a working knowledge of \nour Constitution, Bill of Rights, and the principles of democratic \ngovernment. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by \ndiscussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers and \nby participating in other educational activities.\n  The class from Basic High School is currently conducting research and \npreparing for the upcoming national competition in Washington, D.C. I \nwish these young ``constitutional experts'' the best of luck at the We \nthe People . . . national finals and my staff and I look forward to \ngreeting them when they visit Capitol Hill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3508-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3508-S3509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO MS. JULIA TOBIAS AND MR. GUSTAV OWEN ON BEING NAMED NEW \n         HAMSHIRE'S TOP TWO YOUTH VOLUNTEERS FOR THE YEAR 2000\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate and honor two young New Hampshire students who have \nachieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in their \ncommunities. Julia Tobias, 17 of Exeter and Gustav Owen, 14 of Barlett \nhave been named State honorees in the 2000 Prudential Spirit of \nCommunity Awards program, an annual honor conferred on only one high \nschool student and one middle-level student in each state.\n  Ms. Tobias is being recognized for founding ``Youth Across Borders'' \na nonprofit fund to benefit a youth center in Bosnia and to raise \nawareness in her own community about issues of prejudice, tolerance and \nthe Bosnia cause. Though thousands of miles away, Julia felt she could \nmake a difference for these young people by providing money for school \nsupplies, teachers and other materials needed to support the center's \nethnic reconciliation programs. She then expanded her mission to \npromote racial harmony among youth in her city. So far, she has raised \n$2,500 through various school and community fund-raising for her \nproject.\n  Mr. Owen is being recognized for conceiving and organizing a school-\nwide assembly on bus safety and emergency procedures. During his \nschool's semiannual bus evacuation drills, Gustav noticed that his \nfellow students did not fully understand what to do or why the drills \nwere necessary. He felt that if the students were more aware, they \nwould be better prepared for a true emergency. So Gustav approached his \nprincipal with the idea of conducting a school assembly on the subject, \nand began researching the bus driver's handbook for more information on \nemergency procedures. He then called a meeting with the bus drivers, \nthe fire chief, and a police officer to discuss how to involve the \nstudents. Finally, he wrote a plan for assembly, recruited volunteers \nto help, and hosted the actual event, which was followed by bus \nevacuation demonstrations for the entire school.\n  Mr. President, in light of numerous statistics that indicate \nAmericans today are less involved in their communities then they once \nwere, it's vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless \ncontributions these young People have made. People of all ages need to \nthink more about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at \nthe local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and \nneighborhoods. Young volunteers like Ms. Tobias and Mr. Owen are \ninspiring examples to all of us, and are among\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\nour brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.\n  I applaud Ms. Tobias and Mr. Owen for their initiative in seeking to \nmake their communities better places to live, and for the positive \nimpact they have had on the lives of others. It is an honor to serve \nboth Ms. Tobias and Mr. Owen in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3509-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MYRA LENARD\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life \nof Myra Lenard. She was a daughter of Polonia who played an important \nrole in the life of America.\n  Myra Lenard was born in Poland and immigrated to America as a young \ngirl. Like so many new Americans--she embraced her new country while \nnever forgetting her homeland.\n  Myra had a long career as a successful business woman and community \nvolunteer. I got to know her because of our shared commitment to our \nproud Polish heritage. As the executive director of the Polish American \nCongress, she was one of our strongest voices for the people of Poland \nwho were forced behind the Iron Curtain. We worked together to provide \nhumanitarian relief and to support the growing democracy movement. She \nwas one of Solidarity's best friends in America.\n  During the darkest days of martial law in Poland, Myra led the Polish \nAmerican Congress' ``Solidarity Convoy,'' in which 32 container trucks \nprovided $10 million worth of supplies for the suffering people of \nPoland. This showed the Polish people that they were not alone.\n  When Poland became free, Myra began her tireless efforts to rebuild \nPoland and to enable it to take its rightful place among Western \ndemocratic nations. This effort didn't begin in 1998--when the issue \nstarted to make headlines. It began in 1989, when Congress passed \nlegislation to provide assistance to the new democracies of central \nEurope. It was a long process of educating Congress and the American \npeople on how Poland's membership in NATO would contribute to America's \nsecurity. Myra was there every step of the way. She was gentle but \nextremely persuasive. She was creative in tapping into the energy of \nthe Polish American community who understand the history, and cared so \ndeeply.\n  Myra Lenard's life was a triumph. Her legacy is her family, as well \nas the deep friendship and alliance between the United States and a \nfree, democratic Poland. I will miss her friendship and her counsel. \nHer beloved husband Cas and their children are in my thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3509-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TEEN PREGNANCY PREVENTION AWARENESS MONTH\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, teen pregnancy is an alarming \nhealth, social and economic problem for our country and we must all \nwork together to address it. Every year, more than a million girls \nunder the age of 20 become pregnant at an estimated cost of $6.9 \nbillion to American taxpayers. In South Carolina, teen pregnancy is of \nparticular concern. Our state has the 10th highest teen pregnancy rate \nin the nation, spending more than a billion dollars a year to cover \ndirect and indirect costs for children born to teen mothers. The \nefforts of organizations such as the Greenville Council for the \nPrevention of Teen Pregnancy have made a difference--teen pregnancy in \nGreenville County, SC has decreased 44% since 1988 for girls aged 14-\n17. Community awareness and education are the key and I would like \nbring to my colleagues' attention that May has been designated Teen \nPregnancy Prevention Awareness Month. It is our duty to ensure that \nAmerica's youth have a bright, healthy and secure future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3509-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MASSACHUSETTS STATE LETTER CARRIERS' ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. KERRY.

These hardworking men and \nwomen provide the Bay State with a vital service each day. Letter \nCarriers have been the backbone of the communications and commercial \ninfrastructure of our nation since its inception. On behalf of all \nMassachusetts residents, I would like to thank the Letter Carriers \nAssociation for remaining vigilant in the fight to further improve the \npostal system.\n  The Letter Carriers' Association has always fought for decent wages, \ncost of living adjustments, job security, and benefits for its brothers \nand sisters, while constantly striving to forge a more effective \npartnership with the United States Postal Service and the federal \ngovernment. Throughout my career, I have always been grateful for the \ntremendous help I have received from the Letter carriers.\n  This year, The Letter Carriers of New England are rallying around an \nagenda to secure fair benefits to provide security for their families \nand their future. They are fighting for adequate social security \nbenefits through the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Social \nSecurity Benefits Restoration Act. The Carriers are working to secure \nlong-term care insurance for federal employees, and are guarding \nagainst rate hikes in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan by \nopposing inserting medical savings accounts. I look forward to \ncontinuing to join with the Letter Carriers in opposing the \nprivatization of the Postal Service.\n  Mr. President, The American public has an overwhelmingly favorable \nview of their letter carriers. In fact, 89 percent of the American \npublic gives the Postal Service a favorable rating, higher than any \nother federal agency. In addition, 75 percent of Americans identify \nthat the Postal Service is doing an excellent or good job. I think that \nit is time that we say, if it is not broke, don't fix it.\n  The Letter Carriers have recently won some victories for their \nbrother and sisters. In September, 1999, an Arbitration Board, in \nconjunction with an agreement between the Postal Service and the NALC, \nupgraded all letter carriers from Grade 5 to Grade 6 federal employees. \nThe recent pay raise and cost of living adjustments reflect the \nconcerted lobbying and negotiating efforts of the Letter carriers' \nleadership, including National President Vincent Sombrotto.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the Letter Carriers for their \nservice to the public. There is much to celebrate. As we focus on the \nfights that lay ahead, I look forward to joining with the Letter \nCarriers to protect our families and our future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3509-4", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3509-S3510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:01 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that it has passed \nthe following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2323.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona relative to the establishment of new \n     national monuments in Arizona; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution 2001\n\n       Whereas, the establishment of two national monuments in \n     Arizona by the President of the United States represents a \n     misuse of the Antiquities Act of 1906 to set aside enormous \n     parcels of real property. The Antiquities Act (16 United \n     States Code sections 431, 432 and 433) grants authority to \n     the President of the United States to establish national \n     monuments, but the Act was intended to preserve only \n     historical landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures and \n     other objects of historic or scientific significance; and\n       Whereas, the proposed designation of two national monuments \n     in Arizona clearly violates the spirit and letter of the \n     Antiquities Act, which requires monument lands to ``be \n     confined to the smallest area'' necessary to preserve and \n     protect historical areas or objects; and\n       Whereas, the people of Arizona, the Arizona Legislature, \n     the Governor of Arizona and the Congress of the United States \n     have not consented or approved this designation, yet the \n     creation of two new national monuments in Arizona could \n     potentially have a significant economic impact on this state. \n     Instead of working as a partner to help local committees and \n     states define and achieve their conservation goals, the \n     federal government dictates unilateral actions that would \n     affect this state and exclude citizens and local governments \n     from determining land management decisions in their \n     communities; and\n       Whereas, the land management and conservation efforts are \n     best administered and managed at the local levels of \n     government. The failure of the federal government to \n     recognize and respect this basic tenet represents an arrogant \n     usurpation by federal powers and a violation of states' \n     rights. Therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:\n       1. That the Legislature denounces the designation of two \n     national monuments in the State of Arizona without full \n     public participation, consent and approval of local \n     governments, the Arizona Legislature, the Governor and the \n     Congress of the United States.\n       2.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to authorize States to \nregulate harmful fuel additives and to require fuel to contain fuel \nmade from renewable sources, to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to \nrequire that at least 85 percent of funds appropriated to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency from the Leaking Underground Storage \nTank Trust Fund be distributed to States to carry out cooperative \nagreements for undertaking corrective action and for enforcement of \nsubtitle I of that act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                      renewable fuels act of 2000\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, ten years ago I joined with two \ndistinguished colleagues, then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and \nSenator Tom Harkin, to introduce the reformulated gasoline (RFG) \nprovision of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The RFG provision, with \nits minimum oxygen standard, was adopted in the Senate by the \noverwhelming vote of 69 to 30 and eventually signed into law by \nPresident George Bush.\n  I am proud to say that this program has resulted in substantial \nimprovement in air quality around the country. It also has stimulated \nincreased production and use of renewable ethanol and other oxygenates \nneeded to meet the minimum oxygen standard.\n  Unfortunately, an unanticipated development involving the petroleum-\nbased oxygenate MTBE requires us to re-examine the many benefits of the \nRFG program. The detection of MTBE in ground water around the country \nhas generated considerable debate in recent months over how to deal \nwith this fuel additive and the oxygen requirement of the reformulated \ngasoline program. The resolution of this debate will have significant \nconsequences for the environment, for farmers and for the rural \neconomy.\n  The pace of activity to resolve the MTBE issue is accelerating \nrapidly. Battlelines are being drawn as the state of California and its \nallies focus on scrapping the oxygen requirement.\n  It is clear that Congress and/or the Clinton administration will \nrespond to the MTBE problem. My focus is on ensuring that that response \nnot only serves the environment, but also retains a prominent place for \nethanol--a place that assures long-term, predictable growth of the \nindustry.\n  I believe a comprehensive legislative solution is necessary in this \ncase--one that recognizes and preserves the important air quality \nbenefits of the RFG program, protects water supplies and leads the \nnation away from greater dependence on imported oil.\n  I have worked for the last year with the ethanol industry, Republican \nand Democratic colleagues in the Senate, the Governor's Ethanol \nCoalition, environmental organizations and the administration in search \nof a solution that gives states the tools they need to address MTBE \ncontamination, ensures the future growth of domestic renewable fuels, \nand prevents supply shortages and price spikes in the nation's fuels \nsupply.\n  This process has led me to two basic conclusions.\n  First, the MTBE crisis has left the RFG oxygen requirement vulnerable \nto legislative attack. Those who doubt this conclusion should reflect \non the following facts.\n  California refiners have shown that clean-burning gasoline can be \nproduced without oxygen.\n  EPA's Blue Ribbon Panel has recommended that the oxygen requirement \nbe repealed.\n  The RFG oxygen requirement is opposed by a diverse coalition that \nincludes the American Lung Association, the American Petroleum \nInstitute, the New England States Coordinated Air Use Management \nagency, the State of California and the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil (NRDC).\n  Second, support for the oxygen requirement will weaken over time. \nImprovements in auto emissions control technology will cause the air \nquality benefits of oxygen in gasoline to decline and the justification \nfor the RFG oxygen requirement to diminish.\n  As one of the original authors of the reformulated gasoline \nprovisions of the Clean Air Act, I feel something of a proprietary \ninterest in the oxygen requirement. As a legislator, I recognize that \ncircumstances change, and obstinacy should not be allowed to become a \nbarrier to the achievement of important policy goals.\n  Ethanol advocates face a choice between defending the oxygen \nrequirement in the near term, realizing that its days ultimately are \nnumbered, or using the current MTBE debate to guarantee the future \ngrowth of the ethanol industry based on important public policy goals, \nsuch as energy security, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and \ndomestic economic growth.\n  In my judgment, providing states with the flexibility to waive the \nRFG oxygen requirement is a fair tradeoff for the establishment of a \nrenewable fuels standard. It represents the most effective way to \nachieve the environmental and economic goals of governors and \nconsumers, while putting the ethanol industry on a steady growth path \nwell into the future and promoting ethanol production in new regions of \nthe nation.\n  Therefore, today, with Senator Richard Lugar, I am introducing the \nRenewable Fuels Act of 2000. Under our\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\nlegislation, EPA is directed to reduce the use of MTBE to safe levels, \nand states can obtain waivers from the RFG oxygen requirement and \nfurther regulate MTBE if they desire. This will allow the nation to \ndeal with the MTBE contamination issue responsibly and avoid gasoline \nsupply disruptions. The bill also includes provisions protecting the \nair quality gains that have resulted from the use of oxygenated fuels.\n  To protect market opportunities for renewable fuels, the bill \nestablishes a renewable fuels standard for the nation's gasoline, which \nbegins in 2000 at 1.3 percent--roughly where renewable fuels production \nstands today--and gradually increases over the next decade to 3.3 \npercent of the nation's gasoline in 2010. Considering the fact that \noverall gasoline use is expected to increase over the next decade, this \nstandard will more than triple ethanol use over that period.\n  In meeting that requirement, our legislation stipulates that a gallon \nof biomass ethanol counts as much as 1.5 gallons of starch-based \nethanol, thereby providing a strong incentive for the development of \nbiomass-based ethanol plans throughout the country. It also established \na renewable fuels standard for diesel fuels to promote the use of \nbiodiesel. These renewable fuels standards can be met through \nnationwide credit trading, to allow for the most economomical use of \nethanol and biodiesel.\n  For those who are concerned about the potential impact of a drought \nor other natural disaster on the ability of the renewable fuels \nindustry to supply this market, the legislation allows the EPA \nAdministrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to \nwaive the renewable requirement in any given year upon determination \nthat there is indequate domestic supply or distribution capacity, or \nthat the requirement would severely harm the economic or environment of \na State, a region, or the United States.\n  I also intend to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto establish a strategic corn reserve as a complement to the renewable \nfuel standard. A properly managed strategic corn reserve could serve as \nthe equivalent of the strategic petroleum reserve and ensure stable \nfeedstocks for domestic ethanol producers in the event of weather \ninduced supply interruptions. Taxpayers would benefit as farmers could \nreceive fair market prices, thereby reducing the need for emergency \nassistance each year.\n\n  It is important to recognize that under Senator Lugar's and my \napproach, the oxygen requirement is not waived entirely. States can \ndecide for themselves whether to apply for a waiver from the RFG oxygen \nrequirement. We fully expect that RFG programs that currently are using \nethanol and have not experienced MTBE contamination, such as Chicago \nand Milwaukee, will stay in the program. Moreover, the bill allows any \ngovernor to apply to EPA to opt into the RFG program, thus expanding \nits air quality benefits to new regions of the country. Those areas \nthat remain in the program or opt into it, and use ethanol, will \ngenerate credits that can be sold to other regions of the country.\n  Finally, the bill prevents adverse effects on states' highway trust \nfund tax allocations, with ``hold harmless'' language ensuring that \nstates reporting Federal excise tax receipts on gasoline are not \npenalized for their ethanol blend sales.\n  Again, my goal in introducing this legislation is both to support \nstates that want to get MTBE out of gasoline and to ensure that this \neffort does not adversely affect ethanol production. It is also to put \ninto place a program that will grow the ethanol industry steadily over \nthe next decade, thereby assuring the market stability necessary to \nattract investment in the construction of new plants and significantly \nincreasing the market for corn and biomass. This approach not only will \nget MTBE out of groundwater; it will do so without backsliding on the \nair quality improvements generated by the RFG program while increasing \ncorn demand by 600 million bushels per year.\n  Mr. President, since first floating this concept in May of last year, \nI have heard from numerous stakeholders in this complex debate. The \nlegislative concept that Senator Lugar and I unveil today has been \nendorsed by diverse interests ranging from the American Coalition for \nEthanol (ACE) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to the 24-state Governors' \nEthanol Coalition, to the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use \nManagement (NESCAUM) to Mr. Leo Leibowitz, chairman of Getty Petroleum. \nI believe that we have struck a delicate balance between the interests \nof farmers, consumers, state regulatory officials, refiners and those \nconcerned about the environment. This plan is a worthy successor to the \noriginal 1990 RFG provision, preserving all of the good things it has \nachieved and rectifying those elements that need fixing.\n  I look forward to working with Senators Smith and Baucus, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, to enact legislation resolving the MTBE issue. I hope that \nother colleagues will join Senator Lugar and me in support of this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2503\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Daschle in \nintroducing the Renewable Fuels Act of 2000.\n  In July 1999, an independent Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in \nGasoline called for major reductions in the use of MTBE as an additive \nin gasoline. They did so because of growing evidence and public \nconcerns regarding pollution of drinking water supplies by MTBE. These \ntrends are particularly acute in areas of the country using \nReformulated Gasoline.\n  The Reformulated Gasoline Program (RFG) has proven to be a success in \nreducing smog and has exceeded expectations in reducing dangerous and \ncarcinogenic air toxics in gasoline. The second stage of the \nReformulated Gasoline Program (RFG) will commence this summer and will \nhave an even greater effect in reducing ozone pollution and air toxics.\n  Because of concerns regarding water pollution, it is clear that the \nexisting situation regarding MTBE is not tenable. The Governor of \nCalifornia has called for a three year phase out of MTBE in California \nand the California Air Resources Board has adopted regulations to that \neffect. Environmental officials from eight Northeastern States have \nproposed a phase down and a capping of the use of MTBE in gasoline in \ntheir states. MTBE is being found in wells in the Midwest even in areas \nthat do not use reformulated gasoline.\n  The Renewable Fuels Act of 2000 will lead to about five billion \ngallons of ethanol being produced in 2010 compared to one billion, six \nhundred million gallons today. Under the Act, one gallon of cellulosic \nethanol will count for one and one-half gallons of regular ethanol in \ndetermining whether a refiner has met the Renewable Fuels Standard in a \nparticular year.\n  We are going to have spikes in oil that will disrupt our economy. It \nmay or may not be able to be controlled. It will happen before 2010. It \nmay happen again next week. Our problem in terms of national security \nand the security of our whole economy revolves around our dependence on \npetroleum-based fuels. We must be able to address this challenge. \nFinding an environmentally sensitive way to resolve the MTBE crisis is \nan important part of this challenge.\n  It is clear that MTBE is on its way out. The question is what kind of \nlegislation is needed to facilitate its departure and whether that \nlegislation will be based on consideration of all of the environmental \nand energy and national security issues involved.\n  The Renewable Fuels Act of 2000 will establish a nationwide Renewable \nFuels Standard (RFS) that would increase the current use of renewable \nfuels from 1.3% in 2000 to 3.3% by 2010. Refiners who produced \nrenewable fuels beyond the standard could sell credits to other \nrefiners who chose to under comply with the RFS.\n  This bill would give the EPA Administrator authority to limit or \neliminate the use of MTBE in order to protect the public health and the \nenvironment. It also gives states the ability to further regulate or \neliminate MTBE use if the EPA does not choose to eliminate it. It would \nalso establish strict ``anti backsliding provisions'' to capture all of \nthe air quality benefits of MTBE and ethanol as MTBE is phased down or \nphased out.\n  The Renewable Fuels Act of 2000 will be good for our economy and our \nenvironment. Most important of all, it will facilitate the development \nof renewable fuels, a development critical to ensuring U.S. national \nand economic security and stabilizing gas prices.\n  I hope that my colleagues will examine this bill as well as other \nlegislative approaches that would spur the development of renewable \nfuels such as ethanol, whether derived from corn or other agricultural \nor plant materials.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Breaux, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Bond, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Edwards, Mr. \n        Conrad, and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 2505. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide increased assess to health care for medical beneficiaries \nthrough telemedicine; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          telehealth improvement and modernization act of 2000\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with my good \nfriend Senator Rockefeller in introducing legislation that will improve \nupon the federal rules for reimbursement for telemedicine and help to \nensure that all of our citizens have access to our great health care \nsystem. We are joined by a broad, bipartisan group of senators in this \neffort.\n\n  In many ways we have the best health care system in the world. But \nincreasingly fewer and fewer Americans actually have access to it. I \nrecently introduced a tax-credit bill that will help some of these \nAmericans and I anticipate supporting future measures aimed at \nincreasing access to health care services.\n  One important area that demands our attention is the problem of \naccess for rural Americans. More than 25 percent of our Nation's senior \ncitizens live in areas underserved for modern health care services. At \nthe same time, telemedicine has come of age. We have moved beyond the \nfeasibility stage and proven that this technology can provide real \nbenefits to people in rural and underserved regions of our country.\n  In my own State of Vermont, nearly 70 per cent live in rural areas. \nThis is the highest percentage rural population of any state in the \nnation. In Vermont, specialists in more than twenty-five disciplines \nfrom Fletcher Allen Health Care in Burlington are made readily \navailable to patients even in the most rural areas. I want to see this \nlevel of service expand and be made available to all Americans.\n  We in Washington have made some good faith attempts to allow for the \ndevelopment of telehealth technologies but we have fallen short. In an \neffort to restrain the expansion of these programs, the Health Care \nFinancing Administration's interpretation of the laws and its \ncumbersome rules for reimbursement have all but guaranteed the demise \nof current programs.\n  Federally-funded telemedicine projects exist in almost every State in \nthe Nation. These projects have proven that cost-effective, high-\nquality care can be delivered using this technology. The provisions in \nthis bill will help to ensure that this care will be continued when the \nfederal grants end.\n  Why is this legislation needed now? Because current HCFA regulations \nconcerning payment are unworkable in the real world. Less than 6 \npercent of all telemedicine doctor-patient visits last year provided to \nMedicare beneficiaries would qualify for reimbursement under HCFA's \ncurrent guidelines.\n  Now that we have more experience and understand better how \ntelemedicine can be used, it is time to enact several changes to the \nlaw so that these programs can thrive and deliver on their promise of \nproviding cost-effective, high-quality healthcare where it is needed \nthe most.\n  Rural healthcare providers and patients are eager for this \nlegislation. Norman Wright, President of the Vermont Association of \nHospitals and Health Systems, recognized the potential of Fletcher \nAllen's telemedicine program by describing it as one that ``provides \nincredible opportunities for rural providers and their patients because \nit links them to a network with access to the region's best authorities \nfor any given condition.''\n\n  I have indeed heard an outpouring of support from healthcare \nproviders across my own State on this issue. Gerry Davis, Professor of \nPulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Fletcher Allen Health Care, \ndescribed ``appropriate and fair third party payment for\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\ntelemedicine'' as ``essential in order to move this process beyond \neducation, and to make the service truly useful for patients in remote \nlocations.''\n  Telemedicine can be used in so many ways. It can be vital to a \npediatrician from a rural area with a sick baby who needs to consult \nwith a neonatologist from a tertiary care hospital in the dead of \nwinter and the middle of the night. It can be also be crucial for a \ndepressed senior citizen who desperately needs mental health services \navailable in their own rural county. And it can be much needed help for \na frustrated isolated primary care provider who longs to be able to \nprovide for access to specialty services for her patients in their own \ncommunity. All of these people need our help.\n  While the changes included in this bill are relatively minor in the \ncontext of the Medicare program, the effect will be far-reaching. This \nlegislation will allow us to avoid arbitrarily denying access to health \ncare for our senior citizens and persons with disabilities just because \nof where they live. It will allow for fair and reasonable reimbursement \nfor services that can be delivered appropriately in this way. It will \nalso encourage the incorporation of telehealth technology in the care \nplans of home health agencies, an area that has already shown great \npromise for the future in terms of cost-effective disease management. \nIn summary, it will allow us to begin to release the incredible \npotential of telemedicine.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in bringing HCFA's \napproach to the delivery of health care into the 21st Century. Any \nMedicare reform must include progress on telemedicine for our Nation's \nrural areas.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to be here \ntoday to introduce the Telemedicine Improvement and Modernization Act \nwith Senator Jeffords and many other of my Senate colleagues. This bill \nincorporates two issues that I care about passionately--health care and \ntechnology.\n  Telemedicine has the potential to bridge the gap that currently \nexists between patients and providers. More than 25% of our Nation's \nsenior citizens live in areas where speciality care may not be \navailable. In states like my own where there are very few primary care \nor specialty care resources and travel is difficult, telemedicine is \ncritical to ensuring that people in remote areas are getting health \ncare they need. By expanding access to health care through \ntelemedicine, we also improve the quality of care available to people \nliving in underserved areas. Personally, I believe that we are just \nbeginning to tap the enormous potential of technology to advance \nquality health care, especially in rural areas.\n  Yet, Medicare's telemedicine program is inefficient in its current \nform. These inefficiencies threaten the future of telemedicine \nservices. When we first created this program, our knowledge of the \npotential of this new technology, or its practical applications was \nvery limited. Today we have a much better understanding of how \ntelemedicine actually works. With this new knowledge, we can repair the \ninefficiencies of the current system and encourage the use of this \nhighly effective health practice. By accomplishing this goal, we can \nensure that quality health care is available to all seniors and \ndisabled Americans regardless of where they live.\n  There are 8 main elements of the bill:\n  (1) Eliminating the provider ``fee sharing'' requirement;\n  (2) Eliminating the requirement for a ``telepresenter'';\n  (3) Allowing limited reimbursement for referring clinics to recover \nthe cost of their services;\n  (4) Expanding telemedicine services to all non-MSAs;\n  (5) Expanding telemedicine services to direct patient care, not just \nprofessional consultations;\n  (6) Making all providers eligible for HCFA reimbursement for services \ndelivered via telemedicine;\n  (7) Creating a federal demonstration project that permits \ntelemedicine reimbursement for ``store and forward'' consultations \n(i.e., x-rays that are sent to another facility for consultation); and\n  (8) Permitting telehomecare.\n  While these changes are relatively minor in the context of the \nMedicare program, the affect will be far-reaching. The modernizations \nwe are proposing will dramatically improve access to quality health \ncare in rural areas. This legislation will allow us to begin to release \nthe incredible potential of telemedicine.\n  On a final note, I'd like to thank Karen Edison for her expertise and \ndetermination in working on this bill. Because Karen is a practicing \ntelemedicine physician, she has been invaluable in developing and \nadvancing this cause.\n  Thank you, Mr. President for your time today. I hope all of my \ncolleagues will join with me in passing this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON:\n  S. 2506. A bill to amend title 46, United States Code, with respect \nto the Federal preemption of State law concerning the regulation of \nmarine and ocean navigation, safety, and transportation by States; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n    legislation regarding marine and ocean navigation, safety, and \n                             transportation\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, environmental protection and states' \nrights were dealt a blow on March 6th, when the U.S. Supreme Court \ndecided the case of United States vs. Locke. The Court, noting that \neven though federal and international laws ``may be insufficient \nprotection,'' invalidated Washington laws, and potentially laws in \neleven other states, that provide protections against spills by oil \ntankers. I disagree with the Court's decision, because I believe that \nWashington state should be allowed to protect its shores as it sees \nfit.\n  That is why, today I am pleased to introduce the ``States Prevention \nof Oil Tanker Spills Act'' (SPOTS)-legislation that will reinstate the \nright of all states to adopt additional standards beyond existing \nfederal requirements governing the operation, maintenance, equipment, \npersonnel and manning of oil tankers. While this legislation will apply \nto all shoreline states, it is particularly important to Washington.\n  Washington has always taken seriously its duty to protect the health \nand safety of its citizens, and has historically supported aggressive \nprotections of its treasured natural resources, including Washington \nshorelines and waterways. Oil refineries and product terminals located \nin Cherry Point, Ferndale, Tacoma, Anacortes, and nearby Vancouver, \nBritish Columbia make Washington an international destination and \nshipping point for millions of tons of oil annually. A large volume of \ncrude oil is transported to and from the state near heavily populated \nPuget Sound.\n  The frequent traffic of large vessels carrying vast amounts of oil \nincreases the risks to the environment and public safety, and \nunfortunately, has resulted in devastating spills. The 1989 Exxon \nValdez disaster was one of the most environmentally devastating in \nUnited States history. The huge oil tanker ran aground in Prince \nWilliam Sound, Alaska, dumping 11 million gallons of crude oil into the \nPacific Ocean, and damaging more than 1,000 miles of coastline in \nsouth-central Alaska. The massive spill resulted in billions of dollars \nin damage claims by over 40,000 people, including some 6,500 Washington \nfishermen who have yet to be compensated for their loss.\n  Incidents such as the Valdez disaster served as a catalyst for \nWashington and many other ocean shoreline states--as well as Congress--\nto enact laws to prevent similar catastrophic events. Congress passed \nthe Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Washington passed its own legislation in \n1994, which created the state Office of Marine Safety and directed the \nestablishment of prevention plans for ``the best achievable \nprotection'' from the damage caused by oil spills.\n  Washington's law enhanced, or added a number of requirements to, the \nfederal law. For example, instead of merely requiring tanker crews to \n``clearly understand English,'' as federal law prescribes, the state \nregulation required tanker crews to be proficient in English in order \nto prevent miscommunication between American navigators and foreign \ncrews. To heighten safety protection in times of limited visibility due \nto fog or other inclement weather conditions common to the Puget Sound, \nthe state also added a requirement that a tanker\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\nhave on its bridge at least three licensed officers, a helmsman, and a \nlookout. Among other requirements adopted by Washington are \nprescriptions regarding training, location plotting, pre-arrival tests, \nand drug testing for tanker crews.\n  While federal law governs the design and construction of tankers, as \nwell as issues affecting Coast Guard and national security, I believe \nthat states should have the right to enact additional regulations that \nthey believe will enhance the safety of their citizens and \nnatural resources. Twenty states' Attorneys General signed an amicus \nbrief in United States vs. Locke, agreeing with Washington on this \npoint.\n\n  Unfortunately, the International Association of Independent Tanker \nOwners, (``INTERTANKO''), a group of companies that own or operate more \nthan 2,000 tankers in the United States and foreign nations, does not \nagree with this common sense proposition. Shortly after Washington's \noil tanker law was enacted. INTERTANKO filed a lawsuit to overturn it. \nA federal district court ruled in Washington's favor, but the \nAdministration voluntarily intervened in the oil tanker companies' \nappeal, and the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Coast Guard's weaker \nregulations superseded the state's requirements on oil tankers.\n  Some have suggested that additional state regulation would interfere \nwith the federal government's relations with foreign governments. In my \nview, allowing states to add common sense safety measures would have \nlittle, if any, impact on foreign relations. It would, however, enhance \nenvironmental protection.\n  This legislation won't eliminate all oil spills. I believe, however, \nthat it will help to prevent some. Laws protecting our shores from \ndangerous oil spills should not be brought to the lowest common \ndenominator. Rather, allowing states to enhance federal laws where \nappropriate, will ensure an even greater level of protection for our \ncitizens and resources in the future.

A bill to amend the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights \nSettlement Act of 1988 to provide for a final settlement of the claims \nof the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes, and for other purposes.\n\n\n             COLORADO UTE SETTLEMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce The Colorado Ute \nSettlement Act Amendment of 2000, and take this opportunity to address \npromises broken, and the opportunity for this nation to finally keep \nthe promises it made to the Southern and Ute Mountain Ute Indian tribes \nof Southern Colorado (Ute tribes). If we can find the resolve to get \nthis done, we will have--for the first time--honored a treaty with an \nIndian tribe.\n  I am pleased to have my friend and colleague from Colorado, Senator \nWayne Allard, join me as an original cosponsor of this bill.\n  In the 1860's the United States promised the Ute tribes it would \nprovide a permanent homeland for their people in the southwest. The \nwater rights for that homeland remain senior over all others. Over a \nhundred years later, the tribes' water is being used by their \nneighbors. Our promise to the tribes gave them, the state, local water \nusers, and the United States the choice of fighting for the water in \ncourt or negotiating and producing an enforceable agreement that all \nthe parties can live with.\n  I am proud to have been a part of the effort over the past 12 years \nthat resulted in an agreement to finally settle the tribal water rights \nclaims, and provide water--not promises or financial compensation--for \nall involved. But, this fight is not a new one. The legal wrangling \nover the Ute Indian water rights was already over a decade old when the \nsettlement was reached in 1986. Two years later Congress enacted the \nColorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988. The Settlement \nAct promised the Ute tribes an adequate water supply to fulfill all of \nthe promises made to them in the 1860's for a homeland and an adequate \nwater supply. The Settlement Act promised; if the Ute tribes would give \nup their claims to the water under their treaties, we would provide \nthem with an adequate alternative water supply.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and as one \nwho has Indian blood coursing through my veins, I am reminded almost \nevery day of the promises and treaties that have been broken by the \nUnited States. While we in the United States Congress are sometimes \nunable to undo the results of this chain of shattered promises, we \nshould at least agree that we will not continue to ignore treaties with \nany more American Indian tribes. The dismal truth is for the last ten \nyears I have watched those opposed to the Animas-La Plata project work \nto prevent the federal government from fulfilling its commitment to the \nUte Indian tribes manipulating facts and the law in an effort to deny \nour responsibilities as a nation. As a result we have squandered \ndecades of time and millions of taxpayers dollars in an effort to not \nfulfill the promises made to the Ute tribes. I urge my colleagues to \nbring this sorry trail of broken promises to an end.\n\n  I remain committed to keeping our word to the Tribes of Colorado. \nSince the tribes have urged me to introduce this further A-LP \ncompromise legislation, I am persuaded that this proposal will not \nviolate the promises made to the tribes in 1988. However, if this bill \nis not enacted, or the permanent opponents of the project are able to \nfurther frustrate and delay the construction of the project, then this \nbill will be another broken promise to another Indian tribe and I \nrefuse to be a part of that. Therefore, I have only introduced this \nbill with the understanding that it will include provisions that \nprevent needless delays.\n  I know there are people who will oppose any version of the Animas-La \nPlata project. In fact some groups had already signed letters rejecting \nthe results of the draft supplemental environmental impact statement \nbefore it was made public. In part, they criticized the Department of \nInterior for prejudging the results of its analysis. I ask you, who is \ndoing the prejudging? There are those who will oppose the project even \nif the final supplemental EIS reaches the same conclusion as the draft \nEIS: that constructing the facilities described by this bill is the \nleast damaging way of fulfilling the federal government's promises to \nthe Ute tribes.\n  It is absurd to continue to negotiate with those prepared to oppose \nany version of this project or to support efforts to continue to delay \nour moral and legal obligation to the Tribes.\n  First, my bill recognizes that a great deal of environmental review \nhas already occurred, and that the facts have not changed, no matter \nwhat version of this project is discussed. The Interior Secretary is to \ncontinue his effort to produce a final supplemental EIS for the \nproject. However, this bill makes clear that if the Secretary \nultimately selects ``alternative #4,'' it will reflect that the \nCongress will also have had the opportunity to review the same record, \nand we concur with this judgment.\n\n  Similarly, the bill makes clear that if the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService determines that an annual diversion of 57,100 acre feet of \nwater can occur without jeopardizing the habitat of endangered fish not \nknown to be there, Congress concurs and believes that the project \nshould move forward, and allocate quantities of water in the manner \nprovided for in this bill. In short, this bill is the last, best chance \nto keep the Tribes from suing the federal government and, in all \nlikelihood, prevail at an unknown cost to taxpayers.\n  For those who hope to wait even longer before proceeding with this\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\nproject, I will point out that as of January 1, 2000, federal law \nauthorized the Ute tribes to return to court to assert their claims for \nthe water already being used in southwestern Colorado. Perhaps they \nshould. In a demonstration of their good faith, the tribes have not yet \nreturned to court to assert their claims. But we only have a small \nwindow of opportunity before the tribes must either assert their claims \nor allow them to lapse.\n  At any time, the tribes could now choose to return to court. I am \ndetermined to bring this matter before the Senate, one last time. We \ncannot allow this bill to become another step in the long trail of \nbroken promises. We are a nation based on the respect for the law. Our \ncompassion, our limitless dedication to defending the truth, and our \nhistory of preserving the dignity of even the least of us is well \ndocumented. So, too, is our atrocious record of respect for the rights \nand the most basic tenets of human dignity when it comes to the first \nAmericans on this continent.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2508\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Colorado \n     Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 2000''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In order to provide for a full and final settlement of \n     the claims of the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes on the Animas \n     and La Plata Rivers, the Tribes, the State of Colorado, and \n     certain of the non-Indian parties to the Agreement have \n     proposed certain modifications to the Colorado Ute Indian \n     Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-585; 102 \n     Stat. 2973).\n       (2) The claims of the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes on all \n     rivers in Colorado other than the Animas and La Plata Rivers \n     have been settled in accordance with the provisions of the \n     Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 \n     (Public Law 100-585; 102 Stat. 2973).\n       (3) The Indian and non-Indian communities of southwest \n     Colorado and northwest New Mexico will be benefited by a \n     settlement of the tribal claims on the Animas and La Plata \n     Rivers that provides the Tribes with a firm water supply \n     without taking water away from existing uses.\n       (4) The Agreement contemplated a specific timetable for the \n     delivery of irrigation and municipal and industrial water and \n     other benefits to the Tribes from the Animas-La Plata \n     Project, which timetable has not been met. The provision of \n     irrigation water can not presently be satisfied under the \n     current implementation of the Federal Water Pollution Control \n     Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n       (5) In order to meet the requirements of the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and in \n     particular the various biological opinions issued by the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service, the amendments made by this Act are \n     needed to provide for a significant reduction in the \n     facilities and water supply contemplated under the Agreement.\n       (6) The substitute benefits provided to the Tribes under \n     the amendments made by this Act, including the waiver of \n     capital costs and the provisions of funds for natural \n     resource enhancement, result in a settlement that provides \n     the Tribes with benefits that are equivalent to those that \n     the Tribes would have received under the Colorado Ute Indian \n     Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-585; 102 \n     Stat. 2973).\n       (7) The requirement that the Secretary of the Interior \n     comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and other national environmental laws \n     before implementing the proposed settlement will ensure that \n     the satisfaction of the tribal water rights is accomplished \n     in an environmentally responsible fashion.\n       (8) Federal courts have considered the nature and the \n     extent of Congressional participation when reviewing Federal \n     compliance with the requirements of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).\n       (9) In considering the full range of alternatives for \n     satisfying the water rights claims of the Southern Ute Indian \n     Tribe and Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe, Congress has held \n     numerous legislative hearings and deliberations, and reviewed \n     the considerable record including the following documents:\n       (A) The Final EIS No. INT-FES-80-18, dated July 1, 1980.\n       (B) The Draft Supplement to the FES No. INT-DES-92-41, \n     dated October 13, 1992.\n       (C) The Final Supplemental to the FES No. 96-23, dated \n     April 26, 1996;\n       (D) The Draft Supplemental EIS, dated January 14, 2000.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this Act:\n       (1) Agreement.--The term ``Agreement'' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 3(1) of the Colorado Ute Indian \n     Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-585; 102 \n     Stat. 2973).\n       (2) Animas-la plata project.--The term ``Animas-La Plata \n     Project'' has the meaning given that term in section 3(2) of \n     the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 \n     (Public Law 100-585; 102 Stat. 2973).\n       (3) Dolores project.--The term ``Dolores Project'' has the \n     meaning given that term in section 3(3) of the Colorado Ute \n     Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-\n     585; 102 Stat. 2974).\n       (4) Tribe; tribes.--The term ``tribe'' or ``tribes'' has \n     the meaning given that term in section 3(6) of the Colorado \n     Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public Law \n     100-585; 102 Stat. 2974).\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill for the relief of Rose-Marie Barbeau-Quinn; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               for the relief of rose-marie barbeau-quinn\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce \nlegislation that will allow a valuable member of the Portland, Oregon, \ncommunity to become a permanent resident of the United States of \nAmerica. Rose-Marie Barbeau-Quinn, a native of Canada, has lived in \nPortland since 1976. Together with her husband, Michael Quinn, she ran \nthe Vat and Tonsure Tavern, a unique and popular restaurant that was a \nfavorite of many of my constituents.\n  While Ms. Barbeau-Quinn and her husband, an American citizen, were \ntogether for over 16 years, their marriage did not take place until \nshortly before Michael's death in 1991. Since Rose-Marie and Michael \nwere not formally married for the two years required by immigration \nlaw, and despite their 16 years together living as husband and wife, \nRose-Marie has not been able to file for permanent residency in this \ncountry.\n  This legislation will correct their injustice, and allow Rose-Marie \nto be a permanent resident of the country she loves and has called home \nfor over 20 years. I first learned of Ms. Barbeau-Quinn's situation \nfrom Senator Hatfield when I joined the Senate in 1996. Senator \nHatfield championed her cause in the 104th Congress, and, as his \nrequest and the request of many of my constituents, I am attempting to \ncomplete the work that Senator Hatfield started. We both firmly believe \nthat Rose-Marie would be a model United States resident.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, so that Rose-Marie \nBarbeau-Quinn can continue her place as a valuable member of our \ncommunity for many years to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2509\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), \n     Rose-Marie Barbeau-Quinn, shall be held and considered to \n     have been lawfully admitted to the United States for \n     permanent residence as of the date of the enactment of this \n     Act upon payment of the required visa fees.\n\n     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.\n\n       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Rose-Marie \n     Barbeau-Quinn, as provided in this Act, the Secretary of \n     State shall instruct the proper officer to reduce by the \n     appropriate number during the current fiscal year the total \n     number of immigrant visas available to natives of the country \n     of the alien's birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 2510. A bill to establish the Social Security Protection, \nPreservation, and Reform Commission; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY PROTECTION, PRESERVATION, AND REFORM COMMISSION ACT OF \n                                  2000\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I join with my friends and \ncolleagues, Senators Bob Kerrey and Pat Moynihan, to introduce a very \nimportant bill that will serve as the catalyst for putting aside \npartisan politics and beginning the process of protecting, preserving \nand reforming the Social Security system.\n  Our bill establishes principles and a process for Social Security \nreform. The bill sets forth broadly stated objectives for comprehensive \nreform of the Social Security system that should be supported by every \none of us. It establishes a bipartisan Congressional Commission charged \nwith developing a reform plan consistent with those objectives. The \nCommission is required to submit a detailed legislative proposal to \nCongress by September 2001, and the bill includes a process for \nexpedited Congressional action on the Commission's recommendations by \nthe end of next year.\n  Mr. President, for far too long, Social Security has been used by \npoliticians\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\non both sides of the aisle to polarize, manipulate and scare American \nvoters. The mere mention of ``Social Security reform'' has become a \nlightning rod for the fears of retirees and workers alike about their \nfinancial futures.\n  Seniors, particularly low-income seniors, are vulnerable to \nexaggerations and hyperbolic rhetoric about their retirement benefits. \nThey are often frightened into believing they will be homeless, \npenniless and starving if Congress reforms Social Security. We all know \nthat is simply not true. The benefits seniors receive today are not the \nissue--nobody wants to take them away. And it is disgraceful that some \nwould stoop so low as to play on the fears of older Americans.\n  The real issue driving Social Security reform--an issue that is only \nfrightening when left unresolved--is how to strengthen and protect the \nsystem so that it is available for future retirees, without putting an \nunfair financial burden on current and future workers. We have wasted \ntoo much time on partisan politics when we should have been working \ntogether to find a solution to the financial problems facing our \nnation's retirement system. We can no longer afford to just spout \nrhetoric about the need for reform, then deliberately avoid taking any \nconcrete action because of fears about how it may affect us in our next \nelection.\n  Social Security reform is not just a political problem; it is a \nserious economic problem for millions of Americans who are counting on \na retirement system that is in dire financial straits. It's time to \nstep up to our common responsibilities, not as Republicans or \nDemocrats, but as servants of the American people.\n  That is why I have joined with Senator Kerrey and Senator Moynihan to \nintroduce this bill to require the Congress to act, and act soon, on \nlegislation to preserve, protect, and reform Social Security. As my \ncolleagues know, Bob Kerrey and Pat Moynihan have worked tirelessly for \nmany years to highlight the urgent need for reform of the Social \nSecurity system, and they have succeeded in making the American people, \nif not the Congress, recognize that reforming our nation's retirement \nsystem must be a national priority.\n  Our bill sets out a timetable for action on Social Security reform by \nthe end of next year--November 2001.\n  First, the bipartisan, bicameral Social Security Protection, \nPreservation, and Reform Commission must be appointed by February 1, \n2001, and begin work within a month. The Commission will be made up of \n12 Members of Congress, selected in equal numbers by the Party Leaders \nin both Houses. In addition, the Commission of Social Security will \nserve as an ex-officio, non-voting member.\n  The Commission is given a reasonable period of time--six months--to \nconduct hearings, review the myriad of reform proposals already in the \npublic domain, and research new ideas to put together a comprehensive \nreform plan that meets the objectives set out in this bill.\n  Those broadly stated objectives represent the most basic requirements \nof meaningful Social Security reform:\n\n       Guaranteed 75-year solvency of the system;\n       Payment of all benefits to which retirees or workers are \n     entitled;\n       A reasonable rate of return on payroll tax contributions \n     for all generations;\n       An opportunity to participate in private investment \n     accounts;\n       A ``lockbox'' for the Social Security Trust Funds to \n     protect from spending raids; and\n       Use of non-Social Security surplus revenues to shore up the \n     system while implementing reform.\n\n  The Commission is required to submit its recommendations to Congress \nin the form of a detailed legislative proposal by September 1, 2001, \nand the bill's expedited procedures are designed to ensure a final vote \non Social Security reform by mid-November 2001. The strict time lines \nin the bill are designed to ensure that this vitally important issue is \ndealt with promptly--not pushed aside yet again, to be solved later.\n  Too often, election year politics stand as an obstacle to any \nmeaningful action in Congress. This proposal is carefully crafted to \navoid this. The bill is designed to ensure that Congress can complete \naction on Social Security reform by the end of 2001, before being \nconsumed by the political sparring of an election year.\n  Mr. President, each year that reform of the Social Security system is \npostponed, restoring solvency to the trust funds becomes more expensive \nand places a greater financial burden on current and future workers. \nThis ``principles and process'' legislation is, we believe, the only \nway to force Congress to pass a Social Security reform proposal that \nwill protect and preserve our nation's retirement system and also allow \nmore Americans to share in our nation's prosperity.\n\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to comment on the objectives, or \nprinciples, included in this bill. The objectives are intended as \nminimum guidelines for the Commission's work, not as a comprehensive \nblueprint for Social Security reform. We intentionally stated these \nobjectives as broadly as possible in order to give the Commission the \nopportunity to develop a comprehensive plan without micro-managing \ntheir every decision.\n  I believe very strongly that all promised benefits must be guaranteed \nunder any reform proposal, both for those currently receiving Social \nSecurity benefits and those who are working and paying into Social \nSecurity today. In addition, I will work to ensure that Social Security \nreform does not unfairly burden today's workers by increasing payroll \ntaxes from their current levels. And I do not believe it would be fair \nto further increase the eligibility age for receiving Social Security \nbenefits.\n  I am a strong proponent of allowing workers to invest a portion of \ntheir payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts that will provide a \nmuch greater return than the current Social Security system. This will \nafford all Americans the opportunity to have greater personal wealth \ncreation in addition to a minimum Social Security benefit.\n  Mr. President, I was very disappointed that Vice President Gore is \ncontinuing to use scare tactics about Social Security reform. Instead \nof putting the retirement needs of all Americans ahead of politics, the \nVice President seems content to exacerbate the financial burden facing \nour children and grandchildren by ignoring the real structural problems \nof the program. By using politically intimidating rhetoric, the Vice \nPresident is seriously harming bipartisan efforts in Congress to put \nthe needs of working Americans ahead of partisan politics.\n  Let's look at the facts. The savings rate in America today is \nappallingly low. Many low-income families have no savings at all, and a \nlarge number of middle-income Americans have less than $2,000 in the \nbank.\n  Because of this low savings rate, many Americans rely heavily on \nSocial Security benefits for their retirement income. But economists \nagree that the rate of return on Social Security payroll tax \ncontributions is abysmal--somewhere between 1 and 2 percent. Most \nworkers today are unaware that the payroll taxes they contribute to \nSocial Security may not provide anywhere near the income they expect \nwhen they retire. In fact, if nothing is done to reform the Social \nSecurity system, younger workers will receive nothing at all in return \nfor paying more than 6 percent of their earnings every pay day into the \nSocial Security system.\n  Allowing every worker to invest a portion of the payroll taxes they \nalready pay in a higher-yielding private account would make it possible \nfor families on very tight budgets to save more for their futures.\n\n  Even the most anemic savings account today realizes almost 3 percent, \nand secure short-term certificates of deposit return almost 6 percent. \nOver the past 50 years, the stock market has gained an average of more \nthan 6 percent per year, with 20 to 30 percent gains in several recent \nyears.\n  Proposals to allow every American to choose to invest a portion of \ntheir Social Security payroll taxes in a low- to moderate-risk private \ninvestment account are designed to give even the lowest-income families \nthe opportunity to share in our Nation's economic prosperity and create \nwealth for themselves and their children.\n  In the long run, diverting a portion of payroll taxes to personal \nretirement accounts will bring more money into the Social Security \nsystem. In the short run, it will cost money. Using a significant \nportion of the non-Social\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\nSecurity surplus revenues to shore up the Social Security system will \nensure that current retirees receive their full benefits while reforms \nare implemented. At the same time, reducing the financial insolvency of \nthe Social Security system through reform will also reduce our national \ndebt.\n  Mr. President, we all have opinions about how the Social Security \nprogram should or could be reformed, and I will have more to say about \nspecific aspects of Social Security reform when I introduce a \ncomprehensive reform bill later this month. Every one of these ideas \ndeserves fair and full consideration as we work together to restore \nsolvency to our Nation's retirement system. It is clear that we need a \nformal process and effective deadlines to review these ideas and \ndevelop and pass a real, meaningful plan to reform Social Security. \nThat is exactly what this bill will achieve.\n  Mr. President, Social Security is a sacred compact with workers and \nretirees that must be honored. The Congress has an obligation to \ndevelop a real, meaningful reform plan that strengthens and protects \nthe Social Security program for our Nation's seniors without placing an \nunfair burden on America's workers. And we must do it sooner rather \nthan later.\n  I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan politics and work with us \nto get this process legislation passed and begin the business of \nreforming Social Security now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2510\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Social Security Protection, \n     Preservation, and Reform Commission Act of 2000''.\n\n               TITLE I--FINDINGS AND OBJECTIVES OF REFORM\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Two-thirds of Americans depend on social security for \n     half or more of their income and 47 percent of beneficiaries \n     would be in poverty without their social security benefits.\n       (2) Social security is an unbreakable compact between \n     workers and retirees across generations that must be honored \n     and needs to be sustained.\n       (3) The social security trust funds will begin to run a \n     cash-flow deficit in 2015 and trust fund assets are expected \n     to be exhausted by 2037.\n       (4) Americans covered by the social security program are \n     required to pay into a system from which they can expect \n     lower rates of return than earlier generations.\n       (5) Each year that comprehensive reform of the social \n     security system is postponed, restoring actuarial solvency to \n     the trust funds becomes more expensive and places a greater \n     financial burden on current and future workers.\n\n     SEC. 102. OBJECTIVES OF REFORM.\n\n       Congress must act to reform the social security system so \n     that--\n       (1) beneficiaries receive the benefits to which they are \n     entitled based on a fair and equitable reform of that system;\n       (2) the long-term solvency of the social security system is \n     guaranteed for at least 75 years without any foreseeable \n     funding shortfall immediately following that period and cash-\n     flow deficits and pressure on future general revenues to pay \n     benefits is significantly reduced;\n       (3) every generation of workers is guaranteed a reasonable \n     comparable rate of return on all tax contributions;\n       (4) all Americans, particularly low-income workers, are \n     provided the opportunity to share in our Nation's economic \n     prosperity and create wealth for themselves and future \n     generations through a private investment account under that \n     system;\n       (5) revenues flowing into the Federal Old-Age, Survivors, \n     and Disability Trust Funds are protected from congressional \n     or other efforts to spend on nonsocial security related \n     purposes; and\n       (6) resources are made available from surplus non-social \n     security revenues to preserve and protect the social security \n     system while implementing reform.\n\n              TITLE II--SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM COMMISSION\n\n     SEC. 201. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n       There is established a commission to be known as the Social \n     Security Protection, Preservation, and Reform Commission (in \n     this title referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 202.

CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n       (a) Introduction of Recommendations and Committee \n     Consideration.--\n       (1) Introduction.--The legislative language transmitted \n     pursuant to section 202(b) with the recommendations for \n     reform of the Commission shall be in the form of a bill (in \n     this title referred to as the ``reform bill''). Such reform \n     bill shall be introduced in the House of Representatives by \n     the Speaker, and in the Senate, by the Majority Leader, \n     immediately upon receipt of the language and such reform bill \n     shall be referred to the appropriate committee of Congress \n     under paragraph (2). If the reform bill is not introduced in \n     accordance with the preceding sentence, the reform bill may \n     be introduced in either House of Congress by any member \n     thereof.\n       (2) Committee consideration.--\n       (A) Referral.--A reform bill introduced in the House of \n     Representatives shall be referred to the Committee on Ways \n     and Means of the House of Representatives. A reform bill \n     introduced in the Senate shall be referred to the Committee \n     on Finance of the Senate.\n       (B) Reporting.--Not later than 30 days after the \n     introduction of the reform bill, the committee of Congress to \n     which the reform bill was referred shall report the bill or a \n     committee amendment thereto.\n       (C) Discharge of committee.--If the committee to which is \n     referred a reform bill has not reported such reform bill (or \n     an identical reform bill) at the end of 30 calendar days \n     after its introduction or at the end of the first day after \n     there has been reported to the House involved a reform bill, \n     whichever is earlier, such committee shall be deemed to be \n     discharged from further consideration of such reform bill and \n     such reform bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar \n     of the House involved.\n       (b) Expedited Procedure.--\n       (1) Consideration.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 2 days after the date on \n     which a committee has been discharged from consideration of a \n     reform bill, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or \n     the Speaker's designee, or the Majority Leader of the Senate, \n     or the Leader's designee, shall move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the committee amendment to the reform bill, \n     and if there is no such amendment, to the reform bill. It \n     shall also be in order for any member of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, respectively, to move to \n     proceed to the consideration of the reform bill at any time \n     after the conclusion of such 2-day period.\n       (B) Points of order waived.--All points of order against \n     the reform bill (and against consideration of the reform \n     bill) are waived.\n       (C) Motion to proceed.--A motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of the reform bill is highly privileged in the \n     House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and \n     is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, to \n     a motion to postpone consideration of the reform bill, or to \n     a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A \n     motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion to proceed \n     is agreed to or not agreed to shall not be in order. If the \n     motion to proceed is agreed to, the House of Representatives \n     or the Senate, as the case may be, shall immediately proceed \n     to consideration of the reform bill without intervening \n     motion, order, or other business, and the reform bill shall \n     remain the unfinished business of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be, until \n     disposed of.\n       (D) Limited debate.--Debate on the reform bill and on all \n     debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith shall \n     be limited to not more than the lesser of 100 hours or 14 \n     days, which shall be divided equally between those favoring \n     and those opposing the reform bill. A motion further to limit \n     debate on the reform bill is in order and not debatable.\n       (E) Amendments.--\n       (i) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), amendments to the \n     reform bill--\n\n       (I) during consideration in the House of Representatives \n     shall be limited in accordance with a rule adopted by the \n     Committee on Rules of the House of Representatives; and\n       (II) during consideration in the Senate shall be limited \n     to--\n\n       (aa) one first degree amendment per member or that member's \n     designee with 1 hour of debate equally divided; and\n       (bb) germane second degree amendments (without limit) with \n     30 minutes of debate equally divided.\n       (ii) Leadership amendments.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives and the Majority Leader of the Senate and the \n     Minority Leader of the Senate may each offer 1 first degree \n     amendment (in addition to the amendments afforded such \n     members under clause (i)), with 4 hours of debate equally \n     divided on each such amendment offered. No second degree \n     amendments may be offered by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, or the \n     Minority Leader of the Senate in their leadership capacities.\n       (F) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on the reform bill, and on all \n     amendments offered to the reform bill, and all votes required \n     on amendments offered to the reform bill, the vote on final \n     passage of the reform bill shall occur.\n       (G) Other motions not in order.--A motion to postpone \n     consideration of the reform bill, a motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit the \n     reform bill is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote \n     by which the reform bill is agreed to or not agreed to is not \n     in order.\n       (H) Appeals.--Appeals from the decisions of the Chair \n     relating to the application of the rules of the House of \n     Representatives or of the Senate, as the case may be, to the \n     procedure relating to the reform bill shall be decided \n     without debate.\n       (2) Consideration by other house.--If, before the passage \n     by one House of the reform bill that was introduced in such \n     House, such House receives from the other House a reform bill \n     as passed by such other House--\n       (A) the reform bill of the other House shall not be \n     referred to a committee and may only be considered for final \n     passage in the House that receives it under subparagraph (C);\n       (B) the procedure in the House in receipt of the reform \n     bill of the other House, with respect to the reform bill that \n     was introduced in the House in receipt of the reform bill of \n     the other House, shall be the same as if no reform bill had \n     been received from the other House; and\n       (C) notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the vote on final \n     passage shall be on the reform bill of the other House.\n     Upon disposition of a reform bill that is received by one \n     House from the other House, it shall no longer be in order to \n     consider the reform bill that was introduced in the receiving \n     House.\n\n       (3) Consideration in conference.--\n       (A) Convening of conference.--\n       (i) In general.--Immediately upon a final passage of the \n     reform bill that results in a disagreement between the two \n     Houses of Congress with respect to the bill, the conferees \n     described in clause (ii) shall be appointed and a conference \n     convened.\n       (ii) Conferees described.--The conferees described in this \n     clause are the following:\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\n       (I) The Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n       (II) The Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.\n       (III) The Majority Leader of the Senate.\n       (IV) The Minority Leader of the Senate.\n       (V) Each member of the Committee on Ways and Means of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (VI) Each member of the Committee on Finance of the Senate.\n\n       (B) Deadline for report.--Not later than 14 days after the \n     date on which conferees are appointed, the conferees shall \n     file a report with the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate resolving the differences between the Houses on the \n     reform bill.\n       (C) Limitation on scope.--A report filed under subparagraph \n     (B) shall be limited to resolution of the differences between \n     the Houses on the reform bill and shall not include any other \n     matter.\n       (D) House consideration.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding any other rule of the \n     House of Representatives, it shall be in order to immediately \n     consider a report of a committee of conference on the reform \n     bill filed in accordance with subparagraph (B).\n       (ii) Debate.--Debate in the House of Representatives on the \n     conference report shall be limited to the lesser of 50 hours \n     or 7 days, equally divided and controlled by the Speaker of \n     the House of Representative and the Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives or their designees.\n       (iii) Limitation on motions.--A motion to further limit \n     debate on the conference report is not debatable. A motion to \n     recommit the conference report is not in order, and it is not \n     in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the \n     conference report is agreed to or disagreed to.\n       (iv) Vote on final passage.--A vote on final passage of the \n     conference report shall occur immediately at the conclusion \n     or yielding back of all time for debate on the conference \n     report.\n       (E) Senate consideration.--\n       (i) In general.--The motion to proceed to consideration in \n     the Senate of the conference report shall not be debatable \n     and the reading of such conference report shall be deemed to \n     have been waived.\n       (ii) Debate.--Consideration in the Senate of the conference \n     report on a reform bill shall be limited to the lesser of 50 \n     hours or 7 days, equally divided and controlled by the \n     Majority Leader and the Minority Leader or their designees.\n       (iii) Limitation on motion to recommit.--A motion to \n     recommit the conference report is not in order.\n       (4) Rules of the senate and house of representatives.--This \n     subsection is enacted by Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed to \n     be part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a bill, and it supersedes other \n     rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent with such \n     rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am joined by my esteemed colleagues \nSenator McCain and Senator Moynihan in introducing the Social Security \nProtection, Preservation, and Reform Commission Act of 1990''. I am \nhonored to join these two distinguished colleagues in an effort to \ncreate a bipartisan and bicameral Congressional Commission to reform \nSocial Security.\n  I am pleased to join Senator McCain in a serious effort to provoke \nthis body to move beyond demagoguery and toward action on the subject \nof Social Security reform. Senator McCain has had the unique benefit of \nspending the earlier part of this year talking to thousands of \nconstituents from across America about their hopes and concerns during \nthe course of his Presidential campaign. As Senator McCain has noted to \nme, a great majority of these people expressed particular concern for \nthe future state of the Social Security program. Americans have intense \nfeelings of patriotism where Social Security is concerned--and strongly \nsupport reworking and preserving this program for generations to come.\n  My friend's commitment to an honest debate and a reform agenda has \nsparked the continued interest and attention of millions of Americans--\nand his support of the Social Security reform cause makes the program's \neventual reform all the more likely.\n  I am also honored to be joining my dear friend Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan in introducing this legislation. Senator Moynihan has perhaps \nthe most distinguished record of accomplishment where Social Security \nis concerned of anyone in this body--perhaps even in this country. As a \nformer member of the Greenspan Commission, which restored solvency to \nthe Trust Funds in 1983, Senator Moynihan is a seasoned veteran of \nreform commissions--and we welcome his counsel on, and support of, this \nlegislation. My dear friend's participation in the Greenspan Commission \nalso reminds us of what can happen when Congress waits until the last \npossible moment to restore solvency to this important program. As my \ncolleagues may remember, the 1983 Commission met to discuss reforms at \na time when the program was in severe jeopardy--Social Security checks \nwere at risk of not being sent out. Since the 1983 reforms were \nenacted, future insolvency has again plagued the program. Senator \nMoynihan has been leading the charge to ensure that Congress does not \nmake the same mistake in waiting until 2037 to reform the program--he \nknows too well that fixing it now will alleviate great financial pain \non future generations. I have been honored to co-sponsor two reform \nbills with Senator Moynihan--and I am honored to call him a friend. His \nwise leadership on this and other issues will be dearly missed when he \nretires at the close of this 106th Congress.\n\n  I was skeptical at first about an effort to create a Congressional \nCommission to reform the Social Security program. But upon further \nconsideration, I have reached the conclusion that a bicameral, \nbipartisan Congressional Commission is the only way to move beyond the \npolarizing partisanship and inflammatory rhetoric that stalls action on \nthis important program.\n  The Commission envisioned in our bill will include equal numbers of \nRepublicans and Democrats, including the Chairs and Ranking Members of \nthe Ways and Means and Finance Committees, and the Commissioner of \nSocial Security as a non-voting, ex-officio member. Our bill also \ncreates an expedited process for consideration of the Commission's \nreform bill in the House and Senate. The process is similar to \nreconciliation protections for budget and tax measures--and will \nprevent Members from exercising delaying tactics.\n  Our bill also sets out a number of reform objectives for the \nCommission to meet, such as maintaining benefits for current \nbeneficiaries, restoring Trust Fund solvency for at least 75-years, and \nincluding some form of wealth creation component as part of the Social \nSecurity program.\n  I am particularly interested in encouraging this Commission to \ninclude some form of individual account provision--with special \nattention given to making the accounts and the program itself more \nprogressive for low and moderate income individuals.\n  As a Democrat, one of my greatest concerns is the growing wealth gap \nbetween the rich and poor. The latest Statistics of Income Bulletin \nfrom the IRS shows that the combined net worth of the top 4,400,000 \nAmericans was $6.7 trillion in 1995. In other words, the top 2.5% of \nour population held 27.4% of the nation's wealth in the mid-1990s. \nThese statistics highlight why we should be concerned about the growing \nwealth gap. The ownership of wealth brings security to people's lives. \nThe ownership of wealth opens up new opportunities. And the ownership \nof wealth transforms the way people view their futures.\n  An individual with no financial assets--and no means to accumulate \nfinancial assets--cannot count on a secure retirement or ensure that \nhis or her future health care needs will be met.\n  Ownership of wealth is a much more reliable way of becoming \nfinancially secure in old age than promises by politicians to tax and \ntransfer income. Ownership of wealth produces greater independence and \nhappiness. The mal-distribution of wealth (the rich getting richer and \nthe poor getting poorer) is not healthy for a liberal democracy and a \nfree market economy such as ours. Wealth ownership is the only path to \ntrue security--and we must work to enact laws that provide low and \nmoderate income families the opportunities and the tools to acquire \nwealth.\n  We will never reach a stage in which all Americans are full \nparticipants in the growth of the American economy, unless we enact \ncomprehensive pension reforms that will improve savings opportunities \nfor low income workers, and modernize and improve the Social\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\nSecurity program so that it becomes more than just a mechanism for \ntransferring income.\n  I look forward to a spirited and substantive debate on the subject of \nSocial Security in the upcoming Presidential election. And I am hopeful \nthat our Congressional Commission proposal can become the vehicle by \nwhich the next President can work with Congress to create a bipartisan \nconsensus on Social Security reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2511. A bill to establish the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm \nNational Heritage Area in the State of Alaska, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n kenai mountains-turnagain arm national heritage corridor area act of \n                                  2000\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nto establish the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Heritage Area \nin my State of Alaska.\n  The Heritage Area, when enacted, will include the first leg of the \nIditarod National Historic Trail and most of the Seward Highway \nNational Scenic Byway. Through National Heritage designation these \nroutes will be portrayed and interpreted as part of the whole picture \nof human history in the wider transportation corridor through the \nmountains, which includes early Native trade routes, connections by \nwaterway, the railroad, and other trails and roadways.\n  This proposal differs from the 16 existing National Heritage Areas. \nThe fact that it would be one of a kind strengthens the case for \ndesignation.\n  Unlike any of the existing National Heritage Areas, the Kenai \nMountains-Turnagain Arm National Historic Corridor will highlight the \nexperience of the western frontier--of transportation and settlement in \na difficult landscape--of the gold rush and resource development in a \nremote area. These are the themes of the proposal--themes that formed \nour perception of ourselves as a nation. The proposed Heritage Area \nwonderfully expresses these themes.\n  Within the proposed Heritage Area there are a number of small \nhistoric communities that developed around transportation and the gold \nrush. They are dwarfed by the sweeping landscapes of the region, by the \nmagnificence of the mountains, and the dominance and strength of \nnature.\n  Turnagain Arm, once a critical transportation link, has the world's \nsecond largest tidal range. Visitors can stand along the shore lines \nand actually watch 30-foot tides move in and out of the arm. On \noccasion, the low roar of an oncoming bore tide can be heard as a wall \nof water sweeps up the Turnagain.\n  A traveler through the alpine valleys and mountain passes of the \nHeritage Area can see evidence of retreating glaciers, earthquake \nsubsidence, and avalanches. Dall sheep, beluga whales, moose, bald \neagles, trumpeter swans, and Artic terns give glimpses of their \npresence.\n  Through this rugged terrain humans have developed transportation \nroutes into South-central and Interior Alaska. Travel was channeled \nthrough the valleys and on the rivers and fjord-like lakes. First came \nAlaska Natives, establishing trading paths. Later the Russians, gold \nrush stampeders, and all types of people arrived seeking access into \nthe resource-rich land. The famous Iditarod Trail to Nome, which was \nused to haul mail in and gold out, started at Seward.\n  A series of starts and stops by railroad entrepreneurs eventually \nculminated in the completion of the railroad from Seward to Fairbanks \nby the federal government. President Harding boarded the train in \nSeward in 1923 to drive the golden spike at Nenana (and died on the \nboat returning to Seattle). It was only in the last half of this \ncentury that the highway from Seward to Anchorage was opened. Before \nthen the small communities of the area were linked to the rest of \nAlaska by wagon trail, rail, and by boat across Turnagain Arm and the \nKenai River.\n  The Heritage Area contains one of the earliest mining regions in \nAlaska. Russians left evidence of their search for gold at Bear Creek \nnear Hope. In 1895, discovery of a rich deposit at Canyon Creak \nprecipitated the Turnagain Arm Gold Rush, predating the stampede to the \nKlondike.\n  The early settlements and communities of the area are still very much \nas they were in the past. But, as in the early days, this is a region \nwhere ``nature is boss,'' and historic trails and evidence of mining \nhistory are often embedded and nearly hidden in the landscape. What can \nbe seen stands as powerful testimony to the human fortitude, \nperseverance, and resourcefulness that is America's proudest heritage \nfrom the people who settled the Alaskan frontier.\n  People living in the Kenai Mountains--Turnagain Arm areas share a \nsense that it is a special place. In part, this is simply because of \nthe sheer natural beauty; but it is also because the Alaska frontier is \nrelative recent. Memories of the times when the inhabitants were \ndependent on their own resources, and on each other, are still very \nmuch alive.\n  Communities are small, but they are alive with volunteerism. All have \nactive historical societies. Groups in Seward and Girdwood have \norganized to rebuild the Iditarod Trail. In the town of Hope citizens \nconstructed a museum of mining history, building it themselves out of \nlogs and donated materials. Local people have conducted historic \nbuilding surveys, written books and short histories, collected and \npublished old diaries, and created web pages to record and share the \nhistory of their communities. Seward, the corridor's gateway, has \ncreated a delightful array of visitor opportunities that display and \ninterpret the region's natural setting, Native culture, and history. \nNational Heritage Area designation would greatly encourage and expand \nthese good efforts.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that this National Heritage \nArea is a local grass roots effort and it will remain a locally driven \ngrass roots effort. Decisions will be made by locals, not by Federal \nbureaucrats. The only role of the Federal Government is to provide \ntechnical expertise, mostly in the areas of the interpretation of the \nmany historic sites and tremendous natural resource features that are \nfound throughout the entire region. There will be no additional land \nownership by the Federal Government or by the local management entity \nthat is charged with putting together a coordinated plan to interpret \nthe Heritage Area. The Heritage Area is about local people working \ntogether.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be printed in the \nRecord and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2511\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to convey certain Federal properties on Governors \nIsland, New York; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               governors island preservation act of 2000\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with my distinguished \ncolleague and fellow New Yorker, Senator Schumer,\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\nto introduce the ``Governors Island Preservation Act of 2000.'' This \nbill will establish the Governors Island National Monument preserving \ntwo of New York Harbor's earliest fortifications, Fort Jay and Castle \nWilliams. The balance of the property will be conveyed to the State of \nNew York. New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and New York State \nGovernor George E. Pataki have developed a plan for the reuse of \nGovernors Island. Their agreement has helped to make this bill \npossible, and both deserve much credit.\n  Congress stipulated in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that Governors \nIsland be sold ``at fair market value'' no sooner than Fiscal Year \n2002. Without the benefit of an appraisal, the Congressional Budget \nOffice determined its value to be somewhere between $250 million and $1 \nbillion. As Congress continued its work on the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, $500 million of Federal revenue was identified in Fiscal Year \n2002 through the sale of Governors Island. A fantasy perhaps, but no \nmatter, the money had been found.\n  Governors Island has played a significant role in every major \nmilitary conflict from the American Revolution through World War II. In \nApril of 1776, General Israel Putnam and 1,000 officers arrived on \nGovernors Island and began erecting fortifications. Three months later, \nthe guns at Governors Island prevented Admiral Howe's 400 ships and \nLord Cornwallis' army--32,000 men strong--from crushing General George \nWashington's badly overwhelmed forces during the Battle of Long Island. \nOutflanked in Brooklyn, Washington's men retreated to the island of \nManhattan across the East River under the cover of the Governors \nIsland's guns. At the risk of falling into what historians term a \n``teleological trap,'' I would suggest that the Revolution could well \nhave ended right then and there.\n  During the War of 1812, the guns at the ``cheese-box'' shaped Castle \nWilliams--and those at the Southwest Battery--dissuaded the British \nfrom mounting a direct attack on New York City, then the Nation's \nprincipal seaport.\n  During the Civil War, Governors Island served as the primary Eastern \nSeaboard recruiting depot for Union soldiers. Nearly 5,000 Union \ndraftees and volunteers were stationed there. Its inaccessibility \nproved useful for garrisoning the most recalcitrant of Confederate \nsoldiers, who were confined both in Castle Williams and Fort Jay. Only \none, Captain William Robert Webb, managed to escape. It will give my \ncolleagues some measure of satisfaction to learn that this artful rebel \nwas later appointed U.S. Senator from Tennessee.\n\n  After the U.S. Congress declared war with Germany and Austria-Hungary \non April 6, 1917, Governors Island became an embarkation point for the \nwar effort. Several years earlier, the Island was expanded to its \ncurrent 172-acre size by the excavation of the Lexington Avenue Subway \nline, which generated over 4.7 million tons of fill. The additional \nspace permitted the construction of over 70 buildings providing a \ncombined total of 30 million square feet of storage space. As the War \nescalated, estimates place the value of goods transported from \nGovernors Island to the European theater at over $1 million per day--in \n1917 dollars.\n  More than 20 years later, the famed General Hugh Drum commanded the \nFirst Army from Governors Island as the United States prepared for the \nSecond World War. Once war was declared, Governors Island served as the \nheadquarters for the Eastern Defense Command, which was tasked with \nprotecting the Eastern Seaboard from Nazi attack.\n  In 1966, the Coast Guard assumed control of Governors Island, and \nremained there for 30 years. After lighting the refurbished Statue of \nLiberty from Governors Island on July 4, 1986, President Reagan grew \nfond of Governors Island. On December 7, 1988, he chose the Admiral's \nHouse on Governors Island to meet Soviet Premier Mikhail S. Gorbachev \nto present each other with the Articles of Ratification of the \nIntermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty.\n  It is inconceivable that Congress would permit this site, so rich in \nhistory, to be recklessly sold to the highest bidder.\n  In January of this year, Governor Pataki and Mayor Giuliani announced \nan agreement on a preservation plan for Governors Island. The Governors \nIsland Preservation Act is based upon that plan and calls for the \nestablishment of the Governors Island National Monument to be comprised \nof Fort Jay and Castle Williams (so named after Lt. Col. Jonathan \nWilliams, the first superintendent of West Point). Once the Monument is \nestablished, all of the historic New York Harbor forts--Fort Wood (the \nbase of the Statue of Liberty), the Southwest Battery (now Castle \nClinton National Monument), and Fort Gibson (partially demolished to \nprovide for the construction of Ellis Island)--will be within the \nNational Park Service inventory.\n  The remaining portions of the Island will be conveyed to the Empire \nState Development Corporation, as agreed to by Mayor Giuliani and \nGovernor Pataki. Their plan will incorporate a public park, athletic \nfields, a museum dedicated to the history and ecology of the Hudson \nRiver and New York Harbor, a family center modeled after Colonial \nWilliamsburg, a conference center, and a hotel. After 200 years of \nFederal occupation, Governors Island will at last be open to the \npublic.\n  I thank the chair and I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to offer a few brief remarks \nto underscore several of the points that my colleague, Senator \nMoynihan, made when he introduced the ``Governors Island Preservation \nAct of 2000,'' a bill I gladly cosponsored.\n  The first point is that Governors Island is truly a national \ntreasure. It has played a significant role in nearly every American \nbattle from the Revolution through World War II. During the War of \n1812, it is credited with preventing a direct British attack on the \nCity of New York--then the Nation's principal seaport. It served as the \nUnion's foremost recruiting depot and as a Confederate prison during \nthe Civil War.\n  The second point, Mr. President, is that its historical structures \nhave been placed in no small degree of danger by the statutorily \nmandated Fiscal Year 2002 sale date. If the Island should be sold then \n``at fair market value,'' there simply is no guarantee the Castle \nWilliams, Fort Jay, Building 400--a McKim, Meade & White masterpiece \nthought to be the largest single Army barrack ever constructed, the \n1708 Governor's house, and the entire Governors Island National \nHistoric Landmark District will be protected. When the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997 was being negotiated, Congress faced seemingly intractable, \nstructural deficits. We had to make a great many difficult and, if I \nmay, extreme choices to bring the Federal budget into balance. Three \nyears later, our circumstances are quite different. Fiscal austerity \nhas paid its dividends and we are approaching an era of surpluses much \nsooner that we might have otherwise imagined. Should we still be \nproposing to sell off such an important piece of American history?\n  Finally, Mr. President, my colleague mentioned the issue of fairness. \nNew York gave Governors Island to the national government in 1800. No \ncomplaints. The British and the French were then poised to attack our \nyoung nation. Now the Federal government has no use for Governors \nIsland--the Coast Guard found it too expensive to maintain--it is only \nright that the people of New York get their property back. The \nGovernors Island Preservation Act of 2000 will do just that. In \naddition, it will establish the Governors Island National Monument \nwhich will provide all Americans--for the first time--with the \nopportunity to learn of the Island's rich contributions to American \nhistory while experiencing the spectacular views of New York Harbor \nfrom this idyllic setting.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Robb, Mr. Dodd. Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Harkin, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 2513. A bill to strengthen control by consumers over the use and \ndisclosure of their personal financial and health information by \nfinancial institutions, and for other purposes to the committee on \nBanking Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\n              financial information privacy protection act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nFinancial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000, which was crafted \nby President Clinton and Vice President Gore. I am delighted to be \njoined by Senator Sarbanes, the Ranking Member of the Senate Banking \nCommittee, who is a real leader in the Senate on protecting personal \nfinancial information. I am also pleased that Senators Robb, Dodd, \nKerry, Bryan, Edwards, Durbin, Harkin and Feinstein are original \ncosponsors of this legislation to protect the financial privacy of all \nAmericans.\n  Last November, President Clinton signed into law the landmark \nFinancial Modernization Act of 1999, which updates our financial laws \nand opens up the financial services industry to become more \ncompetitive, both at home and abroad. Many of my colleagues and I \nsupported that legislation because we believe it will benefit \nbusinesses and consumers. It will make it easier for banking, \nsecurities, and insurance firms to consolidate their services, cut \nexpenses and offer more products at a lower cost to all. But it also \nraises new concerns about our financial privacy.\n  New conglomerates in the financial services industry may now offer a \nwidening variety of services, each of which may require a customer to \nprovide financial, medical or other personal information. Nothing in \nthe new law prevents these new subsidiaries or affiliates of financial \nconglomerates from sharing this information for uses beyond those the \ncustomer thought he or she was providing it. For example, the new law \nhas no requirement for the consumer to control whether these new \nfinancial subsidiaries or affiliates sell, share, or publish \ninformation on savings account balances, certificates of deposit \nmaturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases and sales, \nlife insurance payouts or health insurance claims. That is wrong.\n  When President Clinton signed the financial modernization bill last \nyear, he directed the National Economic Council to work with the \nTreasury Department and Office of Management and Budget to craft a \nlegislative proposal to protect financial privacy in the new financial \nservices marketplace. The result of that process is the bill we are \nintroducing today.\n  I believe the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 \nshould serve as the foundation for model financial privacy legislation \nthat Congress enacts into law this year. This bill is a common sense \napproach that can attract both consumers and the industry. It sands off \nthe extremes at both ends of the issue. We need a catalyst to bring \nboth sides together, and this bill can do it.\n  Privacy is one of our most vulnerable rights in the information age. \nDigitalization of information offers tremendous benefits but also new \nthreats. Some in Congress are content to punt the privacy issue down \nthe field for another year. The public disagrees. People know that the \nlonger we dawdle, the harder it will be to halt the erosion of privacy. \nA year is an eternity in the digital age.\n  The right of privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by \nthe Constitution of the United States. But today, the American people \nare growing more and more concerned over encroachments on their \npersonal privacy. To return personal financial privacy to the control \nof the consumer, the Administration's financial privacy legislation \nwould create the following enforceable rights in Federal law.\n  New Right To Opt-out of Information Sharing By Affiliates. The new \nfinancial modernization law permits consumers to say no to information \nsharing, selling or publishing among third parties in many cases, but \nnot among affiliated firms. The Financial Information Privacy \nProtection Act of 2000 would require financial conglomerates, which \nwill only grow under the new modernization law, to expand this \nprotection to give consumers the right to notify it (opt-out) to stop \nall information sharing, selling or publishing of personal financial \ninformation among all third parties and affiliates.\n  New Right For Consumers To Opt-In For Sharing of Medical Information \nand Personal Spending Habits. The Financial Information Privacy \nProtection Act of 2000 would require financial firms to get the \naffirmative consent (opt-in) of consumers before a firm could gain \naccess to medical information within a financial conglomerate or share \ndetailed information about a consumer's personal spending habits.\n  New Right To Access and Correct Financial Information. The Financial \nInformation Privacy Protection Act of 2000 would give consumers the \nright to review and correct their financial records, just like \nconsumers today may review and correct their credit reports.\n  New Right To Privacy Policy Up Front. The Financial Information \nPrivacy Protection Act of 2000 would require financial firms to provide \ntheir privacy policies to consumers before committing to a customer \nrelationship, not after. In addition, the bill's new rights would be \nenforced by federal banking regulators, the Federal Trade Commission \nand state attorney generals.\n  As President Clinton warned all Americans: ``Although consumers put a \ngreat value on privacy of their financial records, our laws have not \ncaught up to technological developments that make it possible and \npotentially profitable for companies to share financial data in new \nways. Consumers who undergo physical exams to obtain insurance, for \nexample, should not have to fear the information will be used to lower \ntheir credit card limits or deny them mortgages.'' I strongly agree.\n  Unfortunately, if you have a checking account, you may have a \nfinancial privacy problem. Your bank may sell or share with business \nallies information about who you are writing checks to, when, and for \nhow much. And even if you tell your bank to stop, it can ignore you \nunder current law. This legislation returns to consumers the power to \nstop the selling or sharing of personal financial information.\n  Americans ought to be able to enjoy the exciting innovations of this \nburgeoning information era without losing control over the use of their \nfinancial information. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act \nof 2000 updates United States privacy laws to provide these fundamental \nprotections of personal financial information in the evolving financial \nservices industry. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nFinancial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 and a section-by-\nsection analysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2513\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FTC RULEMAKING AUTHORITY UNDER THE FAIR CREDIT \n                   REPORTING ACT.\n\n       Section 621(e) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \n     1681s(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(3) Regulations.--The Federal Trade Commission shall \n     prescribe such regulations as necessary to carry out the \n     provisions of this title with respect to any persons \n     identified under paragraph (1) of subsection (a). Prior to \n     prescribing such regulations, the Federal Trade Commission \n     shall consult with the Federal banking agencies referred to \n     in paragraph (1) of this subsection in order to ensure, to \n     the extent possible, comparability and consistency with the \n     regulations issued by the Federal banking agencies under that \n     paragraph.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Financial Information Privacy Protection Act--Section-by-Section \n                                Analysis\n\n     Section 1: Short Title; table of Contents\n     Section 101: Opt-out Requirement for Disclosure to Affiliates \n         and Nonaffiliated Third Parties\n       The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requires a financial \n     institution to give consumers notice of, and an opportunity \n     to prevent (opt out of), sharing of their nonpublic personal \n     information with companies that are not affiliated with the \n     financial institution (nonaffiliated third parties). Section \n     101 of the bill strengthens consumers' control over their \n     personal financial information by expanding this opt-out \n     right to cover information sharing between financial \n     institutions and their affiliates.\n       Section 101 also requires that when a financial institution \n     notifies a consumer of its intent to share the consumer's \n     information and gives the consumer the opportunity to opt-\n     out, the consumer must be able to exercise the opt-out choice \n     through the same method of communication by which the \n     financial institution communicated the opt-out notice to the \n     consumer, or by another method at least as convenient to the \n     consumer. For example, if a financial institution gives a \n     consumer an opt-out notice by electronic mail, the consumer \n     would have to be able to exercise the opt-out by a method at \n     least as convenient, such as by electronic mail or by \n     telephone, but could not be required to opt-out via an \n     individual letter.\n       The GLBA currently includes general exceptions to the \n     notice and opt-out requirement--for example, to allow \n     processing a consumer's transaction, to prevent fraud, or to \n     control institutional risk. The bill would also apply these \n     exceptions to information sharing with affiliates.\n     Section 102: Limitation on Transfer of Information About \n         Personal Spending Habits\n       Section 102 of the bill strengthens consumers' control over \n     the detailed information that financial firms can learn about \n     their personal spending habits and sources of income. In the \n     course of providing a payment mechanism for consumers, \n     financial institutions such as credit card companies, banks \n     and brokers--when they provide checking or money market \n     accounts--learn to whom a consumer makes payments, from whom \n     the consumer receives payments, and what the payments are \n     for.\n       The bill recognizes the special sensitivity of this \n     information. It requires that where a financial institution \n     is providing payment services for a consumer, the institution \n     cannot disclose the consumer's spending habits--whether in \n     the form of a list of the consumer's transactions or as a \n     description of the consumer's interests, preferences, or \n     other characteristics derived from payment information--\n     unless the institution clearly and conspicuously requests \n     permission from the consumer, and the consumer affirmatively \n     consents (opts in). This applies for transfers to both \n     nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates.\n       Section 102 includes the exceptions for transaction \n     processing, servicing of customer accounts, and other \n     necessary activities such as law enforcement.\n     Section 103: Restricting the Use of Health Information in \n         Making Credit and Other Financial Decisions\n       Limitation on Receipt of Consumer Health Information from \n           Affiliates\n       Section 103(a) of the bill prevents financial institutions \n     from using a consumer's health information held at an \n     affiliate in order to discriminate in the provision of credit \n     and financial services. Section 103(a) provides that in \n     deciding whether, and on what terms, to offer, provide, or \n     continue to provide a particular financial product or service \n     to a consumer, a financial institution may not obtain, \n     receive, evaluate, or otherwise consider individually \n     identifiable health information about the consumer from an \n     affiliate unless the financial institution: (1) clearly and \n     conspicuously requests permission from the consumer; (2) \n     obtains the consumer's affirmative consent; and (3) requires \n     the same information about all consumers as a condition for \n     receiving the financial product or service.\n       Relation to the Health Insurance Portability and \n           Accountability Act\n       Section 103(b) of the bill clarifies that the provisions of \n     subtitle A of title V of the GLBA, which create protections \n     for the privacy of consumers' financial information, do not \n     in any way modify or override the requirements of the \n     regulations issued by the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services implementing the privacy and security protections \n     for consumers' individually identifiable health information \n     under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \n     of 1996 (HIPAA). Nor do the requirements of the GLBA \n     governing protection of consumers' financial information \n     authorize any use of individually identifiable health \n     information that would be inconsistent with other laws that \n     apply to such information. Section 103(c) makes clear that \n     for purposes of this provision, the term ``individually \n     identifiable health information'' has the same meaning as \n     under the HIPAA.\n     Section 104: Limits on Redisclosure and Reuse of Information\n       The GLBA imposes certain limits on a nonaffiliated third \n     party's ability to redisclose nonpublic personal information \n     received from a financial institution. The GLBA does not \n     prohibit a third party from redisclosing this information to \n     its own affiliates or to affiliates of the financial \n     institution from whom it received the information. In \n     addition, the third party may disclose the information to \n     another company if that disclosure would be lawful if made \n     directly by the financial institution.\n       Section 104 of the bill tightens the limits on redisclosure \n     and extends them to a financial institution's affiliates, in \n     order to parallel the new opt-out requirement for disclosure \n     of information to affiliates. Under section 104, when a \n     financial institution discloses nonpublic personal \n     information to either an affiliate or a nonaffiliated \n     third party, the recipient of the information may not \n     redisclose the information to any other person unless that \n     disclosure would be lawful if made directly by the \n     financial institution.\n       Section 104 also clarifies how the limits on redisclosure \n     apply when a financial institution discloses a consumer's \n     nonpublic personal information to another company pursuant to \n     one of the general exceptions to the opt-out requirement. \n     Section 104 provides that an affiliate or a nonaffiliated \n     third party that receives nonpublic personal information from \n     a financial institution under one of the general exceptions \n     may use or disclose that information only: (1) as permitted \n     under that general exception; or (2) under another general \n     exception, if necessary to carry out the purpose for which \n     the information was originally disclosed under a general \n     exception.\n       Since the opt-in requirement for the disclosure of personal \n     spending information by payment service providers is subject \n     to some, but not all, of the general exceptions, only a \n     subset of the general exceptions apply to reuse and \n     redisclosure by recipients of such information.\n     Section 105: Consumer Rights to Access and Correct \n         Information\n       Section 105 of the bill gives consumers the right to access \n     and to correct information about them that is under the \n     control of, and reasonably available to a financial \n     institution. A financial institution would not, however, be \n     required to give consumers access to confidential commercial \n     information, to make disclosures that would interfere with \n     law enforcement, or to create new records in order to comply \n     with a consumer's request for information.\n       Section 105 also requires financial institutions to give \n     consumers the opportunity to dispute the accuracy of \n     information disclosed to the consumer and to present evidence \n     of any inaccuracy. The financial institution must correct or \n     delete material information identified by the consumer that \n     is materially incomplete or inaccurate. In addition, a \n     financial institution may impose a reasonable fee for making \n     information available to consumers, as long as consumers \n     receive prior notice of the fee.\n       In promulgating regulations to implement the new access and \n     correction requirements, federal regulators must consult and \n     coordinate with one another in order to ensure that the \n     regulations: (1) impose consistent requirements across \n     financial institutions; (2) take into account conditions \n     under which the financial institutions do business in the \n     U.S. and abroad; and (3) are technology neutral.\n     Section 106: Improved Enforcement Authority\n       Compliance with Privacy Policy\n       The GLBA does not clearly explain whether a financial \n     institution is legally required\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\n     to abide by commitments it makes to consumers in its privacy \n     policy if those commitments are not required by law. Section \n     106(a) of the bill clarifies that a financial institution's \n     failure to comply with any of the privacy policies or \n     practices disclosed to a consumer constitutes a violation \n     of law.\n       Clarification of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Enforcement \n           Authority\n       Section 106(b) of the bill makes clear that if a financial \n     institution or other person under the FTC's enforcement \n     jurisdiction under subtitle A of title V of the GLBA engages \n     in an activity that violates subtitle A, that activity \n     constitutes an unfair and deceptive trade practice under the \n     Federal Trade Commission Act. Consequently, in addressing \n     such a violation, the FTC could use all the enforcement tools \n     it has with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices \n     under the FTC Act.\n       State Enforcement Authority Concurrent with FTC\n       Section 106(c) of the bill gives States concurrent \n     authority with the FTC to enforce the GLBA's privacy \n     requirements with respect to FTC-regulated entities. Section \n     106(d) gives the States concurrent authority with the FTC to \n     enforce the GLBA's prohibitions on ``pretext calling,'' which \n     involves obtaining customer information from a financial \n     institution under false pretenses. Enforcement with regard to \n     banking institutions would continue to be done solely by the \n     federal banking agencies.\n     Section 107: Enhanced Disclosure of Privacy Policies\n       Timing of Disclosure of Privacy Policy\n       The GLBA requires financial institutions to provide their \n     privacy policies to consumers at the time of establishing a \n     customer relationship and at least annually during the \n     continuation of the relationship. The phrase ``at time of \n     establishing a customer relationship'' does not provide clear \n     guidance regarding when a financial institution must provide \n     its privacy policy to those individuals seeking to become its \n     customers. Section 107(a) of the bill is intended to clarify \n     the timing of notice delivery, and to ensure that individuals \n     are able to receive copies of financial institutions' privacy \n     policies before they commit time and resources to dealing \n     with any one financial institution. The bill specifically \n     clarifies that financial institutions must provide their \n     privacy policies to individuals upon request and as part of \n     an application for a financial product or service. Thus, \n     consumers will be empowered to comparison shop based on \n     privacy practices.\n       Content of Privacy Policy--Disclosure of Rights to Access \n           and Correct Information\n       Section 107(b) requires a financial institution's privacy \n     policy to include a statement of the consumer's rights to \n     access and correct information held by the financial \n     institution (see discussion of section 105 regarding \n     consumers' rights to access and correct information).\n     Section 108: Prohibition on Sharing of Account Numbers\n       The GLBA prohibits financial institutions from disclosing \n     consumers' account numbers or access codes to nonaffiliated \n     third parties (other than consumer reporting agencies) for \n     marketing purposes. Section 108 of the bill extends this \n     prohibition to disclosures to affiliates.\n     Section 109: Exceptions to the Opt-out and Opt-in \n         Requirements\n       Agency and Joint Marketing Exception\n       Section 502(c) of the GLBA creates an exception to the opt-\n     out requirement where a financial institution discloses a \n     consumer's nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated \n     third party that is acting as the financial institution's \n     agent. This exception permits a financial institution to \n     disclose consumers' nonpublic personal information to third \n     parties in connection with outsourcing certain functions, \n     such as back-office operations or direct mailings to market \n     the financial institution's own products, without giving \n     consumers the option to prevent disclosure. The financial \n     institution is, however, required to give consumers notice of \n     such disclosures and to enter into agreements with the third \n     parties to maintain the confidentiality of the consumers' \n     information.\n       Among the services and functions covered by the principal-\n     agent exception are certain joint marketing arrangements, \n     where a third party markets financial products or services \n     pursuant to a joint agreement between two or more financial \n     institutions. The joint marketing agreement exception was \n     enacted to allow financial institutions without affiliates, \n     particularly small institutions, to be able to jointly market \n     their products under the same rules that affiliates may do \n     so--that is, free from any opt-out requirement.\n       As noted in the discussion of sections 101 and 102 above, \n     the bill imposes the same restrictions on information sharing \n     between affiliates that now apply to information sharing \n     between financial institutions and nonaffiliated third \n     parties. Therefore, because coverage of information sharing \n     among affiliates and with third parties would be equivalent, \n     the joint marketing exception is rendered unnecessary, and is \n     eliminated. The bill also moves the remaining principal-agent \n     exception from section 502(c) of the GLBA to the list of \n     general exceptions in 502(e), which is redesignated as \n     502(f).\n       Customer Service and Consolidated Statements\n       Among the general exceptions to the notice and opt-out \n     requirements in the GLBA are disclosures for servicing \n     customer accounts and resolving customer disputes or \n     inquires. These exceptions are intended to permit financial \n     institutions to share information in response to customer \n     service needs. Section 109(7) of the bill expands the general \n     exceptions to include disclosures necessary to facilitate \n     customer service such as maintenance and operation of \n     consolidated customer call centers and the use of \n     consolidated customer account statements.\n       Technical Amendments\n       Section 109 of the bill makes technical amendments to the \n     list of general exceptions in section 502(e) of the GLBA, by \n     splitting an existing exception that deals with disclosures \n     to rating agencies and attorneys, and by adding a conforming \n     statutory reference.\n     Section 110: Definitions\n       ``Financial Institution''\n       The financial privacy requirements of subtitle A of title V \n     of the GLBA apply to ``financial institutions,'' which are \n     defined as institutions the business of which is engaging in \n     activities that have been specified as ``financial \n     activities'' under certain statutes and regulations. The \n     GLBA, however, specifically excludes three types of entities \n     from the definition of ``financial institution.'' They are: \n     (1) any person or entity to the extent engaged in a financial \n     activity that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commodity \n     Futures Trading Commission; (2) the institutions of the Farm \n     Credit System; and 3) institutions chartered by Congress to \n     engage in certain securitization or secondary market sale \n     transactions, as long as such institutions do not sell or \n     transfer nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated \n     third parties. Section 109(1) of the bill eliminates these \n     exclusions in order to ensure consistency in the protection \n     of consumers' nonpublic personal information under the GLBA. \n     The bill preserves the existing general exception for \n     disclosures in connection with securitization or secondary \n     market sales transactions.\n       ``Nonpublic Personal Information''\n       Section 110(2) of the bill revises the definition of \n     ``nonpublic personal information'' in order to clarify that \n     the term includes a consumer's Social Security number. This \n     provision also clarifies that publicly available information \n     about consumers also would be covered whether or not that \n     information is disclosed as part of a larger list of \n     consumers or as it pertains to an individual consumer. Under \n     current law, this type of information is covered only if it \n     is part of a list of more than one consumer.\n       ``Consumer''\n       Under the GLBA, the term ``consumer'' is defined as an \n     individual who obtains a financial product or service from a \n     financial institution for personal, family, or household \n     purposes, or such person's legal representative. Section \n     109(3) of the bill amends the definition of ``consumer'' to \n     clarify that the term includes an individual who applies for, \n     but does not necessarily obtain, such products or services \n     from a financial institution.\n     Section 111: Implementing Regulations\n       Section 110(a) of the bill authorizes the federal \n     regulators who have rulemaking authority under subtitle A of \n     title V of the GLBA to issue regulations implementing the \n     amendments made by the bill. The bill requires these agencies \n     to include in their regulations requirements they determine \n     are appropriate to prevent circumvention or evasion of any of \n     the bill's requirements. Section 110(b) provides that in \n     issuing their regulations, the agencies must follow the \n     procedures and requirements set forth in section 504(a) of \n     the GLBA that currently apply to their rulemaking authority. \n     Specifically, the agencies must consult with each other and \n     with representatives of state insurance authorities, and must \n     issue consistent and comparable rules, to the extent \n     possible. The statutory deadline in section 504(a)(3), which \n     is set in relation to the date of the enactment of the GLBA, \n     is obsolete for purposes of the regulations implementing this \n     bill, and therefore does not apply.\n     Section 112: FTC Rulemaking Authority Under the Fair Credit \n         Reporting Act (FCRA)\n       Section 112 of the bill amends section 621(e) of FCRA by \n     establishing rulemaking authority for the Federal Trade \n     Commission. This amendment creates parity with the federal \n     banking agencies and the National Credit Union \n     Administration, which each obtained rulemaking authority \n     under the FCRA for their respective regulated entities \n     pursuant to section 506 of the GLBA. Extending this authority \n     to the FTC fills a gap in administrative enforcement under \n     the FCRA.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to address a very important \nissue: the protection of every American's personal, sensitive, \nfinancial and medical information which is held by their financial \ninstitutions. I am pleased to join Senator Leahy, the chairman of the \nSenate Democratic Privacy Task Force, and Senators Dodd, Kerry, Bryan, \nEdwards, Robb, Durbin, Harkin, and Feinstein in co-sponsoring the \nFinancial Information Privacy Protection Act.\n  This bill, submitted to us by the Clinton-Gore Administration, seeks \nto\n\n[[Page S3537]]\n\nprotect a fundamental right of privacy for every American who entrusts \nhis or her highly sensitive and confidential financial and medical \ninformation to a financial institution.\n  Every American should at least have the opportunity to say `no' if he \nor she does not want that nonpublic information disclosed. Every \nAmerican should have the right to have especially sensitive information \nheld by his or her financial institution kept confidential unless \nconsent is given. Every American should be allowed to make certain that \nthe information to be shared is accurate and, if not, to have it \ncorrected. And these rights should be enforced.\n  Mr. President, the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act would \naccomplish these objectives.\n  Few Americans understand that, under current Federal law, a financial \ninstitution could take information it obtained about a customer through \nhis or her transactions, and sell or transfer that information to an \naffiliated party without the customer being able to object. And that \ncustomer has no right to get access to or to correct that information.\n  The amount of information that could be disclosed is enormous. It \nincludes, for example:\n  Savings and checking account balances;\n  Certificate of deposit maturity dates and balances;\n  Checks an individual writes;\n  Checks deposited into a customer's account;\n  Stock and mutual fund purchases and sales;\n  Life insurance payouts; and\n  Health insurance claims.\n  Today's technology makes it easier, faster, and less costly than ever \nfor institutions to have immediate access to large amounts of customer \ninformation; to analyze that data; and to send that data to others. \nBanks, securities firms, and insurance companies are increasingly \naffiliating and cross-marketing and, in the process, they are selling \nthe products of affiliates to existing customers. This can entail the \nwarehousing of large amounts of highly sensitive customer information \nand selling it to or sharing it with other companies, for purposes \nunknown to the customer. While cross-marketing can bring new and \nbeneficial products to receptive consumers, it can also result in \nunwanted invasions of personal privacy.\n  Surveys show that the public is widely concerned about privacy. Major \ncorporations have bumped up against privacy concerns when expanding \ntheir marketing services. Citizen groups have expressed serious \nconcerns about the privacy implications of financial institutions' \nsharing or selling the information they collect without the knowledge \nof the party involved.\n  Along with medical records, financial records rank among the kinds of \npersonal data Americans most expect will be kept from prying eyes. As \nwith medical data, though, the privacy of even highly sensitive \nfinancial data has been increasingly put at risk by mergers, electronic \ndata-swapping and the move to an economy in which the selling of other \npeople's personal information is highly profitable--and legal.\n  On January 19, 1999, I introduced the Financial Information Privacy \nAct of 1999 (S. 187) to provide consumers with important privacy \nprotections for their financial information. Some of these protections \nare reflected in this bill, including a right for consumers to object, \nor opt out, of their financial institutions sharing with affiliates \ncustomer information, such as account transactions, balances and \nmaturity dates as well as rights for the consumer to have access to and \nto correct mistakes in information that would be shared.\n  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, enacted last November, contained some \nlimited federal financial privacy protections for consumers. While an \nimportant beginning, these protections failed to meet the expectations \nof Americans and did not contain the important protections that I have \njust referred to.\n  When the President signed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, he observed \nthat the privacy protections contained in the new legislation were \ninadequate. In his State of the Union Address this year, the President \nreiterated the need for stronger privacy legislation. Last Sunday, the \nPresident announced a proposal for improved financial privacy \nprotections. He said, ``We can't let breakthroughs in technology break \ndown walls of privacy.'' I agree and applaud the Clinton-Gore \nAdministration's proposal as an important step forward.\n  The Financial Privacy Protection Act reflects the Administration's \nproposal and contains important financial privacy protections.\n  The Act would provide an ``opt out'' for affiliate sharing, allowing \ncustomers to object to a financial institution's sharing customer \nfinancial data with any affiliated firms.\n  It also would provide an ``opt in'' for sharing some types of \n``sensitive information.'' A financial institution would need to have a \nconsumer's affirmative consent before releasing his or her medical \ninformation or personal spending habits, reflected on checks written \nand credit card charges, to either an affiliate or an unaffiliated \nthird party.\n  The Act also provides consumers with rights of access and correction. \nA consumer would be able to see the information to be released and \ncorrect material errors.\n  The Act also requires financial institutions to make privacy notices \navailable to consumers who request them and makes other important \nimprovements to the law.\n  As we proceed in an age of technological advances and cross-industry \nmarketing of financial services, we need to be mindful of the privacy \nconcerns of the American public. I ask myself the question, ``Whose \ninformation is this, the individual's or the institution's?'' I believe \nit is the individual's.\n  Consumers who wish to keep their sensitive financial and medical \ninformation private should be given a right to do so. The passage of \nthe Financial Information Privacy Act would be a step toward that goal.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, after numerous unsuccessful attempts, last \nyear, Congress enacted legislation to modernize our nation's financial \nservices laws. This important legislation will help to provide \nconsumers greater choices for financial products and services and will \nalso ensure that U.S. financial services companies are better equipped \nto handle the challenges of competing in a global marketplace.\n  As part of the financial services modernization legislation, limited \nprovisions were included to help protect consumers' personal financial \nprivacy. While these provisions were constructive, I believe that \nCongress must continue to press for the strongest possible privacy \nprotections for financial services consumers.\n  I rise today in support of legislation, the Financial Information \nPrivacy Protection Act of 2000, which affords additional privacy \nprotections for financial services consumers.\n  Although it does not fully address my concerns with respect to the \nprotection of financial and medical information, this legislation is a \nmodest, but important step, in ensuring what I believe to be \nfundamental for all financial consumers, whether they execute their \ntransactions in person, by mail or phone, or online. Consumers should \nhave the ultimate control over the sharing of their personal financial \ninformation.\n  This legislation provides that among affiliates of financial \ninstitutions as well as to unaffiliated third parties, consumers would \nbe afforded the opportunity to ``op-out'' of the sharing of their \npersonal financial information.\n  Additionally, this legislation gives enhanced protection to \nconsumers' medical records. Under this legislation, financial \ninstitutions would be required to obtain an affirmative consent from a \nconsumer before the consumer's medical information could be shared \namong affiliates. Although I believe this is an important component in \nsafeguarding the privacy of medical information, I continue to believe \nthat it is critical we pass comprehensive medical privacy legislation \nthis year so that consumers can be assured that their medical \ninformation is protected regardless of the context in which it \ngenerated or used.\n  As we continue to wrestle with finding the proper balance between the \nproviding new financial products and services while at the same time \nproviding consumers with the strongest possible protections for their \npersonal financial and medical information, This legislation is a \npositive step in the right direction.\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS (for himself, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 2514.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to guarantee \ncomprehensive health care coverage for all children born after 2001; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 MEDIKIDS HEALTH INSURANCE ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to \nintroduce the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2000. Congressman Stark \nis introducing a companion bill in the House.\n  This legislation is, without a doubt, ambitious. It is a deliberate \neffort to try to ignite a national commitment to the goal of insuring \nall of our children. For some, that is an idealistic proposition that \ndoes not seem achievable. With this bill, I want to call on the public \nand my colleagues to consider once again the clear and convincing case \nfor investing the necessary resources in the health of our children--\nand therefore, in the well-being of their families and our entire \ncountry. I will continue to work hard on every possible step to achieve \nthis ultimate goal, but with this legislation, I urge lawmakers, health \ncare professionals, and citizens to recognize the imperative of \nreaching that goal sooner rather than later.\n  Our children are not only our future, they are also our present. What \nwe do for them today will greatly affect what happens tomorrow. Yet \neven though we recognize these facts, we still have not found a way to \nguarantee health coverage for children. Without health insurance, many \nof these children go without health care all together.\n  Children are the least expensive segment of our population to insure. \nThey are also the least able to have control over whether or not they \nhave health insurance. Yet we now have over 11 million uninsured \nchildren in this country. And this number is steadily climbing higher \nand higher every year.\n  Our success in expanding Medicaid and passing the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program was a meaningful, significant start at closing \nthe tragic gap represented by millions of uninsured children. However, \nCongress\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\ncannot point to these programs and declare that our work is done. We \nstill have much more to do. The percent of children in low-income \nfamilies without health insurance has not changed in recent years. Even \nwith perfect enrollment in S-CHIP and Medicaid, there would still be a \ngreat number of children without health insurance.\n  This is partially due to our increasingly mobile society, where \nparents frequently change jobs and families often move from state to \nstate. When this occurs there is often a lapse in health coverage. \nAlso, families working their way out of welfare fluctuate between \neligibility and ineligibility for means-tested assistance programs. \nAnother reason for the number of uninsured children is that the cost of \nhealth insurance continues to increase, leaving many working parents \nunable to afford coverage for themselves or their families. All of this \nadds up to the fact that many of our children do not have the \nconsistent and regular access to health care which they need to grow up \nhealthy.\n  That is why I am introducing the MediKids Health Insurance Act of \n2000. This bill would automatically enroll every child at birth into a \nnew, comprehensive federal safety net health insurance program \nbeginning in 2002. The benefits would be tailored to the needs of \nchildren and would be similar to those currently available to children \nunder Medicaid. A small monthly premium would be collected from parents \nat tax filing, with discounts to low-income families phasing out at \n300% of poverty. The children would remain enrolled in MediKids \nthroughout childhood. When they are covered by another health insurance \nprogram, their parents would be exempt from the premium. The key to our \nprogram is that whenever other sources of health insurance fail, \nMediKids would stand ready to cover the health needs of our next \ngeneration. By the year 2020, every child in America would be able to \ngrow up with consistent, continuous health insurance coverage. Like \nMedicare, MediKids would be independently financed, would cover \nbenefits tailored to the needs of its target population, and would have \nthe goal of achieving nearly 100% health insurance coverage for the \nchildren of this country--just as Medicare has done for our nation's \nseniors and disabled population. It's time we make this investment in \nthe future of America by guaranteeing all children the health coverage \nthey need to make a healthy start in life. The MediKids Health \nInsurance Act would offer guaranteed, automatic health coverage for \nevery child with the simplest of enrollment procedures and no \nchallenging outreach, paperwork, or re-determination hoops to jump \nthrough. It would be able to follow children across state lines, or \ntide them over in a new location until their parents can enroll them in \na new insurance program. Between jobs or during family crises such as \ndivorce or the death of a parent, it would offer extra security and \nensure continuous health coverage to the nation's children. During that \ncritical period when a family is just climbing out of poverty and out \nof the eligibility range for means-tested assistance programs, it would \nprovide an extra boost with health insurance for the children until the \nparents can move into jobs that provide reliable health insurance \ncoverage. And every child would automatically be enrolled upon birth, \nalong with the issuance of the birth certificate or immigration card.\n\n  As we all know, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. \nProviding health care coverage to children affects much more than their \nhealth--it affects their ability to learn, their ability to thrive, and \ntheir ability to become a productive member of society. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues and supporting organizations for the \npassage of the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2000 to guarantee every \nchild in America the health coverage they need to grow up healthy.\n  Mr. President, I stand before you today to deliver a message. That is \nthat it is time to rekindle the discussion about how we are going to \nprovide health insurance for all Americans. The bill I am introducing \ntoday--the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2000--is a step toward \neliminating the irrational and tragic lack of health insurance for so \nmany children and adults in our country.\n  Partial solutions to America's ``uninsured crisis'' lie before \nCongress, and I recognize the sense of realism and care that are the \nbasis for proposing incremental steps towards universal coverage. As \nsomeone involved in the tough battles in years past to achieve \nuniversal coverage, I will continue to do all I can to make whatever \nprogress can be made each and every year.\n  But I also believe it is important to not lose sight of the ideal--\nand our capacity to reach that ideal--of the United States of America \njoining every other industrialized nation by ensuring that its citizens \nhave basic health insurance. Until we succeed, millions of children and \nadults will suffer human and financial costs that are preventable.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I offer this legislation to both enlist my \ncolleagues in an effort to insist that all of our nation's children are \ninsured as quickly as possible and to lay out the steps that would \nachieve that goal. At a time when Congress seems stalled by politics \nand paralysis, and is therefore failing to make any tangible progress \nin dealing with rising number of uninsured Americans, I hope this bill \nwill help to build the will and momentum so desperately needed by our \nchildren for action that will change their lives and strengthen our \nvery nation. I ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join \nas co-sponsors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2515\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Report on long-term revenues.\n       (c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) More than 11 million American children are uninsured.\n       (2) Children who are uninsured receive less medical care \n     and less preventive care and have a poorer level of health, \n     which result in lifetime costs to themselves and to the \n     entire American economy.\n       (3) Although SCHIP and Medicaid are successfully extending \n     a health coverage safety net to a growing portion of the \n     vulnerable low-income population of uninsured children, we \n     now see that they alone cannot achieve 100 percent health \n     insurance coverage for our nation's children due to \n     inevitable gaps during outreach and enrollment, fluctuations \n     in eligibility, and variations in access to private insurance \n     at all income levels.\n       (4) As all segments of our society continue to become more \n     and more transient, with many changes in employment over the \n     working lifetime of parents, the need for a reliable safety \n     net of health insurance which follows children across State \n     lines, already a major problem for the children of migrant \n     and seasonal farmworkers, will become a major concern for all \n     families in the United States.\n       (5) The Medicare program has successfully evolved over the \n     years to provide a stable, universal source of health \n     insurance for the nation's disabled and those over age 65, \n     and therefore provides a tested model for designing a program \n     to reach out to America's children\n       (6) The problem of insuring 100 percent of all American \n     children could be gradually solved by automatically enrolling \n     all children born after December 31, 2001, in a program \n     modeled after Medicare (and to be known as ``MediKids''), and \n     allowing those children to be transferred into other \n     equivalent or better insurance programs, including either \n     private insurance, SCHIP, or Medicaid, if they are eligible \n     to do so, but maintaining the child's default enrollment in \n     MediKids for any times when the child's access to other \n     sources of insurance is lost.\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\n       (7) A family's freedom of choice to use other insurers to \n     cover children would not be interfered with in any way, and \n     children eligible for SCHIP and Medicaid would continue to be \n     enrolled in those programs, but the underlying safety net of \n     MediKids would always be available to cover any gaps in \n     insurance due to changes in medical condition, employment, \n     income, or marital status, or other changes affecting a \n     child's access to alternate forms of insurance.\n       (8) The MediKids program can be administered without \n     impacting the finances or status of the existing Medicare \n     program.\n       (9) The MediKids benefit package can be tailored to the \n     special needs of children and updated over time.\n       (10) The financing of the program can be administered \n     without difficulty by a yearly payment of affordable premiums \n     through a family's tax filing (or adjustment of a family's \n     earned income tax credit).\n       (11) The cost of the program will gradually rise as the \n     number of children using MediKids as the insurer of last \n     resort increases, and a future Congress always can accelerate \n     or slow down the enrollment process as desired, while the \n     societal costs for emergency room usage, lost productivity \n     and work days, and poor health status for the next generation \n     of Americans will decline.\n       (12) Over time 100 percent of American children will always \n     have basic health insurance, and we can therefore expect a \n     healthier, more equitable, and more productive society.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The MediKids program will be separate from \n     Medicare and will have no financial impact on the existing \n     program.\n       The cornerstone of the new program will be automatic \n     enrollment into MediKids at birth. Beginning in 2002, every \n     child will be automatically enrolled in MediKids health \n     insurance coverage at birth, and their parents will be \n     assessed a small annual premium with their taxes. Parents who \n     have another source of health insurance for their children \n     are exempt from this premium. Babies initially enrolled in \n     MediKids who are determined to be eligible for S-CHIP or \n     Medicaid can be enrolled into the appropriate other program.\n       As each year brings a new cohort of babies into the \n     program, the program will grow to ensure a source of health \n     insurance to every child in America by the year 2020. (Future \n     Congresses will be able to speed up the extension of coverage \n     to children of all ages if they find it desirable to \n     accelerate the process of the program.) There will be no \n     means testing, no outreach problems, and the program will \n     exist as a safety net of health insurance for children, \n     regardless of income.

Mr. President, today marks the 10th anniversary of \nthe declaration of independence of Latvia from the domination of the \nSoviet Union. Latvia's resolution on May 4th, 1990 followed closely \nafter Lithuania's declaration in March. These courageous Baltic \ncountries led the way to throw off the yoke of Soviet Communist \nimperialism, resulting in the disintegration of the Soviet Union.\n  The courage of the peaceful crowd that surrounded the parliament \nbuilding in Riga to prevent a Soviet attack should be remembered and \ncommended. The Latvians showed the power of peaceful resistance and \nrisked their lives doing so.\n  Latvia has now become a vibrant democracy. It has established a free-\nmarket economy and the rule of law. Latvia wants to be fully integrated \ninto Europe, and is seeking membership in the European Union and the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n  This year we also celebrate the 60th anniversary of the refusal of \nthe United States to recognize Soviet domination of the Baltic states. \nThe logic then and the logic now is that the United States will only \nrecognize free and independent Baltic states. What we celebrate this \nyear is what we must help preserve next year and the year after that. \nWe must carry on that principle today by being sure that Latvia, \nLithuania and Estonia are admitted into NATO as an unequivocal \nstatement that we will never tolerate domination of the Baltic states \nagain.\n  I support admitting the Baltic states into NATO and I hope my \ncolleagues here in the Senate will support their entry also in the next \nround of NATO expansion.\n  That debate we will save for another day, but I am sure all my \ncolleagues can agree on the importance of the Baltic states' \ncontribution to the freedom and independence of the former Soviet \nRepublics and will join me in congratulating Latvia in celebrating 10 \nyears of that precious freedom and independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3546-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3546-S3547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 303--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n   TREATMENT BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION OF ANDREI BABITSKY, A RUSSIAN \n         JOURNALIST WORKING FOR RADIO FREE EUROPE/RADIO LIBERTY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Grams) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 303\n\n       Whereas Andrei Babitsky, an accomplished Russian journalist \n     working for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a United States \n     Government-funded broadcasting service, faces serious charges \n     in Russia after being held captive and beaten by Russian \n     authorities;\n       Whereas the mission of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's \n     bureaus in Russia is to provide Russian listeners objective \n     and uncensored reporting on developments in Russia and around \n     the world;\n       Whereas Russian authorities repeatedly denounced Mr. \n     Babitsky for his reporting on the war in Chechnya, including \n     his documentation of Russian troop casualties and the Russian \n     Federation's brutal treatment of Chechen civilians;\n       Whereas Senate Resolutions 223 and 262 of the One Hundred \n     Sixth Congress condemning the violence in Chechnya and urging \n     a peaceful resolution to the conflict were adopted by the \n     Senate by unanimous consent on November 19, 1999, and \n     February 24, 2000, respectively;\n       Whereas on January 16, Mr. Babitsky was arrested by Russian \n     police in the Chechen battle zone, was accused of assisting \n     the Chechen forces, and was told he was to stand trial in \n     Moscow;\n       Whereas Russian authorities took Mr. Babitsky to a \n     ``filtration camp'' for suspected Chechen collaborators where \n     he was severely beaten and then transferred to an undisclosed \n     location;\n       Whereas on February 3, the Government of the Russian \n     Federation announced that it had traded Mr. Babitsky to \n     Chechen units in exchange for Russian prisoners, a violation \n     of the Geneva Conventions to which Russia is a party;\n       Whereas on February 25, Mr. Babitsky was released by his \n     captors in the Republic of Dagestan, only to be jailed by \n     Russian officials for carrying false identity papers;\n       Whereas Mr. Babitsky says the papers were forced on him by \n     his captors and used to smuggle him across borders;\n       Whereas Mr. Babitsky now faces charges from the Government \n     of the Russian Federation of collaborating with the Chechens \n     and carrying false identity papers and is not allowed to \n     leave the city of Moscow;\n       Whereas on February 25, a senior advisor in Russia's \n     Foreign Ministry published an article in The Moscow Times \n     entitled ``Should Liberty Leave?'', which condemned the \n     coverage by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty of the war in \n     Chechnya, particularly reporting by Radio Free Europe/Radio \n     Liberty correspondent Andrei Babitsky, and which stated that \n     it would ``be better to close down the branches of Radio \n     Liberty on Russian territory'';\n       Whereas on March 13, the Russian Ministry of the Press \n     ordered Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Moscow Bureau to \n     provide complete recordings of broadcasts between February 15 \n     and March 15, an action that Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty \n     described as ``designed to intimidate us and others'';\n       Whereas on March 14, the Russian Ministry of the Press \n     issued a directive to prevent the broadcast of interviews \n     from Chechen resistance leaders, an act of censorship which \n     undercuts the ability of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to \n     fulfill its responsibilities as an objective news \n     organization;\n       Whereas the treatment of Mr. Babitsky intimidates other \n     correspondents working in Russia, particularly those covering \n     the tragic story unfolding in Chechnya;\n       Whereas Russia's evolution into a stable democracy requires \n     a free and vibrant press; and\n       Whereas it is imperative that the United States Government \n     respond vigorously to the harassment and intimidation of \n     Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to drop \n     its charges against Mr. Babitsky;\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\n       (2) calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     provide a full accounting of Mr. Babitsky's detention;\n       (3) condemns the Russian Federation's harassment and \n     intimidation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and other \n     news organizations;\n       (4) calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     adhere fully to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \n     which declares in Article 19 that ``everyone has the right to \n     freedom of opinion and expression;

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Grams \nand Senator Leahy in offering this Senate resolution expressing our \ndeep concern about the continuing plight of the Russian journalist \nAndrei Babitsky.\n  Mr. Babitsky, an accomplished journalist working for Radio Free \nEurope/Radio Liberty, still faces serious charges in Russia after being \nheld captive by Russian authorities, beaten, and kept in a ``filtration \ncamp'' for suspected Chechen collaborators.\n  For 10 years, Mr. Babitsky has helped fulfill the mission of RFE/RL \nto provide Russian listeners with objective and uncensored reporting. \nBut Russian authorities, displeased with Mr. Babitsky's courageous \nreporting on the war in Chechnya, accused him of assisting the Chechen \nforces and had him arrested in the battle zone last January.\n  After six weeks in captivity, Mr. Babitsky was released, and then \njailed again by Russian officials for carrying false identity papers. \nHe says the papers were forced upon him. After an international outcry \narose over his case, he was again released. But he still is not allowed \nto leave Moscow, and he still faces charges for carrying false papers \nand aiding the Chechens.\n  In addition, Russian authorities have continued to condemn Radio \nLiberty's coverage of the Chechen conflict, and have suggested that \nRadio Liberty should be forced to abandon its facilities in Moscow and \nthroughout the Russian Republic. The authorities have taken steps to \ncensor Radio Liberty and to intimidate its correspondents and others.\n  The United States should respond vigorously to this harassment and \nintimidation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The Russian government \nshould drop its trumped-up charges against Mr. Babitsky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3547-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3547-S3552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                ABRAHAM (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3117\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. \nFitzgerald) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 2) to extend programs \nand activities under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965; as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 203, line 8, strike all through the \n     period on page 213, line 15 and insert the following:\n       ``(11)(A) Reforming teacher tenure systems.\n       ``(B) Establishing teacher compensation systems based on \n     merit and proven performance.\n       ``(C) Testing teachers periodically in the academic \n     subjects in which the teachers teach.\n       ``(b) Coordination.--A State that receives a grant to carry \n     out this subpart and a grant under section 202 of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 shall coordinate the activities carried \n     out under this section and the activities carried out under \n     that section 202.\n\n     ``SEC. 2014.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk \nabout the proposed remedies submitted last Friday by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice and 17 States in the antitrust suit against \nMicrosoft. As my colleagues know, the Department of Justice and the \nStates have asked the court to break Microsoft into two separate \ncompanies, and to require significant Government regulation of the two \ncompanies.\n  Let's begin by reviewing the charges in the case. First, the \nGovernment has alleged that Microsoft entered into a series of \nagreements with software developers, Internet Service Providers, \nInternet content providers, and online services like AOL, that \nforeclosed Netscape's ability to distribute its Web browsing software. \nDespite claims by Government lawyers and outside commentators that this \nwas the strongest part of the Government's case, the trial court--even \nJudge Jackson--disagreed. The court ruled that Microsoft's agreements \ndid not deprive Netscape of the ability to reach PC users. Indeed, the \ntrial court pointed out the many ways in which Netscape could, and did, \ndistribute Navigator. Direct evidence of this broad distribution can be \nfound in the fact that the installed base of Navigator users increased \nfrom 15 million in 1996 to 33 million in late 1998--the very period in \nwhich the Government contends that Microsoft foreclosed Netscape's \ndistribution.\n  The second charge involves what the Government alleged was the \nunlawful ``tying'' of Internet Explorer to Windows. The Government \nargued that this ``tying'' was one of the primary means by which \nMicrosoft foreclosed Netscape's ability to distribute Navigator. The \ntrial court agreed with the Government, finding that Microsoft violated \nSection 1 of the Sherman Act in its design of Windows 95 and 98. The \ncourt's conclusion is astounding in two respects. First, as I \nmentioned, the trial court determined that Microsoft had not deprived \nNetscape of distribution opportunities. Second, and even more \nimportant, the trial court's conclusion is in direct contradiction to \nthat of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. In June, \n1998--before the antitrust trial even began--that court of appeals \nrejected the charge that the inclusion of Internet Explorer in Windows \n95 was wrongful. In its June, 1998 decision, the appeals court stated \nthat ``new products integrating functionalities in a useful way should \nbe considered single products regardless of market structure.'' Despite \nthe fact that trial courts are obliged to follow the rulings of \nappellate courts, the trial court in the Microsoft case has singularly \nfailed to do so.\n  In its third charge, the Government alleged that Microsoft held a \nmonopoly in Intel-compatible PC operating systems, and maintained that \nmonopoly through anticompetitive tactics. The trial court agreed, and \ndetermined that there were three anticompetitive tools employed by \nMicrosoft: (1) the series of agreements that the trial court itself \nheld did not violate antitrust law; (2) the inclusion of Internet \nExplorer in Windows, which the Appellate Court already determined was \nnot illegal; and (3) a random assortment of acts involving Microsoft's \ndiscussions with other firms, such as Apple and Intel--none of which \nled to agreements. In relying on these three factors, the trial court \nseems to have concluded that, while Microsoft's actions, taken \nindividually, might not constitute violations of antitrust law, the \ncombination of these lawful acts constitutes a violation of law. This \napproach to antitrust liability has generally been rejected by courts, \nin part because it fails to provide guidance allowing businesses to\n\n[[Page S3554]]\n\nunderstand their legal obligations. Such a rule effectively chills \ndesirable competitive conduct.\n  Finally, the trial court agreed with the Government's allegation that \nMicrosoft unlawfully attempted to monopolize the market for Web \nbrowsing software. This conclusion is directly at odds with the court's \nown previous finding. In the findings of fact released in November of \nlast year, the trial court found that Microsoft's conduct with respect \nto Netscape was aimed at preventing Netscape from dominating Web \nbrowsing software--not at gaining a monopoly for Microsoft. Under \nantitrust law, a firm cannot be found liable for attempted \nmonopolization unless it specifically intends to monopolize the market. \nSeeking to prevent somebody else from acquiring a monopoly is not \nattempted monopolization.\n  To summarize, one of the Government's charges was dismissed by the \ntrial court; another flouts a specific decision of the appellate court; \nand the remaining two simply provide no legal basis as antitrust \nviolations. I am highly confident that the appeals court will once \nagain recognize the fundamental flaws in the trial court's decision and \nfind in favor of Microsoft.\n  In the meantime, however, let's examine the ``remedy'' proposed by \nthe Department of Justice and 17 States for these fictional violations. \nFirst, and most obvious, is the Government's proposal to break \nMicrosoft into two separate companies. Under the Government plan, \nWindows would be retained by the new ``Operating Systems Business,'' \nwhile the remainder of Microsoft, including its office family of \nproducts on its Internet properties, would be moved into a new \n``Application Business.'' The Department of Justice plan effectively \nprohibits these two companies from working together for a period of 10 \nyears and effectively freezes fundamental components of the operating \nsystem from improvement, thereby crippling in this fast-moving world of \ntechnology the very technology which is one of the principal bases of \nour present prosperity.\n  As outrageous as the proposal to break up Microsoft is, the \nheavyhanded regulations the Government proposes to impose on Microsoft \nare at least as outrageous.\n  Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent that an article \nby Declan McCullagh, published in the April 29, 2000, edition of Wired \nNews be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Government Wants Control of MS\n\n                         (By Declan McCullagh)\n\n       Bellevue, WA--If Bill Gates was unhappy with early reports \n     of the government's antitrust punishments, he's going to be \n     plenty steamed when he reads the fine print this weekend.\n       In two lengthy filings on Friday, government attorneys said \n     they eventually hope to carve up Microsoft into two huge \n     chunks. But until that happens, their 40KB proposal would \n     impose extraordinarily strict government regulations on what \n     the world's largest software company may and may not do.\n       For instance: Microsoft wouldn't be able to sell computer \n     makers discounted copies of Windows, except for foreign \n     language translations, but would be ordered to open a \n     ``secure'' lab where other firms may examine the previously \n     internal Windows specifications. Microsoft wouldn't be able \n     to give discounts to hardware or software developers in \n     exchange for promoting or distributing other company \n     products. For instance, Microsoft would be banned from inking \n     a discount deal with CompUSA to bundle a copy of Microsoft \n     Flight Simulator with a Microsoft joystick.\n       Microsoft would have to create a new executive position and \n     a new committee on its board of directors. The ``chief \n     compliance officer'' would report to the chief executive \n     officer and oversee a staff devoted to ensuring compliance \n     with the new government rules. If Microsoft hoped to start \n     discarding old emails after its bad experiences during the \n     trial, it wouldn't be able to do so. ``Microsoft shall, with \n     the supervision of the chief compliance officer, maintain for \n     a period of at least four years the email of all Microsoft \n     officers, directors and managers engaged in software \n     development, marketing, sales, and developer relations \n     related to platform software,'' the government's proposed \n     regulations say.\n       Microsoft would have to monitor all changes it makes to all \n     versions of Windows and track any alternations that would \n     slow down or ``degrade the performance of'' any third-party \n     application such as Internet browsers, email client software, \n     multimedia viewing software, instant messaging software, and \n     voice recognition software. If it does not notify the third-\n     party developer, criminal sanctions would apply.\n       State and federal government lawyers could come onto \n     Microsoft's campus here ``during office hours'' to ``inspect \n     and copy'' any relevant document, email message, collection \n     of source code or other related information.\n       The same state and federal government lawyers would be \n     allowed to question any Microsoft employee ``without \n     restraint or interference.''\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Mr. McCullagh did an excellent job of \noutlining these extraordinary regulations. I will highlight a few.\n  Under the Department of Justice proposal, the Government would \nrequire Microsoft to create an entirely new executive position, as well \nas a new committee on its corporate board of directors, the function of \nwhich would be to ensure the company's compliance with the Government's \nnew regulations.\n  The Department of Justice would require Microsoft to ``maintain for a \nperiod of at least 4 years the e-mail of all Microsoft officers, \ndirectors, and managers engaged in software development, marketing, \nsales, and developer relations related to Platform Software.''\n  Under the proposed remedy, Microsoft would also be required to give \nthe Government ``access during office hours'' to inspect and demand \ncopies of all ``books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda, \nsource code, and other records and documents in the possession or under \nthe control of Microsoft'' relating to the matters contained in the \nfinal judgment. Not only that, the Government, ``without restraint or \ninterference'' from Microsoft, could demand to question any officers, \nemployees, or agents of the company.\n  Together with the other sanctions, these proposals would guarantee \nthat every Microsoft competitor would know everything the two \nMicrosofts plan long before the plans became reality. Mr. President, \nthat is a death sentence.\n  The function of relief in an antitrust case is to enjoin the conduct \nfound to be anticompetitive and to enhance competition. Any objective \nreview of the ``remedies'' proposed by the Department of Justice and \nStates, however, can only lead to the conclusion that the Government is \nnot seeking relief from anticompetitive behavior but to punish \nMicrosoft with unwarranted sanctions for allegations by threatening its \nvery existence.\n  There is no question that the Department of Justice initiated this \nantitrust action at the behest of Microsoft's competitors. Those \ncompetitors have said they sought Government intervention because it \nwould be ``too expensive'' to pursue private litigation. This \nunjustified case has been too expensive--way too expensive--but not in \nthe way the competitors envisioned. In the 10 days following the \nbreakdown of settlement talks, there was a $1.7 trillion loss in market \ncapitalization. The damages from that huge loss were not limited to \nMicrosoft--a broad range of companies, including many of Microsoft's \ncompetitors, were affected. More importantly, so, too, were millions of \nAmerican investors.\n  As one would expect, the millions of Americans who hold Microsoft \nshares have taken a bath in recent weeks. The day after the trial court \nissued its ``Findings of Law'' on April 3, Microsoft stockholders lost \n$80 billion in assets. The decline in Microsoft stock helped fuel a \n349-point slide in the NASDAQ, the biggest 1-day drop in the history of \nthe exchange. The pain wasn't limited to individual Microsoft \nshareholders, however. At least 2,000 mutual funds and countless \npension funds include Microsoft shares.\n  I find it curious that the Vice President of the United States \ncriticizes as the ``risky scheme'' tax proposals in this body that \nwould reduce taxes by $12 billion in 1 year and $150 billion in 5 \nyears. Yet the very administration that he supports has caused a loss \nin the pockets of very real American citizens of far in excess of that \namount.\n  The ``risky scheme'' is the Microsoft lawsuit and we have now \nsuffered damages from that risk. It is unfortunate that those who were \nso anxious to bring the heavy hand of Government into this incredibly \ninnovative and successful industry didn't listen to some of the more \ncautious voices, such as that of Dr. Milton Friedman, who warned early \non to be careful what you wish. Dr. Friedman recently reinforced that \nsentiment in a statement to the National Taxpayers Union:\n\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\n\n       Recent events dealing with the Microsoft suit certainly \n     support the view I expressed a year ago--that Silicon Valley \n     is suicidal in calling Government in to mediate in the \n     disputes among some of the big companies in the area of \n     Microsoft. The money that has been spent on legal maneuvers \n     would have been much more usefully spent on research in \n     technology. The loss of the time spent in the courts by \n     highly trained and skilled lawyers could certainly have \n     been spent more fruitfully. Overall, the major effect has \n     been a decline in the capital value of the computer \n     industry, Microsoft in particular, but its competitors as \n     well. They must rue the day they set this incredible \n     episode in operation.\n\n  One of the biggest tragedies of this case is that it has all been \ndone in the name of consumer benefit. So far, the only real harm to \nconsumers I have seen has come from the resources wasted on the case \nitself and from the market convulsions that resulted from the mere \nspecter of the Government's punitive relief proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3555-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3555-S3557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 504, S. 2370.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2370) to designate the Federal building located \n     at 500 Pearl Street in New York City, New York, as the \n     ``Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I was very proud to report out \njust a couple weeks ago a bill to designate the federal building at 500 \nPearl Street in New York City, New York, as the ``Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan United States Courthouse.'' When I first joined this \ncommittee, the chairman's seat was occupied by the Senator from New \nYork. His generosity and kindness in helping me, a freshman Senator \nfrom the other side of the aisle, is something I will always remember \nand for which I will be forever grateful. I have since come to rely on \nhis advice, counsel and wisdom on issues ranging from transportation to \nSuperfund, as have so many of my colleagues.\n  Our friend, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, is someone who has \nserved this nation with great integrity and true patriotism. He is the \nonly person in our nation's history to serve in four successive \nadministrations as a member of the Cabinet or sub-Cabinet. He served \ntwo Republicans and two Democrats--but he would rather tell you that he \nsimply served four Presidents of the United States. He was Ambassador \nto India, as well as the President of the United Nations Security \nCouncil. And since 1977, he has been the cerebral center of the United \nStates Senate.\n  He is among the most intelligent Senators ever to serve in this body. \nHe has taught at MIT, Harvard, Syracuse, and Cornell, and has been the \nrecipient of over 60 honorary degrees. Few can match his resume and \nnone can surpass his commitment to this nation. He will be sorely \nmissed.\n  The building to be named for Daniel Patrick Moynihan is a magnificent \nstructure in New York City that will be a fitting tribute to the \ndistinguished Senator. Completed in 1994 and built to last 200 years, \nthe courthouse is an extraordinary work of art inside and out. It will \nserve as an enduring monument to our good friend Senator Moynihan and \nhis 47-year career in public service.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my support for the \nnaming of the Pearl Street courthouse in New York City as humble \ntribute to our colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from New \nYork, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who regrettably announced his retirement \nfrom this body at the conclusion of the 106th Congress.\n  It is only fitting that any recognition of the senior Senator from \nNew York's achievements should first underscore his limitless passion \nin reflecting the highest ideals befitting the dignity, enterprise, \nvigor and stability of the American government. His singular vision of \nthe role of a United States Senator and his deep desire to live up to \nthat lofty image is only part of what makes my friend and colleague the \nparagon of public service which he has been for this body, his \nconstituents and the American people for nearly a quarter century.\n  Since his election to the United States Senate in 1976, Senator \nMoynihan has imprinted an indelible impression upon our Nation's \nCapital in so many estimable ways. His virtues extend far beyond my \ncapabilities of statesmanship but, given that the pending matter is the \nnaming of a federal building in his honor, I will limit myself to \nsimply discussing his unique role in shepherding the physical \ntransformation of the federal landscape in Washington, D.C.\n  During his tenure in Congress, Senator Moynihan has made a consistent \ncommitment to build government buildings well and help achieve the \npotential L'Enfant envisioned here 200 years ago.\n  There's a fitting symmetry to Senator Moynihan's career in \nWashington. He started out nearly four decades ago in the Kennedy \nAdministration, and his service at the White House end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue continued in the Johnson and Nixon years. Since 1977, he's \nserved on this end in the U.S. Capitol as the Senator from New York.\n  It fell to him, as one of Kennedy's cadre of New Frontiersman, to \nwrite a prescription for then-failing Pennsylvania Avenue, whose \nshabbiness had caught the President's eye during the inaugural parade. \nTrue to his scholar's training, Senator Moynihan went back to basics to \nprepare an eloquent appreciation of L'Enfant's conception of \nPennsylvania Avenue, ``the grand axis of the city, as of the Nation . . \n. leading from the Capitol to the White House, symbolizing at once the \nseparation of powers and the fundamental unity in the American \ngovernment.''\n  Little wonder, then, that Senator Moynihan today can look back with \nsatisfaction at what has happened to the avenue. He was there at the \nbeginning.\n  When news came that President Kennedy had been shot, Senator Moynihan \nwas having lunch with fellow White House aides to arrange a briefing \nfor congressional leaders concerning the new plan for Pennsylvania \nAvenue.\n  Senator Moynihan started out, as he once wrote, ``at a time of the \nnear-disappearance of the impulse to art'' in public building, \nwitnessing a ``steady deteriorating in the quality of public buildings \nand public spaces, and with it a decline in the symbols of public unity \nand common purpose with which the citizen can identify, of which he can \nbe proud, and by which he can know what he shares with his fellow \ncitizens.'' He called the new Rayburn House Office Building ``perhaps \nthe most alarming and unavoidable sign of the declining vitality of \nAmerican government that we have yet witnessed.''\n  In his 1962 report which he drafted for President Kennedy, ``Guiding \nPrinciples for Federal Architecture,'' Senator Moynihan outlined three \nbroad principles which still affect federal architecture today: (1) An \nofficial style must be avoided; (2) Government projects should embody \nthe finest contemporary American architectural thought; and (3) Federal \nbuildings should reflect the regional architectural traditions of their \nspecific locations.\n  Senator Moynihan's deep rooted passion for public architecture has \nabated not an iota in the years since he wrote that document. In an \ninterview he gave as a freshman Senator newly assigned to the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, he was quoted as saying, ``I \nlike buildings, I like things,'' he explained simply, ``and the \ngovernment builds things.'' Later as chairman, he used his vantage \npoint to become one of the capital's most persuasive, powerful voices \nfor rationality and beauty in the things our government builds.\n  Recently, he was asked about the capital's esthetic transformation, \nto which he asked a rhetorical question: ``Do we realize we look up and \nwe have the most beautiful capital on earth?''\n  I thank Senator Moynihan. I have been privileged to serve with you to \nhelp transform Pennsylvania Avenue into the great thoroughfare of the \ncity of Washington, DC.\n  His 1962 vision is Y2K's reality. I sincerely hope that the \ncourthouse we name in his honor reflects the legacy of federal \narchitecture he leaves and the great vision of this Nation he always \nespoused.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of S. 2370. S. \n2370 names\n\n[[Page S3556]]\n\nthe new Foley Square Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street, New York City, \nafter Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. But even more, I wish to pay \ntribute to a colleague, a mentor, and a friend.\n  When Senator Moynihan retires from the Senate at the end of this \nyear, he will be deeply and perhaps uniquely missed because he has \ncontributed so much to our debates and, in fact, to our lives. There \nwill be plenty of time for extended tributes later.\n  Each Senator will stand up and explain in his own words the work and \nwonder of Senator Moynihan, particularly as the session draws to a \nclose, and I hope to participate in those tributes at that time.\n  The bill we are considering today is also a fitting tribute for two \nreasons: First, one of the many special contributions that Pat Moynihan \nhas made to our Nation is the contribution to our public architecture.\n  Thomas Jefferson said:\n\n       Design activity and political thought are indivisible.\n\n  In keeping with this, Pat Moynihan has sought to improve our public \nplaces so they reflect and uplift our civic culture.\n  Senator Moynihan, himself, said it well back in 1961. We all know he \nhas held many important positions in Government, in fact, so many I \ndon't think any of us can remember them all. But only recently did I \nlearn that he once was the staff director of something called the Ad \nHoc Committee on Federal Office Space.\n  That is right. He was. In addition to everything else, he once wrote \na document called the ``Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture'' \nback in 1961. And that remains in effect today. It is one page long. It \nsays that public buildings should not only be efficient and economical \nbut also should ``provide visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, \nvigor, and stability of the American Government.''\n  For many years, he has worked with energy and vision to put the goals \nexpressed in the guidelines into practice.\n  As an assistant to President Kennedy, he was one of the driving \nforces behind the effort to renovate Pennsylvania Avenue, to finally \nachieve Pierre L'Enfant's vision.\n  He followed through. There is the Navy Memorial, Pershing Park, the \nRonald Reagan Building, and Ariel Rios. And there are other projects. \nAlong with John Chafee, he had the vision to restore Union Station--a \nmagnificent building--and then to complement it with the beautiful \nThurgood Marshall Judiciary Building.\n  It is absolutely remarkable, leaving a lasting mark on our public \nplaces that bring us together as American citizens.\n  In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that Daniel Patrick Moynihan \nhas had a greater positive impact on American public architecture than \nany statesman since Thomas Jefferson.\n  That brings me to my second point. The new courthouse in Foley Square \nbears Pat Moynihan's mark. It is the Nation's largest courthouse, for \nthe Nation's oldest Federal court.\n\n  Senator Moynihan was the principal sponsor of the bill authorizing \nits construction back in 1987. And characteristically, he followed \nthrough, paying close attention to details.\n  At times, the courthouse has been controversial. But no one can deny \nits grandeur. It preserves history, uses space to great effect, and it \nfeatures a graceful sculpture in the form of a fountain designed by \nMaya Lin, who also designed the Vietnam War Memorial.\n  The building itself is designed by a very distinguished American \nfirm, Kohn Pederson Fox, and it was designed, as Senator Moynihan \nhimself has said, ``with dignity and presence.''\n  I am sure Senator Moynihan will correct me later if I am wrong, but I \nbelieve in St. Paul's Cathedral in London there is an inscription \nmemorializing the architect of the cathedral, Sir Christopher Wren. It \nreads:\n\n       If you would see his memorial, look about you.\n\n  If, years from now, you stand outside the Capitol and look west, down \nPennsylvania Avenue, or you stand on the steps of the Jacob Javits \nFederal Building in New York City and look east at the courthouse that \nwill bear his name, you can say the same about Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan:\n\n       If you would see his memorial, look about you.\n\n  Mr. President, this bill is a fitting tribute to a distinguished \nscholar, an outstanding Senator, and a great American. I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I rise just to say I have no words at this moment \nfor what my beloved colleague said. We have been 22 years together on \nthe Committee on the Environment and Public Works and on the Finance \nCommittee. He will succeed me soon, I hope, as chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. He has my profound and lasting gratitude for what he has \njust said. I am sure he will continue in that mode.\n  I thank my dear colleague.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud my colleagues for \ntheir unanimous support of S. 2370, a bill to name the stunning Federal \nCourthouse at 500 Pearl Street in Manhattan after Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan, the champion of this project and an esteemed Member \nof this body. I also rise to honor Senator Moynihan, who against the \nwishes of his fellow New Yorkers, myself included, plans to retire at \nthe end of this year. I honor Pat Moynihan for all he has accomplished \nthroughout his 47-year career in public service as legislator, scholar, \nreformer, teacher, and last, but definitely not least, builder.\n  It is especially for his role as builder that we honor him today. The \nFederal Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street embodies the same spirit as \nSenator Moynihan's previous architectural endeavors--an extraordinary \nwork of art, inside and out. Completed in 1994, the Courthouse was \ndesigned by the distinguished architectural firm of Kohn Pederson Fox \nwith a dignity worthy of the weighty judicial matters considered within \nits walls. It is a magnificent structure of solid granite, marble, and \nsturdy oak, built to last 200 years, adorned with public art from \nnotable contemporary artists Ray Kaskey and Maya Lin.\n  Senator Moynihan has always been an important force for architecture \nin New York. He was responsible for the restoration of the spectacular \nBeaux-Arts Custom House at Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan and beloved \nin Buffalo for reawakening that city's appreciation for its \narchitectural heritage, which includes Frank Lloyd Wright houses and \nthe Prudential Building, one of the best-known early American \nskyscrapers by the architect Louis H. Sullivan--a building which \nMoynihan helped restore and then chose as his Buffalo office. Moynihan \nhas also spurred a powerful popular movement in Buffalo to build a new \nsignature Peace Bridge over the Niagara River.\n\n  But the project for which he is best known is his beloved \nPennsylvania Station. In 1963, Pat Moynihan was one of a group of \nprescient New Yorkers who protested the tragic razing of our City's \nspectacular Penn Station--a glorious public building designed by the \nnation's premier architectural firm of the time, McKim, Mead & White.\n  It was Pat Moynihan who recognized years ago that across the street \nfrom what is now a dingy basement terminal that functions--barely--as \nNew York City's train station, sits the James A. Farley Post Office \nBuilding, built by the same architects, in much the same grand design, \nas the old Penn Station. Moynihan recognized that we could use the \nFarley Building to once again create a train station worthy of our \ngreat City. I had offered a bill last year to name that new train \nstation after him, but Senator Moynihan, with characteristic modesty, \nasked that the station keep the Farley name. And I, with characteristic \npersistence, introduced another bill to name the new Federal Courthouse \nat 500 Pearl Street after him.\n  Not coincidentally, the Courthouse's presence and elegance befit \nSenator Moynihan, who was most responsible for its creation. Senator \nMoynihan toiled for nearly a decade prodding the Congress, General \nServices Administration, three New York City mayors, and anyone else he \nneeded, to see this spectacular Courthouse built. The Courthouse at 500 \nPearl Street will serve as a fitting tribute and provide an enduring \nmonument in the heart of the City that Pat Moynihan and I both love so \ndearly, a monument for the millions of New Yorkers and their fellow \nAmericans who love and admire Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n\n[[Page S3557]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 109 introduced earlier today by \nSenators Schumer, Brownback, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 109) expressing the \n     sense of Congress regarding the ongoing persecution of 13 \n     members of Iran's Jewish community.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to denounce--in the \nstrongest terms possible--the sham trial of 13 Jews in Iran accused of \nespionage. And I want to thank my colleagues for voting unanimously for \na Concurrent Resolution urging President Clinton to condemn this \nmockery of justice and violation of fundamental human rights, and make \nclear to Iran that the United States and the world is watching the fate \nof these men very closely.\n  Leaders in Tehran must know that the treatment of the Jews on trial \nwill go far in determining the nature of Iran's relations with the \nU.S., and its standing in the community of nations.\n  The 13 Iranian Jews, mostly community and religious leaders in the \ncities of Shiraz and Isfahan, were arrested more than a year ago by the \nIranian authorities and accused of spying for the U.S. and Israel. \nThese espionage charges are, of course, preposterous.\n  Indeed, how could they be true? Jews in Iran are prohibited from \nholding any positions that would grant them access to state secrets or \nsensitive materials. And most of these men live hundreds of miles from \nTehran.\n  This mockery of truth and justice reached new lows this week. After a \nyear in prison--isolated, no contact with family or friends, no contact \nwith even a lawyer--three of these men were dragged from the darkness \nof one of Iran's harshest prisons and stuck in front of cameras to \npublicly ``confess'' to their charges.\n  No-one is fooled. In fact, the world is appalled.\n  These men were presumed guilty before their trials even began. That's \nbecause they are in the hands of the hard-line Clerics in Iran, who run \nthe Revolutionary Courts. And, as we know, In Iran, the Clerics are \nnever wrong.\n  This is an Inquisition, not a trial.\n  What we are really witnessing is a high-stakes attempt at a bait and \nswitch. After forcing confessions to capital crimes, the Revolutionary \nCourt judge--who, by the way, also serves as prosecutor, chief \ninvestigator, and jury--may dole out ``light'' sentences on the 13 men, \nto show how ``forgiving'' the Clerics are.\n  Our Resolution makes it perfectly clear that these innocent men \nshould not be used as pawns in a shifty battle of egos in Iran. They \nshould be released immediately.\n  The case of the 13 Jews is showing the world how far Iran needs to go \nbefore they may even begin to expect to be welcomed into the community \nof nations.\n  That is why countless nations and all leading international human \nrights organizations have expressed their concern for the 13 Iranian \nJews, and have denounced the abuse of their fundamental human rights.\n  The United States recently presented Iran with goodwill overtures, \nsuch as lifting restrictions on many Iranian imports and easing travel \nrestrictions between our two countries. We learned this week that \ngoodwill gestures are meaningless.\n  Truth be told, Iran has continued to display nothing but hostility \nand contempt for the United States and everything for which we stand.\n  At a minimum, Iran must show signs of respecting human rights as a \nprerequisite for our improving relations with them. I am pleased that \nSecretary of State Albright has identified the case of the 13 Jews in \nIran as ``one of the barometers of United States-Iran relations.''\n  The same standards should hold true for international financial \ninstitutions. Iran's quest for $130 million from the World Bank must \nnot be taken seriously unless and until Iran begins to show a basic \nunderstanding of basic rules of justice.\n  Much has been made of President Mohammad Khatami's popular reform \nmovement, and there is significant optimism that a kinder, gentler Iran \nis slowly emerging from the darkness of a 20-year hardline clerical \ndictatorship. Indeed, Khatami has received a huge mandate from the \npeople of Iran over the past four years.\n  However, Iran must fully understand that normalized relations with \nthe United States is only a pipedream if persecution such as that \nenacted upon the 13 Jews accused of spying goes unchallenged. If it \ndoes not, then what kind of reform movement are we really witnessing?\n  Colleagues, I thank you for supporting this Resolution urging the \nPresident to use all his resources to convince President Khatami that \nthis farcical trial leading to a pre-ordained outcome will send US-Iran \nrelations back to ground zero. Three of these men have already been \ntried and convicted without a shred of evidence. There are 10 more left \nto go. They should not spend one more day in prison. They should be \nreleased right now.\n  Today, the voice of the United States Senate has spoken. And we have \nsaid unanimously: ``Iran, the world is watching.''\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to; that the preamble be agreed to; that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements \nrelating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 109) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 109\n\n       Whereas on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover 1999, \n     13 Jews, including community and religious leaders in the \n     cities of\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\n     Shiraz and Isfahan, were arrested by the authorities of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran and accused of spying for the United \n     States and Israel;\n       Whereas three of 13 defendants were tried in the first week \n     in May 2000, in trials that were closed to all independent \n     journalists, outside media, international observers, and \n     family members;\n       Whereas no evidence was brought forth at these trials other \n     than taped ``confessions'', and no formal charges have yet \n     been filed;\n       Whereas Jews in Iran are prohibited from holding any \n     positions that would give them access to state secrets;\n       Whereas the judge in the case also serves as prosecutor, \n     chief investigator, and arbiter of punishment;\n       Whereas United States Secretary of State Albright has \n     identified the case of the 13 Jews in Shiraz as ``one of the \n     barometers of United States-Iran relations'';\n       Whereas countless nations and leading international human \n     rights organizations have expressed their concern for the 13 \n     Iranian Jews and especially their human rights under the rule \n     of law;\n       Whereas President Mohammad Khatami was elected on a \n     platform of moderation and reform;\n       Whereas the United States has recently made goodwill \n     overtures toward Iran, including lifting restrictions on the \n     import of Iranian foodstuffs and crafts, promising steps \n     toward the return of assets frozen since 1979, and easing \n     travel restrictions, all in an attempt to improve relations \n     between the two countries;\n       Whereas the World Bank is currently considering two Iranian \n     projects, valued at more than $130,000,000, which have been \n     on hold since 1993; and\n       Whereas Iran must show signs of respecting fundamental \n     human rights as a prerequisite for improving its relationship \n     with the United States and becoming a member in good standing \n     of the world community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should--\n       (1) condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the arrest of \n     the 13 Iranian Jews and the unfair procedures employed \n     against them leading up to, and during, their trials, and \n     demand their immediate release; and\n       (2) make it clear that--\n       (A) Iran's treatment of the Jews on trial is a benchmark \n     for determining the nature of current and future United \n     States-Iran relations, and that concessions already made may \n     be rescinded in light of Iran's conduct of these cases; and\n       (B) the outcome of these cases will help determine Iran's \n     standing in the community of nations, and its eligibility for \n     loans and other financial assistance from international \n     financial institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/04/senate-section/article/S3559-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3559-S3567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MANUFACTURED HOUSING IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. GORTON.
