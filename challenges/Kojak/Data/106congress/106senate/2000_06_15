Mr. President, this morning's session of the Senate was \nopened by Reverend Monsignor Lloyd Torgerson of Santa Monica, \nCalifornia. I welcome this opportunity to commend Monsignor Torgerson \nfor his eloquent prayer and for the wisdom he has offered the Senate.\n  Monsignor Torgerson is a pastor at the Santa Monica Parish where he \nhas served with great distinction for many years. He ministers to over \n7,000 families, as well as an elementary school and a high school. He \nalso serves at the Archdiocese level in Los Angeles, and is Dean of the \n19 Westside parishes.\n  Over the years, Chaplain Ogilvie and Monsignor Torgerson have \ndeveloped an excellent friendship through their work in the Los Angeles \ncommunity. In fact, Monsignor Torgerson baptized all four of Chaplain \nOgilvie's grandchildren.\n  The Senate is graced and honored by Monsignor Torgerson's presence \nthis morning. I commend him for his inspirational prayer and for his \nservice as our guest Chaplain. I ask unanimous consent that \nbiographical information on Monsignor Torgerson's distinguished career \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Rev. Msgr. Lloyd Torgerson, Pastor, St. Monica Parish Community\n\n       Rev. Msgr. Lloyd Torgerson was born in East Los Angeles in \n     1939 and attended St. Alphonsus Elementary School and Los \n     Angeles Community College High School. Msgr. Torgerson \n     completed his training for the priesthood at St. John's \n     Seminary in Camarillo, California. He was ordained a Roman \n     Catholic Priest in May, 1965 and his first assignment was at \n     Holy Trinity Parish in San Pedro where he served for five \n     years. Msgr. Torgerson was sent to complete his graduate \n     degree in Religious Education at Fordham University in New \n     York in 1970/71 and came back to serve the Los Angeles \n     Archdiocese as Director of Youth Ministry. After eleven \n     years, he was named the Director of Religious Education for \n     the Archdiocese. Msgr. Torgerson has been in residence at St. \n     Monica for twenty-one years and has served as pastor for the \n     last thirteen years. St. Monica Parish has over 7,000 \n     families, an elementary school, high school and a large \n     outreach to the community of Santa Monica. His work as pastor \n     and leader of St. Monica Parish includes parish \n     administration, campaign and restoration of St. Monica \n     Catholic Church and schools, adult education and formation, \n     bringing new adults into the church, young adult ministry, \n     working with the elderly, teaching in the schools, liturgy, \n     hospital visitation, bereavement, and many other outreaches \n     in this parish community.\n       In Santa Monica, Msgr. Torgerson participates in Rotary, is \n     a member of the Board of Directors of the Boys' and Girls' \n     Club of Santa Monica, and the N.C.C.J. On the Archdiocesan \n     level, he is Dean of the nineteen Westside parishes, on the \n     Finance Council, the Tidings Board and the Cathedral Complex \n     Restoration Committee. In March, 1999 through the present he \n     is Episcopal Vicar of Our Lady of the Angels Pastoral Region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/15/senate-section/article/S5165-6", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5165-S5166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

As soon as we get word on \nwhether or not we can accept the unanimous consent request, we will \ninterject ourselves and try to get that entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, noting the objection, in discussing \nthis amendment, I am going to proceed to give my statement and I will \nsend my amendment to the desk following my remarks and the remarks of \nmy colleagues.\n  Mr. President, when I first introduced S. 1144, the Surface \nTransportation Act, more than a year ago, I did so thinking that our \nState and local governments should have the maximum flexibility \npossible in implementing Federal transportation programs.\n  I still firmly believe that our State and local governments know best \nwhich transportation programs should go forward and at what level of \npriority.\n  As the only person in this country who has served as President of the \nNational League of Cities and Chairman of the National Governors' \nAssociation, and one who has worked with the State and local government \ncoalition, which we refer to as the Big 7, I have great faith in State \nand local governments, and I believe they should have maximum \nflexibility in determining how best to serve all of our constituents.\n  I think one of the best examples of how state and local governments \nwork to benefit our constituents is what we have been able to do with \nthe welfare system in this country when we let the States and local \ngovernments take it over.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment today--to give our State and \nlocal governments the flexibility they need to make some key \ntransportation decisions that will best suit their needs.\n  The amendment I am offering will give States the ability to use their \nFederal surface transportation funds for passenger rail service, \nincluding high-speed rail service.\n  This amendment is identical to section 3 of S. 1144. It allows each \nState to use funds from their allocation under the National Highway \nSystem, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, and the \nSurface Transportation Program for the following: acquisition, \nconstruction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, and preventative \nmaintenance for intercity passenger-rail facilities as well as for \nrolling stock.\n  As my colleagues know, under current law, States cannot use their \nFederal highway funding for rail, even when it is the best \ntransportation solution for their State or region. Since States are \nassuming a greater role in developing and maintaining passenger and \ncommuter rail corridors, I think it makes sense that States be given \nthe most flexibility to invest Federal funds in those rail corridors.\n  Part of being flexible is making sure we consider all of our options. \nIt is similar to the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax repeal effort that we \nfaced in the Senate this past April. High gasoline prices exposed that \nwe have no national energy policy. With prices currently over $2 per \ngallon in several areas in the Midwest, the fact that we still have no \nnational energy policy is now really being felt by the American public.\n  With the need for a national energy policy plainly evident, we need \nto put all our options on the table. We need to look at expanded rail \ntransportation, conservation, exploration, alternative fuels, and so \non. We need to put all of the right ingredients together that will make \nfor a successful transportation policy.\n  In addition to the high gas prices, I think the Senate should \nrecognize the fact that there is an appeal pending in the Supreme Court \nof the United States of America on the issue of the Environmental \nProtection Agency's new proposed ambient air standards for ozone and \nparticulate matter. If the Supreme Court overrules the lower court's \ndecisions that those new standards are not justified, then we will find \nthroughout the United States of America many communities, including \ncommunities in my State--where we have achieved the current national \nambient air standards in every part of our State--that will be in \nnonattainment. If the new standards are implemented, we will need more \ntools to deal with the pollution.\n\n  With the need for a national energy policy plainly evident, we need \nto put all of our options on the table. We need to look at expanded \nrail transportation and conservation and all the rest.\n  As States are more able to turn towards passenger rail service as a \nsafe, reliable, and efficient mode of transportation, we will relieve \ncongestion on our Nation's highways. With fewer cars on the road, \ncontributions to air quality improvements and lower gas consumption \nwill be realized.\n  Again, the idea behind my amendment is simple. States understand \ntheir particular transportation challenges better than the Federal \nGovernment. I believe it is the States' right and obligation to use \nwhatever tools are available to efficiently meet the transportation \nneeds of their citizens. In this instance, the Federal Government \nshould not stand in their way but work as a partner to give them the \nflexibility they need to develop a successful policy.\n  S. 1144 had 35 bipartisan Senate cosponsors. This particular \namendment we are offering today is endorsed by the National Governors' \nAssociation, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of \nCities, the Council of State Governments, the National Conference of \nState Legislatures, the National Association of Rail Passengers, and \nthe Friends of the Earth.\n  I have yet to convince some of my colleagues that this amendment will\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\ngive our States and localities the latitude they need to make proper \nand cost-effective transportation decisions.\n  First and foremost, this amendment does not mandate that any portion \nof a State's highway dollars be used for rail. If a State wants to use \nall their highway dollars the same way they have been doing for the \npast few years under TEA-21, then they will be able to do that. It does \nnot establish a percentage of how much is set aside for rail. If a \nState wants to use highway dollars for rail, then the State decides the \namount to meet the particular needs. Governors will have to work with \nlegislators to decide if they want to use it for rail and how much can \nbe used for rail.\n  So often when we talk about such issues--``the Governors are going to \nuse this money for rail''--my colleagues and I know that Governors \nrecommend and the legislatures then decides whether they are going to \nfollow the recommendations. In my State, looking back on my years as \nGovernor, I think Ohio probably will not use this flexibility \nprovision. But the fact is, it ought to be available to any State if it \nthinks it is in its best interest.\n  There is very strong support from outside the Beltway for each \nState's right to spend its Federal transportation funds on passenger \nrail. States understand their particular transportation challenges \nbetter than the Federal Government and therefore should be given the \nflexibility to use their highway dollars for rail transportation. There \nare no mandates on the States to do this. It is totally at the \ndiscretion of the States.\n  We face a historic opportunity today to provide the States with the \nflexibility they need to meet their growing transportation needs. I \nurge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \nto be offered by my distinguished colleague from Ohio. People in my \nregion of the country in the South are usually known for their position \nin favor of States rights. This is not just a transportation issue; \nthis is a States rights issue. This amendment is not a mandate. It is \nnot a threat to highways or the Highway Trust Fund. It would not change \nany Federal transportation formulas. It requires not a penny in new \nspending. What it does do is to give States the option to spend Federal \ntransportation funds on intercity passenger rail. What this amendment \ndoes do is give States the opportunity to make transportation spending \ndecisions based on their own local needs.\n\n  Mr. President, part of my State is in a transportation crisis. Metro \nAtlanta has the worst traffic congestion of any southern city, and our \ndrivers have the longest commute in the Nation. Due in large part to \nthe exhaust from nearly three million vehicles, Atlanta's skies are in \nviolation of national clean air standards. For two years now, Federal \nfunds have been frozen for new transportation projects. The bottom \nline? Metro Atlanta's congestion and pollution problems are now \nthreatening our most valuable selling point: our quality of life.\n  The good news is that the best transportation minds in the State have \nrallied around Metro Atlanta's transportation crisis. These movers and \nshakers are not afraid to redraw the maps. The result is a new \ntransportation plan that is going to meet our air quality goals, and \nthat plan devotes 60 percent of Georgia's transportation dollars to \nrail. Georgia has dramatically reformed its transportation focus: from \nmoving cars to moving people, from promoting sprawl to promoting smart \ngrowth.\n  As the folk song says, ``the times they are a-changing.'' We're about \nto witness a rebirth of rail in Georgia, rivaled only by the days \nbefore General Sherman when Atlanta was the undisputed railroad hub of \nthe Southeast. And key to this vision is intercity rail. The amendment \nbefore us, if adopted, will be a Godsend to my state. Let me state loud \nand clear, this amendment will be a Godsend not just to Georgia, for \nAtlanta's commuter congestion is mirrored in countless highways across \nAmerica. One viable solution to two of the 21st century's most \nchallenging and frustrating problems, smog and gridlock, may very well \nbe found in a renaissance of rail, not just in my home State, but \nthroughout this great Nation.\n  For those States which see rail as key to their transportation \nfuture, we should at least give them another option for financing their \nintercity rail investments. Our amendment will do just that. It will \ngive states whose highways and skyways are clogged with traffic not a \nmandate, but a chance to use their CMAQ, National Highway System, and \nSurface Transportation Program funds on passenger rail if they want to.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the bipartisan measures before us. \nThe National Governors Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the \nCouncil of State Governments, the National League of Cities and the \nNational Council of State Legislatures are all on record in support of \nproviding flexible funding for passenger rail. This is States' rights \nlegislation, and it's the right legislation for a balanced \ntransportation system in the 21st century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this measure. I \nyield myself 10 minutes in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit.\n  Mr. BOND. There is no time agreement? I thank the Chair. I will take \nsuch time as I require then.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Ohio has offered an amendment which \nI believe takes us down the wrong tracks, very far in that direction. \nHe has offered an amendment that would allow our precious highway \nresources to be used for Amtrak.\n  My colleague from Georgia has talked about the sad situation in \nGeorgia where their highway funds are frozen because the courts have \noverturned a previous policy of the Federal Government to allow highway \ntransportation projects to continue. I urge his and my other \ncolleagues' support of my measure on conformity that would allow needed \nhighway construction to go forward.\n  As to this amendment, many would argue this is an issue of States \nrights. That is just not the case. I am a former Governor. One would be \nhard pressed to find anyone in this body who is a stronger States \nrights advocate than I am. I intend to continue to be so. There will be \nthose who will try to convince us this is anti-Amtrak. That is not the \ncase. As Governor of the great State of Missouri, I was the one who \nensured that my State provided its own resources in an effort to help \nsubsidize Amtrak.\n  This is an issue of a dedicated tax for a dedicated purpose. We told \nthe American people we were going to put the trust back into the trust \nfund. This is an issue of Congress upholding its end of the agreement \nwith the American people.\n  It has just been 2 years this month since the Transportation Equity \nAct of the 21st century--better known as TEA-21--was signed into law. \nIn my opinion, the most historic and the most important provision of \nTEA-21 was the funding guarantee that I authored with our late friend, \nSenator John Chafee, with the assistance and the guidance of the Budget \nand Appropriations Committees. Some called that provision RABA, or \nrevenue aligned budget authority. Up here, it is often called the \nChafee-Bond provision. In Missouri, we call it the Bond-Chafee \nprovision. But the whole intent of that measure was very clear. We have \na dedicated tax that was imposed on the American people for the purpose \nof highway improvement and safety issues. We lose too many lives in my \nState and in every State in this Nation because of inadequate highways. \nOver 30 percent of the deaths on our highways nationally are a result \nof inadequate highway and bridge conditions.\n  We told the American people for the first time we were going to allow \nthem to trust the trust fund; that when they put the money in when they \nbought the gas at the pumps, we would put it back for highway trust \nfund purposes. That is what the funding must be spent on under the \nguarantee--highway improvements and safety issues. Because of the \nguarantee, our road and bridge improvements are financed on a pay-as-\nyou-go basis.\n  We drive on the road. We buy the gas. We pay the tax. We build better \nroads and safer roads to protect our citizens,\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\nto provide convenience and safety, to get rid of the pollution that \ncomes from congestion, and to assure sound economic growth in our \ncommunities and in our States.\n\n  I don't think this debate should even occur. It should not even be an \noption for us to decide whether or not we will use the highway trust \nfund money for other purposes. How soon we forget. We made those \ndecisions just 2 years ago in TEA-21. Do we want to reopen the whole \nhighway funding and highway authorization measure again? Let's not \nstart down the path of reopening TEA-21. We made accommodations. We \nmade changes. We made compromises. We included other projects and other \nactivities such as transit in TEA-21. We made a deal--not just with us \nbut with the taxpaying American public.\n  Earlier this year, the administration proposed to divert funding \ncoming from the highway trust fund to Amtrak and other purposes. At \nthat time, my colleague from Ohio, I, and countless other Senators made \nit clear that we opposed the administration's attempt to rob the \nhighway trust fund. I had an opportunity to discuss this with Secretary \nSlater at our Transportation appropriations hearing and suggested to \nhim that ``this dog won't hunt.'' This dog isn't a much better hunter \neither.\n  I don't believe that the people in my State who pay the taxes or in \nthe States of my colleagues who pay the taxes are going to be excited \nabout this. This amendment is similar to the previous effort by the \nadministration to divert funding. It takes us down the path of diluting \nour highway funding for purposes other than highways and highway \nsafety.\n  I have a simple question for my colleagues to think about: Why are we \ntalking about using our highway funds for Amtrak and not using our \ntransit funds for Amtrak? I personally think transit funds would be \nmore appropriate if it fit into the transit plan. OK. Let them use \ntransit funds because that is essentially what Amtrak is; it is a form \nof transit. It should not be competing with the scarce dollars to build \nsafe highways, roads, and bridges.\n  I remind my colleagues that we have a transportation infrastructure \ncrisis on our hands. Two years ago, Governors, commissioners, highway \ndepartments, city officials, and everyday Americans told us we were not \ninvesting enough in our highway infrastructure. They let us know that \nthe deterioration of our highways and bridges was having a tremendous \nimpact on their local and State economies and, more importantly, on the \nsafety of their citizens. We are still not getting enough money into \nhighway improvements. The latest I heard, and to the best of my \nknowledge, no State in the Nation has even 80 percent of its highways \nup to a standard the Department of Transportation regards as fair. \nEvery State, to my knowledge, has at least a 20-percent deficit in \nadequate highways, roads, and bridges.\n  These are just some of the reasons so many of us fought to ensure \nthat we would keep our commitment to the American people regarding the \nhighway trust Fund.\n  We increased spending on our Nation's highway infrastructure because \nour needs were much greater. I know with absolute certainty that the \nneeds identified just 2 years ago have not gone away, and they are not \ngoing to go away if we continue to divert money and if we try to divert \nmoney from the highway trust fund. These needs still exist.\n  We told the people of America we would put trust back into the trust \nfund: Trust us. Trust us to spend your highway taxes that go into the \nhighway trust fund for highway trust fund purposes.\n\n  The National Highway System was part of the grand national scheme. \nThis was a national scheme to ensure that people in any State in the \nNation could travel to any other State in the Nation and be safe on a \nNational Highway System. That is what this is all about. This isn't \nabout States having their own little, independent highway programs with \nfour-lane highways that end in a cornfield at somebody's border. This \nis about having a National Highway System where there is safe transit \non interstate highways.\n  Trust fund taxpayers in my State, and your State, and every other \nState, expect when they pay the money in, it will go to assure that \nwhen they drive in their State or in any other State, they will be \ndriving on safe highways; they will not be putting themselves and their \nloved ones and their families at risk from unsafe highway conditions.\n  To my donor State colleagues--those of us whose states pay more into \nthe highway trust fund than they get out--think about this for a \nminute: You have highway needs in your State. Yet under this proposal, \nyou would see the highway trust fund dollars your citizens put into the \nhighway trust fund going into Amtrak. That is not keeping faith with \nthe commitment we made in the highway trust fund.\n  Let's talk about States rights. I have often thought that maybe we \nreally ought to do a States rights approach to this and let the States \nhave all the money they raised. You want to talk about States rights. \nLet's keep the highway trust fund dollars in each State as they are \ncontributing. That is States rights.\n  We agreed in TEA-21 that we were going to have a trust fund for a \nNational Highway System--not a national Amtrak system. We are providing \nfunds in this bill for Amtrak.\n  We know that improvements and repairs to our highway system will help \nimprove driving conditions, will reduce driving costs to motorists, \nwill relieve congestion, and will reduce the number of accidents and \nfatalities. The cost of repairing roads in poor condition can be about \nfour times as great as repairing roads that are in fair condition. We \nhave to keep our roads in at least fair condition. Our Nation's roads \nand bridges are at a high level of deterioration.\n  A recent headline in the Capital City newspaper in Missouri said that \nmy State of Missouri ranks seventh nationally in poor bridges. We need \nto do something about those bridges; they are dangerous. The highways \nare dangerous and we need to do something about them.\n  Look at the other side. This is not an issue of trying to deny Amtrak \nresources. Senators Shelby and Lautenberg included in the underlying \nTransportation bill, which I support, $521 million for Amtrak's capital \nprogram. I have supported that. That is $521 million for Amtrak for \ncapital. That $521 million provided is consistent with the \nadministration's request, and it is consistent with the so-called \nglidepath level of Federal funding agreed to by the administration and \nAmtrak.\n  We continue these huge Federal subsidies, even though Amtrak's \nfinancial situation is precarious at best. According to the Senate \nreport, the Federal Railroad Administration has said that Amtrak ended \nthe 1999 fiscal year with a net operating loss of $702 million.\n  Since 1971, Amtrak has received over $23 billion in Federal funding \nfor operating and capital expenses. Despite Amtrak's efforts to improve \nand its new business plan, it is still not clear whether or not Amtrak \nwill reach self-sufficiency. I said that I support the appropriation \nfor Amtrak in the underlying bill. I have used Amtrak. I am happy to \nwork with my colleagues in the Senate, my former fellow Governors, and \nothers, to see that we put money into Amtrak. But this issue is not \nabout Amtrak. This is an issue about keeping our commitment to the \ntaxpaying citizens of our States and of this country, whom we told we \nwere going to put the ``trust'' back in the highway trust fund.\n  I strongly oppose the Voinovich amendment because it violates that \npromise. We can't even keep a promise for 2 years. We said we were \nputting the ``trust'' back in the highway trust funds. That is what the \nhighway trust fund is all about. I think this amendment violates the \nagreement made during TEA-21, and I strongly urge my colleagues to \noppose the Voinovich amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Ohio please send his \namendment to the desk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3434\n\n (Purpose: To provide increased flexibility in use of highway funding)\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Voinovich], for himself, Mr. \n     Cleland, Mr. Roth, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3434.\n\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that with respect to Senator Voinovich's amendment on passenger \nrail flexibility, the vote occur on or in relation to the amendment at \n11 a.m. today with the debate until 11 divided in the usual form. I \nfurther ask consent that no amendments be in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am on the side of the Senator from \nOhio. I don't know what the agreement is as to who has jurisdiction \nover the time, but I believe----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio controls half of the \ntime, and the manager or his designee controls the other half.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 20 minutes for the Senator from Ohio \nand 17 minutes for the opposition.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Ohio whether he \nwould be willing to yield me 7 minutes?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I would be more than happy to do so.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio and the \nSenator from Rhode Island for taking the lead on this important \namendment this year. As a former Governor and mayor, they can both tell \nyou firsthand about the need for State and local governments to have \nflexibility to make the best use of their transportation dollars as \nthey see fit.\n  I find this kind of fascinating. Here we are and we talk about States \nrights and doing what the States need and the States know what their \nrequirements are. Yet repeatedly when I have introduced this same \namendment without the help--hopefully, it will change now because I \nhave a former Republican Governor who has done the job. He is here in \nthe Senate. I have stood up on the floor since 1991 introducing this \namendment and I have been told that the Governors don't want this, or \nthat this is inconsistent with the Republican philosophy, or whatever.\n  Now we have a Governor from one of the largest States in the United \nStates who has done the job--and he obviously did it very well--who \nsays, along with a former mayor from one of our smaller States but with \nmore concentrated cities, that this is a flexibility that will help. \nWhy should you be put in a position as a Governor when, in fact, you \nare able to, by the way, have flexibility with this money and to decide \nhow you want to use your highway money, and you decide you want to put \na bus route on, you can do it? Why can't you use the railroad? This \nsacrosanct principle I always hear from my friend from Missouri I find \nfascinating. What is the difference between a bus and a railroad? It is \nnot a road. Guess what. It is on a road. The cement and asphalt guys \nlike that a lot. They don't like the idea that we would make it better \nfor our constituents and Governors have the choice and flexibility.\n\n  We are not asking for more money; we are asking for flexibility. I \nwould think it is just common sense. The record shows that the Senate \nhas gone on record time after time--in 1991, 1995, and 1997--in favor \nof this same proposal before us today in the Voinovich amendment. Time \nand again, the language has been dropped in conference with the House, \nwhich is why we are here again today.\n  In addition to the same common sense, we are also here to restore \nbalance to the way our transportation dollars are spent. Once again, \nthe highway lobby, which is not content to consume its own large share, \nis trying to keep Amtrak from having a little bit of a share of the \nleftovers that go on after other modes of transportation have been \ntaken care of. I guess we will have that business to deal with today.\n  First, the issue is common sense. Under current law, States are \npermitted to make their own choices to use the money for certain \nFederal transportation programs for mass transit, hike and bike trails, \ndriver education, and even snowmobile trails. This is not a very \nrestrictive list, Mr. President. In fact, there is only one kind of \ntransportation that Governors and mayors aren't allowed to consider; \nthat is, inner-city passenger rail.\n  Isn't that funny? They are going to give the folks in Minnesota, as \nwe should, the ability for the Governor to decide he wants to spend \nhighway money for snowmobile trails. Well, that is his business. They \nneed that, according to the people in Minnesota. We don't need it in \nDelaware. We need rail. As my friend, and the leader on this subject \nfor the entire time he has been here, the Senator from New Jersey, \nsays--and one of my greatest regrets is that he is leaving voluntarily, \nand I mean that sincerely. He has one of the few logical voices in this \ndebate. He and I come from States that if you widen I-95, it will \naccommodate the reduction of rail transportation and you are going to \ntake up the bulk of my State. It would take another seven lanes. Look, \nI don't tell the folks in Missouri what they need. I don't tell the \nGovernor of Missouri that he should or should not build more roads. Why \ncan't you let the Governor of the State of Delaware decide whether or \nnot it is better for us to have rail transportation between Wilmington \nand Newark, DE, instead of having to build another lane on I-95?\n  We all know why Amtrak is off the list. It is politics, pure \npolitics. It has nothing to do with good public policy or a principle \nof federalism. What sense does it make to go out of our way to tie our \nGovernor's hands when it comes to inner-city transportation? It makes \nno sense. That is why the Senate has supported this language time and \nagain--unanimously, in some cases, in the past, and with strong \nbipartisan support. Here is what is at stake when you think about this \nlittle proposition: A little balance in our transportation spending.\n  Mr. President, last year Amtrak received $571 million in Federal \nfunding. The highway system got $53 billion; and $20 billion of that \nwas over and above the gas tax and users' fees that make some folks \nbelieve they are paying their own way. Again, $20 billion.\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\n We are talking $571 million for Amtrak.\n  I am not here to argue against full funding of the highway system. \nHowever, a lot of places such as the Northeast corridor are not going \nto be able to add another lane to I-95. We have to have another option \nfor our transportation dollars. That is all this amendment does. It \ngives, along with every other State, an option we need to keep \nintercity transportation and rail systems viable. That includes States \nin the Midwest, West, and South, which is why S. 1144, the bill on \nwhich this amendment is based, is cosponsored by 36 Senators including, \nI note with interest, the distinguished majority leader.\n  The simple notion of balance says we ought to give all the parts of \nour transportation system the resources they need and we should give \nour citizens the full range of transportation choices that citizens in \nevery other advanced economy in the world can now take for granted. It \nis time to stand up for this language. There is no principled argument \non Federalism.\n  I thank my friend from Ohio for his leadership, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this is one of these \nissues that gets convoluted. Unfortunately, in my role as the chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, I must object to this \nauthorizing amendment to the appropriations bill. I join several of my \ndistinguished colleagues, including my ranking member, Senator Baucus, \nin this regard.\n  I point out upfront I am a cosponsor of S. 1144. I support State \nflexibility. I support a cost-effective rail system that is efficient. \nAnd I encourage Amtrak to move towards privatization. The States do \nhave an interest in developing passenger rail. I want the States to \nhave that flexibility, which is why I cosponsored S. 1144.\n  Rail funding flexibility is a complex subject central to the so-\ncalled TEA-21 legislation which was debated and negotiated over many \nmonths in the last Congress. This issue is squarely in the jurisdiction \nof the authorizing committee, not the Appropriations Committee. We have \nhad this fight many times before. The majority leader has spoken \neloquently on this matter time and time and time again. We basically \nrender the authorizing committees powerless, useless. What is the \npurpose?\n  I have spent days and days and days and weeks and weeks in an effort \nto resolve a matter that deals with buses, an amendment or some \nlanguage that would be acceptable so we could vote for this. If we had \ndone that, perhaps we wouldn't be here now. Instead, we are now faced \nwith a decision. I have to oppose something that in essence I support, \nbut for some language that would deal with the problems the bus \ncompanies have.\n  This is an authorizing committee matter. Time and time again we \nlegislate on appropriations bills, and time and time again the \nauthorizing committees become useless. Since it has been reported, I \nhave spent several months working on substantive amendments to this \nbill. This bill has holes. On behalf of rail flexibility and the \nrailroads, I have tried my best to get around the holes, to no avail.\n\n  This provision requires more thought, more consideration, better \ntiming. Members of the Environment and Public Works Committee have a \ndifference of opinion on this amendment. I respect that. That is the \nway the process works. I have no problem with people having their own \nviews, and I am sure they don't have a problem with me having mine. We \nignore the authorizers' concerns if we shove this through on an \nappropriations bill. The House appropriations bill had another version \nof rail flexibility, and it was struck by a point of order.\n  I am very concerned about continuing Amtrak competition with \nintercity bus service, which is why I have spent with my staff on the \ncommittee weeks and weeks negotiating, working, trying to come up with \nlanguage that would be acceptable. Rail service will prosper if it is \nintegrated with feeder bus service. That is how rail will prosper. The \nrails have limits as to where they can go. Feeder buses have more \nflexibility. That enhances the rail.\n  Not included in this amendment is a specific prohibition against \nthese funds being used for Amtrak operating subsidies. Not included in \nthis amendment is any mechanism to prevent below-cost pricing that \ndamages existing bus service. And not included in this amendment is any \nmechanism to ensure rail and bus service are integrated. This amendment \nin its current form leaves many holes in this important policy, without \nprotecting the buses or the State government from the influence of \nAmtrak.\n  Balanced intercity transportation is important. This amendment cannot \nstrike the right balance, I regret to say. I ask my friends in the \nSenate to keep this provision in the jurisdiction of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee where it belongs. If you are on the \ncommittee, do what I am doing, even though in essence, with the \nexceptions I noted, I support S. 1144. Keep this matter in the \njurisdiction of the committee where it belongs.\n  We will continue our hard work on making it good legislation for all \nthe competing interests. If this provision goes on the appropriations \nbill, my committee cannot work on negotiations in conference. All who \nworked so hard to craft this, going back to when my predecessor was \nchairman of this committee, Senator John Chafee, when the process \nbegan, S. 1144 was marked out of committee and put on the Senate \ncalendar. The idea behind that is, if there is a conference on this \nbill with the House Members of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, which brought the bill out, we would have a right to \nconference. We are not even going to be in the conference now. We are \ntotally shut out of the process.\n  I say to my colleagues, I don't care where you are on the issue \nitself--whether you are for rail, bus, no rail flexibility, total rail \nflexibility--the right thing to do here is to support a rule XVI point \nof order because it is legislating on appropriations. Senator Lott has \nspoken about that issue over the past several weeks. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support the rule XVI point of order. I am not sure who \nyet will raise that point of order. I may do it, Senator Baucus may do \nit. We will talk about that. The point is, the rule should be raised \nand will be raised. I encourage my colleagues to support the rule XVI \npoint of order to this legislation on appropriations bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Ohio to yield \nme 5 minutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Ohio and congratulate him \nfor his foresight. He is among the best to know what to do in a \nsituation such as this, having served as a Governor of Ohio and mayor, \nas we earlier heard from our friend from Delaware.\n  We are simply asking for flexibility to use certain highway funds for \nmass transit investments. I think that is a pretty good idea. The \nVoinovich amendment merely extends that flexibility to include Amtrak \nexpenses.\n  We do not have much new here, except to make certain that if a \nGovernor, if a State, if the people in that State choose to use some of \nthe highway money they are going to have on rail, they have an \nopportunity to do so. I, frankly, think it is an appropriate local \ndecision. We often have disputes here about whether we are invading \nStates rights, seizing their prerogatives. This one surprises me \nbecause what I hear from the opponents, largely, is: Well, my people \nhave put money into the trust fund from the gasoline taxes and we want \nit spent on highways.\n  I can tell you, coming from New Jersey, we don't get very much of a \nreturn on the money we send down here. As a matter of fact, I am \nembarrassed to tell some of my constituents that we have among the \nlowest--perhaps the lowest--return on money we send to Washington. So \nwe understand the concerns there. But this is in the national interest. \nAs we hear the discussion, we say it should be to guarantee a National \nHighway System. The highway system is getting by far the lion's share. \nIf a State says it would also like to be investing in intercity rail \nservice, I think it ought to be able to do it.\n  Some say all the money going to rail, to Amtrak, is largely in the \nNortheast corridor. That may be a fact of life because most of the \npeople in the country\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\nare squashed into that little area, the Northeast quadrant of the \nUnited States. But also, as we look at plans, there are plans to take \ntrains from Chicago to St. Louis. If the investments are properly made \nthere, we will knock about 2 hours off the trip from Chicago to St. \nLouis. I assume that is an important route. It is a Midwest route, \nChicago to St. Louis, MO--that is a pretty busy area, too. And there is \ncongestion there: Been there, done that; I have seen it myself. Traffic \non the highways is bottled up.\n  We are clogging the airlanes to such a point they cannot function. \nThere was an article in the paper the other day about runway \nincursions. They are way up, 27 percent in just 5 months this year. \nThat is an ominous thing to think about. We are always concerned about \nairplanes falling out of the sky. Our system is fundamentally safe, but \nrunway incursions happen for a couple of reasons, not the least of \nwhich is it is just too crowded. There are too many airplanes fighting \nfor the same space to land or to take off or for slots to permit their \npassengers to disembark.\n\n  We are looking at a situation now, as we heard from the Senator from \nDelaware, where we cannot put anymore concrete down without recognizing \nthere is a terrific consequence to that. We talk about urban sprawl; we \ntalk about consuming all the land that is under us. We know one thing \nis true: Rail is an efficient way to go. So we ought to say, OK, I will \nbutt out of your business. If the Governor of Missouri or Governor of \nIllinois or the Governor of New Jersey chooses to use some of their \nhighway funds on intercity rail and convinces their legislature to do \nthat, we ought to agree. We ought to do it. That is usually the cry \nhere: Let the States decide. As much as possible, I would like to see \nthem do that.\n  What we see here is an excellent opportunity to present a States \nrights issue and allow the decisions to be made at the local scene \nwhere they are going to have the greatest impact. I hope we are going \nto see full support for this amendment. This is a matter of direct \nchoice.\n  I yield the floor and encourage all my colleagues to support the \namendment the Senator from Ohio has wisely offered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield to the Senator 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this has an intriguing, alluring, siren \ncall: Let the Governors and State legislatures divert it. It sounds \ngood on the surface. But like a lot of issues, let's stop and think \nabout the actual consequences.\n  First of all, when we passed the last highway bill, even though we \nincreased the amount of dollars to go from Federal gasoline taxes into \nthe trust fund, back out to the States for highway construction, we all \nknew we had not even begun to fully take care of our Nation's roads, \nhighways, and bridges. And we have not. The Department of \nTransportation, the Federal Highway Administration, has done study \nafter study that shows we only meet one-half of our Nation's needs--\none-half.\n  Some of you saw on television last night the report about all the red \nlights, people caught up in traffic. We know about the potholes. We \nknow about roads and bridges and highways that are not up to snuff. \nWhat do we also know? We also know that our highways, as good as they \nare, are not as durable and as lasting as, say, some European highways, \nGerman highways.\n  Why is that? That is because so much more research and development \nand expense in dollars goes into that highway system to make those the \nbest in the world. We have problems. We think we have a good highway \nsystem--it is good, but the Department of Transportation has concluded, \nfrom study after study, we are only halfway there, even with ISTEA that \nwe passed a couple of years ago. So anybody who thinks we should start \ndiverting money from the highway fund better think twice about whether \nor not we are keeping up with our Nation's highway needs. The answer is \nthat we are not.\n  Second, the highway program is trusted by Americans. Why is that? \nBasically because Americans know the Federal gasoline tax, as well as \nthe State gasoline tax, goes into highway construction and maintenance \nand that is it. A few years ago, we decided to divert 4.3 cents, which \nwas the additional tax we put on for highways, the gasoline tax, away \nfrom general revenues in the trust fund. We wanted to restore the trust \nin the highway trust fund. We did that. So basically all Federal \ngasoline taxes go in the highway trust fund and a small percent, half a \ncent, go into mass transit. The rest goes into the highway trust fund. \nAmericans know that. They know where their dollars are going. That \ngives Americans confidence.\n\n  Not along ago, the suggestion was made to repeal the 4.3 cents. That \nwas during a time when gasoline prices were going up. It sounded like a \ngood idea, repeal 4.3 cents of the Federal gasoline tax, get those \nhighway taxes down, get those gasoline taxes down. A siren song? Sounds \ngood on the surface. What happened? We thought about it a little more \nand realized it was not a very good idea and we decided not to do that. \nWe wanted to keep the 4.3 cents in the highway trust fund, knowing in \nthe long run that is much more in our national interest.\n  This trust is very important. I can see this as the beginning of a \nslippery slope, giving Government discretion to take money out of the \nfund for Amtrak. Then what is next after that? We start to nibble away \nat the trust.\n  One other point, the highway system in America is a National Highway \nSystem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask to proceed for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield the Senator another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire only has 3 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield the 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will take 2.\n  This is a National Highway System. What does that mean? President \nEisenhower saw this. It was his conception. As a young soldier, he \ntraveled across America and realized the highway system needed help. \nThat means we know, as we travel across the country, that the highways \nin Montana, New Jersey, Ohio--highways around the country are all in \npretty good shape. It is a National Highway System. What is going to \nhappen? I have the highest respect for my friends from New Jersey and \nDelaware. What is going to happen in those States which are \nessentially, by comparison, Amtrak States? They are not highway States; \nthey are Amtrak States. We know what is going to happen. Those \nGovernors and legislators are going to say we are going to take money \nout of the highway trust fund. Because we don't have as many highways \nin our State, we are going to Amtrak.\n  What are Americans going to think when the highways in those States \nstart to deteriorate? It is no longer a National Highway System. The \nsame thing about Amtrak. One Governor says Amtrak; the one next-door \nsays, no, not Amtrak. It gets to be quilt work, gets to be patchwork, \nit gets to be confused, and we do not have a national system anymore.\n  I think we need to expand Amtrak. I am a strong Amtrak supporter--\nvery strong. But the way to do it is not here on the floor saying \nGovernors decide what a national Amtrak program is. The way to do it is \nfor the Congress of the United States to do its business and come back \nwith a national Amtrak program. That is the way to do it.\n  We have a budget surplus here. Let's talk about Amtrak in the context \nof how we put a national Amtrak program together, and not say Governors \ndo this and do that and sometimes some States will have a little more \nhighway money.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to not succumb to this \nsiren song because in the long run, it is going to hurt us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 2 \nminutes to speak on this amendment.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I object. I want to know----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SHELBY. What does the Senator want to know?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I want to know on whose time?\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 8 minutes remaining for the \nproponents.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I asked unanimous consent that I be given time. It is on \nnobody's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking to put off the 11 \no'clock vote then by unanimous consent?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I was not going to comment on this \nprovision today, as I am trying to expedite consideration of the \ntransportation appropriations bill and did not want any statement by me \nto delay the conclusion of the Senate's consideration of the measure.\n  However, since I heard the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and the ranking member of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee come out in opposition to this measure, I could not \nmiss the opportunity to stand with them in opposition to include this \nprovision on the Transportation appropriations bill. Often we find \nourselves in disagreement on individual amendments, so when the chance \narises to be on the same side with them, I did not want to miss the \nchance.\n  Further, I do believe that in this particular instance flexibility is \na dangerous tool to be giving Amtrak. It is one thing to grant special \ndispensation in the case of increasing service or in unique \ncircumstances, but my concern here is that Amtrak will use the \nprovision to leverage State to shift badly needed highway dollars to \nsimply maintaining already failing Amtrak service.\n  This is one of those circumstances of needing to be careful what you \nwish for--many States may find the they have fewer highway dollars and \nthe same Amtrak service at the end of the day if this provision were to \npass.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this provision on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, one of the things that is a little bit \ndisturbing to me is that there is a feeling in the Senate that somehow \nGovernors control their States: The Governors are going to do this; the \nGovernors are going to do that. The Governors are unable to do anything \nunless they have the support and involvement of their State \nlegislatures.\n  I was a Governor from a donor State and fought for ISTEA and TEA-21. \nWhen I came in, we were at 79 cents. We are up to 90\\1/2\\ cents. I know \nhow important money is for transportation. This is not an issue of \nAmtrak. I keep hearing Amtrak. I do not like Amtrak, and if we had the \nflexibility in my State, I am pretty sure we are not going to spend any \nmoney on rail. But I think the Governors should have an opportunity to \nhave the flexibility to decide--with their legislatures--what is in the \nbest interest of their people in dealing with their transportation \nproblems.\n  There is one other issue that needs to be taken under consideration \nwhen talking about transportation, and that is the environmental policy \nof the United States. We are in a situation today where we have high \ngas prices. We are in a situation today where we need to put together \nan energy policy. Frankly speaking, rail ought to be part of the \nconsideration in deciding that energy policy.\n  Some of the same people who are objecting to Governors having \nflexibility on rail supported welfare reform. I remember when we were \ndown here lobbying for welfare reform. They said: If you give it to the \nGovernors, it will be a race to the bottom. But, we got the job done. \nSome of the same people opposed to this are big advocates of giving \nGovernors the opportunity to spend education dollars. That is what this \nis about. This is not about Amtrak. It is about flexibility. It is \nabout States rights. It is about federalism.\n  The only reason I offered the amendment today is that I could not get \na unanimous-consent agreement to bring up the bill, S. 1144, and it was \nstuck with a hold on it. With all due respect to the chairman, for whom \nI have the highest regard and understanding--and who was a cosponsor of \nthis legislation, this issue of flexibility needs to be aired. We ought \nto have a vote on it. We ought to give the Governors the opportunity to \nhave this flexibility.\n  To characterize the amendment as for rail or against--that is not the \ncase. I am not here for that. I am here for flexibility for the \nGovernors who have a big responsibility, and they ought to have an \nopportunity with their State legislatures to decide how they are going \nto spend this money. If they want to spend it on rail and debate it, \nfine. If they do not want it, let them decide that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I support his \namendment, and I want to reiterate how important this will be to our \nState. Because of ISTEA, our State gets a huge amount of money for road \nbuilding. The Governors make that decision. We are desperately short in \nterms of help for rail in many parts of our State. In fact, in some of \nthe rural areas they are looking for rail help now which they were not \nseveral years ago.\n  As I understand the Senator's amendment, it will simply allow each \nGovernor to make that choice so that in my State of New York, if \nGovernor Pataki decides he has enough, or at least a higher priority \nthan the bottom of the rung in terms of his highway decisions and wants \nto put some of this money into passenger rail service, he will be \nallowed to do it. It is simply his decision, no mandate, and will not \naffect any other State if this amendment is adopted. And that would \napply in each of the States; am I correct in assuming that?\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Ohio, there \nare approximately 2 minutes remaining. We had an understanding that we \nwould share some time. Does the Senator need the 2 minutes? If he does, \nI will step aside.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will try to take only 1 minute.\n  This is not a new idea. This has been in Senate bills before, \nincluding ISTEA and TEA-21, and it passed with those bills. It died in \nconference. There was another influence working over there that \nprevented us from exercising our will and our judgment about what ought \nto happen.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues who oppose this, we have done \nthis before, and we ought to have a clear opportunity to do it again.\n  The Senator from Ohio was so clear in his presentation. It is simply \nallowing the governments within the States to make decisions about how \nthey use their highway funds. If they think they are servicing their \npublic better by permitting them to invest in intercity rail, then, by \ngolly, we ought to let them do it. It is better for the highway people. \nThose who advocate investing more in highways, how about getting more \ncars off the roads? Doesn't that help the highway people? Doesn't that \nhelp clear up congestion? I think so.\n  I understand the jurisdictional dispute. I am on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, and I greatly respect the chairman. He was very \nclear in what he said. He does not oppose the idea, but he opposes the \nidea of doing it here.\n  It is here, and it is now, I say to the Senator, and we have to take \nthe opportunity as it exists. I hope my colleagues will support this.\n  I yield whatever time remains back to the Senator from Ohio. How much \ntime remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A little less than 30 seconds.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nand has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority \nleader, an amendment was inadvertently left off the list of eligible \namendments in order to the bill. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat a Murkowski amendment on an Alaska railroad be added to the list. \nThis has been agreed to by the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I make a point of order \nthat the pending amendment is legislating on an appropriations bill in \nviolation of\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\nrule XVI. I ask my colleagues to stand with me so that we can put a \nstop to this practice of legislating on appropriations bills.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I raise a defense of germaneness and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The Chair submits to the Senate the question, Is the amendment No. \n3434 germane? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 130 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Coverdell\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Domenici\n     Rockefeller\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the ayes are 46, the nays are \n52. The judgment of the Senate is that the amendment is not germane. \nThe amendment falls.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am going to increasingly call attention to \nthe disorder that prevails in this Senate.\n  As I sat here and listened to this crowd in the well, I wondered to \nmyself: Can you imagine Norris Cotton being in that well? Can you \nimagine George Aiken being in the well at that time? Can you imagine \nSenator Dick Russell being in the well? Can you imagine Lister Hill \nbeing there?\n  I don't know what the people who visit as our guests in the galleries \nthink of this institution. It resembles the floor of a stock exchange. \nI can understand that once in a while people have to go in the well and \nask a question. But we are supposed to vote from our seats. I do not \nknow how many Senators know that, but there is a regulation providing \nthat Senators shall vote from their seats. I urge the leadership on \nboth sides to insist that that be done. I always try to vote from my \nseat. It doesn't present any problem for me, voting from my seat. I \nrealize that some Senators don't get an opportunity to talk to one \nanother until they come to the rollcalls, but we have a vast area \noutside the Chamber or in the Cloakrooms where they can do that.\n  So I am going to urge the joint leadership to insist that Senators \nvote from their desks. If Senators will look on page 158 of the Senate \nManual under ``Senate regulations'', they will find this regulation. \nMay I ask the Chair to read that regulation to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. ``Votes Shall Be Cast From Assigned Desks.''\n  ``Resolved, that it is a standing order of the Senate that during yea \nand nay votes in the Senate, each Senator shall vote from the assigned \ndesk of the Senator.''\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: If I or another \nSenator insists on that regulation being enforced, is it the Chair's \nintention--and I am not being personal about this, but will the Chair \nenforce that regulation, if a Senator asks that it be done?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the duty of the Chair to enforce all the \nrules and regulations of the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  I hope Senators heard the Chair. For those who are not here, I hope \nthey will read it. I urge that the joint leadership insist on that \nregulation. Otherwise, I am going to insist on it. One Senator can \ninsist on it. As I understand from what the Chair has said in his \nresponse to my parliamentary inquiry of the Chair, it is the Chair's \nduty to enforce the regulations.\n  I don't say this with any animus, but I am concerned about how the \nSenate appears to visitors during roll call votes. Perhaps other \nSenators may not be quite so concerned, but I am because it seems to be \ngetting worse.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, following the previous agreement, all \namendments had to be filed by 11:30. I think it is a little past 11:30. \nWe should now have all of the amendments.\n  At this time, I would like to review with my ranking member, Senator \nLautenberg, all amendments that have been filed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, may we have order, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair calls for order in the Senate.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President,\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3439\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve should be used to address high crude oil and gasoline \n                                prices)\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine (Ms. Collins), for herself and Mr. \n     Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 3439.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING USE OF THE \n                   STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) since 1999, gasoline prices have risen from an average \n     of 99 cents per gallon to $1.63 per gallon (with prices \n     exceeding $2.00 per gallon in some areas), causing financial \n     hardship to Americans across the country;\n       (2) the Secretary of Energy has authority under existing \n     law to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through time \n     exchanges (``swaps''), by releasing oil from the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve in times of supply shortage in exchange for \n     the infusion of more oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     at a later date;\n       (3) the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n     (``OPEC'') has created a worldwide supply shortage by choking \n     off petroleum production through anticompetitive means;\n       (4) at its meetings beginning on March 27, 2000, OPEC \n     failed to increase petroleum production to a level sufficient \n     to rebuild depleted inventories; and\n       (5) the Secretary of Energy should implement a swap plan at \n     times, such as the present, when prices of fuel have risen \n     because of cutbacks in the production of crude oil.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that if the President determines that a release of oil from \n     the Strategic Petroleum Reserve under swapping arrangements \n     would not jeopardize national security, the Secretary of \n     Energy should, as soon as is practicable, use the authority \n     under existing law to release oil from the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve in an economically feasible way by means of \n     swapping arrangements providing for future increases in \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve reserves.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my \ndistinguished colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, to offer a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that addresses\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\nperhaps what is the most pressing transportation problem facing America \ntoday; that is, the outrageously high cost of gasoline. Retail gasoline \nprices have skyrocketed over the past months to a nationwide average of \n$1.63 per gallon. In my hometown of Caribou, ME, a gallon of regular \nunleaded gas costs $1.68. And that's if you pump your own. In the \nMidwest, gasoline prices have exceeded $2 a gallon. Yesterday, gasoline \nfutures hit a 9\\1/2\\-year high on the New York Mercantile Exchange. \nYet, just last year, gasoline prices averaged only 99 cents per gallon. \nWhat a difference a year can make.\n\n  This past March, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson assured the \nnation that we would enjoy declining gasoline prices over the spring \nand summer and promised that we would not see gasoline prices at $2 per \ngallon. Unfortunately, $2 is exactly what many Americans now pay for a \ngallon of gas.\n  These high prices are the result of steadily increasing crude oil \nprices which, in turn, have been caused by OPEC's anticompetitive \nactivity. Since the second quarter of 1999, OPEC has cut production by \nover 3 million barrels per day in a deliberate attempt to raise prices. \nWell, the strategy has worked. Although OPEC countries sold 5 percent \nless oil in 1999, their profits were up 38 percent. And the profits \nkeep rolling in.\n  Early last fall, Senator Schumer and I began warning the Clinton \nadministration that OPEC's production squeeze would have far-reaching, \ndetrimental impacts on our economy. At that time, oil prices already \nwere beginning to rise, and U.S. inventories were falling. Throughout \nthe winter, Mainers and all Americans who heat with oil suffered from \nthe highest distillate prices in a decade.\n  The administration's lack of a response has been as perplexing as it \nis disappointing. Last winter, Secretary Richardson admitted that the \n``Federal Government was not prepared. We were caught napping.'' This \nis an astonishing explanation for the administration's lack of \nleadership. And now it's time for the administration to wake up.\n  The administration's ``energy diplomacy'' policy has proven to be a \nfailure.\n  On March 27, the OPEC nations agreed to increase production, but at a \nlevel that still falls well short of world demand. At the time, \nSecretary Richardson proclaimed that the administration's policy of \n``quiet diplomacy'' had worked and forecast price declines of 11 to 18 \ncents per gallon by mid-summer. Thus far, exactly the opposite has \noccurred. Gasoline prices are up some 12 cents per gallon since the \nOPEC announcement. Now predictions are not so rosy. As the Department \nof Energy's Energy Information Administration candidly noted in its \nJune 2000 short-term energy outlook, ``we now recognize that hopes for \nan early peak in pump prices this year have given way to expectations \nof some continued increases in June and possibly July.''\n  Moreover, the EIA's June report warns that OPEC's anticompetitive \nscheme could place us next winter once again in the midst of another \ndiesel fuel and home heating oil crisis. The report predicts that world \noil consumption will continue to outpace production throughout this \nyear resulting in, and I quote, ``extremely low inventories by the end \nof the year, leaving almost no flexibility in the world oil system to \nreact to a cutoff in oil supplies somewhere or an extreme cold snap \nduring next winter.''\n  It is past time for this administration to shift gears from quiet \ndiplomacy to active engagement. The oil crisis we have faced for over a \nyear underscores the fact that this administration has no energy \npolicy, much less one designed to address the needs of America in the \n21st century. Americans deserve a long-term, sustainable, cogent energy \npolicy. But, in the short term, they also deserve some price relief. \nThe amendment Senator Schumer and I have offered would do just that.\n  The amendment is straightforward. It addresses the sense of the \nSenate that the Secretary of Energy should use his authority to release \nsome oil from our massive Strategic Petroleum Reserve through time \nexchanges, or ``swaps.'' The immediate commencement of a swaps policy \nwould bring oil prices down while providing a buffer against OPEC's \nsupply manipulations. Moreover, a well-executed swaps plan could, over \ntime increase our reserve from its current level of 570 million \nbarrels, at no cost to taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, the swaps approach advocated by our amendment would \nalso give the administration leverage it has refused to bring to bear \non the OPEC cartel. Quiet diplomacy has not worked. OPEC already has \nbroken a commitment it gave to Secretary Richardson to increase \nproduction further if crude oil prices hit the levels they have reached \nover the past month. OPEC is scheduled to meet again on June 21 in \nVienna. We need to show OPEC that we will not sit idly by as the cartel \nmanipulates our markets and gouges us at the pump. The amendment \nSenator Schumer and I have offered is designed to send a strong signal \nto OPEC nations and to provide relief to the American consumer.\n  Mr. President, I am aware this amendment is subject to a procedural \npoint of order, and therefore, Senator Schumer and I will be \nwithdrawing it. Nevertheless, it is a very important issue.\n\n  I commend the Senator from New York for his leadership in working on \nthis issue for so many months. We will continue our efforts. We are \nwriting, once again, to the President, to urge him to immediately \nimplement a swap plan as proposed by our amendment.\n  For the sake of all Americans who have felt the squeeze of \nskyrocketing oil and gas prices, we sincerely hope that the time has \nfinally come for the administration to heed our call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Maine for \nher leadership and her comradeship on this issue.\n  We have been working for a long time. We are not going to rest until \nsomething is done. If what we propose is not the right course, come up \nwith some other strategy. But clearly, as the Senator says so \ncorrectly, something is not working.\n  The bottom line is simple. Last year, the Senator from Maine and I \npredicted home heating oil prices would go through the roof. We were \ntold by the Energy Department and others: Oh, no, don't worry. You are \nbeing alarmist.\n  Unfortunately, for many of our constituents and millions of Americans \nin other States, home heating oil prices went through the roof.\n  Then in the early winter, we said: Now, gasoline could go to $2 a \ngallon this summer if nothing is done. We had studied how much oil OPEC \nwas putting out. We looked at rural demand. We looked at the fact that \nour former friends, or friends who had always been helpful--Mexico and \nNorway, non-OPEC Members that expanded the supply of oil--would not \nhelp anymore.\n  They said, as the Senator from Maine indicated, let's try some quiet \ndiplomacy. We are not the fount of all wisdom. Why not?\n  On March 27, when the OPEC members met, they said they were going to \nprevent oil from going to $28 a barrel on the spot market. And if it \nwent over $28 a barrel for more than 30 days, they would release \nadditional oil and bring the price back down. In fact, they set a \nrange, not just a ceiling. There was also a floor, $22 to $28. It was \nhigh but within the bounds of being livable for the consumers in our \nStates who, if nothing was done, would pay $1,000 more each year for \ngasoline and home heating oil. That number is no different than for \nmost of the constituents of my colleagues from other States.\n\n  If we look at what Chairman Greenspan is doing in raising interest \nrates, he cites oil pressure on the economy as one of the great \nproblems we face. He said if OPEC will do this on its own, maybe that \nis a better way.\n  Oil has been above $28 for more than 30 days and the OPEC nations are \nsaying they are not going to do anything.\n  Maybe swapping SPR reserves, as we are urging in the bipartisan \nletter we are releasing today, signed by about a dozen of our \ncolleagues, as well as ourselves, is not the only way to go, but nobody \nhas presented a better alternative.\n  If we were to release a relatively modest amount of oil from the SPR, \nprices would come down, the fragile unity that OPEC has shown would be \nbroken, and there would be new cheating on OPEC's part, and the price \nwould come down further.\n\n[[Page S5175]]\n\n  We have 570 million barrels of oil sitting there. If we were to \nrelease, say, a million barrels of oil for a 45-day period, it would \nnot deplete the reserve. Figure it out using simple mathematics. It is \nless than 10 percent of the reserve. Furthermore, because the market is \nwhat is called ``backwardized,'' we could actually require that we \nwould lock in a price, that we could buy oil next April at $25 a \nbarrel. It is simple arithmetic.\n  If we sell at $31 and we can buy it back next April by buying futures \non the oil market for $25, not only do we achieve our main goal, which \nis to bring the price of oil back down and help the consumers \nthroughout the country who are paying through the nose for gasoline, we \ncould also actually make some money. The Government, for once, would be \nbehaving as a private business. That is not our goal, but that would be \na side benefit.\n  Here we are. Everything that has been said has not worked. Home \nheating oil did go through the roof. The price of gasoline is, in parts \nof the country, already above $2 a gallon. The average, as of \nyesterday, was $1.60-something in the rest of the country. And mark my \nwords, heating oil next year, if we do nothing, will be much higher \nthan it was last winter, when our constituents in the Northeast and \nMiddle West faced unprecedented home heating oil bills.\n\n  So this resolution--I wish the point of order didn't lie against it; \nit does--is what is needed. I agree with my friend and colleague from \nMaine we ought to withdraw it. But make no mistake about it; this \npolicy is the only policy left on the table. To those who say it may \nnot work--which is the only argument left. They first told us it was \nnot legal, but it was, as we proved. They had done it three times \nbefore. They told us it was unnecessary. Prices show it is necessary. \nNow they are saying it may not work. Guess what. It cannot be worse \nthan what is happening now.\n  So I strongly urge my colleagues, if they cannot vote on our \nresolution because of this point of order, to sign the letter Senator \nCollins and I have authored and continue to make our case that swapping \noil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is the best policy we have to \nbring the all-too-high cost of energy down and keep our economic \nprosperity on track.\n  With that, I will yield to the Senator from Maine to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Is the Senator from Michigan seeking to be heard on this \nresolution?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me congratulate the Senators from \nMaine and New York for this resolution. Because it is a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution which might be ruled not to be germane or appropriate \non this bill for technical or procedural reasons, I understand they \nwill be withdrawing it. I am sorry that is what they must do under our \nrules, or need to do under our rules, because this resolution of theirs \nreally addresses one of the most critical issues my constituents in \nMichigan are facing. I know the Senator's constituents in Maine are \nfacing it, and the constituents of the Senator from New York. All of \nour constituents are facing these skyrocketing prices which have no \nrational explanation--except that the oil companies have decided they \nare going to gouge us pricewise, although their own prices of oil per \nbarrel have not gone up nearly as much as have the prices that they are \ncharging us.\n  We have had two agencies of this Government that have said there is \nno logical or rational explanation for the huge increase in gas prices. \nThe Federal Trade Commission should investigate this matter. I have \nasked them to investigate this matter because of the possibility of \nanticompetitive practices on the part of the oil and gas industry. That \nis within the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission. Their \nstaff, indeed, is required to undertake that inquiry.\n  What is going on here is intolerable. It is not a reflection of the \nprice of oil per barrel. The prices at the pump have gone up far more, \nproportionally. In the absence of that kind of explanation, and in the \npresence of the kind of skyrocketing prices we are facing at the pump, \nas the Senator from Maine said--in the Midwest, in my State, now over \n$2 a gallon--I think the signal which is being sent by this resolution \nis a very important one. The letter they are sending I hope will get \nthe signatures of every Member of this body. I have already sent the \nPresident a similar letter urging the withdrawal of some oil from the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve and the later swap of oil back into that \nreserve. I intend to sign this letter again because I think the more of \nus who ask this administration to withdraw oil from the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve the better, and the more likely they would do so.\n\n  I commend the two Senators for their action. I intend to forcefully \njoin with them in their letter and to continue my own efforts, as \npreviously indicated both with the Federal Trade Commission to obtain \ntheir investigation for potential anticompetitive practices, as well as \nthe withdrawal issue by the Department of Energy, because I believe \nthat is one of the ways we can fight back against the OPEC monopoly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Michigan will yield, I commend him \nfor his remarks and also commend the Senators from Michigan and Maine \nfor what they have done and their leadership on this issue. This is a \ncritically important issue in the Midwest. It is certainly an important \nissue in the State of Illinois. I have been back to my State and I can \ntell you virtually every single group I have met with--labor, business, \neducation, ordinary families--all bring up this issue as the first \nconcern because it hits them in the pocketbook. Families trying to \ndrive back and forth to a job, small businesses that depend on the cost \nof fuel for profit--they are all concerned. I commend the Senator from \nMichigan for the comments he has made.\n  I have listened to the oil companies and their explanations about why \nthese prices have gone up, but I have to tell you they just don't wash. \nThey don't make sense. When you explore them and look to them you say: \nSure, that might account for a 2-cent increase or a 5-cent increase. \nBut in the Chicagoland area, it is not uncommon to find gasoline at \n$2.29 a gallon and higher, for the lowest cost gasoline. That does not \nexplain it away.\n  Frankly, I think the oil companies are coming up with excuses. In the \npast, they have come up with excuses and, frankly, we have to go \nfurther. I think the Senator from Michigan is correct; the Federal \nTrade Commission has a responsibility here. Next Tuesday, the chairman \nof that Commission is going to meet with the Illinois delegation to \ntalk about this. I hope they take the Senator's suggestion and go \nforward with this investigation. At this time I think we need to have \nthe oil companies in for honest answers so families and businesses \nacross America understand what is behind this.\n  I commend the Senator from Michigan, as well as the Senator from \nMaine, and all those who have shown leadership on this issue. It is \nreally a matter of the quality of life for a lot of families and \nbusinesses in the Midwest--across the Nation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Illinois for his comments. As \nalways, he has his finger on the pulse of his constituents. That is the \nNo. 1 issue with the people of Michigan at the moment, the skyrocketing \nprice of gas at the pump. There is not even a close second. This is the \nfirst, second, and third issue on the minds of the people of Michigan \nand the Midwest, and obviously other parts of the country as well. We \nhave to hold the oil companies accountable. We have to put as much \npressure on them as we can. Withdrawing oil from the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve is one of the ways in which we can fight back against \nthese skyrocketing prices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized, \nSenator Abraham.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I first thank the Senator from Maine for \nher steadfast efforts to raise these issues over a fairly lengthy \nperiod of time now. I also think we should, perhaps, review some of the \nrecent history. As my colleague from Michigan just indicated, it is \nclearly not just in Maine or Michigan but across the country, in almost \nevery part of the country, the No.\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\n1 issue on people's minds today--what it costs to fill up one's \nautomobile or sports utility vehicle with gasoline.\n  In my case, like many other fathers with young children, we have a \nminivan. When we go to the pump now, it is somewhere between $40 and \n$50 to fill up our tank. There seems to be a pattern in our region--\nMichigan, Illinois, and some of the other States in the Great Lakes--\nthat have driven the prices even higher than the national average. I \nshare the concerns my colleague from Michigan and colleague from \nIllinois have expressed with respect to why this is affecting uniquely \nour State. I have asked the Secretary of Energy to meet personally on \nthis issue to find out what insights he provides.\n  I think a few other issues need to be discussed. First, I think the \npoints that have been raised with respect to releasing some of the \npetroleum in our strategic reserve make sense. This is a way to make an \nimmediate impact, to have an immediate impact on the supply of oil \nwhich, in turn, will relate to the price. There are a lot of things we \ncan do that will have a long-term impact, but the short-term impact is \nfairly limited.\n  No. 1, we can tap the reserve. No. 2, we can suspend, as we have on \nseveral occasions tried to vote to do, the Federal gasoline taxes to \nreduce some of the costs the consumers are paying.\n  But I think there is an issue we need to talk about as well, that has \nmore of a long-term consideration to it, and that is the dependency of \nour country on foreign sources of energy. The fact is, even if you \nlevel out the prices for the Great Lakes, if the problems in our region \nwere to be resolved in such a fashion that we simply returned to the \napproximate level of the rest of the country, we would still be paying \nsubstantially higher prices than we did a year ago. There is no \nquestion the reason for that is the OPEC nations' decisions with \nrespect to supply is the cause of these higher prices. While I think we \nshould investigate whether it is the oil companies or anyone else who \nmay be taking advantage of the supply situation in some inappropriate \nway, I think we must try to wean ourselves from the dependency we have \non foreign energy sources.\n  I believe we have a responsibility as a Congress to work on issues \nrelated to this.\n  I believe the administration has a responsibility, which it has not \nfulfilled in over 7 years in office, to provide us with a long-term \nenergy policy that prevents dependency from getting any worse. In the \n1970s, when we had an energy crisis that led to lines at the fuel \npumps, that led to shortages, we were only 35-percent dependent on \nforeign energy. Today, we are 55-percent dependent. At the current \nrate, we will hit 60 percent in the near future.\n  There is no question that if we place ourselves in that position, we \nwill be at the mercy of the decisionmaking of foreign countries with \nrespect to our energy costs. I do not think we want to be in that \nposition as a nation. I do not think we want to have our Energy \nSecretary, irrespective of to which administration he or she might \nbelong, be forced to go hat in hand, as Secretary Richardson recently \nwas required to do, to persuade foreign countries to give America a \nlittle bit more of a supply. The only way to address that is to change \npolicies at home that allow for domestic production to increase that \nwill permit us to tap into alternative energy sources and to conserve \nmore energy.\n  That, I believe, ought to occupy as much attention as anything else \nwe do in this area. To address the long-term needs, in my judgment, is \nthe top energy policy on which we should right now be focused as a \nCongress and as a nation.\n  We need a multifaceted approach. In the short run, the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve can give us immediate relief on some of the prices. I \nbelieve we should, again, consider suspending the gas tax as another \nway to do that for the short run. Until and unless we demonstrate as a \nnation a commitment to increasing our own domestic production, we are \ngoing to send a signal to these other nations that they are going to \nhave the leverage they can use when they wish to make more profits for \nthemselves at our expense, and instead of American consumers being in \ncharge, it will be foreign oil ministers who make those decisions.\n  That is wrong. I intend to fight that, and I intend to be back on the \nfloor as much as it takes on these issues until we begin to focus on \nthat aspect of the problem.\n  Let's say the national average in the region--which does not include \nMichigan, Ohio, and Illinois--if that average fuel price was the price \nin my State, $1.50 to $1.60 a gallon, it would still be too high, in my \nopinion. The only way it is going to change is if we address the long-\nterm issues as well.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine for her amendment and her efforts. I \nlook forward to working with her on this issue. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3439 Withdrawn\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan. He is \nabsolutely right in that we need to pursue a long-term energy policy \nfor this Nation, as well as to provide short-term price relief by \ntapping our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  I thank all my colleagues who have supported and have spoken out in \nsupport of this resolution, but particularly my primary sponsor of the \nlegislation, Senator Schumer of New York. Since a point of order will \nlie against the amendment, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is withdrawn.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I mention this only because I know we were \nin a quorum call and, being in a quorum call, this time would not be \ntaken from the bill. The House of Representatives has passed \noverwhelmingly--I think with only four votes against it--the Electronic \nSignature Act. We will be taking it up in a matter of hours. I will \nspeak further on this on the floor today, but I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this bill.\n  A number of us worked closely--Republicans and Democrats alike--to \ncraft the final package. I was one of the conferees and signed the \nconference report--indeed I also signed and supported the earlier \nreport based on the agreement we achieved before the last recess weeks \nago. I think that it is a good piece of legislation. I think it should \npass. It includes consumer protections and balance that were lacking \nfrom the House-passed bill and builds upon the narrower provisions of \nthe Senate-passed bill to include some additional provisions regarding \nrecord retention.\n  Originally, there were some who wanted to pass a digital signature \nbill almost for the sake of passing one. Fortunately, cooler heads \nprevailed in both parties but also among the industry. I think most of \nthose in the various industries that will be affected, who want an \nelectronic signature bill, realize they have to have something that \nwould have consumer protection in it. Otherwise, we could see companies \nthat do not have a strong sense of consumer ethics misuse the bill. The \npublic reaction would be such that a subsequent Congress would wipe out \nall the gains we made.\n  What has happened now is we have written in good protections. The \nbest companies, those companies that value their reputation and are in \nfor the long haul, will follow these rules without any hesitation. But \ncompanies that may think of this as a chance to make profits--sudden \nprofits--from people who are not computer literate, people who are just \ncoming across the digital divide, they will be stopped from preying on \nthe innocent.\n  I think it is a good piece of legislation, as I said. A number of us, \nRepublicans and Democrats, worked very hard on this. Now we do have a \ngood bill. In the Senate, Chairman McCain and Senator Hollings, Senator \nHatch and I and Senator Gramm and Senator\n\n[[Page S5177]]\n\nSarbanes all participated in this conference, and from the House, \nChairman Bliley and Congressman Dingell, worked to put this together. \nOn our side Senator Wyden made significant contributions, as well.\n  I urge, when this does come to the Senate floor, that it be passed, I \nhope unanimously.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I renew my request for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the amendment that was just reported at \nthe desk is an amendment that is cosponsored by myself, Senator \nVoinovich, Senator Grams, and Senator Enzi. I do want to take the time \nto thank them for their willingness to be a part of this very important \neffort to try to pay down our Nation's debt. We have two debts that are \nreferred to frequently in debate, and I want to talk about each one of \nthem individually. One is the burden of the national debt on America, \nand, as of June 14, 2000, the total national debt to the penny was \n$5,651,368,584,663.04.\n  If we look at the debt that was owed to the public, there is an \nequally astounding figure of $3,499,251,116,128.15.\n  How does this break down to each citizen's share of the national \ndebt? If you were born today, what kind of debt would you have to face \nas you grew and paid for your education and started your own business \nand raised your family? Each citizen born today in America would owe \n$20,550 on the national debt; or another way of putting it, $12,724 on \nthe debt owed to the public.\n  In 1961, Congress established within the Department of the Treasury \nthe Bureau of the Public Debt, an account for citizens to repay the \npublic debt. Our amendment is an attempt to accomplish just that. What \nit does, it makes a one-time payment out of the fiscal year 2000 \nsurplus--that is the budget we are operating under right now--to the \naccount. We have a total of about 26.5 billion surplus dollars that \nhave come in this year. We have already obligated about $14.3 billion \nin an effort for emergency spending.\n  This includes some adjustments between spending provisions we did \nlast year where we forwarded some of our spending. We are going to move \nit back so it is within each fiscal year. It included some emergency \nspending for Kosovo and some emergency spending for farm programs and a \nnumber of other items. That leaves $12.2 billion on the table. So this \namendment says we want to take those $12.2 billion and move them into \nthe debt repayment account that Americans can pay into now, that we \nestablished in 1961.\n\n  This holds the Senate accountable for limited emergency supplemental \nspending consistent with the budget, I might add. I think each of us \nindividually in the Senate, and Members of the House, ought to make a \npersonal commitment to try to enforce provisions of that budget. That \nwas voted on by this body, voted out of the body. If it is going to \nmean anything, I think Members of the Senate have to make a concerted \neffort to help enforce the provisions of the budget.\n  The amendment I have introduced, with the help of some of my \ncolleagues, was scored by CBO as a no-cost intergovernmental transfer. \nIt is well within the budget rules, the rules of the Senate, and it is \nan important amendment. It is something we need to address. We simply \nhave to get the debt under control. I have introduced legislation in \nthe past that has put forth a plan whereby we try to pay down the debt \nover 30 years, then, later on, introduced more legislation so we go \nahead and pay down the debt over 20 years.\n  The fact is, we are having unprecedented surpluses coming in to the \nGovernment coffers. A lot of it is because of the amount of work and \nlabor that is happening out there. It is due to American initiative \nthat has been propelled by the free enterprise society in which we \nlive. It is unprecedented in the history of this country.\n  If we do not do something to pay down the debt now, we are going to \nmiss a great opportunity to have a secure, a more prosperous future for \nthe young Americans of today, our future leaders.\n  I hope we can adopt this amendment as a minor first step in paying \ndown our total debt. We simply should not, as a matter of conscience, \ncontinue to increase spending year after year with a total disregard of \nthe total debt that we have accumulated. We simply need to be doing \nsomething to pay down our national debt.\n  This is a small step. It is something that hopefully will begin to \nget this Senate to understand and this Congress to realize we ought to \nhave a plan of 20 years to pay down the debt. It is accountability on \nfurther emergency spending. Emergency spending is not counted in the \nbudget caps and the 302(b) allocations, and too often this spending \nprivilege is abused. Members of the House and Senate try to put \nprograms which they cannot put in the regular budget resolution when \nthis Congress sets its priorities under the emergency spending \nprograms. We need to do what we can to maintain the integrity of that \nbudget resolution because it is the one that puts restraint on spending \nand puts accountability in the budgeting process.\n  As I mentioned before, CBO has scored this as a no-cost transfer. It \nis important, and it is money that is left laying on the table. At this \npoint in time, I really believe there are few choices of what will \nhappen with the $12.2 billion. It will either go toward debt repayment, \nor it will be spent. I am concerned it will be spent.\n  I have introduced this legislation to obligate it towards debt \nrepayment. It is important. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport us in the effort to pay down the debt, and I ask them to vote \naye to support this amendment to pay down the debt. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, my colleague from the State of Colorado \ndid a very good job outlining for us how important it is that we \naddress our national debt. There is a euphoria in America today over \nthe fact that we have a tremendous surplus. Unfortunately, the fact \nthat we have a surplus reminds me of a Dean Martin song that went \nsomething like ``Money burns a hole in my pocket.'' Everyone is trying\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\nto figure out how to spend this money. No one seems to be making an \nissue of the fact that today we have a $5.7 trillion national debt \nwhich is costing Americans approximately $600 million a day in \ninterest.\n  Most Americans do not understand that 13 cents out of every Federal \ndollar we spend goes to pay interest. National defense gets 16 cents \nper dollar. Nondefense discretionary spending is 18 cents per dollar. \nThey do not understand that we are spending more money on interest each \nyear than we spend on Medicare, five times as much on interest as we do \nfor education, and 15 times more than we spend on medical research.\n  This debt was racked up over a number of years. At a time when our \neconomy is better than it has ever been before, when unemployment is at \nthe lowest we have seen in anyone's memory, we should do like you, Mr. \nPresident, would do in your family and I would do in my family, or what \na business person would do, and that is, in times of plenty, get rid of \ndebt, get out from under debt.\n  We have an excellent opportunity to do that. Because of the expanding \neconomy, we have a $26 billion on-budget surplus in fiscal year 2000. \nThink of that, $26 billion. We already allocated $14 billion of that \non-budget surplus when we passed the budget resolution to deal with \nwhat I consider to be, for the most part, emergency situations.\n  In order to guarantee we do not spend the rest of that money, we need \nto stand up and be counted and pay more than lipservice to reducing our \nnational debt. We need to pass legislation that says the remaining on-\nbudget surplus, this $12.2 billion, is to be used to pay down the \nnational debt. It is something that all of us should think about as \nbeing a moral responsibility.\n  One of the reasons I came to the Senate, was the fact that I believed \nwe had spent money over the years on many things that, while important, \nwe were unwilling to pay for, or, in the alternative, do without. We \nhad a policy of ``let the next guy worry about it''; ``let the next \ngeneration worry about it.''\n  When I came to the Senate, I had one grandchild. Today, I have two \nmore. Like all other Americans, I think about my grandchildren and \nabout the legacy I want to leave to them. I remember a long time ago, \nalmost 38 years ago, when my wife Janet and I got married. At that \ntime, only 6 cents out of every dollar was going to pay interest on our \ndebt. Think of it. Today it has gone up over 100 percent.\n  I think about the legacy we are leaving our children, and Congress, \nduring this wonderful time of a great economy, with a low unemployment \nrate, should take advantage of this opportunity to take our on-budget \nsurplus and pay down our national debt and get this burden off the \nbacks of the young people in our country; off the backs of our children \nand off the backs of our grandchildren.\n  The other thing we need to point out to the American people is \nsomething we have kept kind of a secret. It is a secret about which \nnobody is talking; it has been kept quiet, and that secret is we have \nbeen spending money like drunken sailors.\n  In fiscal year 1998, we spent $555 billion on discretionary spending. \nThat is before I came to the Senate. In fiscal year 1999 we increased \nspending to $575 billion.\n  In this year's budget, if we spend the entire on-budget surplus, \ndiscretionary spending will be $624 billion. Think about it, $624 \nbillion, compared to last year's $575 billion. If my figures are \ncorrect, that is an 8.5-percent increase in discretionary spending.\n  I want to know how many people in this country had an 8.5-percent \nincrease in their paycheck last year. Why is it that the Federal \nGovernment is different than most of the families in this Nation? \nFamilies should understand, the citizens of this country should \nunderstand, if we spend all of this money--and it looks like we could--\nand if we do not adopt this amendment that we are suggesting be adopted \ntoday, we will have increased spending by 8.5 percent.\n  It is time for this Congress to be willing to make tough decisions. \nThe cynicism that I hear so often is: We need the money to get out of \ntown.\n  We need to talk about our kids. We need to talk about this national \ndebt. We need to talk about the moral responsibility that we have to \nAmerica's families.\n  We are not asking for a lot here today. We are asking that this body \nstand up and be counted. I hear people every day talking about: Let's \ndo something about the national debt. It is a problem. We should do it.\n  Reducing the national debt has been a principle of my party. It has \nbeen a principle of mine throughout my political career. First of all, \ndon't go into debt. If you are in debt, get rid of it.\n  Here is a chance to stand up and put our actions where our mouths \nare, and say, yes, we do believe in reducing the national debt. We are \ngoing to take this money, put it aside, and pay down the national debt, \nand we are going to do it now. We are going to do it now because we \nknow if we do not do it now, the temptation will be to spend every dime \nof it.\n  One other thing we ought to remember; and that is, in July CBO will \nbe coming back with some new numbers and the on-budget surplus will be \neven higher, perhaps maybe $20 billion, $25 billion more. The question \nis, What are we going to do with that on-budget surplus? Are we going \nto keep that around so we can get out of town?\n  It is time to make the tough decisions. It is time to stand up and be \ncounted.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I, again, thank my colleague from Ohio, Senator \nVoinovich, for his undying effort and diligent fight to pay down the \ndebt. It is good to have somebody with that kind of persistence and \nbulldog attitude to be a team player on a very important issue such as \nthis. I just want to commend him in a public way for his efforts.\n  I do not see any other Senators on the floor wanting to debate this \nissue. I yield the floor so the Senator from Oregon can be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Objection.\n  Mr. President, was there a unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3433.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 45, line 23, before the period at the end insert \n     the following: ``: Provided, That the funds made available \n     under this heading shall be used by the Inspector General (1) \n     to continue to review airline customer service practices with \n     respect to providing consumers access to the lowest available \n     airfare, information regarding overbooking, and all other \n     matters with respect to which airlines have entered into \n     voluntary customer service commitments; (2) to undertake an \n     inquiry into whether mergers in the airline industry have \n     caused or may cause customer service to deteriorate and \n     whether legislation should be enacted to require that \n     customer service be a factor in the merger review process for \n     airlines; (3) to review the reasons for increases in flight \n     delays, with specific reference to whether infrastructure \n     issues or procedures utilized by the airline industry and the \n     Federal Aviation Administration are contributing to the \n     delays; (4) to review the airline ticket distribution system, \n     and changes in the system, including\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\n     the proposed Internet joint venture known as `Orbitz' and the \n     impact such changes may have on airline competition and \n     consumers; (5) to review whether `Orbitz' would be, or should \n     be, subject to Department of Transportation regulations on \n     airline ticket computer reservation systems; and (6) to \n     report findings and recommendations for reform resulting from \n     these reviews and inquiries to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives, the Committee on Commerce, Science and \n     Transportation of the Senate, and the Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of \n     Representatives by December 31, 2000, and again thereafter \n     when the Inspector General determines it appropriate to \n     reflect the emergence of significant additional findings and \n     recommendations''.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, almost a year ago, this country's airlines \nmade a grand announcement about a new, although albeit voluntary, \ncommitment to the rights of airline passengers.\n  I tend to look with a very skeptical eye at any promise to consumers \nthat contains the notion of both ``voluntary'' and ``rights'' together \nin the same sentence.\n  Now, 1 year later, my conversations with Federal investigators about \nthe work they have done, at the Senate's request, leaves me to be even \nmore skeptical of what the airlines have promised.\n  What I have learned from Federal investigators is that there are more \nquestions than answers about the quality of airline customer service, \nflight delays, and the airline ticket distribution system.\n  Frankly, as I said a year ago, the evidence indicates that the \nairlines' so-called customer first package has proven to be worth \nlittle more than the paper it was written on.\n  In fact, just recently, in the last few months, the Washington Post \nBusiness Section had a headline that said: ``Airline Service Dips n 3 \nof 4 Categories.'' They went on to describe what can only be \ncategorized as a pretty bumpy operation with respect to guaranteeing \nthe rights of passengers in this country.\n  I will take just a few minutes to outline what I think the central \nproblems are, and what I have learned from Federal investigators about \ntheir work. Then I hope the Senate will support my amendment on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  First, after a year of trying to get the airlines to be straight with \nthe American consumer with respect to finding the lowest fare available \non a particular flight, I can report that finding the lowest airfare \nremains one of the great mysteries of our time.\n  On any given flight, there may be as many different fares paid as \nthere are passengers on the plane. Finding out if the flight you want \nto take is overbooked is sort of like playing hide and seek. First, you \nhave to know what to ask for. Then you need to know the difference \nbetween a flight that is oversold and a flight that is overbooked. \nSuffice it to say, there seem to be a fair number of people in the \nindustry who can hardly explain that difference.\n  When I first called for the passage of a real, enforceable passenger \nbill of rights for airline consumers, I made it very clear to the \nSenate that I was not talking about establishing a constitutional right \nto a fluffy pillow on your airplane flight. I was not talking about \nfolks being entitled to a jumbo bag of peanuts. What I was talking \nabout has the public's right to know, the public's right to know \ninformation about basic services, just as they do in every other area \nof our economy.\n  In every other area of the economy, such as when you have a \nreservation for a particular item or you want to find out about how it \nis priced, you can get that information. You can get it whether it is \non the telephone, at the counter, online, or through a variety of \nintermediaries. And you are told, in straightforward kinds of terms, \nthe real reasons behind these scheduling arrangements, and prices, and \nthe kind of information that is so relevant to the consumer.\n  That is not what is happening today in the airline industry, despite \nthe grandiose pledges from folks in the industry.\n  For example, the annual survey by leading scholars at Wichita State \nwho have been doing these surveys for many years came out in April and \nfound that consumer complaints on air travel in 1999 were up 130 \npercent over the previous year. That study showed that 7 out of 10 \nairlines posted lower quality ratings than they did in the previous \nyear.\n  Earlier this year, the Department of Transportation consumer division \nreported that the number of complaints they had received was about \ndouble that of the previous year. The complaints were up and the \nratings were down after the airlines had pledged to the Congress to do \nbetter.\n  Suffice it to say, these professors at Wichita State are not airline \nindustry bashers. These are individuals who, by their own description, \ntake a very conservative orientation to these issues. Yet they found \nthat in virtually every important area of consumer service, there had \nactually been a deterioration in the quality of service to airline \npassengers during this period since the airlines' so-called customer \nfirst pledge went into effect.\n  When the industry's Air Transport Association reported recently that \ncustomer satisfaction was at an all-time high, many of us struggled to \nfind out to whom exactly they were talking. They weren't talking to the \nfolks I sit next to on an airplane or the people I meet in ticket lines \nat home in Oregon or around the Pacific Northwest.\n  I can understand the inclination of the Senate to give the airlines \nsome time to try to make their voluntary program work. I got my head \nhanded to me when we had the vote in the Commerce Committee and it was \n19-1 with respect to airline passenger rights. I respected that. Given \nthe results in the Commerce Committee, I decided we ought to try to do \nsome followup and offered several amendments that were accepted as part \nof this appropriations bill in the last year. I believed it was \nimportant to continue to monitor the situation to see if we would get \nany improvements since the industry's pledges went into effect.\n  What we adopted in the last appropriations bill was part of the final \nlaw. It was binding, and it gave the Transportation Department \ninspector general a statutory mandate to look at whether airlines are \ngiving customers access to the lowest fares no matter what technology \nthey used to contact the airline. It is outrageous to know that even \ntoday airline passengers can be quoted one price over the telephone and \nyet a much lower fare is available to them on the Internet and they \naren't given that kind of information. The Department of Transportation \ninspector general was directed in the last appropriations bill to \ninvestigate that issue and, in addition, to make sure we monitor this \nquestion of the lowest fare.\n  We directed the inspector general to tell us about overbookings of \nflights--again, a right-to-know context. I have no problem with an \nairline selling a ticket to a passenger on a flight that is overbooked, \nif the consumer is told that the flight is overbooked at the time they \nare going to make the purchase. It is fairly straightforward; it is \ninformed consent. We have found that has not been done.\n  The Department of Transportation inspector general is also looking at \na new scheme the airlines have cooked up known as T-2. It is our \nunderstanding this is a new online pool of airfares where nearly all of \nthe major air carriers will offer their lowest fares but which will not \nbe accessible to those who offer travel services.\n  In a few weeks, the inspector general of the Department of \nTransportation is going to issue an interim report on the airlines' \ncustomer service commitment plans. What I have heard about this report \nis that the airlines are coming up short, and seriously so, with \nrespect to following up on the commitments they made to the Congress.\n  For example, recent weather delays at Chicago's O'Hare Airport \nresulted in numerous planes being stranded on the runways for periods \nof 3 hours or more and as long as 8 hours. The Presiding Officer must \nhave heard from some of his constituents on that matter. I happen to \nhave been on the flight that was going from Chicago to Portland where \nsome of those folks had been on the flight that had been stranded in \nChicago. They told me all they had received during this extended wait \nwas granola bars and almost no information at all about the options \nthey had.\n  A recent power failure at National Airport in the Nation's Capital \nstranded scores of passengers without any accommodations or emergency \nprovisions. Again, we have the consumer complaints pouring into the \nDepartment of Transportation at record levels\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\neach month of this year, after the airline industry's voluntary pledge \nwent into effect. This notion from the airline industry that they just \nneed more time, give them a little bit more opportunity to make this \nso-called voluntary program work, is contradicted by what we have seen \neach month since the so-called voluntary pledges went into effect.\n  The customer service commitments don't even address one of the most \nfrustrating areas of air travel; that is, the fundamental underlying \nissue of delays and what the airlines and the FDA will do to combat \nthem.\n  It is important that we get the Department of Transportation interim \nreport. It is going to offer the American people an unbiased view of \nexactly how well airlines are treating passengers. It is going to give \nus an independent assessment of these so-called voluntary passenger \ncommitments.\n  I believe what this report is going to show is that the pledges the \nairline industry made are in effect a kind of cosmetic program to try \nto keep the Senate from enacting real passenger rights that are \nenforceable and truly protect the American public. I suspect what we \nwill hear from the inspector general will be a blueprint for \nenforceable concrete legislation that protects the rights of \npassengers.\n  What the Senate ought to be doing is keeping the airlines' feet to \nthe fire. That is why I am offering an amendment to this year's \nDepartment of Transportation appropriations bill that would instruct \nthe Department of Transportation IG to continue his fact finding and \ninformation gathering in key areas that are so important to the public. \nI am talking about whether these customer service practices amount to \nanything, getting the public straight information on the lowest \navailable fare, information about overbooking.\n  Importantly, for the first time the Senate would direct the \nDepartment of Transportation IG to look at the question of whether \nmergers in the airline industry are causing customer service to \ndeteriorate. We ought to be looking at that issue. We ought to be \nlooking at whether legislation should be enacted to require that \ncustomer service be a factor in granting an airline merger in this \ncountry. We have all heard so much about these airline mergers. We are \nhaving a lot of problems with customer service today. We ought to be \nlooking at the ramifications these mergers are having on the quality of \nairline service in this country.\n  I am particularly interested in knowing whether the Senate, on a \nbipartisan basis, should write a law that would stipulate whether or \nnot customer service ought to be a factor in the merger review process. \nIn addition, this amendment would review the reasons for increases in \nflight delay. We have had some folks say it is the FAA's fault. We have \nhad other folks say that it is the airline industry's fault. I think \nthe Department of Transportation IG ought to dig into that issue. My \namendment also requires a review of the airline ticket distribution \nsystem that I mentioned earlier involving T-2. Suffice it to say that \nthere are a number of questions there about whether that is \ncontributing to problems that consumers are having.\n  The bottom line is, will the Senate keep the airlines' feet to the \nfire? Are we going to have the Department of Transportation continue in \nthis investigative effort to try to at least put some kind of \ncollective focus by the Senate on how important it is to improve \npassenger service? We have all heard from constituents, at a time when \nthe airlines are, in many instances, making great profits, about why it \nis that some of that money can't be devoted to improving passenger \nservice.\n  I am not going to go through all of the recent news stories but just \na few of the headlines. The Washington Post headline is ``Airline \nService Dips In 3 of 4 Categories.'' The Los Angeles Times headline is \n``Air Passengers `Fed Up' With Poor Service, Survey Finds.'' They go on \nto cite the fact that ``Consumer complaints against airlines have more \nthan doubled from last year.''\n  In conjunction with the recommendations we are getting from the \nDepartment of Transportation's IG and their leading official, who I \nthink does a superlative job in this area, I would like to see the \nSenate working with the Transportation inspector general to keep the \nfocus on trying to force these airlines to improve the quality of \npassenger service to the people of this country.\n  I have just been informed by the staff that Chairman McCain and \nSenator Hollings and Senator Rockefeller would be willing to join me \ntoday in committing to send a letter asking the Department of \nTransportation inspector general to investigate and report to the \ncommittee on the issues that are the subject of my amendment. So that \nthe record is clear, Chairman McCain, Senator Hollings, and Senator \nRockefeller--and they are all the leaders of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee and spend many hours looking into these issues--have all \nasked that they join me in a letter to the Department of Transportation \ninspector general inquiring into the issues that are the subject of my \namendment.\n  The fact that we are getting the bipartisan leadership of our \ncommittee behind this effort is very important. It is certainly \nimportant to me because all of them have great expertise regarding this \nissue. My inclination, frankly, is to have a vote on this amendment on \nthe floor of the Senate to send the strongest possible message. But I \nnote that Senator Rockefeller cannot be present today. He has done \nextremely good and important work on a whole host of aviation issues, \nincluding the air traffic control system. As a member of the Commerce \nCommittee and the Aviation Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over \nthese issues, I am going to agree this afternoon, on the basis of the \nfact that we will now have a bipartisan letter sent to the inspector \ngeneral by the bipartisan leadership of the Commerce Committee \ndirecting that the IG look into all of the issues outlined in my \namendment, to withdraw my amendment.\n  But I want to make it clear to people in the airline industry and the \npassengers that are so frustrated by these delays that this fight is \ngoing to continue. It is not being dropped. In fact, we are expanding \nit. As I mentioned, we are going to look, for the first time in recent \nyears, at the ramifications of mergers on customer service. I happen to \nbelieve very strongly that mergers and customer service are \ninextricably linked. I think we ought to change the law and stipulate \nthat one of the criteria on whether or not an airline merger ought to \ngo forward is customer service.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3433, Withdrawn\n\n  I note the absence of Senator Rockefeller, who believes strongly in \nthis. Chairman McCain and the ranking Democrat, Senator Hollings, have \nboth done very important work on aviation issues. They have pledged to \njoin with me in directing the Department of Transportation inspector \ngeneral to investigate these issues. In view of that announcement that \nis being made today, and in view of the bipartisan support for the \nDepartment of Transportation looking into these issues, I ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw my amendment this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have two \narticles printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Apr. 11, 2000]\n\n       Air Passengers ``Fed Up'' With Poor Service, Survey Finds\n\n                        (By Randolph E. Schmid)\n\n       Washington.--U.S. airlines spent a lot of time last year \n     promising things would get better for their customers, but a \n     new study suggests just the opposite occurred: Consumer \n     complaints more than doubled.\n       ``You can see that consumers are just fed up, fed up with \n     poor service,'' Brent Bowen of the University of Nebraska at \n     Omaha said in announcing the survey results Monday.\n       Consumer complaints were up 130% from 1998 to 1999, said \n     Dean Headley of Wichita State University. They rose from 1.08 \n     complaints per 100,000 passengers in 1998 to 2.48 per 100,000 \n     last year.\n       Headley noted that improved Internet access made it easier \n     to file complaints, but said that could not account for such \n     a large increase.\n       The annual report, based on data collected by the \n     Transportation Department, scores the air carriers on on-time \n     performance, baggage handling, consumer complaints and denied \n     boardings.\n       It found an overall decline in airline quality last year, \n     with only baggage handling showing a slight improvement.\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\n       The airlines instituted a consumer bill of rights in \n     December, after a year of pressure from Congress to improve \n     service. A report to Congress by the Transportation \n     Department's inspector general on how they are doing is \n     scheduled for June.\n       Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who pressed for legislation last \n     year, said that if the upcoming report ``shows anything \n     resembling what this study shows, I think we can get a real \n     passenger bill of rights through Congress.''\n       ``The report demonstrates that the airlines are not \n     following through on the voluntary program,'' he said. \n     ``They, of course, claim that it's early and they have just \n     begun it . . . but this is an industry that again and again \n     finds reasons to give passenger service short shrift.''\n       Diana Cronan of the Air Transport Assn., which represents \n     the major airlines, noted that the airlines' voluntary \n     ``customer first'' plan was not put into effect until the end \n     of the year.\n       ``We really would like to see the results next year when \n     the plan has been in place for a full year. We really do \n     believe that things will be better,'' she said.\n       Southwest Airlines ranked best overall, as it did in 1997. \n     In 1998, the top spot went to USAirways, which fell to No. 6 \n     in the new report.\n       This year, Continental finished second, followed by Delta, \n     Northwest and Alaska Airlines. American was No. 7, followed \n     by America West, TWA and United.\n       The report's only good news involved baggage handling. The \n     study found that the industry mishandled 5.08 bags per 1,000 \n     passengers in 1999, down from 5.16 per 1,000 a year earlier.\n       On the other hand, there was a drop in the portion of \n     flights that arrived within 15 minutes of schedule. On-time \n     performance slipped from 77.2% to 76.1% and denied \n     boardings was virtually stable, edging from 0.87 per \n     10,000 passengers to 0.88.\n       The study was particularly critical of airlines for \n     instituting what they called a series of anti-consumer rules \n     designed to increase productivity.\n       These include tighter limits on carry-on bags, bans on \n     carry-on food, not allowing a consumer to take an earlier \n     connection when a seat is available and raising fees to \n     change tickets.\n       ``Soon, consumers will become driven by price and schedule \n     only and regard airline loyalty as having no tangible \n     value,'' the author concluded.\n       The Transportation Department, which independently reports \n     on airline performance, found similar problems through \n     February.\n       Consumers registered 1,999 complaints about the 10 largest \n     carriers in February, slightly down from January but nearly \n     double a year earlier.\n       It found that 74.8% of flights arrived on time in \n     February--also slightly better than in January but not as \n     good as 78.9% in February 1999.\n       The airlines had a mishandled baggage rate of 4.81 reports \n     per 1,000 passengers in February, an improvement from a year \n     earlier.\n       Headley acknowledged the new passenger bill of rights \n     instituted by airlines late last year and allowed that change \n     does take time. But, he argued, the steps promised by the \n     airlines were things they should have been doing already.\n       The carriers pledged to be more forthright with passengers \n     all the way through their travel experience. They promised to \n     volunteer the lowest air fares or cheaper travel options when \n     people call for reservations and to give passengers at least \n     24 hours to cancel ticket purchases.\n       They also said they would update passengers at 15- to 20-\n     minute intervals when there are delays.\n\n                        Airline Complaints Soar\n\n       Airline quality declined in 1999 despite efforts by the \n     carriers to improve service. The 10 major U.S. airlines \n     carried nearly 500 million domestic airline passengers in \n     1999. The volume of consumer complaints rose 130% over 1998. \n     Although improved reporting may account for some of the \n     increase, it does not account for all of it.

The numbers speak for \n     themselves,'' said US Airways spokesman Richard Weintraub. He \n     said government statistics since the start of the year \n     indicate that the airline is now headed back into the ``top \n     tier'' of airline service.\n       The survey--the Airline Quality Rating--is the 10th annual \n     report by two university professors who track the level of \n     service through government statistics gathered by the \n     Department of Transportation.\n       The findings were based on an airline's on-time \n     performance, baggage handling, consumer complaints and \n     involuntarily denied boardings, such as when an airline \n     overbooks a flight and forces some passengers to be denied \n     seats for which they had already paid. The only improvement \n     shown by the survey was a slight drop in complaints about \n     baggage handling.\n       The survey tracked the statistics for 10 major airlines \n     using the Department of Transportation's definition of \n     ``major.'' The airlines, rated from best to worst, were: \n     Southwest, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Alaska, US Airways, \n     American, American West, TWA and United.\n       ``We try to base this on pure performance, something the \n     airline has some control over,'' said Dean Headley of Wichita \n     State University and a coauthor of the survey with Brent \n     Bowen, director of the Aviation Institute at the University \n     of Nebraska in Omaha.\n       Headley said he was not surprised by the survey results, \n     but that he was frustrated by the rise in complaints against \n     the airlines, especially after they had all promised to \n     improve service. He said the Internet has made it easier for \n     people to complain but could not account for such a large \n     increase in the number of complaints--up 130 percent between \n     1998 and 1999.\n       In December, after nearly a year of promising to improve \n     service in the face of rising consumer complaints and \n     congressional threats, the airlines adopted what they called \n     a consumer bill of rights in an effort to head off threatened \n     government intervention on behalf of passengers. That threat \n     began in January 1999, when Northwest stranded a planeload of \n     passengers on a snowy Detroit runway for nearly eight hours.\n       Nebraska's Bowen said the report's conclusion that overall \n     industry quality continues to decline indicates that ``the \n     entire airline-sponsored plan to increase customer services \n     is failing.''\n       A spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association, the trade \n     group that represents the airlines, said the voluntary bill \n     of rights initiated by the airlines has only been in effect a \n     few months. She said the airlines' new policy should be in \n     place a full year before people judge whether service has \n     improved.\n       The transportation department's inspector general is \n     scheduled to issue a report to Congress in June on just how \n     well the airlines are doing. A negative report from DOT in an \n     election year is almost certain to rekindle calls for \n     congressional action.\n       Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), an advocate of legislation to \n     force better service from the airlines, said that if the \n     inspector general's report mirrors the conclusions of \n     yesterday's study, ``it really strengthens my hand.'' Wyden \n     said yesterday's survey ``was a credible report because these \n     fellows have been doing it a long time and they are not \n     normally industry bashers.''\n       Last year, Wyden proposed a bill that would force the \n     airlines to tell customers when a flight was overbooked and \n     to give them information on all available fares on a specific \n     flight. The bill would also allow passengers to get a refund \n     if they canceled a ticket at least 48 hours before a flight.\n       Headley and Bowen concluded that unless airlines improve \n     service, consumers will lose loyalty to individual carriers \n     and ``become driven by price and schedule only.''\n       But Headley said that despite his concerns about \n     deteriorating air service, he did not think setting industry \n     service standards was the answer. ``I'm a big fan of not \n     regulating if we can avoid it,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, today is a very special anniversary. One \nwill not find it noted on most calendars. Although it lacks the \nfamiliarity of the anniversary of the writing of the Constitution, for \nexample, it is a day well worth remembering. The 15th day of this month \ndeserves our attention for one very fundamental reason which is quite \nimportant to this Republic and to those of us in this Chamber. It marks \nthe birth of the idea that ours is a government of laws and not of men, \nand that no man, no man is above the law.\n  Seven hundred and eighty-five years ago, on June 15, 1215, English \nbarons met on the plains of Runnymede, on the Thames River near Windsor \nCastle, to present a list of demands to their king. King John had \nrecently engaged in a series of costly and disastrous military \nadventures against France. These operations had drained the royal \ntreasury and forced King John to receive the barons' list of demands. \nThese demands--known as the Articles of the Barons--were intended as a \nrestatement of ancient baronial liberties, as a limitation on the \nking's power to raise funds, and as a reassertion of the principle of \ndue process under law, at that time referred to in these words, ``law \nof the land.'' Under great pressure, King John accepted the barons' \ndemands on June 15 and set his royal seal to their set of stipulations. \nFour days later, the king and barons agreed on a formal version of that \ndocument. It is that version that we know today as Magna Carta. \nThirteen copies were made and distributed to every English county to be \nread to all freemen. Four of those copies survive today.\n  Several of this ancient document's sixty-three clauses are of \ntowering importance to our system of government. The thirty-ninth \nclause, evident in the U.S. Constitution's Fifth and Fourteenth \namendments, underscores the vital importance of the rule of law and due \nprocess of law. It reads ``No freeman shall be captured or imprisoned . \n. . except by lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.''\n  Beginning with Henry III, the nine-year-old who succeeded King John \nin 1216, English kings reaffirmed Magna Carta many times, and in 1297 \nunder Edward I it became a fundamental part of English law in the \nconfirmation of the charters. (An original of the 1297 edition is on \nindefinite loan from the Perot Foundation and is displayed in the \nrotunda of the National Archives.) In 1368, that would have been under \nthe reign of Edward III, a statute of Edward III established the \nsupremacy of Magna Carta by requiring that it ``be holden and kept in \nall Points; and if there be any Statute made to the contrary, it shall \nbe holden for none.''\n  In the early 1600s, the jurist and parliamentary leader Sir Edward \nCoke interpreted Magna Carta as an instrument of human liberty, and in \ndoing so, made it a weapon in the parliamentary struggle against the \ngathering absolutism of the Stuart monarchy. As he proclaimed to \nParliament in 1628, ``Magna Carta will have no sovereign.'' Unless \nEnglishmen insist on their rights, another observed, ``then farewell \nParliaments and farewell England.''\n  By the end of that century, through the course of civil war and the \nGlorious Revolution, the rights of self-government, first acknowledged \nin 1215, became firmly secured.\n  As settlers began their migration to England's colonies throughout \nthe seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, they took with them an \nunderstanding of their laws and liberties as Englishmen. Magna Carta \ninspired William Penn as he shaped Pennsylvania's charter of \ngovernment. Members of the colonial Stamp Act Congress in 1765 \ninterpreted Magna Carta to secure the right to jury trials.\n  After the colonies declared their independence of Great Britain, many \nof their new state constitutions carried bills of rights derived from \nthe 1215 charter, Magna Carta. As University of Virginia law professor \nA.E. Dick Howard notes in his classic study of the subject, by the \ntwentieth century, Magna Carta had become ``irrevocably embedded into \nthe fabric of American constitutionalism, both by contributing specific \nconcepts such as due process of law and by being the ultimate symbol of \nconstitutional government under a rule of law.''\n\n  In 1975, the British Parliament offered Congress and the American \npeople a most generous gift. To celebrate two hundred years of American \nindependence from Great Britain, Parliament offered to loan one of \nMagna Carta's four surviving copies to the United States Congress for a \nyear. The document they selected is known as the Wymes copy and is \nregularly displayed in the British Library. Parliament also made a \npermanent gift of a magnificent display case bearing a gold replica of \nMagna Carta.\n  A delegation of Senators and Representatives traveled to London in \nMay 1976 to receive that document at a colorful and thronged ceremony \nin Westminster Hall. On June 3, 1976, a distinguished delegation of \nparliamentary officials joined their American counterparts for a gala \nceremony in the Capitol Rotunda. The display case containing Magna \nCarta was placed near the Rotunda's center, where, over the following \nyear, more than five million visitors had the rare opportunity to view \nthis fundamental charter at close range.\n  At a June 13, 1977, ceremony concluding the exhibit, I offered brief \nremarks in my capacity as Senate Majority Leader. I noted that nothing \nduring the previous bicentennial year had meant more to the nation than \nthis gift. I recalled the Lord Chancellor's diplomatic interpretation, \nduring the 1976 ceremony, of the reasons for the bicentennial \ncelebrations. This is what he said:\n\n       What happened two hundred years ago, we learned, was not a \n     victory by the American colonies over Britain but rather a \n     joint victory for freedom by the English-speaking world.\n\n  Today, the magnificent display case remains in the Capitol Rotunda as \na reminder of our two nations' joint political heritage. I encourage my \ncolleagues to visit this case in the rotunda and examine its panel with \nraised gold text duplicating that of Magna Carta. What better way could \nwe choose to observe this very special anniversary day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/15/senate-section/article/S5182-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5182-S5186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                            2001--Continued\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3441, 3443, 3445, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Those amendments have been cleared on both sides. I urge \nthe adoption of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3441, 3443, 3445) were agreed to en bloc.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3441\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple and straight \nforward. It prevents Department of Transportation officials from \nauthorizing project approvals or advance construction authority for the \nCentral Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project in Boston, Massachusetts, \nuntil the Secretary and the State have entered into a written agreement \ncapping the federal contribution to the project.\n  Mr. President, last month I chaired a four-hour hearing in the Senate \nCommerce Committee on the Boston Central Artery/Tunnel project--the \nbiggest, most costly public works project in U.S. history--and commonly \nreferred to as ``the Big Dig.'' This project has suffered from gross \nmismanagement and what appears to have been a complete lack of critical \nfederal oversight. It has experienced billions of dollars in cost \noverruns.\n  The Central/Artery Tunnel project was originally estimated to cost \n$2.5 billion in 1985. Today it is estimated to cost U.S. taxpayers a \nstaggering $13.6 billion.\n  During the Committee's hearing, there was a lengthy exchange between \nmyself, Senator Kerry, Secretary Slater, and DOT-Inspector General Ken \nMead concerning the federal obligation to this project. I argued then, \nas I do now, that there is no cap on the federal obligation. Senator \nKerry argued there is. And Secretary Slater said we were both right!\n  Let me read a few lines from the May 3rd hearing transcript:\n\n       The Chairman: Mr. Secretary, is there a cap on the Federal \n     share of the project costs?\n       Secretary Slater: Mr. Chairman, there is a cap. It is true \n     though, as you noted, and as Senator Kerry noted, that it is \n     not in the statute or necessarily in writing.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, if it isn't in statute or in writing, then where \nis it? The answer is, of course, that it doesn't currently exist.\n  Mr. President, it is not my intent to stop the Boston project. The \nproject should be completed as quickly and as fiscally responsibly as \npossible.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to direct the Secretary and the State \nof Massachusetts to do what the Secretary said he would do at the May \n3rd hearing--to execute a written agreement capping the federal \nobligation of the project at the level announced by the Department--\nthat is, no more than $8.549 billion.\n  It has been six weeks since the Secretary indicated the Department \nwas working on an agreement to cap the funding. DOT officials informed \nmy office again today that an agreement is in the works and I am to be \nassured it will include the $8.549 billion cap. Given this, I can think \nof no reason why not to support my amendment to spur their actions to \nexecute the agreement sooner rather than later.\n  The House-passed DOT Appropriations bill includes a provision that \nwould effectively halt the project for fiscal year 2001. My amendment \nwould not do that. It just ensures that the promised written agreement \nis executed once and for all and that the American taxpayers are not on \nthe hook of having any more gas tax dollars shifted away from other \nimportant highway infrastructure projects.\n  Again, there is no cap on the Federal funding share for the project. \nIn my view, a federal cap would help ensure the project managers reign \nin their run-away costs and project overruns because they will not be \nable to expect the rest of the nation's highway dollars to be funneled \ninto their project.\n  This amendment is fair, it is based on what the Secretary of DOT has \npromised, and it is what is already in the works. Let's help encourage \nthe timely resolution of this important matter so that the needed \ncontinuation of construction of the Central Artery/Tunnel project is \nnot further impeded.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I don't oppose Senator McCain's \namendment. It reflects the current broad understanding about the status \nof the Central Artery/Tunnel project in Boston.\n  The Big Dig project has suffered from serious cost overruns and there \nis no disagreement about who will pay for those costs. The Chairman of \nthe Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, the governor of Massachusetts, \nthe leaders of the State legislature, the Secretary of the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation, the Inspector General of the Department, \nthe Massachusetts Congressional delegation, and Senator McCain all \nagree that the total federal contribution remains as it was--$8.549 \nbillion. It is the responsibility of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts \nto cover any increased costs.\n  The state has developed a plan to do just that, and it is a good \nplan. The state legislature and Governor Cellucci have worked \neffectively to prepare a realistic plan to pay for the increased costs \nof the Big Dig, without asking for\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\nadditional federal assistance, and without shortchanging important \ntransportation projects throughout the rest of the state. The plan is \ncurrently being reviewed by the Federal Highway Administration and is \nlikely to be approved very soon.\n  It is also important to appreciate all that is involved in this \nproject, and all that it will do for Boston and the region. Work of \nthis magnitude and duration has never before been attempted in the \nheart of an urban area. Unlike any other major highway project, the \nCentral Artery/Tunnel Project is designed to maintain traffic capacity \nand access to residents and businesses. Using new and innovative \ntechnology, it has kept the city open for business throughout the \nconstruction.\n  The Big Dig is replacing the current six lane elevated roadway with \neight to ten underground lanes. The project will create 150 acres of \nnew parks and open space, including 27 acres where the existing \nelevated highway now stands.\n  This is an urgently needed project. Today, the Central Artery carries \n190,000 vehicles a day with bumper-to-bumper traffic and stop-and-go \ncongestion for six to eight hours every day. If nothing were done, the \nelevated highway would suffer through bumper-to-bumper conditions for \n15 to 16 hours a day by the year 2000.\n  The new underground expressway will be able to carry 245,000 vehicles \na day with minimal delays. The elimination of hours of congested \ntraffic will reduce Boston carbon monoxide levels by 12 percent \ncitywide. Without such improvements in its transportation, Boston would \nnot be able to continue to grow as the center of economic activity for \nthe state and the region.\n  Work on this important project is progressing effectively again. I \nlook forward to its conclusion so that the city, state, and region can \nbenefit from the needed improvements this project will bring.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 3432, As Modified; 3436, As Modified; 3438, As \n         Modified; 3447, As Modified; 3451, 3452, 3453, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 saved \n     approximately 3,800 lives in providing the essential service \n     of maritime safety.\n       (2) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 prevented 111,689 \n     pounds of cocaine and 28,872 pounds of marijuana from \n     entering the United States in providing the essential service \n     of maritime security.\n       (3) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 boarded more than \n     14,000 fishing vessels to check for compliance with safety \n     and environmental laws in providing the essential service of \n     the protection of natural resources.\n       (4) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 ensured the safe \n     passage of nearly 1,000,000 commercial vessel transits \n     through congested harbors with vessel traffic services in \n     providing the essential service of maritime mobility.\n       (5) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 sent \n     international training teams to help more than 50 countries \n     develop their maritime services in providing the essential \n     service national defense.\n       (6) Each year, the United States Coast Guard ensures the \n     safe passage of more than 200,000,000 tons of cargo cross the \n     Great Lakes including iron ore, coal, and limestone. Shipping \n     on the Great Lakes faces a unique challenge because the \n     shipping season begins and ends in ice anywhere from 3 to 15 \n     feet thick. The ice-breaking vessel MACKINAW has allowed \n     commerce to continue under these conditions. However, the \n     productive life of the MACKINAW will end in 2006.\n       (7) Without adequate funding, the United States Coast Guard \n     would have to radically reduce the level of service it \n     provides to the American public.\n       (8) The allocation to the Committee on Appropriations of \n     the Senate of funds available for the Department of \n     Transportation and related agencies for fiscal year 2001 was \n     $1,600,000,000 less than the allocation to the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives of funds \n     available for that purpose for that fiscal year. The lower \n     allocation compelled the Subcommittee on Transportation of \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate to recommend \n     reductions from the funding requested in the President budget \n     on funds available for the Coast Guard, particularly amounts \n     available for acquisitions, that may not have been imposed \n     had a larger allocation been made or had the President's \n     budget not included $212 million in new user fees on the \n     maritime community. The difference between the amount of \n     funds requested by the Coast Guard for the AC & I account and \n     the amount made available by the Committee on Appropriations \n     of the Senate for those acquisitions conflicts with the high \n     priority afforded by the Senate to AC & I procurements, which \n     are of critical national importance to commerce, navigation, \n     and safety.\n       (9) Due to shortfalls in funds available for fiscal year \n     2000 and unexpected increases in personnel benefits and fuel \n     costs on the 2000 operating expenses account, the Commandant \n     of the Coast Guard has announced reductions in critical \n     operations of the Coast Guard by as much as 30 percent in \n     some areas of the United States. If left unaddressed, these \n     shortfalls may compromise the service provided by the Coast \n     Guard to the public in all areas, including drug interdiction \n     and migrant interdiction, aid to navigation, and fisheries \n     management.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the committee of conference on the bill H.R. 4425 of \n     the 106th Congress, making appropriations for military \n     construction, family housing, and base realignment and \n     closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2001, or any other appropriate committee \n     of conference of the second session of the 106th Congress, \n     should approve supplemental funding for the Coast Guard for \n     fiscal year 2000 as soon as is practicable; and\n       (2) upon adoption of this bill by the Senate, the conferees \n     of the Senate to the committee of conference on the bill H.R. \n     4475 of the 106th Congress, making appropriations for the \n     Department of Transportation and related agencies for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, provided there is \n     sufficient budget authority, should--\n       (A) recede from their disagreement to the proposal of the \n     conferees of the House of Representatives to the committee of \n     conference on the bill H.R. 4475 with respect to funding for \n     AC & I;\n       (B) provide adequate funds for operations of the Coast \n     Guard in fiscal year 2001, including activities relating to \n     drug and migrant interdiction and fisheries enforcement; and\n       (C) provide sufficient funds for the Coast Guard in fiscal \n     year 2001 to correct the 30 percent reduction in funds for \n     operations of the Coast Guard in fiscal year 2000.\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 3447, as modified\n\n (Purpose: To provide that new starts funding shall be available for a \nproject to re-electrify the rail line between Danbury, Connecticut and \n                         Norwalk, Connecticut)\n\n       On page 39 of the substituted original text, between lines \n     18 and 19, insert the following: ``Danbury-Norwalk Rail Line \n     Re-Electrification Project''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3451\n\n(Purpose: To make available funds previously appropriated for the Star \n               Landing Road project in DeSoto County, MS)\n\n       At the appropriate place in bill add the following new \n     section:\n       Sec.   .

CONVEYANCE OF AIRPORT PROPERTY TO AN INSTITUTION OF \n                   HIGHER EDUCATION IN OKLAHOMA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, including the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (58 Stat. \n     765, chapter 479; 50 U.S.C. App. 1622 et seq.), the Secretary \n     of Transportation (or the appropriate Federal officer) may \n     waive, without charge, any of the terms contained in any deed \n     of conveyance described in subsection (b) that restrict the \n     use of any land described in such a deed that, as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act, is not being used for the operation \n     of an airport or for air traffic. A waiver made under the \n     preceding sentence shall be deemed to be consistent with the \n     requirements of section 47153 of title 49, United States \n     Code.\n       (b) Deed of Conveyance.--A deed of conveyance referred to \n     in subsection (a) is a deed of conveyance issued by the \n     United States before the date of enactment of this Act for \n     the conveyance of lands to a public institution of higher \n     education in Oklahoma.\n       (c) Use of Lands Subject to Waiver.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the lands subject to a waiver under subsection (a) shall \n     not be subject to any term, condition, reservation, or \n     restriction that would otherwise apply to that land as a \n     result of the conveyance of that land by the United States to \n     the institution of higher education.\n       (2) Use of lands.--An institution of higher education that \n     is issued a waiver under subsection (a) may use revenues \n     derived from the use, operation, or disposal of that land \n     only for weather-related and educational purposes that \n     include benefits for aviation.\n       (d) Grants.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, if an institution of higher education that is subject to \n     a waiver under subsection (a) received financial assistance \n     in the form of a grant from the Federal Aviation \n     Administration or a predecessor agency before the date of \n     enactment of this Act, then the Secretary of Transportation \n     may waive the repayment of the outstanding amount of any \n     grant that the institution of higher education would \n     otherwise be required to pay.\n       (2) Eligibility to receive subsequent grants.--Nothing in \n     paragraph (1) shall affect the eligibility of an institution \n     of higher education that is subject to that paragraph from \n     receiving grants from the Secretary of Transportation under \n     chapter 471 of title 49, United States Code, or under any \n     other provision of law relating to financial assistance \n     provided through the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment is to provide $20 million \nto support rural air service to the Department of Transportation and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001.\n  The Wendell H. Ford Aviation and Investment Reform Act of the 21st \nCentury (AIR-21) included in Section 203 a provision to provide grants \nto attract and subsidize improved air carrier service to airports \ncurrently receiving inadequate service. The provision authorizes $20 \nmillion for grants of up to $500,000 to communities or community \nconsortia which meet certain criteria for participation in the program.\n  My amendment would provide discretionary authority to the Secretary \nof Transportation to implement this pilot program utilizing not more \nthan $20 million in FY 2001 for this purpose.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize how important this program is to \nmy home State of New Mexico, particularly southeastern New Mexico where \nI have worked for years to bring rural air service to that part of the \nstate. The communities of Roswell, Hobbs, Carlsbad, and Artesia have \nformed a consortium in anticipation of applying for federal funds under \nthis program. The consortium has raised $200,000 in local funding and \n$200,000 in state funds, and can demonstrate that existing air service \nin that part of the state is insufficent and is accompanied by \nunreasonably higher fares. The southeastern New Mexico consortium is \nprecisely the sort of applicant this grant program is intended to \nbenefit. A similar consortium is being put together in northern New \nMexico.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to provide badly \nneeded air service to rural areas in the country.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first I want to thank my colleague, \nSenator Domenici, for his work on this amendment, and Chairman Shelby \nand Senator Lautenberg for adding this important funding to the \nTransportation Appropriations Bill. Our amendment provides funding for \na new program to help rural communities with inadequate or uneconomical \ncommercial air service to attract new air carriers or to improve their \nexisting service.\n  Mr. President, for a number of years, as I traveled around New \nMexico, I heard from many of our community and business leaders about \nthe importance of commercial air service to support economic \ndevelopment and attract new employers to rural parts of my state. To \nhelp address this problem, last year I worked with the Commerce \nCommittee, and especially Senators Rockefeller and Dorgan, to authorize \na new program to help rural communities to improve their commercial air \nservice. The authorization for this new program was included in the \nWendell Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, \nwhich Congress passed and the President signed earlier this year.\n  At the same time, the New Mexico State Legislature, lead by Senators \nAltamirano, Ingle, Jennings, Kidd, and Leavell, established a $500,000 \nstate program to provide matching funds to communities that wanted to \nimprove their commercial air service. Almost immediately, agreements \nwere signed and new air service was made available to Taos and Los \nAlamos--cities that previously had no commercial air service. More \nrecently, agreements have been signed with a consortium of cities in \nSoutheastern New Mexico, including Roswell, Carlsbad, Hobbs and Lea and \nEddy Counties. These are exactly the kinds of communities this program \nwe are funding today is designed to help.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased the committee has found a way to fund \nthis important program for rural communities. I want to work with the \ncommittee as the bill goes to conference to ensure that this funding is \nretained. I again thank Chairman Shelby and Senator Lautenberg for \ntheir help.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to urge \nthe passage of the Domenici, Bingaman and Burns amendment to the \nDepartment of Transportation Appropriations Act, Senate Amendment 3432. \nThis amendment appropriates $20 million for grants supporting the Small \nCommunity Air Service Development Pilot program, properly targeting \nnecessary funding to needy small airports.\n  When I became Ranking Member of the Aviation Subcommittee, I was \ndetermined to make support of small airports a priority. This March, I \nhelped craft the Wendell H. Ford Aviation and Reform Act of the 21st \nCentury (FAIR-21), the Federal Aviation Administration and the Airport \nImprovement Program bill authorizing $40 billion for aviation funding, \nthe largest increase in aviation funding ever. This included \nsignificant new funding for rural airports. In 1998, I had authored the \nAir Service Restoration Act, directing the Department of Transportation \nto make new priorities and incentives supporting the development of \nairports in small communities, which was incorporated into FAIR-21. The \nDomenici-Bingaman-Burns amendment builds on these efforts and makes the \nproposed funding a reality.\n  The Domenici-Bingaman-Burns amendment provides the funding small\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\nairports need. Small airports are an essential part of our aviation \ninfrastructure. Without improvements to our small airports, we will \nstymy the economic growth of less developed areas. We know \ntransportation is vital to economic development and that improving air \ntransportation needs more Congressional attention. Senator Domenici \nsponsored this amendment with Senators Burns and Bingaman and made it a \npriority and possible. But I would like to especially note the work of \nmy good friend and respected colleague, Senator Bingaman, who deserves \ntremendous credit for his assiduous efforts to make sure this funding \nis available. I wholeheartedly endorse this amendment and urge its \nadoption as part of the Department of Transportation Appropriation \nAct.\n  Mr. SHELBY. These amendments have been cleared on both sides of the \naisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3432, as modified; 3436, as modified; 3438, as \nmodified; 3447, as modified, 3451, 3452, and 3453,) were agreed to, en \nbloc.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this completes the amendments that the \nmanagers can clear from the list of amendments. The remaining \namendments on the list either have rule XVI points of order that lie \nagainst them or the managers have been unable to clear. For all intents \nand purposes, we are done. I intend to urge third reading and final \npassage in short order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a unanimous consent agreement we \nwould like to enter in the near future. We are waiting to hear from one \nSenator prior to doing that. It is my understanding Senator Byrd is on \nthe floor. He has some remarks he wishes to make while we are waiting \nfor clearance from the other Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/15/senate-section/article/S5186-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5186-S5188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FATHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank our very distinguished Democratic \nwhip, Mr. Reid, for his accommodation. I thank the distinguished \nmanager of the bill, Mr. Shelby, for his characteristic kindness and \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, this Sunday, June 18, is Father's Day. The Bible tells \nus to ``honor thy father and thy mother.'' I would like to take just a \nfew minutes to pay tribute to fathers and to call particular attention \nto this coming Sunday, that day of special significance.\n  An old English proverb tells us that ``one father is more than 100 \nschoolmasters.'' Fatherhood is the most compelling, the most profound \nresponsibility in a man's life.\n  For those of us who are fathers, there is nothing that we can do here \nin this Chamber that is more important than our commitment to our \nchildren. And, of course, with the greatest responsibilities, come the \ngreatest joys and the greatest challenges. For those of us who are \nblessed with a long life, we learn that existence is an intricate \nmosaic of tranquility and difficulty. Struggles, along with blessings, \nare an inevitable, and instructive, part of life. A caring father \nprepares us for this reality. He teaches us that, in human nature, \nthere is no perfection, there is simply the obligation to do one's \nbest.\n  My foster father, Titus Dalton Byrd, my aunt's husband, gave me my \nname and to a great extent the best aspects--and there are a few, I \nsuppose--of my character. His was not an easy life. He struggled to \nsupport his wife and his little foster son during the depths of the \nGreat Depression. This Nation is today blessed with the greatest \neconomy the world has ever known. But, for those of us who remember the \nterrible poverty that gripped this Nation during the 1930's, \nprosperity, at one time in our lives, seemed a very, very long time in \ncoming. It seemed far, far away.\n  The test of character, the real test of character in a nation is how \nthat nation responds to adversity, and the same with regard to a \nperson, how that person responds to adversity, not only in his own life \nbut in the lives of others.\n  The Roman philosopher Seneca said that ``fire is the test of gold; \nadversity, of strong men.''\n  In this respect, Titus Dalton Byrd was a great teacher. He easily \ncould have been a bitter man, a despairing man. He could have raged at \nhis lot in life. He could have forsaken his family. He could have \nforsaken his faith.\n  I remember as clear as if it were yesterday watching for that man, \nthat tall black-haired man with a red mustache coming down the railroad \ntracks. I recall watching for him as I looked far up the tracks that \nled ultimately to the mine, the East Five Mine in Stotesbury where he \nworked. I would see him coming from afar, and I would run to meet him.\n  As I neared him, he would always set his dinner bucket down on a \ncross tie. He would lift off the top of that dinner bucket, and as I \ncame to him, he would reach in and he would bring out a cake, a little \n5-cent cake that had been bought at the coal company store.\n  He would reach down into that dinner bucket. He would pull out that \ncake and give it to me, after he had worked all day, from early morning \nto quitting time. And in the early days, quitting time was when the \ncoal miner loaded the coal, loaded the slate, the rock, and cleaned up \nhis ``place'' for the next day.\n  He had gone through those hours with the timbers to the right and the \ntimbers to the left, cracking under the weight of millions of tons of \nearth overhead. He had sweated. He had worked on his knees, many times \nworking in water holes because the roof of the mine was perhaps only 4 \nfeet or 3 feet above the ground. He toiled there with a shovel, with a \npick, and his calloused hands showed the result of that daily hard \ntoil. Of course, he wore gloves and he wore kneepads so that he could \nmake his way on the ground, on his knees, lifting the coal by the \nshovelful and dumping it over into the mine car. There he worked in the \ndarkness except for a carbide lamp. It was a very hazardous and \ndangerous job. But when he had his lunch, he ate the rest of the food \nbut always saved the cake.\n  When I ran to meet him, he would set down the dinner pail and lift \noff the cover and reach in and get that cake and give it to me. He \nalways saved the cake for me.\n  He was an unassuming man. Unlike me, he never said very much. He took \nthe hard licks as they came. I never heard him use God's name in vain \nin all the years I lived with him. Never. He never complained. When he \nsat down to eat at the table, he never complained at the humble fare. I \nnever heard him complain. He was as honest as the day was long. When he \ndied, he did not owe any man a penny. He always represented a triumph \nof the human spirit to me. He honored his responsibilities. He did his \nduty.\n  He could not be characterized as a literate man. He never read \nEmerson's essays or Milton's ``Paradise Lost'' or Bocaccio's \n``Decameron,'' or the ``History of Rome.'' He could hardly read at all. \nI suppose the only book he ever read was the Bible. His formal \neducation was in the school of hard knocks, but he was a wise man. He \nknew right from wrong.\n  That sounds simple, even quaint, in these sophisticated times, but it \nsurely is not. Cicero said, ``The function of wisdom is to discriminate \nbetween good and evil.'' To genuinely know right from wrong and to \nhonor that as the guiding force in one's life--that is not always \nsimple. That is not always easy. Brilliant theologians of every faith \non Earth will tell you that such moral discernment is a central \nspiritual challenge of a human life. But my dad knew right from wrong. \nHe read his Bible, the King James' version of the Bible.\n  When the burdens of my dad's life were almost too heavy to bear \nduring the desperate poverty of the Great Depression, his faith never \nwavered that the Creator would give him the strength he needed. Abraham \nLincoln, as he contended with the overwhelming agonies of a nation torn \napart by a great civil war, said of the Bible:\n\n       This great Book . . . is the best gift God has given to \n     man.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a lesson that great men, whether mighty or \nhumble, have learned, and it is the lesson my dad taught me.\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\n  We live now in what has been termed the age of information. But, as \nwe salute our fathers on this coming Sunday, this is an opportune time \nto again sound a note of caution for our children. Information is not \nthe same as wisdom. Our society, including our children and our \ngrandchildren, and our great grandchildren, is bombarded with \ninformation and entertainment, such as it is, useless, tasteless, and \nbewildering, much of which is geared to our basest instincts and our \ntawdriest impulses. It is a parade of the lowest common denominator all \ntoo often. This is the more complicated world with which parents today \nmust contend. Parents need to instill wisdom in their children, a moral \nsense that will enable their children to navigate through a volatile \nsea of uplifting and distressing images.\n  My dad, like most rural people, who was not used to much, never had \nmuch, found solace and understanding in nature. He understood the \ngenerous and bountiful delights of nature. The flowers of spring, this \nblessed season which officially gives way to summer on June 21, call us \nback to the beauty and sweetness of the world, and perhaps hint at what \nis best within ourselves as well. Spring is the season of rebirth, the \nseason of replenishment. I defy any cluttered, tumultuous, cacophonous \ntelevision program to compete with the simple, quiet drama of the \nforsythias, the dogwoods, the roses, and the azaleas, to compete with a \nsingle miraculous bud.\n  James Russell Lowell wrote:\n\n       And what is so rare as a day in June?\n       Then, if ever, come perfect days;\n       Then Heaven tries earth if it be in tune,\n       And over it softly her warm ear lays:\n       Whether we look, or whether we listen;\n       We hear life murmur, or see it glisten.\n\n  As I have said, my dad was not himself a formally educated man. But, \nhe understood and he appreciated nature, and he knew the tremendous \nvalue of an education. That is why he wanted me to go on to school. He \ndid not want me to be a coal miner. He did not want me to earn my \nliving in that way. He encouraged, indeed, he demanded that I study \nhard. He looked at that report card. He looked at that category \ndenominated ``deportment.'' And he always said: If you get a whipping \nat school, I'll give you a whipping when you get home. And I knew that \nthat one would be the worst of the two. But he loved me. I knew he \nloved me. That is why he threatened to whip me; it was because he loved \nme.\n\n  He encouraged me to study hard and to develop my mind. He wanted \nsomething better for me. He knew that education was the key that I \nwould need to unlock the potential in my own life.\n  So, Titus Dalton Byrd was a model for me not only of the virtuous \nindividual life, but of married life as well. He and my mom, my Aunt \nVlurma, were married for 53 years. I do not recall ever witnessing \neither of them raise a voice in anger against the other. And I heard \nthem say from time to time: We have made it a pledge that both of us \nwould not be angry at the same time.\n  I have always counted myself as truly fortunate--truly fortunate--\neven though my life's ladder had the bottom rungs taken away. You ought \nto see where I lived, Mr. President. You ought some time to go with me \ndown Mercer County and see where I lived--3 miles up the hollow, with \nno electricity, with no running water, the nearest hospital 15, 20 \nmiles away, the nearest doctor the same. That was back in the days of \nthe 2-cent stamp, the penny postcard. Some things were better; some \nthings were not. But I have always counted myself as truly fortunate in \nhaving such exemplary role models.\n  A lot of people say today there are no role models anymore. Well, I \nhad two role models in the good old man and woman who reared me.\n  They set the standard to which I have not always succeeded but I have \nalways aspired. And, on May 29, my beloved wife Erma and I celebrated \nour 63rd wedding anniversary.\n  We both came from families, from mothers and fathers, who tried to \nbring us up right. And they inculcated into us a dedication to one's \noath.\n  Like, I suspect, many fathers whose jobs consume so much of their \ntime and energy, I regret the times away from my daughters when they \nwere children. I am grateful for the capable and loving efforts of Erma \nwho has shouldered so much of the responsibilities at my home. To the \nextent, limited though it may be, that I have been a good father, I am \nhumbly indebted to Erma's having been such a wonderful mother. Our \njourney as a family has been a more tranquil one thanks to her \npatience, her understanding, and her strength.\n  Of course, the roles of fathers--and mothers--in some ways have \nchanged a great deal over the course of my lifetime. Parents today are \nconfronted with far more choices at home and work than my wife and I \never encountered when we began our family. But, one thing has not \nchanged. One thing has, in my opinion, remained constant. Parenthood \nis, ideally, a partnership, a collaboration. It is a vitally important, \nlifelong responsibility, and best experienced, whenever possible, in \nthe shared, balanced efforts of both parents.\n  No mortal soul is perfect or without fault. That is the reality of \nbeing human. We are all prey to losing our way at difficult times in \nour lives. But, a good father will provide his child with a map, a path \nto follow. The hallmark of that path, throughout life, is conscience. \nIt is that inner moral compass that has been so essential to the \ngreatness of our Nation, and that is, I fear, so buffeted now by an \naimless, hedonistic popular culture.\n  The ancient truths of our fathers are perhaps more obscure in this \nnoisy, materialistic society, but they are still there--still there--\ngleaming and bright. John Adams, one of the great Founding Fathers of \nthis Nation, said:\n\n       All sober inquiries after truth, ancient and modern, \n     divines, moralists and philosophers, have agreed that the \n     happiness of mankind, as well as the real dignity of human \n     nature, consists in virtue.\n\n  The material things, with all their appeal and their comfort, are, in \nthe end, fleeting. They are all transient. I remember not so much the \ntangible things--other than a piece of cake perhaps--that my dad gave \nme, as the values that he taught me. It is the treasured, if fleeting, \nmoments together, the lessons learned, that endure. I can say now, from \nthe perspective of a long and full and eventful life, that that is what \nmatters. That is the greatest gift we can receive as children, and that \nis the greatest gift that we can bequest as parents.\n\n  A caring father is a lifelong comfort. I remember the stoic and \nkindly face of Titus Dalton Byrd. He encouraged me, he protected me, \nand his memory still guides me.\n  Mr. President, I have met with Kings in my lifetime, with Shahs, with \nPrinces, with Presidents, with Princesses, with Queens, with Senators, \nwith Governors, but I am here to say today that the greatest man that I \never knew in my long life, the really great man that I really knew in \nmy long life, was my dad, Titus Dalton Byrd.\n  He taught me, in word and in deed, to work hard, to do my absolute \nbest.\n  I close with this bit of verse:\n\n                            That Dad of Mine\n\n       He's slowing down, as some folks say\n       With the burden of years from day to day;\n       His brow bears many a furrowed line;\n       He's growing old--that dad of mine.\n\n       His shoulders droop, and his step is slow;\n       And his hair is white, as white as snow;\n       But his kind eyes sparkle with a friendly light;\n       His smile is warm, and his heart is right.\n\n       He's old? Oh, yes. But only in years,\n       For his spirit soars as the sunset nears.\n       And blest I've been, and wealth I've had,\n       In knowing a man like my old dad.\n\n       And proud I am to stand by him,\n       As he stood by me when the way was dim;\n       I've found him worthy and just as fine,\n       A prince of men--that dad of mine.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I personally appreciate the remarks of the \nSenator from West Virginia. I only hope that my five children will \nreflect upon their dad someday as he has his.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the one thing we can always count on \nfrom Senator Byrd is to throw in some good, sensible reflection as we \ngo on battering one another, at times over sometimes important things \nbut sometimes not so important. There is a commercial about one of the \nbrokerage firms, that when that firm speaks, everybody listens. When \nSenator Byrd\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\nspeaks, everybody should listen. We have a collection of his papers on \nthe Senate, but he has done so many other things. Just think of the \nvoice, but look at the message, and you capture the essence of Senator \nByrd. I am going to miss him terribly when I leave here.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/15/senate-section/article/S5188-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5188-S5215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                            2001--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3440\n\n(Purpose: To condition the use by the FAA Airport Office of non-safety \n related funds on the FAA's completion of its investigation in Docket \n                             No. 13-95-05)\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3440 on behalf of \nSenator McCain and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides of the aisle. I have talked to Senator Lautenberg about it. I ask \nfor its immediate adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there debate on the amendment? If not, \nwithout objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3440) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to \nlay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the Transportation \nAppropriations bill for accepting my amendment that would prohibit the \nDepartment of Transportation from making any airport grant to the Los \nAngeles International Airport until the Federal Aviation Administration \nconcludes an investigation into illegal revenue diversion at the \nairport. The exception to this prohibition would be if such grants were \nrequired to ensure public safety. The investigation at issue here has \nbeen going on for more than five years without resolution, and American \ntaxpayers deserve to know whether their money has been used for illegal \npurposes.\n  The investigation of revenue diversion about which I am concerned \ninvolves the City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles International \nAirport, LAX. Unfortunately, this airport has served as the poster \nchild for the problem of illegal revenue diversion for as long as I \ncare to remember. In this case, a complaint was filed with the FAA in \n1995 about the transfer of $59 million from LAX to the city. Despite \nthe fact that the DOT's Office of Inspector General has periodically \ncontacted the FAA to inquire about the status of a decision by the FAA \non the complaint, no decision has been forthcoming. As the Inspector \nGeneral stated in a recent memo to the FAA on this subject, 5 years \nshould be more than sufficient time for the FAA to consider the facts \nin the case and render a decision.\n  If there is no objection, I ask unanimous consent to print the \nInspector General's memo in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is with a deep sense of frustration that I am \ncompelled to act on this matter. As many of my colleagues know, I have \nbeen fighting against the illegal diversion of airport revenues for \npurposes that do not serve the aviation system. In fact, four years ago \nI spearheaded the legislative effort in the Senate to strengthen the \nlaws against such revenue diversions.\n  Because we have a national air transportation system with \nconsiderable federal investment and oversight, funded in large part by \nthe users of the system, it is critical that airports or the bodies \nthat control them do not use monies for non-airport purposes. We cannot \nallow airports to receive federal grant dollars on the one hand, and \nspend other airport revenues for non-aviation purposes. This type of \nshell game results in the misuse of the underlying grant. That is one \nof the principal reasons there are laws against diversions of airport \nrevenues. Unfortunately, many cities that control airports see them as \nsources of cash that can be tapped for popular purposes.\n  Another reason that revenue diversion is harmful is that our Nation's \nairports are meant to be self-sustaining. By keeping monies generated \nby airports at those airports, we ensure that an important part of the \nnational transportation system is kept strong. If airports are used to \ngenerate cash for local jurisdictions, the airport itself will suffer \nfrom the loss of resources. Even worse, air travelers will be \neffectively double taxed--once through federal aviation excise taxes, \nand a second time through the higher air fares that airlines will \ncharge when their costs of maintaining the airport go up.\n  I stress that I am not advocating a specific result in this matter, \nand I trust that whatever decision or course of action the FAA may take \nwill be made in the best interests of the country. In that vein, my \namendment would allow grants to be made once the investigation is \nconcluded, even if the determination is made that no action is \nnecessary.\n  Again, I seek no preferential treatment for any of the parties in \nthis matter. I desire only that this investigation be conducted \nappropriately, fairly, and in a timely manner. The delays that have \noccurred so far are just not acceptable.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for accepting my amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                            U.S. Department of Transportation,\n\n                                                     May 10, 2000.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Jane F. Garvey, Federal Aviation Administrator\n     From: Kenneth M. Mead, Inspector General\n     Subject: Action: Complaint by Air Transport Association \n       Concerning Los Angeles International Airport\n\n       The Air Transport Association (ATA) requested the Inspector \n     General's assistance in expediting resolution of ATA's formal \n     complaint to FAA over the transfer of revenues from Los \n     Angeles International Airport (Airport) to the City of Los \n     Angeles (City). The complaint, filed in March 1995 pursuant \n     to FAA's Investigative and Enforcement Procedures (14 CFR \n     Part 13), questioned the transfer of about $59 million from \n     the Airport to the City. These funds were the proceeds from \n     sale of Airport property to the State of California \n     Department of Transportation for construction of the Century \n     Freeway. The ATA considered the transfer to be a prohibited \n     revenue diversion in violation of Federal regulations and \n     grant assurances.\n       In May 1996 we issued a Management Advisory Memorandum \n     (Report Number R9-FA-6-011) to your Associate Administrator \n     for Airports discussing issues which FAA needed to consider \n     in its deliberations on the merits of the ATA complaint. We \n     pointed out the land sold to the State of California was used \n     for aeronautical purposes, was purchased by the Airport, and \n     severance damages associated with the sale should be paid to \n     the Airport. In a June 1996 reply to our memorandum, FAA \n     agreed to consider our information and make the memorandum a \n     part of the Record of Decision on the complaint.\n       Over the past several years we have periodically contacted \n     your Office of Associate Administrator for Airports to \n     inquire as to the status of a decision by FAA on the ATA \n     complaint. However, no decision on the complaint has been \n     forthcoming.\n       On Apri 26, 2000, we informed the Acting Associate \n     Administrator for Airports of the ATA request and she \n     promised to look into why it was taking so long to resolve \n     this complaint. Five years has elapsed since ATA filed its \n     complaint. This should be more than sufficient time for FAA \n     to consider the facts in the case and render a decision.\n       Please advise us as to when FAA expects to render a \n     decision on the ATA complaint. If\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\n     the decision is not forthcoming in the near term, please \n     provide the estimated date of completion and an explanation \n     for further delays.\n       If you have any questions, or would like additional \n     information, please contact me at (202) 366-1959, or my \n     Deputy, Raymond J. DeCarli, at (202) 366-6767.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLautenberg be recognized for 5 minutes before we proceed to vote on the \nAllard amendment. I further ask unanimous consent that following the \nvote, I be recognized to offer an amendment; following the disposition \nof that amendment, the bill then be read a third time and the Senate \nthen proceed to the vote on passage of the bill, as amended. I further \nask unanimous consent that following that vote, the Senate then insist \non its amendments and request a conference with the House; further, \nthat Senator Gorton then be immediately recognized in order to make a \nmotion to instruct conferees relative to CAFE.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 hours equally \ndivided in the usual form for debate on the motion, divided in the \nusual form, with an additional 15 minutes under the control of Senator \nLevin, 15 minutes under the control of Senator Abraham, and 15 \nadditional minutes for the proponents of the motion, with no amendments \nto the motion in order.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following that time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the motion and that the Chair then be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure that \neveryone understands the minority.\n  We are doing our best to be cooperative here. But the original \narrangement was that we would be able to spend some time on the Defense \nauthorization bill. Under this agreement that will be entered shortly, \nwe will be very lucky to finish a vote on the CAFE instructions to \nconferees by 7 o'clock tonight. That is an inappropriate time for us to \nbegin some very serious deliberations that we have on a matter relating \nto Cuba, to abortion, and to military hospitals.\n  So I want the majority to be put on notice that we expect, next week, \nto have adequate time to go into these issues, and others. There has \nbeen a gentlemen's understanding between the two leaders that we would \ndo half and half. We just haven't been getting our half over here on \nthe authorization matters. We hope there will be something done next \nweek to allow us to do that. Otherwise, we could have some problems.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3430\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to talk about this Allard \namendment because it gives an appearance of reserving $12.2 billion for \ndeficit reduction. I support that goal, and I am not going to oppose \nthis amendment. But I really want to make it clear that, as a practical \nmatter, this amendment has no meaning. Nobody should fool themselves \ninto believing otherwise.\n  The current budget rules already protect budget surpluses by \nestablishing limits on discretionary spending and by requiring offsets \nfor all new mandatory spending or tax cuts. These rules require across-\nthe-board cuts if Congress raids any surplus by exceeding the spending \ncaps or by violating the so-called pay-as-you-go rules. So this \namendment doesn't add any new protections to those already in law, nor \ndoes it change the provisions in current law that require all surpluses \nto be used to reduce our public debt.\n  The amendment claims to promote debt reduction by depositing $12.2 \nbillion into a trust fund that generally is used for receipts of gifts \nfrom foreign countries, the proceeds of which are automatically \ndedicated to debt reduction.\n  Well, that sounds good. I don't think it is going to do any harm. But \nit doesn't change anything, realistically. It is an intragovernmental \ntransfer, taking from one end of the Government and giving it to \nanother. It doesn't affect the bottom line, and it doesn't add any \nprotections that don't already exist.\n  I point out, also, that we are on a course to reduce publicly held \ndebt by a lot more than $12.2 billion this year. Under the budget \nresolution, all of the roughly $150 billion Social Security surplus, \nand more than $12 billion of the non-Social Security surplus, is \nalready devoted to debt reduction. So there is roughly a $160 billion \nreserve for debt reduction already.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is expected to add another $30 \nbillion to $40 billion in their re-estimate to that total within the \nnext few weeks. So while we are on track to reduce the debt by \npotentially $200 billion this year, including perhaps $50 billion from \nthe non-Social Security surplus, this amendment stands for the bold \nproposition that we should commit at least $12.2 billion for debt \nreduction. Again, it is likely that we are going to have a $200 billion \ndebt reduction this year. So I don't understand, and I am not quite \nsure why we are doing this or why we have to define $12.2 billion as \ndirected to debt reduction.\n  In sum, the amendment claims it is going to reduce debt by a lot less \nthan we are already on track to reduce, and it doesn't have any \npractical effect. Perhaps it will make some folks feel good, and I am \nnot going to object to its adoption; but this is an exercise that is \nunnecessary and doesn't accomplish really anything. But we are all in \nthe process of saluting debt reduction, and this is just another \nsalute, I guess.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield back whatever time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is now \non agreeing to the Allard amendment No. 3430.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                                  waas\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield for a brief colloquy?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding. I want to commend the \nchairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for \ndeveloping this legislation. I understand the constraints of the \nallocation given the subcommittee and I believe he and the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey have done a great job in developing a bill the entire \nSenate can support.\n  As a general aviation pilot I also want to specifically thank the \nSenator for his recognition throughout the legislation of the role of \ngeneral aviation in the national air transportation system. As the \nreport correctly noted, ``the FAA should not let the perfect be the \nenemy of the good'' and although for example the WAAS program is \nstruggling, the legislation notes the number of satellite based \napplications that can be deployed here and now to enhance aviation \nsafety.\n  As you move to conference, would the Chairman be willing to work with \nme on language for inclusion in the Statement of Managers to enhance \ndirection to the FAA in this particular regard? Increasing the number \nof GPS approaches, developing databases and GPS corridors through Class \nB airspace will immediately improve safety for thousands of general \naviation pilots.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator for yielding and for his kind words \nregarding our legislation. We would be pleased to work with the Senator \nand I support the thrust of his request.\n  His request tracks very closely with the subcommittee's philosophy \nregarding FAA modernization. Funds provided in this bill for next \ngeneration navigation should not be used solely to protect programs \nwhich our bill report details are struggling to various degrees but to \ndeploy the immediate benefits of satellite based technologies as \nquickly as possible.\n  I thank the Senator for his interest and look forward to working with \nhim.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n         USE OF SMALL DUMMIES IN THE NEW CAR ASSESSMENT PROGRAM\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to ask my distinguished friend, the Senator \nfrom Alabama, about committee report language on the Fiscal Year 2001 \nTransportation Appropriations bill that affects the use of small \ndummies in the New Car Assessment Program, or NCAP. Let me quote from \nthe relevant section of the report:\n\n       The Committee denies the request to expand NCAP by using \n     small size dummies in crash tests. The Committee believes \n     that test devices should be required for use in safety \n     standards compliance testing before being considered for \n     inclusion in NCAP.\n\n  As my good friend knows, the National Highway Transportation Safety \nAdministration (NHTSA) currently conducts crash tests using dummies \nthat meet a standard for full-grown adult men, and I am concerned that \nthis report language would prevent the public from learning how new \ncars would perform in crashes involving occupants of all sizes--smaller \nadults and children.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator from California for the opportunity \nto clarify the committee's intent with respect to the committee's \nresponse to NHTSA's request to test the ``feasibility of using the 5th \npercentile dummy'' as indicated in the budget justification. The \ncommittee intended with this report language to ensure that NCAP would \nbe expanded to include small size dummies until those dummies are \ncertified for use in crash tests conducted to verify compliance with \nfederal motor vehicle safety standards. I am very supportive of the \nexpanding the number of crash test dummies to more accurately simulate \nthe diverse height and weight of vehicle occupants. The intent was not \nto prevent the agency from using small dummies nor to prevent NHTSA \nfrom acquiring test data essential. To the contrary, the committee \nprovides additional funding in the relevant Research and Analysis \ncontract program.\n  I want to underscore how important it is for members of the committee \nand the entire body to have accurate and consistent information from \nNHTSA in order to proceed with expanded NCAP tests. Indeed, the \ncommittee has received conflicting information from NHTSA regarding the \nreadiness of small size dummies for use in crash tests.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his answer, and I agree that it \nis essential that safety dummies used in the NCAP program in fact \nprovide adequate and reliable data to consumers and automobile \nmanufacturers alike. I appreciate that there has been some confusion \nwith respect to certification of the so-called small 5th percentile \ndummy, but I now have information from NHTSA which indicates that the \ndummy has been thoroughly tested and certified through the appropriate \nrulemaking process.\n  Would he under these circumstances commit to making every effort in \nthe conference committee on the Transportation bill to change that \nspecific report language to reflect this information from NHTSA?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I assure the Senator from California that I will continue \nto consult with NHTSA regarding the design and reliability of the small \nsize dummies. I believe it is critical that these dummies be \nsatisfactorily developed in time for compliance testing associated with \nthe new advanced air bag rule in 2004.\n\n\n                 national planning and research program\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as the Senator from Alabama is aware, \nthis bill includes funding for a number of transit planning and \nresearch grants under the National Planning and Research Program. The \nCommittee report that accompanies the bill identifies a number of \nindividual research projects, including several university based \nprojects, and the amount of federal funding to be provided for each. I \ncommend the Chairman and the Subcommittee for their support for \nUniversity based research into transit and related transportation \nmatters. I would inquire of the Chairman whether he was aware of \nJackson State University's transportation research capabilities and \ntheir plan to establish an institute at the University to utilize the \ndisciplines of information technology, engineering, environmental \nscience, public policy and business to provide technical and other \nassistance to transportation planners, local governments and others \ninvolved in multimodal transportation?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am advised that the Senator from \nMississippi did bring this matter to the Subcommittee's attention and \nrequested the Subcommittee's consideration for funding. As the Senator \nfrom Mississippi knows, the subcommittee considered a number of \nrequests for research projects that could not be funded within the \nallocations. However, I share the Senator from Mississippi's view that \nthe research program proposed by Jackson State University would make an \nimportant contribution to multi-modal transportation research.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Chairman's response, and \nI hope he will work in conference to provide funding for the Jackson \nState University Transportation Institute.\n\n\n                             bus facilities\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before the Senate H.R. 4475, the \nfiscal year 2001 Appropriations Act for transportation. Included in the \nSenate Committee Report is the statement: State of Michigan buses and \nbus facilities: Despite unanimous supported agreements among the \nMichigan Public Transit Association, its members, and the Michigan \nDepartment of Transportation that Section 5309 bus funds to Michigan \ntransit agencies be distributed through MDOT, designations of funds to \nindividual transit agencies continue to be sought and proposed apart \nfrom the agreement. The Committee directs that any fiscal year 2001 \ndiscretionary bus funds for projects in Michigan be distributed through \nMDOT in accordance with the MPTA-MDOT agreement.\n  I have spoken with many local jurisdictions who do not agree that \nthere has been an agreement that all money would go to the Michigan \nDepartment of Transportation and that there would be no specific \nearmarks.\n  I have a letter here from the President of the Michigan Public \nTransit Association which states that it was understood by MPTA that \nMichigan\n\n[[Page S5191]]\n\ntransit systems be allowed to pursue their own individual earmarks. I \nhave requested such earmarks from the Committee. I ask consent that \nthis letter be inserted in the Record at the conclusion of this \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Michigan, and he is correct, \nthere is language in the Committee Report which directs that any fiscal \nyear 2001 discretionary bus funds for projects in Michigan be \ndistributed through MDOT in accordance with the MPTA-MDOT agreement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask that you consider in conference our specific \nrequests as well as the overall allocation of $70 million for Bus \nGrants for Bus Dependent States.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I assure the Senator from Michigan that specific \nrequests will be carefully considered.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                   Michigan Public\n\n\n                                          Transit Association,\n\n                                       Lansing, MI, June 15, 2000.\n     To: Michigan Congressional Delegation\n       In regard to FY 2000-01 Section 5309 earmarks to the State \n     of Michigan, the Michigan Public Transit Association is in \n     support of both the State's priority list for earmarks as \n     provided to the Michigan Congressional Delegation, and will \n     support any individual earmarks that Michigan areas have \n     requested. There is no agreement that says that the State of \n     Michigan will get all the earmark funds. We understand that \n     the State of Michigan has submitted a priority list in which \n     certain facility projects will receive the first priority, \n     and bus replacement needs in Michigan will receive the second \n     priority. The Michigan Public Transit Association supports \n     Michigan Department of Transportation identification of needs \n     and has agreed to the prioritization. We furthermore \n     understand that transit systems will be asking for special \n     earmarks for projects and we are supportive of all the \n     requests. We urge the Michigan Congressional Delegation to \n     secure the largest possible earmark to the State of Michigan, \n     and to provide individual earmarks at the highest possible \n     levels to transit systems in Michigan.\n       The above is what was agreed to between Michigan public \n     transit systems and the Michigan Department of Transportation \n     at meetings held in January and February of this year. It is \n     clearly our understanding that transit systems in Michigan \n     are allowed to pursue their own individual earmarks at the \n     same time as we are supportive of the State receiving funds \n     and distributing them in accordance with their agreed to \n     priority list.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Peter Varga,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG, Mr. President, I would like one moment to ask Senator \nShelby, chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, a \nbrief question. Mr. Chairman, would you agree that the Jamaica \nIntermodal Project in Jamaica, Queens, New York is eligible to receive \nbus funds along with the other projects listed in the Committee report?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would agree.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of \nTransportation and Related agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year \n2001.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nand the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for \nbringing us a balanced bill within necessary budget constraints.\n  The Senate-reported bill provides $15.3 billion in new budget \nauthority (BA) and $19.2 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of \nthe Department of Transportation, including federal-aid highways, mass \ntransit, and aviation activities. When outlays from prior-year budget \nauthority and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals \n$14.0 billion in BA and $48.0 billion in outlays.\n  The Senate-reported bill is exactly at the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation for budget authority, and the bill is $310 million in \noutlays under the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  I thank the chairman for the consideration he gave to New Mexico's \ntransportation priorities.\n  Mr. President, I support the bill and urge its adoption.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record spending \ncomparisons of the Senate-reported bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            H.R. 4475, TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS, 2001 SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                                   [Fiscal year 2001, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               General               Mass\n                                                               purpose  Highways    transit   Mandatory   Total\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\1\\-----------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority...........................................   13,281  ........  ..........       739    14,020\n  Outlays....................................................   15,663    26,920      4,639        737    47,959\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...........................................   13,281  ........  ..........       739    14,020\n  Outlays....................................................   15,973    26,920      4,639        737    48,269\n2000 level:\n  Budget authority...........................................   12,536  ........  ..........       721    13,257\n  Outlays....................................................   14,635    24,338      4,569        717    44,259\nPresident's request \\2\\:\n  Budget authority...........................................   13,911  ........  ..........       739    14,650\n  Outlays....................................................   15,661    26,677      4,646        737    47,721\nHouse-passed bill \\2\\:\n  Budget authority...........................................   13,735  ........  ..........       739    14,474\n  Outlays....................................................   15,948    26,920      4,639        737    48,244\n               SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...........................................  .......  ........  ..........  .........  .......\n  Outlays....................................................     -310  ........  ..........  .........     -310\n2000 level:\n  Budget authority...........................................      745  ........  ..........        18       763\n  Outlays....................................................    1,028     2,582         70         20     3,700\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority...........................................     -630  ........  ..........  .........     -630\n  Outlays....................................................        2       243         -7   .........      238\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...........................................     -454  ........  ..........  .........     -454\n  Outlays....................................................     -285  ........  ..........  .........    -285\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Although the President's request, House-passed, and Senate-reported versions of this bill all include $1.254\n  billion in BA for the mass transit category, there is no such allocation to compare it to, so those amounts\n  are omitted.\n\\2\\ For comparison purposes, outlays for the highways and mass transit categories for the President's request\n  and the House-passed bill are adjusted by the same amounts as the Senate-reported bill to reflect the\n  difference between CBO's estimate of outlays for implementing TEA-21 and OMB's calculation of the the TEA-21\n  caps for those categories.\n \nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I seek recognition to raise an issue of \nimportance to my home state of Colorado with the distinguished chairman \nof the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Shelby.\n  I commend my friend and colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, for \nhis effective leadership on this important Transportation \nAppropriations bill. I take this opportunity to call to his attention a \nmatter of highway safety in the increasingly congested Denver Metro \narea, particularly the I-25 ramps project near downtown Denver.\n  I-25 is the most congested highway artery in the State of Colorado \nand has more accidents per miles driven than any other traffic corridor \nin the State. All of the ramps in this project area are separated by \ninadequate distances. Funds for this project would increase these \ndistances and therefore increase safety.\n  The amount of traffic directed onto the 17th Avenue and 23rd Avenue \nramps off of I-25 is expected to grow to a point that would overwhelm \nthe already unsafe traffic volumes on these ramps.\n  I am concerned that even today, the ramps are substandard and could \nbe considered unsafe. Under the design recommendations of the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the \nminimum safe distance between an ON and OFF ramp is 1,600 feet. These \nramps are only 435 and 750 feet apart.\n  The Average Daily Traffic (ADT) for these ramps is 40,800 yet the \ncurrent ramps are designed for only 12,000 ADT. These ramps are \ncurrently at 340 percent over capacity and they can't handle more \ntraffic without funding for this project.\n  I have been working with the Subcommittee on Transportation \nAppropriations to help the Denver Metro area and Colorado and very much \nappreciate the Chairman's assistance. A key priority for me is to \nimprove highway safety in Metro Denver through this ramps project. \nBecause of the budget constraints, however, the subcommittee was not \nable to include the project at this time. Will the Chairman be able to \nassist my efforts in seeking this funding as we move towards \nConference?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank the Senior Senator from Colorado \nfor raising the issue of highway ramps to improve safety on the roads \nin the Metro Denver area. Based on the Transportation Subcommittee's \nreview of highways across the country, it is clear that Colorado, \nespecially the Denver Metro area, has one of the fastest growth rates \nin the country and has specific transportation needs.\n  I support the Senator's request for assistance on the particular \nhighway project he mentions, and will be happy to work with him to \nidentify funding for this important safety and capacity project as we \nmove towards Conference.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my concerns about Section \n335 of the Transportation Appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\nThis section flatly bans the Department of Transportation from even \nconsidering any reform of the commercial drivers' Hours of Service \n(HOS) regulations, which limit the time that drivers spend behind the \nwheel of large trucks and buses. The provision shuts off all funding \nfor DOT current and future efforts to ensure drivers receive adequate \nrest. This sweeping ban on any further consideration of HOS regulations \ngoes too far.\n  Section 335 would not even give DOT a chance to try to address \nconcerns that have been raised about its proposed regulations. DOT \nwould be prohibited from holding public hearings on the changes \n(several are planned for this month alone) or from even talking with \ndrivers, law enforcement groups, and highway safety groups about the \nproposed changes. The measure also halts efforts to enhance HOS \nenforcement through on-board recorders--one of the National \nTransportation Safety Board's ten most wanted safety improvements.\n  The ban on any consideration of HOS reform also contradicts Congress' \nrecent action to improve truck safety. Just last year Congress mandated \nthe creation of a new truck safety agency within DOT, the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration. It is FMCSA's proposal to change the HOS \nregulations which has led to the ban in section 335 of the \nTransportation Appropriations bill. Moreover, in 1995, the Congress, \nthrough the medium of the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination \nAct (ICCTA), directed DOT to study the HOS regulations and suggest \nreforms. DOT and FMCSA have done so. The result of their efforts should \nnot be the foreclosing of all debate on new driver safety rules.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the Senate continues to debate this \nyear's Transportation Appropriations bill, I am pleased to again \nexpress my support for high-speed passenger rail. Efficient high-speed \npassenger rail has many benefits: it helps to relieve some of our ever-\nincreasing traffic congestion, it provides increased mobility for both \nbusiness and personal travel, and it reduces pollution of the air we \nbreathe. I have long supported a truly intermodal and effective \ntransportation system and high-speed rail is a vital link in that \nchain.\n  Federal assistance is essential for the development of transit \nsystems such as high-speed rail. The Federal Government has long had a \nmajor role, of course, in funding America's transportation network, \nfrom construction and maintenance of the interstate highway system to \nproviding mass transit assistance to local governments. I believe the \nfederal role is important because we need a coherent, responsible \nnational transportation policy.\n  But I believe it is appropriate that state and local officials have \nthe greatest role in making the important decisions about where our \ntransportation money is spent, because they are the people who deal \nwith the demands on all the elements of the transportation system on a \ndaily basis. The great thing about high-speed passenger rail is that it \nincorporates the best of both worlds.\n  The Federal Government should be the partner of state and local \ngovernment in transportation, where there are local, state and national \ninterests. While it is crucial that we provide adequate funds for high-\nspeed rail, it is also important for the Federal Government to support \nhigh-speed rail in other ways. To this end, I urge the Federal Railroad \nAdministration to further develop its outreach activities to help \npromote awareness of high-speed rail as a viable option for providing \ndependable intercity transportation.\n  I am committed to supporting a sound national transportation \ninfrastructure and to developing thoughtful, fair transportation policy \nthat reflects the changing needs of our Nation and respects the role of \nstate and local government as the main decision-makers. High speed \npassenger rail fits the bill.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, as we vote today on the Transportation \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 2001, I want to draw the attention \nof my colleagues to a remarkable achievement in the Atlanta region of \nmy home state of Georgia. But first let me thank Chairman Shelby and \nour Ranking Member, Senator Lautenberg, for their assistance on my \nstate's transportation priorities in this bill.\n  The bill provides assistance for a number of alternative \ntransportation projects, from water taxies to eliminating high-hazard \ngrade crossings on the proposed Atlanta to Macon commuter rail line. We \nhave direction to the Federal Railway Administration and funding to \nextend the agency's high-speed rail transportation plan from Charlotte, \nNorth Carolina, to Macon, Georgia. We have important funding to make up \nfor a shortfall in funding to complete a regional transit study for \nmetropolitan Atlanta, so that this fast growing region--whose motorists \ndrive the longest distance of any metro area--can plan for a region-\nwide system of seamless intermodal transportation. We have the Georgia \nRegional Transportation Authority, GRTA, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid \nTransit Authority, MARTA, the Georgia Department of Transportation, \nChatham Area Transit, and the Southern Coalition for Advanced \nTransportation on the eligibility list for bus funding. In addition, \nMARTA is eligible for New Starts mass transit rail funding. And, the \nmaglev program to provide high-tech, high-speed fixed guideway service \nbetween Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Atlanta would receive $3 million to \ncontinue pre-construction planning in this Senate bill.\n  These are important projects, especially in light of the unanimous \ndecision yesterday by the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority to \napprove the Transportation Improvement Program, TIP, for the Atlanta \nregion. This was a remarkable event given the intense process that has \nbeen underway the past 12 weeks in Atlanta, culminating a two-year \neffort to submit a fiscally constrained, air quality conforming plan to \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation for approval. As many of my \ncolleagues know, the Atlanta region has been called the ``poster-child \nof urban sprawl.'' The region is in a conformity lapse, and, as a \nresult, new highway and transit construction dollars are frozen until \nthe Federal Government approves a plan that conforms with the Clean Air \nAct and the requirements of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury.\n  The Atlanta region has developed and submitted a plan that has been \nunder the closest scrutiny of any metropolitan region of the country. \nNo other region has had to fulfill the requirements set forth by the \nFederal transportation agencies for not only local financial \ncommitments, but to adopt a land-use strategy that would support the \nmajor public transportation investments called for in the TIP. In \nregard to these requests, let me remind my colleagues that the counties \nin my state are very protective of their home rule powers and rightly \nso, and Federal directives on local control issues are difficult to \nswallow.\n  Nevertheless, officials from the Atlanta Regional Commission, ARC, \nwhich is the metropolitan planning organization for the region, and \nfrom the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, GRTA, our new \nregional agency established to implement the ARC's plan, worked with \nthe Federal agencies to craft a process to ensure that the \ntransportation alternatives in the TIP are successful. This 3-year TIP \nmakes a very strong investment in alternative transportation. Half of \nthe $1.9 billion plan is devoted to mass transit, bicycle, pedestrian \nand air quality improvement projects and only 10 percent is devoted to \nnew capacity for single-occupant vehicles.\n  Even more important, the ARC and the GRTA are pledged to work \ntogether to implement a land use strategy that links the regional \ndevelopment plan with this transportation improvement program. This is \nan historic linkage of land-use guidelines with transportation \nimprovements. The Atlanta Regional Development Plan calls for land use \npolicies that strengthen town centers, foster transit-oriented \ndevelopment, encourage new development to be more clustered in portions \nof the region where new opportunities exist, protect environmentally \nsensitive areas, support the preservation of stable, single-family \nneighborhoods and encourage best development practices.\n  For the first time, these high-sounding goals are not just left to \ngather dust on a shelf. They are the guideposts for the region's \ntransportation program. The GRTA resolution calls\n\n[[Page S5193]]\n\nthe regional development plan ``an integral part of fulfilling its \nresponsibility to manage land transportation and air quality. . . .''\n  Mr. President, I would like to point out that these plans for mixed-\nuse and transit-oriented development do not mean that the GRTA is going \nto mandate high-density housing throughout the region. That could not \nbe farther from the truth. What this plan sets out is that where \nopportunities exist along certain transportation corridors the counties \nshould allow the free market to step in and build higher-density \nhousing and commercial development that would attract support for \ntransportation alternatives, such as express buses or commuter rail \nlines.\n  Let me state that many local governments have submitted written \npromises that they will do their part in implementing the TIP. Even \nmore important, everybody is now fully aware of what will be expected \nof them. For that reason--and because the GRTA has pledged to use its \ninfluence to put the program into action--I believe moving forward is \nthe right thing to do. I urge the Department of Transportation to move \nthis plan forward. It is time to put solutions that improve air \nquality, reduce traffic congestion and provide transportation choices \non the roads and railways in Atlanta.\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext of the GRTA resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Resolution of the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority\n\n\n                           resolution 00.6.1\n\n       Whereas, on May 10, 2000, the Georgia Regional \n     Transportation Authority (GRTA) adopted a resolution relative \n     to the Transportation Improvement Program for FY 2001-FY \n     2003;\n       Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved that GRTA approves the \n     Atlanta Region Transportation Improvement Program, FY 2001-FY \n     2003, and further resolves:\n       Land Use: Be it further resolved that GRTA finds the \n     policies and best development practices approved by the \n     Atlanta Regional Commission Board on May 24, 2000, and \n     described in ``A Framework for the Future: ARC's Regional \n     Development Plan,'', October, 1999 to be an integral part of \n     fulfilling its responsibility to manage land transportation \n     and air quality; and\n       Be it further resolved that GRTA will use its resources and \n     authority to cause the implementation of the policies and \n     practices as described in ``A Framework for the Future: ARC's \n     Regional Development Plan,'', October, 1999, and assumed and \n     required by the RTP and the ARC Land Use Strategy commitments \n     approved by the ARC Board on May 24, 2000, and\n       Funding/Projects: Be it further resolved that GRTA finds \n     the prioritization, in cooperation with ARC and local \n     governmental jurisdictions, of planning, funding and \n     implementation of local and regional public transit (bus, \n     rail, vanpool, carpool, and supporting infrastructure, such \n     as a regional network of high-occupancy vehicle lanes), \n     travel demand management programs and projects, and streets \n     safe for walking and bicycling are important to fulfilling \n     its responsibility to manage land transportation and air \n     quality; and\n       Be it further resolved that GRTA adopts the jurisdiction-\n     specific transportation funding assumptions detailed in the \n     RTP/TIP and will use its resources and authority to cause the \n     fulfillment of these local commitments assumed and required \n     by the RTP/TIP, and\n       Cooperating Local Government Status: Be it further \n     resolved, that GRTA's designation of cooperating local \n     governments requires that the region's jurisdictions make \n     satisfactory progress on the land use, fiscal and other \n     assumptions and requirements of the RDP, RTP, TIP and the ARC \n     Land Use Strategy commitments approved by the ARC Board on \n     May 24, 2000, as well as regional and jurisdictional \n     transportation and air quality goals, performance measures \n     and targets established by GRTA, and\n       Be it further resolved that GRTA will establish regional \n     and jurisdictional transportation and air quality goals, \n     performance measures and targets prior to the next process to \n     update/amend the TIP.\n       Environmental Justice: Be it further resolved, GRTA's \n     approval of future TIPs require compliance of the TIP with \n     all federal, state, and GRTA statutory and regulatory \n     requirements for addressing the issue of environmental \n     justice.\n       Speed Study: Be it further resolved, that GRTA, EPD, GDOT, \n     and ARC will perform a comprehensive vehicle speed study for \n     peak and non-peek traffic to address air quality \n     considerations in support of the State Implementation Plan \n     (SIP) for the non-attainment area to be completed by October \n     1, 2000.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern \nabout a rider that has been attached to the Transportation \nAppropriations bill in Congress for the past four years. The language \nof this rider prevents the Administration from even considering an \nincrease to our nation's Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE. This \nrider was a bad idea when it was first introduced four years ago, and \nit is a bad idea today. This rider appears yet again in the FY2001 \nHouse Transportation Appropriations bill. I would like to voice my \nopposition to this rider and express my support for Senator Gorton's \nMotion to Instruct Conferees, which he is offering with Senators \nFeinstein and Bryan, that opposes the CAFE freeze.\n  Aside from my personal conviction about the importance of improved \nCAFE standards, I am troubled by this provision for another fundamental \nreason: this rider bars the Administration from considering--even \ndiscussing--making our cars more efficient. This Administration should \nbe making decisions in light of all possible information, not being \nasked to forgo critical policy analyses simply because they are not \nallowed to freely evaluate different options.\n  Substantively, this rider forces the nation to bypass a critical \nopportunity to make our fleet of cars more efficient. The efficiency of \nour cars, or said another way, the number of miles our cars can travel \non one gallon of gasoline, is important for a great number of reasons. \nFirst, because of recent and continuing increases in the price of fuel, \nwe have felt firsthand the bite of high prices at the pump. The best \nanswer to reducing the amount of money we spend each month on gasoline \nis to make our cars more efficient. We know this approach will work, \nbecause the doubling of fuel economy between 1975 and the mid 1980s \nsaved new car purchasers an average of $3,000 in fuel over the lifetime \nof the car, at today's prices. The Union of Concerned Scientists \nestimates, for example, that if we were to raise light truck fuel \neconomy to 27.5 miles per gallon, the most popular Sports Utility \nVehicle in the country--the Ford Explorer--would go from traveling 19 \nmiles to the gallon to traveling 34 miles to the gallon. We could \nachieve this for $935 in established technology, and the SUV owner \nwould save thousands of dollars over the lifetime of the car.\n  Second, we need to raise CAFE standards for the sake of our national \nsecurity. The United States imports more than half of its oil from \nforeign countries, and this dangerously limits our independence and \npotentially our options in times of turmoil. The dramatic rise in oil \nprices in recent months should be a reminder of how overly-dependent we \nare on OPEC, and how vulnerable we are to OPEC cartel pricing. We must \nraise our domestic fuel economy in order to reduce this dependence. \nAccording to the Sierra Club, raising CAFE standards would save more \noil than we import from the Persian Gulf and off-shore California \ndrilling combined.\n  Third, there are critical environmental gains to be made from \nimproving the fuel economy of our vehicles. There have been a number of \nreports in recent weeks about the reality of global warming. A Federal \nGovernment study released earlier this week, requested by Congress four \nyears ago, reports that global climate has become approximately one \ndegree hotter over the past century, and many scientists believe that \nthis warming trend will continue as humans continue to burn fossil \nfuels. This trend will cause very real and significant changes to our \nweather and climate patterns, fundamentally altering the way of life in \nsome geographic areas. A recent study at NASA's Ames Research Center \nreported that the ozone layer is not recovering as fast as was \npreviously thought, potentially due to greenhouse gas emissions. A \nreport by Environment Canada and Parks Canada shows that some national \npark glaciers could disappear in 20 years due to global warming. These \nand other significant reports come on the heels of one another to warn \nus that global warming is real and that we need to pay serious \nattention to the problem.\n  The first, very important step we must take to curb greenhouse gas \nemissions is to reduce the amount of fossil fuels we consume in our \nvehicles. Improving the CAFE standards to 45 mpg for cars and 34 mpg \nfor light trucks would save this country 3 million barrels of oil per \nday and prevent\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\nhundreds of millions of tons of CO2 from entering the \natmosphere every year. Carbon dioxide is the major contributor to \ngreenhouse gas emissions and to the subsequent warming of our climate. \nWe must, I repeat we must, take this step and raise CAFE standards.\n  Since the 1980s, partly due to our nation's increasing use of light \ntrucks, or Sports Utility Vehicles, the corporate average fuel economy \nof our fleet of vehicles has declined. According to EPA's 1999 Report \non Fuel Economy Standards, there have been no improvements in fuel \neconomy for light trucks in 19 years. This is particularly dismaying \nwhen we consider that over half the passenger vehicles sold in the U.S. \nnow fit into the category of light trucks. We know we can do better and \nthat the technology already exists. Using state of the art engine \nrefinements; optimized transmission control; high strength, ``ultra-\nlight'' steel techniques, and lower rolling resistance tires, auto \nmanufacturers should be able to improve fuel economy drastically.\n  For all these reasons, we must move back toward improving the fuel \neconomy of the vehicles in the United States. It saddens me that some \nof my colleagues would like to prevent this discussion from even taking \nplace. The first step in the right direction is to uphold the Gorton/\nFeinstein/Bryan motion and oppose the freeze on CAFE standards. From \nthere, we will be able to discuss appropriate measures to improve upon \nour vehicles, for so many reasons that make good sense.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to thank the distinguished \nChairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, \nSenator Shelby, and Ranking Member, Senator Lautenberg, for their \ndiligence and patience in moving this vital legislation forward. The \ndifficulty of crafting such a comprehensive appropriations bill is \nconsiderable and they deserve congratulations. While I plan to vote for \nthis bill, I would like to state my reservations about one particular \nprovision--Section 335--which would preclude the Secretary of \nTransportation from expending any FY 2001 funds on the completion of a \nFederal rule pertaining to motor carrier ``Hours of Service.'' As my \ncolleagues prepare for conference with their House counterparts, I hope \nthey will recede to the House on this particular provision.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Slater recently wrote to the Appropriations \nSubcommittee stating his opposition to such a provision. The Secretary \npoints out, rightly I think, that heavy trucks are a major source of \naccidents on our roadways. Driver fatigue often plays a major role in \nthese accidents.\n  I feel that since the Department has not yet begun responding to \ncomments on its ``Hours of Service'' Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, it \nis premature to terminate DOT's review. Highway Safety is one of \nCongress' foremost transportation priorities, as evinced by the recent \ncreation of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\n  Mr. President, it is because highway safety is so important that I \nask my colleagues to drop this provision in conference. I have attached \na copy of Secretary Slater's letter, and ask unanimous consent to have \nit printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              The Secretary of Transportation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2000.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am advised that the Transportation \n     Subcommittee may add a very damaging provision to the pending \n     DOT Appropriations Bill, effectively barring the Federal \n     Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) from acting on \n     comments from the public and affected industries on one of \n     the most critical safety challenges we face--fatalities \n     involving heavy trucks on our nation's highways and the need \n     to update our ``Hours of Service'' rules for ensuring \n     adequate rest for commercial drivers.\n       Heavy trucks are involved in almost 15 percent of all fatal \n     highway crashes. I challenged the FMCSA last year to cut \n     fatality levels in half by 2009. We cannot accomplish this \n     without addressing the problem of operator error, and we know \n     that fatigue is a critical factor in crashes. The 60-year-old \n     rules for driver Hours of Service should be modernized. Also, \n     new technology, such as on-board recorders may play a role in \n     reducing the crash/fatality rates.\n       We have just proposed changes in a Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking to change the Hours of Service rules. This \n     proposal emphasizes rest and is science-based. We do not even \n     have the benefit of full comment at this point, yet some are \n     advocating that Congress intervene and prohibit analysis of \n     the information and views we receive. This would be utterly \n     contrary to the action Congress just took in December 1999 to \n     set up the FMCSA as a free-standing safety regulatory agency.\n       We have heard from industry representatives about the pace \n     of the rulemaking, and I am prepared to extend the comment \n     period for 90 days to allow interested members of the public \n     more time for in-depth analysis of the proposal's details and \n     to clarify matters that have arisen since the proposal was \n     issued May 2. However, I am not prepared to stop moving \n     forward on an issue that has not been substantially addressed \n     in 60 years and that promises so much in safety improvement. \n     If the Subcommittee adds the amendment, it will signal an end \n     to our efforts to address driver fatigue. I therefore \n     strongly oppose the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Rodney E. Slater.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the motion to \ninstruct conferees to reject the provision in the House version of the \nfiscal year 2001 Transportation Appropriations bill that freezes \nimplementation of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards.\n  As my colleagues have stated, the House bill would, for the sixth \nyear in a row, block the Department of Transportation from studying \nways to improve CAFE standards for vehicles in the United States.\n  Mr. President, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's \nlatest report to Congress states that cars sold in the United States in \n1999 averaged 28.3 miles per gallon, down from 28.7 miles per gallon in \n1998. Light trucks, which now make up about half of new passenger \nvehicles sold, averaged 20.7 miles per gallon, down from 20.9 in 1998.\n  What a shame that in an era of great technological innovation, all of \nthe fuel economy gains from technological improvements over the last \ntwelve years have been erased by the proliferation of larger, heavier, \ngas-guzzling vehicles.\n  As Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said of the CAFE freeze in \nhis June 8 letter to Chairman Shelby, ``Because this prohibition has \nbeen in place in recent years, the Department has been unable to fully \nanalyze this important issue. The average fuel economy of passenger \ncars and light trucks has decreased almost 7 percent since 1987. In \nfact, the average miles-per-gallon for 1999 was the lowest since 1980. \nCAFE is a significant policy issue that should be addressed \nanalytically and not preemptively settled through the appropriations \nprocess.''\n  With fuel prices high and rising, it is especially critical that we \nimprove CAFE standards. Lax fuel economy standards have allowed SUVs \nand other light trucks on the road today to be 30 percent less \nefficient than cars on average. This fuel economy gap caused Americans \nto spend $21.4 billion more for gasoline last year than if these trucks \nwere as efficient as cars. SUV and light truck drivers in my state of \nRhode Island paid an extra $55 million at the pump last year due to \nthis gap in fuel efficiency standards.\n  Meanwhile, as overall fuel efficiency goes down, our nation continues \nto import over 55 percent of its crude oil, putting us at the mercy of \nthe OPEC cartel. We owe it to the drivers in the Northeast who are \npaying over $1.70 for a gallon of gas, or those in the Midwest paying \nover $2.00 per gallon, to take a serious look at cutting our \nconsumption of foreign oil by improving CAFE standards.\n  Nevertheless, the CAFE freeze rider has been inserted into the House \nDOT spending bill every year for the past 5 years, and each time that \nhappens, Congress denies the American people the benefits of fuel-\nsaving technologies that already exist, technologies that the auto \nindustry could implement with no reduction in safety, power, or \nperformance.\n  Shouldn't we at least give the Department of Transportation the \nchance to study this issue? Isn't it time to lift the gag order that \nhas been placed on our ability to consider the costs and benefits of \nhigher CAFE standards? I believe the answer is clearly yes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important motion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Fiscal Year 2001 Transportation \nAppropriations bill now before the Senate\n\n[[Page S5195]]\n\ncontains, in my opinion, a very damaging and potentially dangerous \nprovision. This provision would effectively bar the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) from acting on comments from the \npublic and other interested parties on the critical need to revise the \nso-called Hours of Service rules, which regulate, among other things, \nthe number of continuous hours commercial drivers are permitted to be \non the road.\n  Over 5,300 people are killed and 127,000 are injured each year as a \nresult of truck-related crashes, and research shows that truck driver \nfatigue is a contributing factor in 30 to 40 percent of all truck-\nrelated fatalities. Moreover, the Department of Transportation (DOT) \nfinds that fatigue is directly related to 15 percent of all fatalities \ninvolving heavy trucks.\n  There are both good and not-so-good parts to DOT's proposed changes \nto the Hours of Service rule. While I am very concerned that the \nproposed rule contemplates increasing the number of continuous driving \nhours from 10 to 12, it would also require the use of electronic on-\nboard recorders for long haul and regional truckers, and it would \nrequire commercial drivers to follow the 24-hour circadian rhythm cycle \nas opposed to the currently permitted 18-hour cycle. This is important \nbecause all authoritative studies show that the human body best resets \nits ``clock'' when following the circadian rhythm cycle.\n  In response to requests from groups on all sides of this issue, DOT \nrecently extended the comment period on the proposed rule by another 90 \ndays. Nevertheless, language in the Transportation Appropriations bill \nwould bring the entire rulemaking process to a halt.\n  Mr. President, not only is it wrong for this body to insert itself in \nthis way in the preliminary stages of a proposed rulemaking process, I \nam concerned that that this provision will set highway safety \ninitiatives back by decades. Only by keeping the rulemaking process \nalive can the existing 60-year-old Hours of Service rules ever be \nmeaningfully reformed.\n  I understand that the House Transportation Appropriations bill \ncontains no such provision, and it is my strong hope that this \nprovision will be rejected in Conference Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Fiscal Year 2001 \nTransportation Appropriations bill, and I compliment the Chairman of \nthe Subcommittee, Senator Shelby, and the Ranking Member, Senator \nLautenberg, for the outstanding job that they have done on this \nmeasure.\n  Their recommendations, which were approved by a unanimous vote of the \nAppropriations Committee, are the best that could be done within the \nvery tight 302(b) allocation that was provided to the Subcommittee. I \nam hopeful that we will be able to provide increased funding for the \nTransportation Subcommittee, as the bill proceeds through the Senate \nand its conference with the House. As is usual for the Transportation \nSubcommittee, the programs and activities contained in this bill are \nfunded in as fair and balanced a way as one could expect. I am proud of \nthe work of the managers of this bill. Very importantly, the bill \ncontinues to fully fund the highway spending levels set forth in the \nTransportation Equity Act for the Twenty-First Century, TEA-21. As \nmembers will recall, when that landmark legislation was debated and \nenacted two years ago, I joined with Senator Gramm of Texas as well as \nSenators Warner and Baucus, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nSubcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, to provide some $26 billion in additional \nhighway spending over the six-year life of that measure. In so doing, \nwe put the ``trust'' back into the Highway Trust Fund. We assured the \nAmerican people that the full amount of the gasoline taxes that they \npay at the gas pump, and which go into the highway account of the \nHighway Trust Fund, will be spent on construction and rehabilitation of \nour Nation's highway and transit systems. Unfortunately, for the second \nyear in a row, the Administration's budget proposed that a large \nportion of these Highway Trust Funds be used for non-highway purposes. \nFortunately, the managers of this bill, Senators Shelby and Lautenberg, \nfound a way to reject the Administration's proposal and to continue, in \nfull, the commitments made to the American people; namely, that all of \nthe gasoline taxes that they pay will be fully spent, each year, for \nthe purposes for which those taxes were collected. I am grateful to the \nmanagers of the bill for having the wisdom and the courage to reject \nthe Administration's ill-conceived proposal for a second year in a row. \nI hope the Administration will get the message that this Congress is \nnot interested in going back on the commitments it made and that the \nPresident signed into law in TEA-21, to keep the ``trust'' in the \nHighway Trust Fund.\n  Mr. President, I note that this will mark the last occasion upon \nwhich Senator Lautenberg will serve as the Ranking Member of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee. During his tenure as \nChairman and Ranking Member of this Subcommittee, Senator Lautenberg \nhas always been very cooperative with me in my role as Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Appropriations Committee. He was no less \ncooperative when I served as Majority and Minority Leader of the \nSenate. He has demonstrated the courage to take a stand for what he \nbelieves in, throughout his Senate career, even when the votes were not \nthere. He has performed a tremendous service to his State, as well as \nto his Country on many critical issues. He has worked tirelessly on a \nbroad range of transportation issues throughout his service on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation. These accomplishments \nrange from improvements in Amtrak service, to ensuring that there are \nsufficient resources for the FAA, Coast Guard, mass transit and highway \nsafety programs. When it comes to transportation issues, Senator \nLautenberg has always been in the forefront. He has always fought \nvaliantly to protect the lives of the American people. He was the \nauthor of the smoking ban on airplanes. He was the author of the \nMinimum Drinking Age Act. His tireless battle against drunk-driving, \nwhich began with that Act, has now brought us to this appropriations \nbill, which includes a provision establishing a national intoxication \nthreshold of point-zero-eight (.08) blood alcohol content. The Senate \nwill miss Frank Lautenberg. We will remember him with great fondness.\n  The one disservice, however, that he performed for his Nation, and \nfor the Senate, and for the Appropriations Committee, was his decision \nnot to run again. I am sorry that he made that decision. I talked with \nhim about the matter several times. I told him that it was simply not \ngood for the Country. I don't say that because he is a Democrat--I say \nthat because this man is a Senate man. This man has rendered great \nservice. I greatly regret his decision--and I told him so, and I urged \nhim to rethink it, because he renders the kind of service that our \nCountry needs. I salute him for his Senate service. And, I say again, \nwe are going to miss this man--Frank Lautenberg.\n  Mr. President, I urge all Members to support the Fiscal Year 2001 \nTransportation Appropriations Bill now before the Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to express my concerns over a \nprovision included in this legislation that would effectively prevent \nthe Department of Transportation (DOT) from continuing its work to \nfulfill a statutory directive to revise its regulations that limits the \ndriving and duty time of truck and bus drivers.\n  The federal hours of service regulations were established in 1937. \nYet, despite the vast technological advancements and dramatic changes \nin the motor carrier industry, those rules have remained largely \nunchanged after more than 60 years.\n  Due to the growing safety concerns stemming from truck driver fatigue \nand other factors, the National Transportation Safety Board has \nrepeatedly called for the Department to develop new hours of service \nrules that reflect current research on truck and bus driver fatigue. \nFurther, the ICC Termination Act of 1995 required the department to \nissue an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) addressing \nmotor carrier hours-of-service regulations by March 1996 and a final \nrule by March 1999.\n  Unfortunately, the Department failed to meet the time frames as \nrequired under the law. The ANPRM was not\n\n[[Page S5196]]\n\nissued until November 1996. It wasn't until April of this year that the \nNotice of Proposed rule was issued--a proposal not embraced by industry \nor safety advocates.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, which has jurisdiction over most federal transportation \npolicy, I believe it critical to allow and actually require the \nDepartment to continue its work to develop sound new rules governing \nmotor carrier operators. I fully recognize the DOT's regulatory \nproposal is not acceptable in its current form. Moreover, the public \nneeds sufficient time to analyze the proposal and the Department must \nclearly evaluate and understand its implications before a final rule \ncan be issued. But the Appropriations Committee approach which prevents \nthe DOT from doing anything in this area is simply wrong.\n  Section 335 of the Transportation Appropriations bill would prohibit \nDOT's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) from using \nany funds to ``consider or adopt any proposed rule'' contained in the \nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) issued on April 24, 2000 or to \n``consider or adopt'' any ``similar'' rule.\n  I will not and am not defending the DOT's regulatory proposal. But I \ndo not think that preventing any further work in this area is sound \njudgement on our part. If the provision in this bill is allowed to \nstand in conference, it will effectively prevent any changes to the \nmore than 60-year-old truck driver rules.\n  We must urge the DOT to move forward with reasoned regulations in \nlieu of the depression era regulations that today continue to dominate \na technologically driven industry. The safety of the traveling public \nis at stake.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3454\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3454:\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       Sec.  . Hereafter, the New Jersey Transit commuter rail \n     station to be located at the intersection of the Main/Bergen \n     line and the Northeast Corridor line in the State of New \n     Jersey shall be known and designated as the ``Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Transfer Station''; Provided; That the Secretary \n     of Transportation shall ensure that any and all applicable \n     reference in law, map, regulation, documentation, and all \n     appropriate signage shall make reference to the ``Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Transfer Station''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will try to be really brief. My \ncolleagues have said much about what Senator Lautenberg has contributed \nto the country, to the Senate, and his persistent advocacy on behalf of \nthe State of New Jersey. I will not repeat all those things that have \nalready been said about our distinguished colleague. What I would like \nto share with the Senate today is a more overlooked but important \nperspective in Frank Lautenberg.\n  Senator Lautenberg is appropriately characterized as a Democrat. I am \nappropriately characterized as a Republican. You might think we would \nhave a difficult time working together in managing the Transportation \nappropriations bill. Make no mistake, we have our differences, as we \nall do. But in the 4 years that I have shared the responsibility of \nmanaging this bill with Senator Lautenberg, holding hearings on \nTransportation appropriations issues, working to improve transportation \nsafety, working to improve the efficiency of transportation programs, \nand working to develop recommendations that reflect the will of the \nSenate and the priorities of our colleagues, I have found Frank \nLautenberg to be thoughtful, decisive, reasonable, and professional. I \ncould not ask for more from a ranking member.\n  I could talk about his accomplishments when he chaired this \nsubcommittee in years past, his advocacy on behalf of Amtrak and the \nCoast Guard, about his legislative accomplishments to ban smoking on \nairline flights and to shape highway reauthorization bills, about his \nlove of aviation, about his significant place in shaping Transportation \nauthorization and appropriations bills during his tenure in the Senate, \nabout his vision for improving transportation services, not just in his \nState of New Jersey but more broadly for the entire Northeast region of \nthe United States.\n  But that would not give the full measure of his contribution. \nEqually, if not more important, is his commitment to making the process \nhere work, to applying pressure in his own way to get the issues before \nthe Senate and the Congress that are timely and that are relevant.\n  Many have said the Senate will miss Senator Lautenberg, that New \nJersey will miss his influence, and that the country will miss his \nleadership on transportation issues. That is all true. But what I will \nmiss most is his friendship, his advice and support on the \nTransportation Subcommittee on which he has labored so long.\n  I would like to see Senator Lautenberg honored in an appropriate way \nas he departs his service to the Senate and to the Nation's \ntransportation system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for his \nvery generous and appropriate gesture on behalf of Senator Lautenberg. \nOver the last months, I have had occasion to meet around the country \nwith people who are concerned about transportation. To a person, they \nall voluntarily offer up the degree to which they are going to miss \nSenator Lautenberg who has been an extraordinary champion for public \ntransportation and for aviation, as the chairman said.\n  Most important, speaking parochially for a moment, it is not easy to \nchampion the rail system in a country that has been dominated by \nautomobiles and our love affair with autos and highways. In all his \nyears here, Frank Lautenberg has been the single strongest advocate of \nmaking certain we have an alternative form of transportation.\n  In the Northeast particularly, we will have an accelerated rail link \nbetween New York and Boston and ultimately Washington that is due \nalmost solely to his persistent annual guarantee that the funding is \nthere.\n  That is an enormous legacy. We do not always get an opportunity in \nthe Senate to have that kind of niche where your vision is \nsinglehandedly implemented. Senator Lautenberg has done that with great \ncommitment and great perseverance.\n  I thank him on behalf of everybody in New England who depends on that \nsystem to get to work, to travel, to meet their families, and to enjoy \naffordable opportunity to travel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know our colleagues are waiting to \nvote. I will not take more than a moment. I add my voice and \ncongratulate the Senator from Alabama for his amendment. This amendment \nwill be adopted unanimously, as it should. It is in recognition not \nonly of the great contribution Senator Lautenberg has made to this \nsubcommittee and to transportation policy but to the country at large \non policies that go way beyond transportation, whether it is tobacco or \ngun safety. Whether it is an array of issues foreign or domestic, \nSenator Lautenberg has provided an insightful voice, a courageous \nvoice.\n  As Democratic leader, it has been an honor and high pleasure for me \nto have worked with him. I am proud to have had that opportunity. I \ncongratulate him on his extraordinary service to his country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I add my voice as well and compliment Frank \nLautenberg for his accomplishments. I commend him for his fine service \nin the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3454.\n  The amendment (No. 3454) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S5197]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendments and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill (H.R. 4475), as amended, pass? The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] moves that the \n     conferees on the part of the Senate on the disagreeing votes \n     of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n     H.R. 4475 be instructed, and are hereby instructed, not to \n     accept section 318 of the bill as passed by the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Yesterday, both Senator Bryan and I came to the floor to discuss this \nmotion, the reasons for dealing with corporate average fuel economy \nstandards in this fashion, and to give a preview as to our reasons for \nthis vitally important motion.\n  Twenty-five years ago, in 1975, the Congress--an enlightened \nCongress, I may say--passed a certain set of requirements demanding \nthat automobiles and small trucks on average from each manufacturer \nmeet certain fuel efficiency standards; that is to say, that they get \nbetter gas mileage and, not at all incidentally, provide less pollution \ninto the atmosphere of the United States.\n  That statute was passed, of course, in the aftermath of the oil \nboycott on the part of Arab countries and a steep rise in gasoline \nprices.\n  Though I am quite conservative and often critical of government \nregulation, I know of few, if any, regulatory regimes of the United \nStates that were more successful. In a period of a little more than 5 \nyears, the average fuel efficiency of automobiles in the United States \nfor all practical purposes doubled. That proposal was passed, \nincidentally, over arguments that were not similar to the arguments \nthat are made against this motion today but identical to the arguments \nmade against this motion today.\n  We were told by the Ford Motor Company that the passage of such \nstandards would mean everyone would be driving a Maverick or something \nsmaller than a Maverick. Chrysler and General Motors followed suit. The \npeople of the United States would not be able to buy the kinds of \nautomobiles they were accustomed to driving and those that they were in \nfact driving at the present time.\n  Well, those predictions were so dramatically off kilter that the \nlargest regular passenger cars manufactured today get better gas \nmileage than the Maverick about which they were speaking in the year \n1975.\n  Curiously enough, however, in spite of this huge success, a success \nthat literally saves 3 million gallons of gasoline a day in the United \nStates, for at least the last 10 years, the House of Representatives, \nin its appropriation bill for the Department of Transportation, has \nprohibited not only the promulgation of new corporate average fuel \neconomy standards but even their study and proposal on the part of the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  The Senate, in each of those years, has been wiser. It has included \nno such prohibition. Regrettably, however, the Senate has without \nexception receded to the House position on this issue in each and every \nyear of the last decade or two. As a consequence, the average fuel \neconomy of our overall fleets has been decreasing rather than \nincreasing.\n  Last year, the distinguished Senator from California, Mr. Bryan from \nNevada, and I introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution stating that \nwe should not keep our heads in the sand any longer; We ought to allow \nthese studies to go forward. We ended up with roughly 40 votes, a \nsubstantial and credible vote, but obviously not a majority vote of the \nSenate. What has happened during the course of the last year, Mr. \nPresident? Well, the most obvious occurrence has been a vast increase \nin the retail price of gasoline for each and every American consumer.\n  A year ago, we were at the end of roughly a year of abnormally low \ngasoline prices. The reaction earlier this year on the part of OPEC was \nto get that cartel together, cut back on production, and thus hugely \ndrive up the price of gasoline. Our Secretary of Energy was sent, hat \nin hand, around the world to plead with OPEC countries to please \nproduce more gasoline, please don't punish Americans by driving up \nretail gasoline prices so high. This is what we in the United States \nwere reduced to--pleading with OPEC countries for a greater degree of \nproduction.\n  Well, they agreed to a little bit more. Prices dropped for a month or \nso, although nothing comparable to the increase that had preceded it. \nNow they are on the rise again. I believe it was Monday that the \nWashington Post indicated that retail prices for gasoline in the \nMidwest, where there are certain air pollution requirements, have gone \nup 30 to 50 cents a gallon in the course of 6 or 8 weeks. The same \nreport indicated that we had 3 straight weeks of gasoline price \nincreases all over the country, to the point where they are higher than \never before. Predictions are that they will hit $2 a gallon well before \nthis year is over. Perhaps even more significant than this punishment \nof the American people with higher gasoline prices is the increased \ndependence the U.S. has on foreign sources of oil. Way more than 50 \npercent of our oil is produced overseas now, which, of course, subjects \nus to the effectiveness of the OPEC cartel.\n  That is the first thing that has taken place. The second thing is \nthis: We were accused last year in the debate with mandating new \ncorporate efficiency standards when we didn't know what they would be, \nand when they\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\nwould ignore completely the safety of automobiles that were produced \nand driven in the U.S. Curiously enough, that, too, was a major \nargument made 25 years ago: More people will be killed on the highways \nbecause we will be driving these tiny little Mavericks and subcompact \nautomobiles.\n  But do you know what has happened? Death rates on our highways, per \nhundred million miles driven, have dropped by more than 50 percent. \nWhy? Because the big three automobile manufacturers' technology and \nimagination is far more efficient than their lobbying and the points \nthey make during the course of political campaigns. They have made \nautomobiles safer both because there has been a demand and because \nthere have been mandated requirements through the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration for airbags, side impact matters, and a \nwide range of other safety devices. It is far safer to drive with the \ncars that we have today, which are twice as fuel efficient as those in \nthe mid-1970s, than it was before these standards were adopted.\n  Nevertheless, it is our view that safety is an appropriate \nconsideration. So you have a different proposition before you this year \nthan you had last year. All we are asking--so it is a very important \nrequest in this motion--is that the Senate not agree to a House \nprohibition that says you cannot study, propose, or promulgate new \ncorporate average fuel-efficient standards for automobiles. To say that \nwe can't study that in light of the technological changes in the last \n20 years--it is incredible that anybody in the Senate would argue for \nsuch a proposition. No study? No proposal? No knowledge about what we \nare doing?\n  I will be one of the conferees that will be appointed as soon as this \ndebate is over and this voice vote is taken. Mr. President, because the \nHouse, of course, will maintain its position, my view is that not only \nan appropriate compromise but an appropriate course of action will be \nto permit the Department of Transportation study and propose new \ncorporate average fuel efficiency standards. I think they ought to be \nstudied. I think they ought to be proposed. I think they ought to \nconsider safety as well as fuel efficiency. But I do think it quite \nappropriate that they be brought back here to this body into the House \nof Representatives before they be promulgated. So I will accept as a \ncompromise with the House a prohibition against promulgating new \nstandards until next year's Transportation appropriations bill has been \ndeliberated, passed, and signed, obviously by a new President of the \nUnited States.\n\n  We will not be running the risk of a runaway Federal agency by any \nstretch of the imagination. What risks will we be running? We will run \nthe risk that we will vote on something we understand. We will run the \nrisk that standards will be proposed that will increase the efficiency \nof our automobiles and lower the cost of gasoline for every American \npurchaser of a new car and help clean up our air--important \nconsiderations that are specific in nature and brought to us because \nthey cannot be promulgated until we have had another chance to vote on \nthem. I think it takes a great deal of imagination to say the United \nStates of America, through its Department of Transportation, cannot \nengage in such a study and such a proposal.\n  The arguments you will get on the other side you already have in a \nDear Colleague letter, one that says, gee, we made our cars more \nefficient in 1975, and now we drive more. I don't think that is a \ncriticism. I think that is a praise of better gas mileage. Of course, \noil consumption has increased in 25 years. We have more people. We have \nbetter roads. And we have better automobiles. It may very well be that \nwill be the case, if we have even better gas mileage. But to say we \nought to cause people to stop driving because gasoline is too expensive \nand we are not going to do anything about it is, at the very best, a \nbizarre argument.\n  The second is, of course, the very argument that there will no longer \nwill be any choice--that cars will have to be so small that people \nwon't be able to choose small trucks or SUVs. The Ford Motor Company \nhas already told us it can greatly increase the fuel efficiency of \nSUVs. We know they can do this in the future, as they have in the past. \nI repeat that it is perfectly appropriate to say we will bring these \nstandards back here to us with their actual impact before we actually \npose them.\n  Finally, they argue that we are doing so well already with creating \nmore efficient cars that we shouldn't undercut that kind of research \ngoing into a new generation of engine by having some kind of mandate. \nTrue. We have. In fact, I chaired another appropriations subcommittee, \nthe Subcommittee on Interior, which finances the studies for a new \ngeneration of vehicles. I do so with great enthusiasm. But I also note \nthat while these studies have gone on, the automobile manufacturers \nhave done nothing to actually increase their average fuel economy on \nthe road.\n  This proposal is not only not inconsistent with the studies that are \ngoing on with the cooperation of the Federal Government and the \nautomobile manufacturers, but they are totally consistent with them. We \nare saying: Do a better job for Americans. Don't tell us that we will \nsee future Secretaries of Energy every time the OPEC countries are \nmoved to demand more money going hat in hand around the world. Use \nAmerican technological genius to do the job that you did from 1975 \nuntil 1980. Produce a more efficient automobile. Don't make it less \nsafe, make it more safe; the way you did then.\n  To use the old expression, if you fool me once, shame on you; fool me \ntwice, shame on me. They attempted to fool our predecessors in 1975. \nThey didn't succeed. They were wrong in every single argument they made \nin 1975. If we let them fool us twice with the same arguments, shame on \nus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Missouri such \ntime as he might require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nyielding time to me to speak on a very important issue.\n  In the 1970s, Congress sought to regulate fuel economy for various \nvehicles in the United States, and recently, as a result of the \ncontinuation of that program, there has been an effort to continue to \nescalate the amount of fuel economy that is demanded from companies \nthat produce automobiles. Since CAFE was enacted, we have had a weight \nreduction in cars of about 1,000 pounds per car. That is the way you \nget better fuel economy--carry less, and reduce the weight of the car \nin order to get better fuel economy.\n  I point out that there are some very serious consequences of reducing \nthe weight of a car by a thousand pounds. I indicate that one of those \nserious consequences has been highlighted in USA Today in a major \nfeature article from July 2 of last year, ``Death by the Gallon.''\n\n       A USA Today analysis of previously unpublished fatality \n     statistics discovers that 46,000 people have died because of \n     the 1970's-era push for greater fuel efficiency which has led \n     to smaller cars--\n\n  Read, ``lighter cars.''\n  For a number of reasons, I think it is in our best interest not to \nforce our auto manufacturers to produce lighter and lighter cars--\n46,000 people represents 46,000 families. I think we want to be a part \nof a voice that says don't make it riskier to drive on the highways.\n  There are a number of individuals who would say: This kind of \nstatistical analysis isn't the right thing. They say fuel economy has \ngone up, and the number of fatalities on our highways has gone down. \nTherefore, it must be that cars are safer in spite of the fact that \nthey are lighter. Very frankly, that is a pretty primitive sort of \nanalysis, and it is misleading. It is not correct.\n  I have in my hand a letter addressed to me from the Harvard Center \nfor Risk Analysis. I will ask unanimous consent it be printed in the \nRecord. I would like to read from the letter. Here is what this letter \nsays:\n\n       There are many powerful forces at work that have produced \n     the overall decline in the traffic fatality rate: increasing \n     rates of safety belt use, less drinking and driving, and a \n     growing share of miles traveled on relatively safe Interstate \n     highways, to name a few of those important forces.\n\n  Here is important language:\n\n       It would be easy for these favorable forces to mask or \n     conceal any adverse safety effects\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\n     of CAFE in overall data. In fact, our national times series \n     analyses published in 1989 (Journal of Law and Economics, \n     vol. 32, April 1989, pp. 112-3) show that, once these \n     favorable effects are controlled for in a national time-\n     series model, the average weight of the vehicle fleet is \n     significantly and NEGATIVELY associated with the fatality \n     rate. In other words, more vehicle weight (less fuel economy) \n     is associated with a smaller fatality rate.\n\n  In other words, more vehicle weight and less fuel economy is \nassociated with a smaller fatality rate.\n  Conversely, the more weight you have in the vehicle, the lower your \nfatality rate, and the more weight you take out of the vehicle, the \nhigher your fatality rate.\n  Those who have suggested that this 46,000 number is not a reliable \nnumber simply are simplistically interpreting the data.\n  When you control for factors such as the reduction in drunk driving, \nwhen you control for the factors such as airbags and seatbelts, when \nyou control for factors such as the increased number of miles driven on \ninterstate highways, we still have to live with the fact that 46,000 \npeople have died because we have mandated that vehicles be made lighter \nand unsafe. It is clear that this is a tremendous human toll to pay.\n  Due to higher gasoline prices, there are those who would argue that \nif we suddenly have lighter vehicles, the fuel savings will remediate \nthe problem that we have no energy policy in the United States. I think \nthat is less than realistic.\n\n  We need an energy policy in the United States. We need to have the \nopportunity to develop our own energy resources. Trying to get a few \nmore miles per gallon on the highway and lightening our vehicles even \nfurther, subjecting more people to the fate of the 46,000 who have \nalready died, is not going to solve the problem we have energy-wise \naround the world. We will solve the problem when we decide that America \nwill make a commitment to some of its own energy and energy \nindependence.\n  I rise today to oppose this motion that instructs the conferees on \nthe part of the Senate to fight the position expressed in the House of \nRepresentatives. The House of Representatives measure properly \nrecognizes that to take additional weight out of vehicles as a result \nof a mandate for additional corporate average fuel economy is unwise.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency that \nadministers CAFE, found increasing the average weight of each passenger \ncar on the road by 100 pounds saves 300 lives annually. Rather than \ndecreasing, we might be able to increase and save lives.\n  A number of studies have been conducted to determine the actual \neffect of CAFE standards on highway safety. The Competitive Enterprise \nInstitute found that of the 21,000 car occupant deaths that occurred \nlast year, between 26 and 4,500 in just 1 year were attributable to the \nFederal Government's new car fuel economy standards. That is not \nconsequential; 4,500 is nearly 100 people per State on average who die \nin car accidents because Congress is mandating weight be taken out of \ncars.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have two letters printed in the Record on \nwhich I will now comment.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Harvard Center for Risk Analysis,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, June 13, 2000.\n     Senator John Ashcroft,\n     Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n   Correcting Misinformation About Fuel Economy Regulation and Safety\n\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: During the recent House discussions \n     of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulation, there \n     was a widely distributed letter dated May 18, 2000 by the \n     American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) and \n     the Center for Auto Safety (CAS). I am concerned that this \n     letter contains some misleading statements about an important \n     issue: The potential adverse effects of fuel economy \n     regulation on the safety of motorists. The purpose of my \n     letter is to correct the misinformation and offer a different \n     perspective. I have enclosed a copy of the ACEEE/CAS letter \n     in case you have not seen it.\n       There are a variety of claims in the ACEEE letter about \n     energy savings, jobs, and technology that I am in no position \n     to evaluate. However, I have published the critical peer-\n     review science on the CAFE-safety issue and thus am in a \n     strong position to offer insight into the safety risks of the \n     CAFE program. I have four specific concerns about the ACEE \n     letter.\n       Concern #1. A chart accompanying the ACEEE letter shows \n     that the U.S. traffic fatality rate has steadily declined \n     form 1970 to 1998 (CAFE started in 1975), a period when motor \n     vehicle fuel economy improved substantially. The inference \n     drawn from the chart, that improved fuel economy did not \n     compromise the safety of motorists, is misleading.\n       There are many powerful forces at work that have produced \n     the overall decline in the traffic fatality rate: increasing \n     rates of safety belt use, less drinking and driving, and a \n     growing share of miles traveled on relatively safe Interstate \n     highways, to name a few of those important forces. I would be \n     easy for these favorable forces to mask or conceal any \n     adverse safety effects of CAFE in overall data. In fact, our \n     national times series analyses published in 1989 (Journal of \n     Law and Economics, vol. 32, April 1989, pp. 112-3) show that, \n     once these favorable effects are controlled for a national \n     time-series model, the average weight of the vehicle fleet is \n     significantly and negatively associated with the fatality \n     rate. In other words, more vehicle weight (less fuel \n     economy) is associated with a smaller fatality rate.\n       Another important factor that ACEEE does not mention (with \n     regard to safety) is that the light truck fleet grew rapidly \n     in the post-CAFE period (particularly post-1985), and these \n     light trucks tend to be larger, heavier, and more crashworthy \n     than the passenger cars they displaced in the market. Thus, \n     one of the reasons for the declining traffic fatality rate \n     from 1985 to the present was the growing size and weight of \n     the light-duty vehicle fleet, which is increasingly dominated \n     by light trucks (minivans, cargo vans, pick-up trucks and \n     sport-utility vehicles). Although some of these light trucks \n     have serious safety issues associated with them (e.g., \n     rollover risk for certain smaller SUVs), there is no question \n     that the size of these vehicles offers more crashworthiness \n     for the occupant than does the average passenger car (even \n     holding constant optional safety features).\n       Since CAFE regulation was applied only to new vehicles and \n     was applied more stringently to new passenger cars than light \n     trucks, we would not expect CAFE to have a noticeable effect \n     on the fatality rate for all vehicles (old and new, light \n     trucks and cars) on the road, the overall data presented by \n     ACEEE. When direct comparisons were made of fatality and \n     injury rates in new passenger cars downsized due to CAFE and \n     old passenger cars unaffected by CAFE, it was clearly shown \n     that the downsizing of cars increased the fatality and injury \n     risks to the occupants of the downsized cars. These data were \n     published by the Highway Loss Data Institute and the \n     Insurance Institute for Highway Safety over ten years ago.\n       When Dr. Robert Crandall of Brookings and I analyzed \n     fatality rates with and without CAFE regulation, controlling \n     for other relevant safety variables, we estimated that CAFE \n     regulation (from 1975 to 1985) was responsible for about half \n     of the 1,000-pound decline in the average weight of new \n     passenger cars, which resulted, once the entire car fleet was \n     regulated, in 2,200 to 3,900 additional fatalities to \n     motorists per year in the USA. To the best of my knowledge, \n     these findings have never been disputed in the peer-reviewed \n     scientific literature.\n       Concern #2: The ACEEE letter asserts that the growing sales \n     of small cars in the 1975-1985 time period were attributable \n     to recession, oil prices and other market factors rather then \n     CAFE regulation.\n       Dr. Crandall and I addressed this question explicitly in \n     our 1989 study. In our economic analysis of the car market, \n     we found that the average new passenger car became about \n     1,000 pounds lighter during this period. About half of the \n     weight reduction was due to market forces; the other half was \n     due to CAFE regulation.\n       Concern #3: The ACEEE letter asserts that the Insurance \n     Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has a history of ``shoddy \n     analysis'' on the subject of CAFE and safety.\n       I feel compelled to come to the scientific defense of IIHS \n     by simply noting that IIHS has a strong scientific reputation \n     throughout the world and, although I sometimes disagree with \n     their inferences, I have always found IIHS's scientific \n     work--on this topic as well as on other safety topics--to be \n     meticulous and analytically competent. I would urge you and \n     your colleagues to give a fair hearing to the analyses \n     prepared by IIHS.\n       Concern #4: The ACEEE letter suggests that automakers, in \n     the future, can make light trucks more fuel efficient without \n     reducing their size or weight through technological \n     enhancements. This statement may be correct but it is \n     misleading because the CAFE program does not require or \n     encourage automakers to favor technological enhancements over \n     downsizing and weight reduction.\n       Reducing the size and weight of a light truck generally \n     reduces the cost of producing the vehicle. Making the kinds \n     of engineering changes recommended by ACEEE will generally \n     increase the cost of producing a light truck, a point that \n     ACEEE acknowledges. The CAFE program is designed to let \n     automakers choose how to comply with tighter CAFE \n     requirements, and you can be sure that there will be ``bean \n     counters'' in Detroit and Japan who would prefer to comply \n     with tighter CAFE rules by reducing vehicle size and weight \n     rather than adopting costly engineering changes.\n       The regulatory history of CAFE shows that automakers, when \n     confronted with tough\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\n     CAFE rules, respond with a mix of downsizing, weight \n     reduction, and engineering innovations. For example, from \n     model year 1974 to 1990, a period of improving new car fuel \n     economy, the average ``shadow'' (length times width) of a new \n     car declined by 16% and the average weight of a new car \n     declined by 20%. Engineering improvements such as front-wheel \n     drive and computerized fuel injection systems also increased \n     rapidly. Although automakers ``could'' have complied \n     primarily or even exclusively with engineering improvements, \n     there is nothing about the design or enforcement of the CAFE \n     program that discouraged vehicle manufacturers from reducing \n     vehicle size and weight as part of their compliance strategy. \n     This compliance issue is discussed in more detail in my \n     published critique of the ``Bryan bill'' of ten years ago (JD \n     Graham, ``The Safety Risks of Proposed Fuel Economy \n     Legislation,'' Risk: Issues in Health and Safety, vol. 3(2), \n     Spring 1992, pp. 95-126.) If tougher CAFE rules are now \n     applied to light trucks, there is no reason to believe that \n     downsizing and weight reduction will be ignored by automakers \n     (especially since they represent a cost-SAVING compliance \n     strategy.\n       It should also be noted that the letter by ACEEE touts \n     weight reduction (e.g., through lighter steel materials) as a \n     compliance strategy without acknowledging the safety risks of \n     lighter materials. For example, an SUV may be more likely to \n     rollover if it is constructed with lighter materials, and the \n     driver of a vehicle that crashes into a guardrail is \n     generally safer with more vehicle mass than less vehicle mass \n     (assuming the guardrail is somewhat flexible or penetrable). \n     Heavier vehicles do pose more risk to other motorists in two-\n     vehicle crashes but the government's studies have \n     demonstrated that making small cars heavier will have seven \n     times more safety benefit than making light trucks lighter \n     (and hence less aggressive in two-vehicle crashes).\n       In summary, any discussion of tighter CAFE standards should \n     include a serious, careful evaluation of the potential safety \n     risks. Although safety risks are important, they should not \n     dictate the final policy choice since they need to be \n     weighted against the benefits of enhanced fuel economy, some \n     of them cited in the ACEEE letter.\n       Senator Ashcroft, I certainly hope that these thoughts are \n     helpful. If you should use any of these comments in the \n     policy debate, be careful to attribute the comments to me \n     personally rather than to my Center or University. Please do \n     not hesitate to contact me if you or your staff should have \n     any questions or desire any additional information. You may \n     also be interested to know that we have a working group at my \n     Center looking into these issues, exploring new policy \n     approaches that may save both energy and lives. We will \n     certainly keep you in touch as we make progress on this \n     complex regulatory issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            John D. Graham, Ph.D.,\n     Professor and Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Insurance Institute for\n\n\n                                               Highway Safety,\n\n                                   Arlington, VA, August 27, 1999.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: This is in response to your letter \n     of August 20 requesting information from the Institute about \n     relationships between Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) \n     standards and vehicle safety.\n       Although the relationships between CAFE standards and \n     vehicle safety are difficult to quantify precisely, there is \n     no question that the two are related because smaller/lighter \n     vehicles have much higher occupant fatality rates than \n     larger/heavier vehicles. But the safer larger/heavier \n     vehicles consume more fuel, so the more ``safer'' vehicles a \n     manufacturer sells the more difficult it becomes to meet the \n     CAFE standards.\n       Institute analyses of occupant fatality rates in 1990-95 \n     model passenger vehicles show that cars weighing less than \n     2,500 pounds had 214 deaths per million registered vehicles \n     per year, almost double the rate of 111 deaths per million \n     for cars weighing 4,000 pounds or more. Among utility \n     vehicles the differences are even more pronounced: Those \n     weighing less than 2,500 pounds had an occupant death rate of \n     330, more than three times the rate of 101 for utility \n     vehicles weighing 4,000 pounds or more.\n       It is important to recognize that these differences are due \n     to factors in addition to the greater risks to occupants of \n     lighter vehicles in collisions with heavier ones. Even in \n     single-vehicle crashes, which account for about half of all \n     passenger vehicle occupant deaths, people in lighter vehicles \n     are at greater risk. The occupant death rate in single-\n     vehicle crashes of cars weighing less than 2,500 pounds was \n     83, almost double the rate of 44 for cars weighing 4,000 \n     pounds or more. In the lightest utility vehicles the occupant \n     death rate was 199, again more than three times the rate of \n     65 for utility vehicles weighing 4,000 pounds or more.\n       The key question concerning the influence of CAFE standards \n     on occupant safety is the extent to which these standards \n     distort the marketplace by promoting additional sales of \n     lighter, more fuel efficient vehicles that would not occur if \n     CAFE constraints weren't in effect. Because CAFE standards \n     are set for a manufacturer's fleet sales, it seems likely \n     that raising these requirements for cars and/or light trucks \n     would encourage a full-line manufacturer to further subsidize \n     the sale of its smaller/lighter vehicles that have higher \n     fuel economy ratings. This would help meet the new \n     requirements while continuing to meet the marketplace demand \n     for the manufacturer's much more profitable larger/heavier \n     vehicles. Obviously the potential purchasers of the larger/\n     heavier vehicles are unlikely to be influenced to purchase \n     subsidized small/light vehicles, but at the lower ends of the \n     vehicle size/weight spectrum these subsidies likely would \n     produce a shift in sales towards the lightest and least safe \n     vehicles. The net result would be more occupant deaths than \n     would have occurred if the market were not distorted by CAFE \n     standards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Brian O'Neill,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The 1989 Harvard University/Brookings Institution study \ndetermined that the current CAFE standard of 27.5 miles per gallon is \nresponsible for between a 14 and 27 percent increase in the annual \ntraffic deaths, since the new car fleet must be downsized in order to \nmeet stricter standards.\n  Further, the 1992 National Academy of Sciences study concluded that \nthe downsizing of automobiles due to fuel economy requirements has a \ndirect impact on passenger safety. The study found ``safety and fuel \neconomy are linked because one of the most direct methods manufacturers \ncan use to improve fuel economy is to reduce vehicle size and weight.''\n  Stunning advances are being made to improve safety in other respects. \nTo give away those advances by imposing lighter and lighter vehicles \nraises very, very, very serious and troubling questions.\n  The most troubling conclusion from the study that was conducted by \nthe National Academy of Sciences: ``it may be inevitable that \nsignificant increases in fuel economy can occur only with some negative \nsafety consequences.'' The National Academy of Sciences study also \nsaid, ``the CAFE approach to achieving automotive fuel economy has \ndefects that are sufficiently grievous to warrant careful \nreconsideration of the approach.''\n  The National Academy of Sciences says careful reconsideration of this \nentire approach ought to be undertaken. If the National Academy of \nSciences is suggesting we need to carefully reconsider this approach, I \nam not sure we ought to be in the business of extending the approach or \nenlarging that approach. These standards are killing people, yet there \nare those who want to make the standards even tougher, even more \ndeadly.\n  Based on experience and the research, increasing CAFE standards to 40 \nmiles per gallon, which is less than the proposal supported by the \nPresident and the Vice President, would cause up to about 57,00 deaths \na year. At some point, I hope we will get the attention of policymakers \nand ask ourselves if we really want to sacrifice, on this altar of fuel \neconomy, that many lives a year.\n  Of course, that is included in this special USA Today report. Mr. \nPresident, 46,000 people is equivalent to an entire town, such as \nJoplin, MO, in my home State. The deaths of 46,000 people would wipe \nout the entire town of Blue Springs, MO, or all of Johnson and \nChristian Counties in Missouri.\n  The average gas mileage for passenger vehicles in 1975 was 14 miles \nper gallon; today it is 20 miles per gallon. That averages 7,700 lost \nlives for every gallon of increased fuel efficiency. I am not sure \n46,000 lives are worth it for improved fuel efficiency.\n  There are a number of alternatives to lightening vehicles for fuel \nefficiency. Some of the alternatives are in the process of being \ndeveloped in the capitals of the automotive industry, whether in \nDetroit or other sections around the country. They relate to fuel \ncells. They relate to combination strategies. They relate to large \nflywheels that capture the momentum of a car as it stops, and as that \nmomentum is captured in the flywheel it is regained as the car is \nstarted again. There are many things that are being done.\n  Some in the automotive industry say if we mandate additional fuel \neconomy standards immediately, the research resources which are \nsupporting the development of these new technologies will have to be \nshifted back over into weight reduction techniques immediately to meet \ndemands. So instead of moving toward long-term changes in efficiency, \nwe get to the short run,\n\n[[Page S5201]]\n\nwhich loses more lives and impairs our ability to develop the kind of \nfuel cell technology, the kind of combined energy technologies that \nresult in safer and more efficient cars.\n  I asked the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for an opinion on \nraising CAFE standards and the impact on highway safety. The Institute \nsaid: Even in single vehicle crashes, which account for about half of \nall passenger vehicle occupant deaths, people in lighter vehicles are \nat greater risk. The letter stated: The more safer vehicles the \nmanufacturer sells, the more difficult it becomes to meet CAFE \nstandards.\n\n  The idea of elevated CAFE requirements is at war with the idea of \nsafe occupancy in the automobile. The simple idea or notion that says \nfatalities have been going down while weight has been going down in \ncars, therefore it must be safer to be in lighter cars, is a simple \nnotion, but it is an incorrect notion. It ignores the other factors. It \nignores factors such as seatbelt use, airbag deployment, divided \nhighways, the kinds of things highway design has done to elevate safety \nstandards.\n  I make one thing very clear: I am in favor of promoting cleaner air. \nI believe we must be responsible environmentally. However, there is a \nlevel at which we ought to consider the risk to human lives. The reason \nwe want clean air is that dirty air impairs the health and well-being \nof human beings. So the reasons we are pursuing are the same. We want \nto save people who might be included in these gruesome statistics of \n46,000 people dying. While I want to have cleaner air, I don't think it \nis necessarily done by putting people on the altar of lighter vehicles \nand having them lose their lives when we can find other ways of \nachieving that.\n  Consumers are not choosing smaller cars. They look at convenience. \nThey look at safety. They look at where their children are going to be \nriding, and how they will get there. They are buying larger cars. \nSafety is one of the three main reasons people purchase SUVs. Small \ncars are only 18 percent of all vehicles on the road, but they account \nfor 37 percent of vehicle deaths. You have to think about that for a \nmoment. That is a startling statistic. Small cars are only 18 percent \nof the vehicles on the road. Yet they account for 37 percent of the \nvehicle deaths--or that was the figure in 1997. I doubt if the data has \nsignificantly changed.\n\n  Some people argue that the reason the small cars are troublesome is \nbecause they get into wrecks with bigger cars; they are getting into \naccidents with SUVs. Frankly, the facts do not support that claim. \nBased on figures from the National Highway Traffic Safety Board, only 1 \npercent of all small car deaths involved collisions with mid-size or \nlarge SUVs--1 percent. One percent of their accidents, yet their \nfatality rate is 37 percent; in spite of the fact they are only 18 \npercent of the cars on the road, 37 percent of all the traffic deaths.\n  Car-buying experts have said that only 7 percent of new vehicle \nshoppers say they will consider buying a small car. According to this \nsource, 82 percent who have purchased small cars say they will not buy \nanother.\n  Safety-conscious consumers--certainly my constituents in Missouri--\nunderstand the need for safety and are buying larger vehicles. But now \nWashington wants to tell residents in my State what kind of car they \ncan buy. Washington wants to increase the level of risk, basically, \nthat will attend driving those cars. The lighter the car, according to \nthe National Academy of Sciences and the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Board, the higher the risk.\n  We fight drunk driving. We mandate seatbelt use. We require \nmanufacturers to install airbags. Yet today we are being asked to tell \nthe House we will not accept their policy of providing for Americans \nthe opportunity of choosing cars that are heavy enough to be safer. We \nwant to mandate, somehow, that we take additional pounds out of cars.\n  I was stunned by the data developed by our own agencies that said if \nyou add 100 pounds, you save 300 lives. I suppose it is not \nscientifically correct to say if you took 100 pounds out, you would \nlose 300 lives--maybe you would. You might lose more. I would hate to \nbe the person who had to make up the list of the 300 names, or of the \nthousand names, or however many names there are, of the lives that \nwould be lost because we refused to adopt an approach which says: We \nhave gone far enough with the Federal mandates on weight reduction and \nfuel economy. We should allow what is already happening in the \nautomotive industry, a tremendous surge of research and technology, \nmuch of it spurred by our own incentives and initiatives, to develop \nalternative technologies which can provide for the transportation needs \nthat we have with greater efficiency, without putting so many people at \nrisk.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this motion, the motion which would \ninstruct the conferees not to accept section 318 of the bill as passed \nby the House of Representatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield such time to the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom California as she may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to join the \nSenator from Washington in this debate. I have just listened to the \ncomments of the distinguished Senator from Missouri. I must say I \nprofoundly differ with them. But let's for a moment say the Senator is \ncorrect. Then what is the fear of doing a study to take a look at the \nsafety implications of SUVs and light trucks in single and multicar \naccidents? If the other side is so sure they are correct, they have \nnothing to worry about from a study being done. So why the gag order \nthat prevents the Government from looking at this?\n  I submit to you, Mr. President, in direct debate with the Senator, \nthat as fuel economy standards have gone up, fatality rates per million \nmiles traveled have actually decreased. That decrease is rather large. \nI wish I had a big chart, but you can kind of see it here. These are \nthe fuel economy on-road miles per gallon going up, and here are the \nfatality rates to the year 2000 actually going down.\n  Second, Ford Motor Company, by 2003, will have on the market a hybrid \nSUV which will get 40 miles per gallon. And Ford says that its 2003 \nversion of its Escape sports utility vehicle will get twice that of \nother small SUVs, four times that of big ones. This comes from \ntechnology, from a hybrid powerplant, a small gasoline engine coupled \nto an electric motor. This SUV will get 40 miles to the gallon. Let me \nread a statement by the National Highway Traffic Safety Board:\n\n       Collisions between cars and light trucks account for more \n     than one half of all fatalities in crashes between light duty \n     vehicles. More than 60 percent of all fatalities in light \n     vehicle side impacts occur when the striking vehicle is a \n     light truck. SUVs are nearly three times as likely to kill \n     drivers of other vehicles during collisions than are cars.\n\n  According to a study by the National Crash Analysis Center, an \norganization funded by both the Government and the auto industry:\n\n       Occupants of a SUV are just as likely as occupants of a car \n     to die, once the vehicle is involved in an accident.\n\n  The explanation, of course, is that SUVs have high rollover rates; 62 \npercent of SUV deaths are in rollover accidents, but only 22 percent of \ncar deaths are in rollover accidents. So you cannot say that the SUV/\nlight truck is a safe vehicle, even as a heavier vehicle. The \nstatistics do not support it.\n  Let me also say that Ford Motor Company itself, which depends on SUVs \nfor much of its profit, has acknowledged that they cause serious safety \nand environmental problems. Let me quote from the New York Times:\n\n       In its first corporate citizenship report issued at the \n     company's annual shareholders' meeting here, Ford said that \n     the vehicles contributed more than cars to global warming, \n     emitted more smog-causing pollution, and endangered other \n     motorists. The auto maker said that it would keep building \n     them because they provide needed profit, but would seek \n     technological solutions to the problems and look for \n     alternatives to big vehicles.\n\n  So here is a major American manufacturer admitting that SUVs are not \nsafer.\n  Let me finally, on this point, quote a GAO report:\n\n       The unprecedented increase in the proportion of light cars \n     on the road that occurred between 1976 and 1978, and 1986 and \n     1988, did not have the dire consequences for safety that \n     would be expected if fatality rates were simply a function of \n     car weight. Not only did the total fatality rate decrease, \n     but the fatality rate for small cars, those at the greatest \n     risk, if it is assumed that heavier cars\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\n     are inherently safer than lighter cars, also declined \n     sharply.\n\n  So why be afraid of the study? If those who say safety is a problem \nare so sure, let's take a good look at it. Let's have unbiased sources \ntake a look at it.\n  The reason I feel so strongly is because I do believe that global \nwarming is a real and vital phenomenon; that it is taking place all \nacross the land, and that the largest single thing we can do to reduce \nglobal warming is to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide.\n  By putting the same fuel efficiency standards on SUVs and light \ntrucks as are on sedans, we essentially remove 240 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide each year from the atmosphere.\n  This year's House Transportation appropriations bill once again \ncontains the provision which prevents this issue from even being \nconsidered. This is the seventh consecutive year this gag order has \nappeared. Why are they so afraid of a study?\n  If you add to what the Senator from Washington said--and I think he \nis absolutely correct--that we are witnessing a new phenomenon this \nyear in increasing gasoline prices which have exacerbated our Nation's \ndependence on OPEC and foreign oil, this policy does not make sense \nfrom another viewpoint. It costs the consumer more. Frankly, I am \nsurprised there is this resistance. Since last year's debate, gasoline \nprices reached $2 per gallon in many parts of my State, and they are \napproaching $2.50 through much of the Midwest. This should harden our \nresolve to take a look at the situation.\n  Today, the United States, with only 4 percent of the world's \npopulation, consumes 25 percent of the world's energy. Our CO2 \nemissions from vehicles alone exceed the total CO2 emissions of carbon \ndioxide from all but three other countries in the world today.\n  My State of California is the third largest consumer of gasoline in \nthe world, behind only the United States and Japan and ahead of \nvirtually every other country. So California has a huge stake in this. \nWe use more gasoline than China, Germany, and Russia. The situation is \nmade worse by this loophole. SUVs and light trucks, which are as much \npassenger vehicles as station wagons and sedans, are only required \ntoday to have 20.7 miles per gallon per fleet versus 27.5 miles per \ngallon for automobiles.\n  I am an SUV owner. I own three Jeeps. I love my Jeeps, but I do not \nsee why they should not be just as fuel efficient as the sedan we also \ndrive. At today's prices, light truck and SUV owners are spending an \nadditional $25 billion a year at the pump because of this loophole. If \nSUVs simply achieve the same fuel economy standards as automobiles, \nconsumers would save hundreds of dollars a year and thousands of \ndollars over the life of a vehicle.\n  As this chart shows, the typical SUV burns about 861 gallons of fuel \neach year. The average gasoline price, if it is at $1.50 cents a \ngallon, costs consumers $1,290 a year. At $2, the cost increases to \nmore than $1,700.\n  If we simply close this SUV loophole and require these vehicles to \nmeet the same standards as automobiles, SUVs would burn 213 fewer \ngallons of gasoline a year. That is a savings of 1 million barrels of \noil a year, and it is a savings of 240 million tons of carbon dioxide \ngoing into the air. It is also a savings for the consumer of $318 each \nyear. At $2, the savings is $420 a year. The real clincher is the \npollution argument, and that is, the savings of 240 million tons of CO2 \nfrom going into the air and creating a greenhouse effect that warms the \nEarth.\n  We also know that raising CAFE standards is the quickest and most \nsingle effective step we can take in this direction. I happen to \nbelieve global warming is real. I took a day and went to the Scripts \nInstitute of Oceanography in San Diego and had a briefing. What I heard \nthere doubly convinced me it is a real phenomenon.\n  The weather is getting hotter, and the ten hottest years on record \nhave all occurred since 1986; 1980 to 1999 was the hottest 20-year \nperiod ever recorded, and 1998 was the hottest year in recorded \nhistory. Yesterday the temperature in San Francisco, a usually very \ncold city, was 104 degrees.\n\n  The Earth's average temperature has risen 1.3 degrees in the last 100 \nyears, and computer models predict an increase of 2 to 6 degrees over \nthe next century. Because of our temperate climate, the increase in the \nUnited States will be on the high end of that figure; meaning we will \ngain about 6 degrees in temperature over the next century.\n  What does that mean? That means warmer weather in my State will make \nwater even more scarce. It means it will destroy certain agricultural \ncrops. It means it will lead to more frequent and intense Sierra forest \nfires and serious flooding at certain times of the year.\n  In normal winters, our water gets stored in snowpacks until the \nspring when it is needed for drinking and farming, but warmer winters \nwould cause significant amounts of winter precipitation to change from \nsnow to rain, becoming runoff or, worse, floods into low-lying flood-\nprone areas, such as Sacramento. Drought conditions will worsen in the \nsouthern and central valley parts of my State, destroying water-\ndependent crops, such as rice, cotton, and alfalfa.\n  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, sea \nlevels could rise 2 feet over the next century, further flooding low-\nlying areas, and greatly increasing the penetration of salt water into \nthe California delta, the source of drinking water for 22 million \npeople.\n  That is why I am concerned. It is a legitimate reason to be concerned \nand it is doubly legitimate if you know something that is doable and \ncan be done with no adverse impact, is, in fact, being done by some \nmanufacturers and foreign manufacturers, and this Congress will not \neven take a look at what effect it would have on pollution, what effect \nit would have on safety. It is an ostrich syndrome par excellence.\n  Mr. President, 117 million Americans live in areas where smog makes \nthe air unsafe to breathe. Asthma of children is on the uptake, and \nroughly half of this air pollution is caused by cars and trucks.\n  If we increase fuel efficiency, we consume less gasoline. This \ndecreases smog and air pollutants. Given all these facts, I cannot \nfigure out why anyone would not want to at least study whether CAFE \nstandards should be updated. For 7 years there has been a gag order: Do \nnot even take a look; both sides are certain. Senators Gorton, Bryan, \nand myself on one side; Senators Abraham, Levin, and Ashcroft on \nanother. Let's settle it. Let's take a look. Let's have an independent \nstudy. Let's see who is right. It does not bother me to do that. I do \nnot understand why it bothers anyone else.\n  Half of all new vehicles sold in this country are SUVs and light duty \ntrucks, and this is what makes this so compelling. This becomes then a \nstranglehold on energy efficiency, and it has produced an American \nfleet with the worst fuel efficiency since 1980. We are going backwards \nbecause of it. We are polluting the air more because of it. We are \ncontributing to global warming more because of it.\n  The United States saves 3 million barrels of oil each day because of \nthe current fuel efficiency standards. Closing the SUV loophole adds 1 \nmillion additional barrels. That is a total savings of 4 million \nbarrels of oil each day.\n  Last year, opponents of our amendment argued that boosting CAFE \nstandards would lead to increased traffic fatalities, layoffs, and \nhigher sticker prices. If our opponents again are so sure of their \narguments, what is the harm of allowing the Department of \nTransportation to study the costs and benefits of higher CAFE \nstandards?\n  Last year, I listened to some of my colleagues cite their concerns \nagain about traffic safety. Based on what we heard today, I believe it \nis naive to think that bigger cars are simply safer.\n  I was going to buy a bigger car not too long ago. I watched the crash \ntests. I saw this expensive, heavy sedan crumple up like an accordion. \nI decided not to buy it; it was not safer.\n  The New York Times recently reported on tests conducted by the \nNational Highway Transportation Safety Administration to demonstrate \nthe propensity of SUVs to roll over. Here is a particularly poignant \nquote from the article:\n\n       Because it is taller, heavier and more rigid than a car, an \n     SUV or pickup is more than twice as likely to kill the driver \n     of the other vehicle in a collision. Yet partly because these \n     so-called light trucks roll over so often, their occupants \n     have roughly the same chance of dying in a crash.\n\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\n\n  So not only is an SUV driver more apt to kill someone else, but that \nsame driver is not any safer. I think this should be disturbing to \nanyone who gets into any moving vehicle.\n  With regard to job losses in the domestic auto industry, opponents of \nour amendment fail to offer any empirical evidence. A recent study by \nthe nonpartisan American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy \nconcludes that the consumer savings at the pump would actually \ntranslate to a net increase of 244,000 jobs nationwide, with 47,000 of \nthese new jobs occurring in the auto industry. Let me repeat: The \nprojections are, it will not mean a loss of jobs; it will mean a gain \nof jobs. And that gain of jobs has translated into a net increase of \n244,000 jobs nationwide and 47,000 in the auto industry.\n  I remember when automakers told us they could not make cars safer; \nthey could not meet the original CAFE standards; they could not add \nseatbelts or catalytic converters; But they did. They said regulations \nand mandates would drive them out of business, but they did not.\n  These same arguments have been recycled for decades.\n  In 1974, a representative for Ford Motor Company testified in front \nof Congress that the implementation of CAFE standards would lead to a \nfleet of nothing but sub-Pinto-sized automobiles. Of course, that did \nnot happen. Our Nation's fleet of vehicles are as diverse as ever and \nprobably more diverse. The largest sedans and station wagons today get \nfar better fuel economy than the 1974 Pinto. It is really a tribute \nboth to the industry and to that industry's ingenuity. It is also a \ntribute to the CAFE or fuel efficiency program.\n  One of the reasons that, for a while, the American automobile \nmanufacturers lost their cutting edge in the 1970s was their reluctance \nto do the research and development necessary to build innovative new \nvehicles. But I am very proud to say that today's car companies are far \nmore efficient and innovative and have the technology to increase the \nfuel economy of light duty trucks and SUVs to much higher levels than \nachieved by today's automobiles.\n\n  I am disappointed that the automotive companies continue lobbying for \nthis gag order. To me, it is like pushing things back into the 1970s, \nwhere the Japanese made all the advances, and the American industry \nrefused to change its models, to move with the times, to put in the \nresearch and development that is necessary to build a better \nautomobile. I thought those days were behind us.\n  What do we have to lose by allowing the Department of Transportation \nto simply do their job and determine whether it makes sense to increase \nCAFE standards?\n  Let me just touch on a couple of the safety fallacies.\n  Again, in fact, vehicle fatality rates have been cut in half since \nCAFE standards were introduced. I pointed that out in the beginning. \nOnly by stretches of fallacious logic do opponents contrive higher \ndeath rates to the CAFE standards.\n  Let me give you some of these fallacies:\n  First, the CAFE standards imply smaller vehicles.\n  The answer: Higher CAFE is achieved by technology improvement, not by \ndownsizing.\n  Secondly, that lighter vehicles imply higher fatalities.\n  The answer: Crashworthiness is determined not by size or weight but \nby design. Today's compacts are safer than large cars of 20 years ago.\n  And finally, unbalanced risk assessment.\n  The answer: Studies based on harm to small-car occupants neglect the \nrisks that larger vehicles impose or inflict on others.\n  So I am hopeful that because of the increase in fuel prices, because \nof the added cost to the consumer by the gag order, by the fact that \nevery consumer, if this were to come to pass, would save $318, with an \naverage cost of $1.50, and $504 with a higher cost a year, we can \nclearly make a showing that a study is necessary at this time.\n  I thank the Chair and also the Senator from Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the opponents are absent for the time \nbeing, discussing what is at least a possible settlement of this \nmatter. As a consequence, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I might \nneed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, we are obviously in the midst of an \nongoing discussion that has been held on a number of occasions here \nover the issue of CAFE standards and this motion, obviously, to \ninstruct the Senate conferees to either modify or strike the moratorium \non CAFE standards in the House bill.\n  I rise to speak in opposition to this motion to instruct.\n  Let me begin, first, by outlining the case against raising corporate \nfuel economy standards, or CAFE. Then what I would like to discuss is \nwhat would actually happen as a matter of law if the CAFE freeze were \nlifted.\n  First, increased CAFE requirements would cost American auto workers \ntheir jobs.\n  They put American automobile manufacturers at a competitive \ndisadvantage vis-a-vis foreign manufacturers. Let me explain what I \nmean by this.\n  The Federal Government currently mandates that auto manufacturers \nmaintain an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and \n20.7 miles per gallon for minivans, sport utility vehicles, and light \ntrucks. To meet increased CAFE requirements, automakers must make \ndesign and material changes to their vehicles. Those changes cost \nmoney. They force American manufacturers to build cars that are \nsmaller, less powerful, less popular to consumers, and, as I will \nindicate in a moment and as several of the preceding speakers have \nnoted, less safe.\n  In 1992, the National Academy of Sciences found that raising CAFE \nrequirements to 35 miles per gallon would increase the average \nvehicle's cost by about $2,500. Japanese automakers have escaped these \ncosts because sky high gasoline prices in their home markets forced \nthem to make smaller, lighter cars years ago. Increased CAFE \nrequirements will continue to favor Japanese automakers, and that means \nthey will continue to place an uneven burden on American automobile \nworkers.\n  The American auto industry accounts for one in seven U.S. jobs. \nSteel, transportation, electronics, literally dozens of industries \nemploying thousands upon thousands of Americans depend on the health of \nour auto industry. It is not just people in Michigan or people in Ohio; \nit is people across our Nation whose livelihoods are linked to the \nsuccess of the American automobile manufacturing industry.\n  In their letter of June 7, the United Auto Workers wrote:\n\n       * * * further increases in CAFE could lead to the loss of \n     thousands of jobs at automotive plants across this country \n     that are associated with the production of SUVs, light trucks \n     and full size automobiles.\n\n  In a June 9 letter, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters \nwrites: The CAFE program has not helped manufacturers reduce U.S. \nconsumption of gasoline.\n\n       Instead, it has created competitive disadvantages for the \n     very companies that provide job opportunities for millions of \n     Americans.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of these letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: When the Senate considers the FY 2001 \n     Transportation Appropriations bill, we understand that \n     amendments may be offered, including the Gorton-Feinstein-\n     Bryan clean car resolution, to eliminate or\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\n     modify the current moratorium on increases in the fuel \n     economy standards for autos and trucks (commonly known as \n     CAFE, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards). The UAW \n     strongly opposes such amendments and urges you to vote \n     against them.\n       The UAW supported the CAFE standards when they were \n     originally enacted. We believe these standards have helped to \n     improve the fuel economy achieved by motor vehicles (which \n     has doubled since 1974). This improvement in fuel economy has \n     saved money for consumers and reduced oil consumption by our \n     nation.\n       However, for a number of reasons the UAW believes it would \n     be unwise to increase the fuel economy standards at this \n     time. First, any increase in the CAFE standard for sport \n     utility vehicles (SUVs) and light trucks would have a \n     disproportionately negative impact on the Big Three \n     automakers because their fleets contain a much higher \n     percentage of these vehicles than other manufacturers. \n     Second, any increases in CAFE standards for cars or trucks \n     would also discriminate against full line producers like the \n     Big Three automakers because their fleets contain a higher \n     percentage of full size automobiles and larger SUVs and light \n     trucks. The current fuel economy standards are based on a \n     flat miles per gallon number, rather than a percentage \n     increase formula, and are therefore more difficult to achieve \n     for full line producers. Taking these two factors together, \n     the net result is that further increases in CAFE could lead \n     to the loss of thousands of jobs at automotive plants across \n     this country that are associated with the production of SUVs, \n     light trucks and full size automobiles.\n       The UAW believes that additional gains in fuel economy can \n     and should be achieved through the cooperative research and \n     development programs currently being undertaken by the U.S. \n     government and the Big Three automakers in the ``Partnership \n     for a New Generation of Vehicles'' (PNGV). This approach can \n     help to produce the breakthrough technologies that will \n     achieve significant advances in fuel economy, without the \n     adverse jobs impact that could be created by further \n     increases in CAFE standards. PNGV is working. This spring, \n     PNGV achieved one of its major goals with the introduction of \n     a supercar concept by each of the Big Three automakers.\n       Accordingly, the UAW urges you to oppose any amendments \n     that seek to eliminate or modify the current freeze on \n     increases in motor vehicle fuel economy standards. Thank you \n     for considering our views on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                   International Brotherhood of Teamsters--AFL-CIO\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: The United States Senate may soon be asked to \n     vote on a provision that currently prevents the Department of \n     Transportation from increasing the Corporate Average Fuel \n     Economy (CAFE) standards for passenger cars and light trucks. \n     Opponents of this provision argue that higher standards will \n     benefit consumers and help the U.S. reduce oil imports and \n     gasoline consumption. We disagree, and urge you to vote \n     against any amendments to eliminate or modify the current \n     moratorium on these standards.\n       Many observers feel CAFE is a case of good intentions gone \n     awry. The law's original purpose was to improve automotive \n     fuel economy, and in so doing, cut our nation's dependence on \n     foreign oil. Unfortunately, although fuel economy for cars \n     and trucks has risen substantially over the past 25 years, \n     our reliance on imported oil has not declined. In fact, our \n     nation's dependence on imported oil has risen to more than 55 \n     percent today from 35 percent in 1975 when the law was \n     passed. By any measure, CAFE has not delivered the benefits \n     it promised.\n       Even worse, CAFE produces serious side effects when it \n     comes to American jobs. Rather than creating a level playing \n     field for all manufacturers, the CAFE system has actually \n     worked against U.S. manufacturers and autoworkers. The law \n     gives small car manufacturers a competitive advantage. Of \n     course, these manufacturers are primarily foreign-based, and \n     they import many of the cars and light trucks that they sell. \n     In addition, this situation has provided an incentive for the \n     Asian automakers to enter the mid-size and large car market \n     segments at the expense of the traditional U.S. auto \n     companies.\n       Domestic autoworkers need to be able to build the larger \n     cars and trucks American consumers want. Today, American \n     consumers are demanding the safety and utility of trucks, \n     including vans, mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pick-\n     ups--a market in which U.S.-based manufacturers and \n     autoworkers produce eight out of ten vehicles. Increases in \n     light truck CAFE standards would erode the dominant position \n     of U.S. manufacturers and autoworkers in this market segment. \n     It would also adversely affect the jobs of Teamsters, who \n     transport materials, components and finished vehicles across \n     the country.\n       Increasing vehicle fuel economy is a laudable goal. But the \n     CAFE program has not helped manufacturers achieve that \n     objective, and it has not reduced U.S. consumption of \n     gasoline. Instead, it has created competitive disadvantages \n     for the very companies that provide job opportunities for \n     millions of Americans. Consequently, we respectfully urge you \n     to oppose any amendment to strike or modify the current \n     moratorium on increasing CAFE standards for light trucks.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael E. Mathis,\n                          Director, Government Affairs Department.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. In addition, raising CAFE standards will cost lives. On \nthe issue of vehicle safety, for a number of years, the Federal \nGovernment has taken the lead in mandating additional safety features \non automobiles in an attempt to reduce the number of lives lost in auto \naccidents. How ironic to learn that Federal CAFE requirements have been \ncosting lives all this time.\n  The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that between 2,700 and \n4,500 drivers and passengers die every year as a result of CAFE-induced \nauto downsizing. Last year, USA Today, in a special section devoted to \nthe issue of CAFE standards and auto safety, calculated CAFE's \ncumulative death toll at 46,000 lives. Even the National Highway \nTraffic and Safety Administration, which runs the CAFE program, has \nrecognized the deadly effects of CAFE standards. In its publication \n``Small Car Safety in the 1980s,'' NHTSA explains that smaller cars are \nless crash worthy than large ones, even in single-vehicle accidents. \nSmall cars have twice the death rate of drivers and passengers in \ncrashes as larger cars, and smaller light trucks will mean even more \nfatalities. These trucks and SUVs have higher centers of gravity and so \nthey are more prone to rollovers. If SUV and truck weights are reduced, \nthousands more will die.\n  On the safety issue, two additional items: First of all, it is true \nthat since CAFE standards came into effect, the overall death rates on \nour roads have gotten better. However, this fails to note some pretty \nsignificant information. We have had safety belts and airbags, a \nvariety of other safety devices included and, in some cases, mandated \nfor usage in automobiles and other vehicles. Our roads have gotten \nbetter. For all these reasons, the overall cumulative effect in terms \nof safety has been better over the last 25 years. But the studies that \nhave specifically focused on the impact of CAFE standards, the impact \nof lighter vehicles, the impact of less crash-resistant vehicles has \nshown that the problem in terms of CAFE is not to make cars and \nvehicles more safe but to make them less so. That is the bottom line.\n  Moreover, in relationship to SUVs in particular, these are vehicles \nthat are more crash prone. Therefore, the notion of making them less \nsafe as a product of a CAFE reform effort would be a strike at the \nheart of the safety of the American motorist.\n  In addition, increased CAFE standards reduce consumer choice. CAFE \naverages are determined by the buying pattern of the American public. \nU.S. automakers are challenged by the current CAFE standards because \nthe American consumer has demonstrated time and again a preference for \nminivans and SUVs, even though alternatives that are more fuel \nefficient are readily available. We don't need Government mandates to \nforce automakers to produce fuel-efficient cars. If consumers want \nvehicles which get better gas mileage no matter what the cost of \ngasoline, they have a wide choice of vehicles from which to choose.\n  If, as the supporters of new CAFE standards contend, consumers crave \nmore fuel-efficient vehicles, then more small cars and vehicles would \nbe purchased. It is supply and demand. Yet despite a variety of choices \nfor fuel-efficient vehicles which get as much as 40 to 50 miles per \ngallon, these vehicles account for less than 1 percent of total vehicle \nsales. Why? The answer is simple: The public demands the convenience of \nvehicles with a larger carrying capacity and vehicles that are safer. \nThese vehicles, minivans, and SUVs are the class of vehicle that will \nbe eliminated should new CAFE standards be enacted, and the livelihood \nof the thousands of Americans employed in the production of such \nvehicles will be threatened.\n\n  The Americans Farm Bureau writes:\n\n       Full size pickups are the tools of the agricultural trade \n     and they do, indeed, haul everything from bales of hay to \n     farm equipment to livestock feed on an every day basis. \n     Higher CAFE standards would almost inevitably lead to less \n     powerful engines and weaker frames and suspension or even the \n     elimination of some full size truck models.\n\n  We should continue to let the market, not the Government, choose the\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\ntypes of vehicles produced by American automobile manufacturers. \nConsumers will suffer if their choices are narrowed. Automakers and \ntheir employees will suffer if they are forced to make cars the public \nsimply does not want.\n  Again, on the choice issue, this is precisely what happened when the \nCAFE standards were first adopted. In a statement before the Consumer \nSubcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, Dr. Marina Whitman of \nGeneral Motors noted:\n\n       In 1982, we were forced to close two assembly plants which \n     had been fully converted to produce our new highly fuel \n     efficient compact and mid-size cars. The cost of the \n     conversions was $130 million. But the plants were closed \n     because demands for those cars did not develop during the \n     period of sharply declining gasoline prices.\n\n  Our automakers simply cannot afford to pay the fines imposed on them \nif they fail to reach CAFE standards or to build cars that Americans \nwon't buy. In either case, the real victims are American workers and \nAmerican consumers. Proponents of CAFE argue that it will reduce U.S. \ndependence on foreign oil and gasoline consumption. Since the program \nwas enacted 25 years ago, the U.S. fleet average fuel economy has more \nthan doubled. However, U.S. oil imports have risen from 36 percent to \nover 50 percent, and gasoline consumption has increased during that \nvery same timeframe.\n  Thus raising CAFE will not reduce our dependency on foreign oil, but \nit will reduce job opportunities, consumer choice, and the automobile \nsafety we presently enjoy.\n  Mr. President, let me explain why the entire CAFE issue itself is \nalmost obsolete. In just a few years, American automobile workers, \nworking individually as well as through partnerships with Government, \nacademia, and suppliers, will be bringing to the market advanced fuel-\nefficient technologies--cars powered by electric, hybrid electric, \nclean burn, and fuel cell engines, and other promising new \ntechnologies. Toyota became the first manufacturer to mass produce a \nhybrid electric passenger car, the Prius, which will be on sale in the \nU.S. later this year. Several companies, such as Volkswagon, are \nalready selling vehicles that utilize advanced technology to achieve 40 \nto 50 percent greater fuel efficiency than conventional gasoline-\npowered vehicles without sacrificing performance.\n  American automobile manufacturers are close behind. They continue to \ninvest almost $1 billion every year in research to develop more fuel-\nefficient vehicles, and those efforts will soon bear fruit. In fact, \njust today, GM announced it will offer a fuel-efficient SUV capable of \nhandling ethanol-based fuel. As we heard from previous speakers, the \nFord Motor Company is in the process of bringing forth vehicles which \nwill be hybrid fuel efficient within just a few years.\n  Clearly, there already exists fierce competition among automakers to \nmarket more fuel-efficient vehicles. So why should we even consider \nturning to the punitive and disruptive methods of Federal mandates \nthrough CAFE standards to increase fuel efficiency for American \nvehicles. This is going to happen, Mr. President. The market will drive \nit, and it will be done in the most efficient fashion if we allow the \ncompanies to do what they are already in the process of accomplishing, \ninstead of grabbing control in Washington and once again dictating \nthrough a bureaucracy the way America ought to do business.\n  Since 1993, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles has \nbrought together Government agencies and the auto industry to conduct \njoint research, research that is making significant progress that will \nbreach the gap to real world applications after 2000. By enhancing \nresearch cooperation, PNGV is helping our auto industry develop \nvehicles more easily recyclable, have lower emissions, and can achieve \nup to triple the fuel efficiency of today's mid-size family sedans--all \nthis while producing cars that retain performance, utility, safety, and \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, we are making solid progress--progress toward making \nvehicles that achieve greater fuel economy without sacrificing the \nqualities consumers demand or the safety we should all expect, progress \nthat will render CAFE requirements obsolete.\n  Mr. President, I want to address the contention that lifting the CAFE \nfreeze will simply allow the Department of Transportation to study the \nneed to raise CAFE standards. Of course, that sounds rather benign on \nits face, and a study alone is something we do often around here. But \nthe way the rules and the law are currently set up, that is simply not \nthe case. As a matter of law, lifting the freeze will lead to higher \nCAFE standards on sports utility vehicles and light trucks. Public Law \n94-163, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, requires the \nDepartment of Transportation to set CAFE standards each year at--get \nthis, Mr. President--the maximum feasible average fuel economy level.\n  The Secretary is not authorized to just study CAFE. The Secretary \nmust act by regulation to set new CAFE standards each year. The last \nyear prior to the CAFE freeze--1994--the administration began \nrulemaking on new CAFE standards. DOT's April 6, 1994, proposal \nreferenced feasible higher CAFE levels for trucks of 15 to 35 percent \nabove the current standard. Since 1995, Congress has refused to allow \nDOT to unilaterally increase the standards, as it has in the past.\n\n  We have recognized that it is our duty as legislators to make policy \nin this important area of economic and environmental concern. I believe \nthat very strongly. I think it ought to be the Congress that steps up \nto the responsibility of making these kinds of determinations, which \nhave such overriding and such pervasive impact on the economy of \nvirtually every one of the 50 States.\n  Now, however, the proposal before us would move us back in the \ndirection of delegating these critical economic decisions to the \nbureaucracy, the Department of Transportation. The automobile industry \nis a critical component of our overall economy. Indeed, the future of \nour economic growth depends on the continued health of the automobile \nmanufacturing sector. That is why I believe that we in Congress should \nmake the policy decisions related to CAFE, not regulators at the \nDepartment of Transportation, or anywhere else.\n  In summary, raising CAFE standards for light trucks and SUVs will \ncost American jobs. It will undermine our automobile industry's global \ncompetitiveness. It will compromise passenger safety. It will reduce \nconsumer choice, and it will not reduce America's dependence on foreign \noil sources. Nor, in my judgment, as I think some of our colleagues who \nwill soon be speaking will indicate, will it make that much of an \nimpact with respect to fuel efficiency. Therefore, I urge my colleagues \nto vote against this motion to instruct the conferees to strike the \nCAFE freeze provision.\n  I yield the floor and withhold the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, if the Senator from Michigan wants to \nspeak, I will not ask for a quorum call.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am prepared to go.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator may go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the CAFE law, which the House of \nRepresentatives very properly has kept on the shelf--is a bill with \nmany flaws. I am just going to focus briefly on a couple of those \nflaws.\n  First, the CAFE law, as it is written, and which would be put back \ninto force, does not allow for the consideration of some very highly \nrelevant factors that should be considered in the regulatory process. \nOne of these is safety. Senator Ashcroft--and I believe Senator \nAbraham--have also made reference to analyses of losses of life that \nhave resulted from lighter vehicles.\n  There has been a study and analysis, which has been referred to at \nsome length, by USA Today which shows that 46,000 people have died \nbecause of the CAFE law who otherwise would not have died. I want to \nread very briefly from this article:\n\n       . . . in the 24 years since a landmark law to conserve \n     fuel, big cars have shrunk to less-safe sizes and small cars \n     have poured onto roads. As a result, 46,000 people have died \n     in crashes they would have survived in bigger, heavier cars.\n\n  This is according to the USA Today's analysis of crash data since \n1975, when\n\n[[Page S5206]]\n\nthe Energy Policy and Conservation Act was passed.\n  The Energy Policy and Conservation Act and the corporate average fuel \neconomy (CAFE) standards it imposed have improved fuel efficiency. The \naverage of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads is 20 miles per gallon \nversus 14 in 1975. But the cost has been roughly 7,700 deaths for every \nmile per gallon gained, the analysis shows.\n  These figures can be disputed, although this is a very lengthy and \nvery objective analysis in the USA Today of July 2, 1999.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at \nthis time.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       A USA TODAY analysis of previously unpublished fatality \n     statistics discovers that 46,000 people have died because of \n     a 1970s-era push for greater fuel efficiency that has led to \n     smaller cars.\n       Californian James Braggs, who helps other people buy cars, \n     knows he'll squirm when his daughter turns 16.\n       ``She's going to want a little Chevy Cavalier or something. \n     I'd rather take the same 10 to 12 thousand bucks and put it \n     into a 3-year-old (full-size Mercury) Grand Marquis, for \n     safety.\n       ``I want to go to her high school graduation, not her \n     funeral.''\n       Hundreds of people are killed in small-car wrecks each year \n     who would survive in just slightly bigger, heavier vehicles, \n     government and insurance industry research shows.\n       More broadly, in the 24 years since a landmark law to \n     conserve fuel, big cars have shrunk to less-safe sizes and \n     small cars have poured onto roads. As a result, 46,000 people \n     have died in crashes they would have survived in bigger, \n     heavier cars, according to USA TODAY's analysis of crash data \n     since 1975, when the Energy Policy and Conservation Act was \n     passed. The law and the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) \n     standards it imposed have improved fuel efficiency. The \n     average of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads is 20 miles per \n     gallon vs. 14 mpg in 1975.\n       But the cost has been roughly 7,700 deaths for every mile \n     per gallon gained, the analysis shows.\n       Small cars--those no bigger or heavier than Chevrolet \n     Cavalier or Dodge Neon--comprise 18% of all vehicles on the \n     road, according to an analysis of R.L. Polk registration \n     data. Yet they accounted for 37% of vehicle deaths in 1997--\n     12,144 people--according to latest available government \n     figures. That's about twice the death rate in big cars, such \n     as Dodge Intrepid, Chevrolet Impala, Ford Crown Victoria.\n       ``We have a small-car problem. If you want to solve the \n     safety puzzle, get rid of small cars,'' says Brian O'Neill, \n     president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The \n     institute, supported by auto insurers, crash-tests more \n     vehicles, more violently, than all but the federal \n     government.\n       Little cars have big disadvantages in crashes. They have \n     less space to absorb crash forces. The less the car absorbs, \n     the more the people inside have to.\n       And small cars don't have the weight to protect themselves \n     in crashes with other vehicles. When a small car and a larger \n     one collide, the bigger car stops abruptly; that's bad \n     enough. But the little one slams to a stop, then instantly \n     and violently accelerates backward as the heavier car's \n     momentum powers into it. People inside the lighter car \n     experience body-smashing levels of force in two directions, \n     first as their car stops moving forward, then as it reverses. \n     In the heavier car, bodies are subjected to less-destructive \n     deceleration and no ``bounce-back.''\n       The regulations don't mandate small cars. But small, \n     lightweight vehicles that can perform satisfactorily using \n     low-power, fuel-efficient engines are the only affordable way \n     automakers have found to meet the CAFE (pronounced ka-FE) \n     standards.\n       Some automakers acknowledge the danger.\n       ``A small car, even with the best engineering available--\n     physics says a large car will win,'' says Jack Collins, \n     Nissan's U.S. marketing chief.\n       Tellingly, most small-car crash deaths involve only small \n     cars--56% in 1997, from the latest government data. They run \n     into something else, such as a tree, or into one another.\n       In contrast, just 1% of small-car deaths--136 people--\n     occurred in crashes with midsize or big sport-utility \n     vehicles in '97, according to statistics from the National \n     Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency that \n     enforces safety and fuel-efficiency rules. NHTSA does not \n     routinely publish that information. It performed special data \n     calculations at USA TODAY's request.\n       Champions of small cars like to point out that even when \n     the SUV threat is unmasked, other big trucks remain a \n     nemesis. NHTSA data shows, however, that while crashes with \n     pickups, vans and commercial trucks accounted for 28% of \n     small-car deaths in '97, such crashes also accounted for 36% \n     of large-car deaths.\n       Others argue that small cars attract young, inexperienced \n     drivers. There's some truth there, but not enough to explain \n     small cars' out-of-proportion deaths. About 36% of small-car \n     drivers involved in fatal crashes in 1997 were younger than \n     25; and 25% of the drivers of all vehicles involved in fatal \n     wrecks were that age, according to NHTSA data.\n\n\n                          gas shortage worries\n\n       U.S. motorists have flirted with small cars for years, \n     attracted, in small numbers, to nimble handling, high fuel \n     economy and low prices that make them the only new cars some \n     people can afford.\n       ``Small cars fit best into some consumers' pocketbooks and \n     driveways,'' says Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for \n     Auto Safety, a consumer-activist organization in Washington.\n       Engineer and construction manager Kirk Sandvoss of \n     Springfield, Ohio, who helped two family members shop for \n     subcompacts recently, says that's all the car needed.\n       ``We built three houses with a VW bug and a utility \n     trailer. We made more trips to the lumber yard than a guy \n     with a pickup truck would, but we got by. Small cars will \n     always be around.''\n       But small cars have an erratic history in the USA. They \n     made the mainstream only when the nation panicked over fuel \n     shortages and high prices starting in 1973. The 1975 energy \n     act and fuel efficiency standards were the government \n     response to that panic. Under current CAFE standards, the \n     fuel economy of all new cars an automaker sells in the USA \n     must average at least 27.5 mpg. New light trucks--pickups, \n     vans and sport-utility vehicles--must average 20.7 mpg. \n     Automakers who fall short are fined. In return, ``CAFE has an \n     almost lethal effect on auto safety,'' says Rep. Joe \n     Knollenberg, R-Mich., who sides with the anti-CAFE sentiments \n     of his home-state auto industry. Each year, starting with \n     fiscal 1996, he has successfully inserted language into \n     spending authorization bills that prohibits using federal \n     transportation money to tighten fuel standards.\n       Even if small cars were safe, there are reasons to wonder \n     about fuel-economy rules:\n       Questionable results.--CAFE and its small cars have not \n     reduced overall U.S. gasoline and diesel fuel consumption as \n     hoped. A strong economy and growing population have increased \n     consumption. The U.S. imports more oil now than when the \n     standards were imposed.\n       Irrelevance.--Emerging fuel technologies could make the \n     original intent obsolete, not only by making it easier to \n     recover oil from remote places, but also by converting \n     plentiful fuels, such as natural gas, into clean-burning, \n     competitively priced fuel. And new technology is making \n     bigger, safer cars more fuel efficient. The full-size Dodge \n     Intrepid, with V-6 engine, automatic transmission, air \n     conditioning and power accessories, hits the average 27.5 \n     mpg.\n       ``Improved fuel economy doesn't necessarily mean lighter, \n     inherently less-safe vehicles,'' says Robert Shelton, \n     associate administrator of NHTSA.\n       Cost--Developing and marketing small cars siphons billions \n     of dollars from the auto industry. Small cars don't cost \n     automakers much less to design, develop and manufacture than \n     bigger, more-profitable vehicles. But U.S. buyers won't pay \n     much for small cars, often demanding rebates that wipe out \n     the $500 to $1,000 profit.\n       Consumers pay, too. Though small cars cost less, they also \n     depreciate faster, so are worth relatively less at trade-in \n     time. And collision insurance is more expensive. State Farm, \n     the biggest auto insurer, charges small-car owners 10% to 45% \n     more than average for collision and damage coverage. Owners \n     of big cars and SUVs get discounts up to 45%. ``It's based on \n     experience,'' spokesman Dave Hurst says.\n       CAFE has been ``a bad mistake, one really bad mistake. It \n     didn't meet any of the goals, and it distorted the hell out \n     of the (new-car) market,'' says Jim Johnston, fellow at the \n     American Enterprise Institute in Washington and retired \n     General Motors vice president who lobbied against the 1975 \n     law.\n\n\n                              here to stay\n\n       CAFE is resilient, although concern over its effect on \n     small-car safety is neither new nor narrow.\n       A 1992 report by the National Research Council, an arm of \n     the National Academy of Sciences, says that while better fuel \n     economy generally is good, ``the undesirable attributes of \n     the CAFE system are significant,'' and CAFE deserves \n     reconsideration.\n       A NHTSA study completed in 1995 notes: ``During the past 18 \n     years, the Office of Technology Assessment of the United \n     States Congress, the National Safety Council, the Brookings \n     Institution, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the \n     General Motors Research Laboratories and the National Academy \n     of Sciences all agreed that reductions in the size and weight \n     of passenger cars pose a safety threat.''\n       Yet there's no serious move to kill CAFE standards.\n       Automakers can't lobby too loudly for fear of branding \n     their small cars unsafe, inviting negative publicity and \n     lawsuits. And Congress doesn't want to offend certain \n     factions by appearing too cavalier about fuel economy. Nor, \n     understandably, does it want to acknowledge its law has been \n     deadly.\n       ``I'm concerned about those statistics about small cars, \n     but I don't think we should blame that on the CAFE \n     standards,'' says Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who supported \n     CAFE and remains a proponent.\n       Pressure, in fact, is for tougher standards.\n       Thirty-one senators, mainly Democrats, signed a letter \n     earlier this year urging President Clinton to back higher \n     CAFE standards.\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\n     And environmental lobbyists favor small cars as a way to \n     inhibit global warming.\n       Although federal anti-pollution regulations require that \n     big cars emit no more pollution per mile than small cars, \n     environmental activists seize on this: Small engines typical \n     of small cars burn less fuel, so they emit less carbon \n     dioxide.\n       Carbon dioxide, or CO{-2 , is a naturally occurring gas \n     that's not considered a pollutant by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, which regulates auto pollution.\n       But those worried about global warming say CO{-2  is a \n     culprit and should be regulated via tougher CAFE rules.\n       Activists especially fume that trucks, though used like \n     cars, have a more lenient CAFE requirement, resulting in more \n     CO{-2 .\n       ``People would be much safer in bigger cars. In fact, \n     they'd be very safe in Ford Excursions,'' says Jim Motavalli, \n     editor of E: The Environmental Magazine, referring to a large \n     sport-utility vehicle Ford Motor plans to introduce in \n     September. ``But are we all supposed to drive around in \n     tanks? You'd be creating that much more global-warming gas. I \n     demonize sport utilities,'' says Motavalli, also a car \n     enthusiast and author of the upcoming book Forward Drive: The \n     Race to Build the Car of the Future. Not all scientists agree \n     that CO{-2  causes global warming or that warming is \n     occurring.\n\n\n                          Seeking alternatives\n\n       Worldwide, the market is big enough to keep small cars in \n     business, despite the meager U.S. small-car market of 2 \n     million a year. Outside the USA, roads are narrow and gas is \n     $5 a gallon, so Europeans buy 5 million small cars a year; \n     Asians, 2.6 million.\n       Automakers are working on lightweight bigger cars that \n     could use small engines, fuel-cell electric vehicles and \n     diesel-electric hybrid power plants that could run big cars \n     using little fuel.\n       But marketable U.S. versions are five, or more likely 10, \n     years off. That's assuming development continues, \n     breakthroughs occur and air-pollution rules aren't tightened \n     so much they eliminate diesels.\n       Even those dreamboats won't resolve the conflict between \n     fuel economy and safety. Their light weight means they'll \n     have the same sudden-stop and bounce-back problems as small \n     cars. Improved safety belts and air bags that could help have \n     not been developed.\n       IIHS researchers Adrian Lund and Janella Chapline reported \n     at the Society of Automotive Engineers' convention in Detroit \n     in March that it would be safer to get rid of the smallest \n     vehicles, not the largest.\n       Drawing on crash research from eight countries, Lund and \n     Chapline predicted that if all cars and trucks weighing less \n     than 2,500 pounds were replaced by slightly larger ones \n     weighing 2,500 to 2,600 pounds, there would be ``nearly 3% \n     fewer fatalities, or an estimated savings of more than 700 \n     lives'' a year. That's like trading a 1989 Honda Civic, which \n     weighs 2,000 pounds, for a '99 Civic, at 2,500 pounds.\n       Conversely, the researchers conclude, eliminating the \n     largest cars, SUVs and pickups, and putting their occupants \n     into the next-size-smaller cars, SUVs and pickups would kill \n     about 300 more people a year.\n\n\n                           Market skepticism\n\n       U.S. consumers, culturally prejudiced in favor of bigness, \n     aren't generally interested in small cars these days:\n       Car-buying expert Bragg--author of Car Buyer's and Leaser's \n     Negotiating Bible--says few customers even ask about small \n     cars.\n       Small-car sales are half what they were in their mid-'80s \n     heyday. Just 7% of new-vehicle shoppers say they'll consider \n     a small car, according to a 1999 study by California-based \n     auto industry consultant AutoPacific. That would cut small-\n     car sales in half. Those who have small cars want out: 82% \n     won't buy another.\n       To Bragg, the reasons are obvious: ``People need a back \n     seat that holds more than a six-pack and a pizza. And, \n     there's the safety issue.''\n       That hits home with Tennessee dad George Poe. He want car \n     shopping with teen-age daughter Bethanie recently and, at her \n     insistence, came home with a 1999 Honda Civic.\n       ``If it would have been entirely up to me, I'd have put her \n     into a used Volvo or, thinking strictly as a parent, a \n     Humvee.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have heard already one speaker contest \nsome of the facts that are set forth in the USA Today article. But it \nseems to me that, at a minimum, it is relevant to discuss the question \nof safety, to study the question of safety, to look at whether or not \nthere are additional traffic deaths that result from lighter cars. \nSurely, at a minimum, any law which seeks to regulate in this area \nshould look at the kind of analysis which has been done-which shows \n46,000 people have died.\n  Now, I am not an expert in this area. I don't know if 46,000 people \nhave died or not. I do know that serious objective analysis by serious \nobjective people have reached that conclusion and the CAFE law, which \nwould be triggered into effect unless this freeze is continued, as the \nHouse of Representatives proposes, doesn't allow for consideration of \nsafety.\n  It seems to me that any regulatory process should look at all of the \ncosts and all of the benefits before we regulate. But when we look at \nthe CAFE laws that would be put back into effect unless the position of \nthe House of Representatives is adopted, they require that at least 18 \nmonths before the beginning of each model year, the Secretary of \nTransportation shall prescribe by regulation--this isn't optional, this \nis mandatory--shall prescribe by regulation a standard which shall be \nthe maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the manufacturers \ncan achieve in that model year.\n  None of the four or five factors listed in the law that should be \nconsidered on decisions on maximum feasible average fuel economy has to \ndo with safety. It seems to me that kind of a narrow approach, which is \njust focused on some of the factors which should go into the regulatory \nprocess, is not the kind of approach which a proper regulatory process \nshould adopt.\n  I emphasize that the CAFE law isn't a study. This is a mandate.\n  No. 1, every year there must be a decision by the Department of \nTransportation as to the maximum feasible average fuel economy level \nfor the model year, and it is mandatory.\n  No. 2, it does not provide for consideration of highly relevant \nfactors.\n  I have no problem myself with a study that looks at all the relevant \nfactors. Quite the opposite. I think it is perfectly appropriate, \nprovided we don't prejudge the outcome of the study and lift the freeze \nbefore we find out what the outcome of the study is. I don't have any \nproblem with a study that looks at all of the factors objectively and \nthen makes a recommendation.\n  I have plenty of problems with telling any agency of this Government \nthat, based on a restricted list of relevant factors, they should \nmandate something every year on the automobile manufacturers. That \nexcludes this current law. This CAFE law excludes highly relevant \nfactors that should be considered.\n  That is point No. 1.\n  At the top of the list of considerations is the question of safety.\n  In addition to that, we have in this law which, in my judgment, \nunfairly discriminates against the U.S. automobile industry. That \nincludes both the manufacturers and the people who manufacture parts.\n  I would like to give one example of what I mean.\n  Take two vehicles. These are two sport utility vehicles--the GM \nSierra and Toyota Tundra. Both of these vehicles are about the same \nweight. One of them is slightly more fuel efficient than the other; \nthat is, the GM Sierra. But the way the CAFE law is designed it has \nabsolutely no impact on the imports. It has a huge impact on domestic \nmanufacturers.\n  Because of the way the CAFE law is written, even though the GM \nvehicle is slightly more fuel efficient than the Toyota vehicle, Toyota \ncan sell 309,000 of those Tundras without any penalty. GM can't sell \none of its vehicles without a penalty.\n  It seems to me that this kind of disparate impact has to be looked \nat. No study worth its salt, and no study that is worthy of being \ncalled objective or fair, could ignore the disparate impact which the \nCAFE law has added. If it is put back into effect, it will continue to \nhave a discriminatory effect on the American automobile manufacturers \nbecause of the way it is designed. It doesn't look at each vehicle \nweight class. Instead, it looks at the manufacturer and its total \nfleet.\n  The result is that you have some manufacturers producing vehicles no \nmore efficient than other manufacturers that have absolutely no \neffective limit on what they can sell--you have the other \nmanufacturers--and it is the American manufacturer--that are \ndiscriminatorily impacted because of the nature of their fleet. The \nAmerican-made vehicles are just as fuel efficient, or perhaps slightly \nmore fuel efficient. Yet they have to pay the price in terms of loss of \nmarket share. They have to pay a penalty. They have no room to sell \nvehicles the same weight as the imports can sell with no effective \nlimits whatsoever.\n\n  People can give the arguments on the other side of this issue. That \nis fair enough. But the problem is--if I am right, and I believe I am \nright--that the discriminatory impact on the\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\nAmerican manufacturers and parts producers cannot be taken into \nconsideration as part of the annual CAFE imposition. That is not on the \nlist of things that go into the definition of ``feasible average fuel \neconomy'' because the Secretary is told that he or she must prescribe \nthe ``maximum feasible average fuel economy,'' and then defines it in \nsuch a way that it excludes the discriminatory impact of the CAFE law \non American manufacturers.\n  The CAFE law is flawed in many ways. It has some very negative \nconsequences, in my judgment, and in the judgment of others in terms of \nsafety, loss of life and discriminatory impact on American automobile \nmanufacturers and parts producers.\n  One other thing: Not only do the imports have this huge amount of \nroom to sell their heavy vehicles while General Motors, using this \nparticular analysis, cannot sell any without penalty, but they can also \nbank so-called ``credits'' under the CAFE law. Because they can bank \ncredits--again, we are comparing vehicles that are the same weight \nwhere the GM vehicle is slightly more fuel efficient--then because of \nthe way in which the law is designed, Toyota could sell 1.6 million of \nthose vehicles without any penalty; General Motors, none.\n  This is the original 309,000 that I made reference to, and these are \nthe addition of so-called ``banked credits.''\n  There are many discriminatory, disparate, and, I hope, unintended \nconsequences of CAFE. But I wasn't here in the early seventies when \nthis law was drafted. I can only say I hope the consequences which I \ndescribed are unintended.\n  The better approach to this entire issue, it seems to me, is for \nGovernment and the private sector to cooperate in a partnership for a \nnew generation of vehicles. That is what is now underway. That \npartnership is producing some extraordinarily positive results.\n  That research approach-that voluntary cooperative partnership- \nharnesses the ingenuity and the energy of business, partially funded \nwith the Government, to achieve the policy goal which we all want--\nwhich is more fuel-efficient cars, and cars that are also safer. And we \ndon't want at the same time to unfairly damage the American automobile \nindustry.\n  How much time does this Senator have left on his 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The better alternative for increasing SUV and light truck \nfuel economy from both an environmental and equity perspective is \naggressive investment in fuel efficiency research projects. The \nPartnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, PNGV, provides an example \nof the pay-off from programs that harness the energy and ingenuity of \ngovernment and business to achieve this policy goal.\n  The goal of PNGV is to improve national manufacturing \ncompetitiveness, implement technologies that increase the fuel \nefficiency of and improve emissions for conventional vehicles, and \ndevelop technologies for a new class of vehicles with up to 80 mpg \nwithout sacrificing the affordability, utility, safety, and comfort of \ntoday's midsize family sedans.\n  For the five years that this program has existed (it is currently in \nits sixth year), the average annual government contribution has been \nabout $250 million per year. The average annual private sector \ncontribution by the Big Three has been in excess of $900 million per \nyear.\n  PNGV fuel-efficient technologies, such as lightweight materials, \nadvanced batteries, and fuel cell and hybrid electric propulsion \nsystems, are already appearing on experimental concept vehicles shown \nby automakers at recent auto shows.\n  Under PNGV, U.S. automakers will have production-ready prototypes by \n2004. Some of the technology from this aggressive research will be \ntransferable to the light duty truck fleet.\n  I urge Members to vote against this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield such time as the distinguished Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Bryan, desires.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I realize this debate has raged on for some \nperiod of time this afternoon. I will simply make a couple of points in \nsupport of the motion to instruct conferees.\n  Fuel economy affects Americans in a very practical way. We have seen \nin recent weeks the escalating prices of gasoline, prices that have \ncaused Americans who come to the gas station real sticker shock. These \nare some of the numbers we have seen: $1.54 a gallon on the east coast; \nin my own part of the country, $1.59. Those numbers appear to be going \nup.\n  The effect of this is to require American families who are dependent \nupon automobiles for transportation--that is most of the people who \nlive in a western State, such as my own in Nevada --to have less \nspendable income for other family needs and requirements. If it is \npossible to reduce the amount of money they spend by increasing fuel \neconomy--that is, getting more miles to the gallon--it makes sense for \nevery family, not only in my own State, but across the Nation.\n  We are proposing lifting the gag rule, to strip the blindfold off, to \nunplug our ears, and simply allow the Department of Transportation to \nexamine the technology of the past 25 years--because it has been 25 \nyears since we have applied new fuel economy standards in America--and \nsee if we can't get better fuel economy and still leave a full range of \nvehicle choice to American consumers.\n  I find it hard to believe that is not a win-win for everyone. It is a \nwin for the consumer. It is a win for the American automobile industry. \nIt is a win for the economy. Not only do we get better fuel economy and \nsave costs for the American motorist, but we can also help to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil.\n\n  We are held vulnerable and hostage to a certain extent. We see that \nevery time OPEC tweaks up or tweaks down the production quotas with an \ninstantaneous response in the market. That is what has happened with \nrespect to these increases.\n  OPEC recognizes how vulnerable we are. We import 54 percent of the \noil consumed in this country; 40 percent of that is attributable to the \nautomotive sector. OPEC knows, because of our dependence on imported \noil, if they can get their own act together to impose some production \nrestraints, they reduce their production, the cost to the consumer who \nis filling up his or her car with gasoline is going up. If we can be a \nlittle less vulnerable by reducing the amounts of oil we import, won't \nthat be a good thing?\n  That is precisely what occurred in the 1970s. We were vulnerable \nthen, as we are now, to events that occurred. We had the embargo, the \nfall of the Shah of Iran, and our economy was sent into a tailspin. \nIndeed, economically, the 1970s were a very difficult time for our \ncountry, as people who lived during that era will recall.\n  By passing the CAFE legislation of 1975, we reduced the amount of oil \nwe consumed each and every day by some 3 million barrels. We are \nsuggesting fuel economy standards are beginning to decline.\n  If one looks at the recent numbers, one will see that after two \ndecades of progress, fuel economy averages are declining. In 1975, we \ngot less than 14 miles per gallon on average. That peaked during 1988, \n1999, and it has declined. The reason it is declining is that Americans \nare choosing to purchase trucks and sport utility vehicles. That is \ntheir choice. Light trucks and sport utility vehicles make up nearly 50 \npercent of the market.\n  Shouldn't we be able to look at the technology of the last 25 years \nand apply that and see if we might not get fuel economy that would make \nit possible for Americans to drive light trucks, sport utility \nvehicles, and get better fuel economy? Is there anything wrong with \nthat? I am hard pressed to come up with an argument in opposition to \nthat.\n  Here is what we have. From the time I was a child, I have been \ninfatuated with the automobile. I have shared on this floor on many \noccasions the excitement I experienced as a youngster each new model \nyear, going down to\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\nthe local dealership, peering in the dealership, and wondering what \nthat year's model was going to be.\n  If I have been improvident in terms of my expenditures, probably in \nno area is that more evident than I have loved automobiles. I have \npurchased them, and I love them. So I do not speak as a Senator who has \nan antipathy to the automobile. I love my cars. I am very dependent, \nand I recognize most Americans are as well.\n  I say with great respect that this is an industry that has almost a \nPavlovian response when it comes to suggestions that technology ought \nto be applied to improved fuel efficiency or some aspect of \ntechnology. The auto industry had fought us for decades on airbags. I \nam privileged to join the distinguished Senator from Washington on this \nissue. He and I were instrumental in the conference of the \nreauthorization of the highway bill a decade ago to get that \nlegislation requiring airbags. Today, many Americans survive auto \naccidents, and of those who have had injuries, their injuries are much \nless than might have been expected but for airbags.\n\n  The industry resisted catalytic converters and the industry resisted \ntenaciously in the 1970s this legislation that we called Corporate \nAverage Fuel Economy.\n  I realize that is ancient history, but is it? One gets a sense of \ndeja vu on the floor when one listens to the arguments against even \npermitting the examination of new CAFE requirements. The motion to \nstrike simply deletes reference to a rider that has been added to the \nTransportation appropriations bill each and every year since 1995 that \nsays that the Department of Transportation may not consider moving \nforward on new fuel economy standards.\n  The sponsors of this action do not seek to establish a numerical \nstandard but simply to say let the Department of Transportation examine \nthe technology and see if a new standard could be imposed that would \nenable us to apply technology, reduce the number of gallons of gas we \nneed to operate our vehicles, save consumers money, reduce our \ndependence on imported oil, and also to clean up our air.\n  These are public policy issues. One is reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil. Another is reducing the trade imbalance, which every \neconomist will tell you is a point of vulnerability in an economy which \nhas extraordinarily performed in 112 consecutive months of economic \nexpansion--without precedent in American history. But continued trade \ndeficits of this magnitude are a problem. About a third of those trade \ndeficits are attributable to the amount of oil we import. We could \nreduce our dependency.\n  There is not an American city of any size that is not concerned about \nair pollution. Most scientists will tell you, whether or not they have \nfully subscribed to the global warming theory, that it is not a good \nthing for us to continue to pump as much carbon dioxide into the \natmosphere as we are. With better fuel economy, we would reduce those \nemissions as well.\n  What is the response? Unfortunately, the industry has chosen to \ninvoke scare tactics. In farm country they are telling America's \nfarmers they may not be able to get and use a pickup truck. For those \nrecreationists who tow vehicles, whether they are boats or horse \ntrailers, they are saying they may no longer be able to participate in \nthis particular avocation--whether it is boating or horseback riding--\nbecause we are not going to be able to build a vehicle that will pull a \ntrailer, that will allow them to transport their boat to the lake, or \ntheir horse to an event where they want to race or show that horse.\n  They are telling others it will be impossible for us to produce the \nsport utility vehicles that they love, whether they love them for \ncomfort, convenience, or to get out on the back trails of America and \ndo a little off-road driving. They will not be able to do that as well.\n  Does this sound familiar? Those arguments, cast in the context of the \n1970s, were the arguments that were advanced by the auto industry then. \nI must say, if the past is prologue, this would be a classic example.\n  In the testimony on the CAFE legislation in 1974, the Ford Motor \nCompany testified as follows, referring to CAFE, which would have and \ndid ultimately double the fuel economy that automobiles get, from less \nthan 14 to more than 27 miles per gallon, in a decade.\n\n       This proposal would require a Ford product line consisting \n     of either all sub-Pinto-sized vehicles--\n\n  Ford's smallest vehicle in the 1970s--\n\n       or some mix of vehicles ranging from a sub-sub-compact to \n     perhaps a Maverick.\n\n  That was a small vehicle as well, slightly larger than the Pinto. \nThat was 1974. All one need do is change the words ``sub-Pinto-sized \nand Maverick,'' and add in there ``light trucks and sport utility \nvehicles,'' that we would not be able to offer those if this proposal \nwere advanced, and we would have the contemporary argument, the \nargument that is made in the year 2000.\n  Chrysler Motors said:\n\n       In effect, this bill would outlaw a number of engine lines \n     and car models, including most full-size sedans and station \n     wagons. It would restrict the industry to producing sub-\n     compact-size cars. . . .\n\n  Does the resonance sound familiar to any of us? It was a pretty \nfamiliar line of argument.\n  And General Motors said:\n\n       This legislation would have the effect of placing \n     restrictions on the availability of 5- and 6-passenger cars.\n\n  Nobody wanted that. Those were all tactics that the industry employed \nto frighten the American public. I am sure none of the sponsors, in \n1974--and I was not a Member of this body--intended to deprive \nAmericans of vehicle choice. I do not think anybody had in mind to \nprevent American families from purchasing station wagons or four-door, \nfull-size, six-passenger sedans. I can assure you, the distinguished \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington, Mr. Gorton, we do not. We do not preclude or attempt \nto preclude it. In fact, some of us own sport utility vehicles and we \nwant the element of choice. All we are saying is please give us an \nopportunity to look at the technology that would be available. Those \nowners of those sport utility vehicles, if we could get 4 or 5 or 10 \nmiles per gallon more, would pay a lot less when they go to fill up at \nthe gas pump.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, whether you believe there is a precise number \nyou can achieve, in terms of increased fuel economy--and some have \nindicated we could double that once again--or whether you believe \nimprovements more incremental and modest are possible, under the \ncurrent legislation, it will be impossible for us to do so because of a \nrider that restrains our ability to do so. That simply does not make \nmuch sense.\n  So all we are asking for is an opportunity for the Department of \nTransportation to examine that technology. One would have to be a neo-\nLuddite to believe that in 25 years, a quarter of a century in which \nmore technology advancements have occurred than in any 25 years of \nrecorded history, of recorded civilization, that somehow the auto \nindustry is not able to take advantage of some of those technology \nimprovements.\n  So we simply ask for this opportunity. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport our position. I know as I speak, there are some discussions \noccurring off the floor that may lead to a compromise. I hope such a \ncompromise will be possible. But it is a compromise that ought to let \nthe technology, not the politics of scare and fright, dictate what a \npublic policy for America ought to be. If we can improve that, and \nreduce the cost that motorists have to use their cars for work or \nrecreation, if we can make America less dependent on imported oil, if \nwe can ease the balance of payments that creates a potential threat to \nfuture economic expansion, if we can reduce the amount of carbon \ndioxide that goes into the atmosphere, would that not be a good thing? \nWouldn't Americans--Democrats, Republicans, Independents, \nlibertarians--embrace that concept? Wouldn't the far left and the far \nright move to the political center and say, yes, that makes sense?\n  I believe it is possible. All we seek is the opportunity to let \nAmerican technology try. I suppose, if I have a quarrel with my friends \nin the auto industry, it is that they have less confidence than I do in \nthemselves and their ability. Let me say, what they did from 1975 to \n1987 was extraordinary. They doubled fuel economy--doubled it. And they \ndoubled it at the same time they provided a full range of vehicle \nchoice.\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\n  By the early 1990s, the largest automobile built by the Ford Motor \nCompany--the largest automobile--got better fuel economy than the \nsmallest Ford automobile produced in 1975, the little Pinto. That is \nsomething about which to rejoice. I say congratulations.\n  I am proud as an American that that kind of technology was possible, \nand I simply say to an industry that in 1974 believed it could \naccomplish nothing: Have confidence in yourself. Let all of those \nentrepreneurial juices flow, and we know, when given a chance, American \nindustry produces technological marvels that are the envy of the world; \ngive us that chance. That is what we ask of our colleagues.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, as we are working on \nnegotiations. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Gorton has 15 minutes; the opponents \nhave 38 minutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have only a relatively short period of \ntime left. The distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, \nis coming to speak on our side of this issue, so I will make only one \nor two points briefly.\n  I listened with great interest to each of the opponents to my motion. \nIt seems to me, as was the case a year ago, that they emphasized \noverwhelmingly the impact of new fuel efficiency standards on \nautomobile safety. In fact, those arguments would have been entirely \npersuasive if this were a proposal requiring lighter automobiles and \nsmall trucks. It, of course, is not. It is a proposal to allow a study \nof whether or not corporate fuel economy standards should be increased.\n  My view, and that of my distinguished colleagues from California and \nNevada, is that this can be accomplished without downsizing automobiles \nor small trucks. Interestingly enough, many of the comments on the part \nof the opponents to our motion in effect said so, that great technical \nstrides have been made in this connection, strides that we encourage.\n\n  But I simply want to make it clear that the goal of the proponents of \nthis motion is to end the prohibition against even studying whether or \nnot we should improve these fuel efficiency standards. To that end, \nthere have been very serious negotiations in the course of the last \nhour or so among members of the contending parties, and it is at least \npossible we will be able to reach an agreement that will be approved on \nthe part of all of those who have debated this issue here today.\n  I have every hope that that is the case because it will allow us to \ngo forward with studies but will see to it that Congress plays the \nsignificant role--that it is playing right here today--in being \npermitted or required to take action before any new fuel efficiency \nstandards become the law of the land.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the Gorton-Feinstein \nmotion to instruct. This states that the House CAFE freeze rider ought \nnot to be accepted by the Senate in conference.\n  When CAFE standards were first passed in the late 1970s, light trucks \nmade up only 20 percent of the market. Back then, light trucks were \nused mainly for hauling. They did not often travel through congested \nurban and suburban areas. But all that has changed.\n  Today, light trucks--the category that includes SUVs and minivans--\nrepresent half of all vehicles sold. They produce 47 percent more \nglobal warming pollution than do cars. Each light truck goes through an \naverage of 702 gallons of gas per year. That compares to 492 gallons \nper year for cars. Goodness knows what is happening now as we look at \nthese prices, recognizing that our consumption of fuel is way above \nwhat it had been, importing more from what at times are very unfriendly \nsources. We are just on a consumption kick that is affecting our way of \nlife but particularly our environment. I will talk more about that in a \nminute.\n  Even with the tremendous increase in the number of SUVs, the Senate \ncontinues to accept the House's CAFE freeze rider. By the way, just as \na note of explanation, CAFE refers to the gas consumed and the \nemissions by the vehicles about which we are talking. We are talking \nabout CAFE standards; that is, to try to have the amount of fuel \nconsumed reduced and to try to reduce the emissions that are affecting \nour environment and the quality of our air.\n\n  The result of the House's CAFE freeze has meant serious consequences \nfor American families' pocketbooks, jobs, and the environment. There is \na myth floating around that CAFE standards hurt the American family. \nThe truth is, sensible CAFE standards helps our families. It is a \nsimple concept. If your car or your SUV uses less gas, you save money \nand you do less harm to the environment in which your families live. \nBetween 1975 and 1980, when the fuel economy of cars doubled, consumers \nwith fuel-efficient cars saved $3,000 over the lifetime of the car. \nThat translated into $30 billion of savings in America for families to \nspend on items other than gas.\n  Jobs are also an important part of this discussion. The opposition \nkeeps insisting that CAFE standards are going to hurt employment, \nparticularly in the auto industry. A study by the American Council for \nan Energy Efficient Economy says that money saved at the gas pump and \nreinvested throughout the economy would create a quarter of a million \njobs, 244,000 in this country, including 47,000 in the auto industry.\n  Another benefit of CAFE standards is in fighting the most daunting \nenvironmental challenge of our time: global warming. Passenger cars, \nSUVs, and light trucks accounted for 18 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas \nemissions in 1998. It is a major contributor to the problem of global \nwarming. A recent National Academy of Sciences study finds that global \nwarming trends are undoubtedly real. In December, a British \nMeteorological Office study said that 1999 was the fifth warmest year \non record and that 7 of the hottest 10 years on record occurred in the \n1990s. That tells us something. It tells us we ought to get our heads \nout of the sand and do something about it. That 10 years in the 1990s \nwas the hottest decade of the millennium, also this winter.\n  I traveled to the South Pole in January because I wanted to see what \nwe were doing about trying to protect ourselves against negative \nenvironmental change. When you see this beautiful ice continent and \nrecognize the contribution it makes to the entire global environment \nand you hear the water rushing off as the ice melts--a condition that \nis not supposed to exist; it is supposed to stay hard ice; 70 percent \nof the world's fresh water supply is stored in the ice there--it is a \nvery bad sign.\n  If we look at our families and our world, we say: What is happening? \nIf that continues to mix with the saline, it is a terrible and ominous \nsign to which we should pay attention.\n  In Australia, a continent thousands of miles away from Antarctica, \nthe Australians pride themselves in recreational water sports, things \nof that nature. Children going to the beach in Australia today have to \nwear hats. They have to wear full-body bathing suits because of the \nhigh incidence of skin cancer. Australia today has the highest \nincidence of skin cancer of any advanced country in the world. It is a \nterrible tragedy; it has such grim warnings attached to that.\n  We still are not paying proper attention. This winter, two gigantic \nicebergs, collectively about two-thirds the size of New Jersey--one the \nsize of\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\nRhode Island and another the size of Delaware--broke off from \nAntarctica. One day we are going to see an iceberg the size of the \nState of Texas. Then everybody is going to say: Woe be unto us. Why \ndidn't we pay attention when our environment was deteriorating \nliterally in front of our eyes? Why didn't we pay attention when it was \npredicted that water levels would rise, that temperatures would rise, \nthat a place like New York City could almost have tropical type \nweather?\n\n  We just saw that in a report the other day. When are we going to pay \nattention to the alarm we hear sounding off day after day? We choose to \nignore that threat and say: Go on, spend it, use those big vehicles and \nburn as much gas as you want and issue as much contamination as you \nwant. It is our problem, and it is our responsibility.\n  Scientists project a rise in sea level of 4 to 12 inches on the mid-\nAtlantic coast in the next 30 years--not 100 years, not 50 years, 30 \nyears away. My little grandchildren who were in the gallery today will \nbe 35 years of age. That is hardly old. That is when it looks as if we \nwill be experiencing the worst of what ignoring the consequences of \nthis process will mean.\n  Scientists also tell us higher seas will lead to greater storm \nsurges, more coastal damage, even from relatively modest storms.\n  CAFE is essential for fighting this danger. A recent analysis shows \nthat CAFE standards could be raised to over 40 miles per gallon for new \ncars and light trucks by 2010. This would result in emissions \nreductions of 396 million metric tons of carbon dioxide below business-\nas-usual projections, which is 6 percent of our current emissions.\n  I don't like to get into those kinds of astronomical figures because \nthey don't always mean much. When we think of 396 million metric tons \nof carbon dioxide, that is a lot. But when we think of the poor air \nquality days, where it is hard for those who are elderly to go out and \nconduct normal travel and normal exercise, normal living, it makes it \ndifficult for them to breathe and be as active as they like. We have \nfew other opportunities for attacking global warming as dramatically \nand as cost-effectively as controlling auto fuel efficiency.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about this problem, to be able to say \nto their constituents: Yes, we are concerned. We want you to have the \ncomfort. We want you to be able to have the cars you prefer to drive. \nYou are spending your hard-earned money. But let's make them as \nefficient as we can.\n  It is something our geniuses in the automobile industry--and they are \ngeniuses; they have built an incredible population of vehicles and \nconveniences--can make better. We have seen all kinds of samples of \nthat. If we encourage them and know that everybody is going to be in \nthe same competitive bind or competitive environment, they will do it.\n  I ask our colleagues to vote in favor of the Gorton-Feinstein motion. \nWe have few other opportunities for attacking global warming as \ndramatically and as cost-efficiently as controlling auto fuel \nefficiency.\n  I will take a minute more, and I ask that my colleague from Louisiana \nbe just a little more patient. I beat her to the microphone. That is \nwhat happens. It wasn't a foot race, but it was just a coincidence of \ncircumstances.\n  Since I have been in the Senate 18 years, many wonderful things have \nhappened. I have seen the benefit of things we have done legislatively \nhave an impact on folks back home. Whether it is no smoking in \nairplanes or mentoring programs or drug control programs in public \nhousing or computers in schools--I come out of the computer industry--\nall have a direct effect.\n  The health programs we have and the education programs have been \nterrific. Today, I was personally rewarded by an expression of \nfriendship and appreciation, led by Senator Shelby from Alabama. He is \nmy colleague, a Republican. He used to be a Democrat. We are still \nfriends, even though his party affiliation changed. He did something \ntoday that both shocked and humbled me. He asked that a new facility \nbeing built in New Jersey, a railroad terminal, a railroad station, \nwhere all of the railroads in New Jersey--and we have a lot of rail \npassenger lines--come together so that people can choose an option for \ngoing to New York City or for going to Newark Airport or for going to \nthe beach for recreation or commuting between cities in New Jersey--he \nasked it be named for me, and I am, indeed, grateful. I was surprised, \nnevertheless flattered.\n  Comments by Senator Byrd and Senators John Kerry, Chris Dodd, Barbara \nMikulski, and Tom Daschle were all laudatory. I was pleased to have two \nof my children and grandchildren in the balcony. It was a coincidence \nbecause they live a distance away, in the State of Florida. They were \nhere to see their grandfather. One of my grandchildren, who is 5 years \nold, said, ``Are they doing anything down there?'' I said, ``Perhaps \nyou would not notice it, but they are.'' So they were here to see it. \nIt was a happy moment for me and my family. I am grateful to my \ncolleagues who voted for it. There was no objection when it was \noffered.\n  While I will miss this place, I will leave it with so many fond \nmemories of opportunities to serve that are rewarded in much more \nspecific ways than having a naming process attached to it. No one has \never exemplified that more thoroughly and more deeply than has Senator \nRobert Byrd, who sits in the Chamber at this moment, who is always \ntalking about the nobility of the service we perform here, about the \nopportunity we have to give something back, showing our appreciation \nfor being in this country, for being in this democracy, for being able \nto be in the position that we are to do the things we do.\n  So I am grateful. With that, I know I will make the Senator from \nLouisiana grateful by yielding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from New \nJersey how much we are going to miss his service and his leadership. I \nknow several of my colleagues spoke earlier today on naming the train \nstation after him. It was very appropriate; he has been such a leader \nin the area of transportation, particularly mass transportation, \nparticularly in regard to how those transportation methods affect our \nenvironment. I was happy to join my colleagues today in doing that. I \nhave really enjoyed working with him in my time here. I thank the \nSenator for the great service he has rendered to Louisiana. He has been \na good friend to us when we have come to this floor and to meetings \nabout things important to our State and our region of the country.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleague from \nCalifornia for offering this motion. The motion instructs the Senate \nconferees to the Transportation Appropriations bill to reject the anti-\nenvironment CAFE rider.\n  This anti-environment rider has been included in the Transportation \nbill for the past four years. The rider prohibits the Transportation \nDepartment from even looking at the need to raise the nearly decade old \nCAFE standards.\n  The existing standards have saved more than 3 million barrels of oil \nper day. We know that raising the CAFE standards is possible and would \nsave more oil. For example, requiring sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and \nother light trucks to meet the same standard that applies to passenger \ncars would save approximately 1 million barrels of oil per day.\n  Because SUVs are coming to dominate the new car market, we must make \nthis change. But under the CAFE rider, the Transportation Department \ncan't even think about it. They can't even study it.\n  Instead of moving forward to raise CAFE standards, what do some want \nto do to relieve our dependence on foreign oil? Some propose opening \nthe California coasts to offshore oil drilling. Others propose opening \nup the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.\n  Why put our natural heritage at risk when we know we could save oil \nby making modest changes to CAFE standards?\n  It's good energy policy and good environmental policy.\n  Mr. President, raising CAFE standards is one critical step toward \nrestoring sanity to our energy policy. In addition to this step, I have \nbeen advocating several other proposals.\n  First, we need to invest more in energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy. Over the past five years, Congress has appropriate 22 percent \nless than requested by the President for energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy.\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\n  Second, we need vigorous enforcement of the anti-trust laws on oil \ncompanies. For several years I have been concerned about the practices \nof the oil companies on the West Coast and in my State of California. \nSeveral times I have called on the FTC to investigate possible anti-\ntrust violations.\n  Just this week, the government began investigating the dramatic jump \nin gasoline prices in the midwest. There is apparently no external \njustification for these huge price spikes.\n  Third, we should place a moratorium on oil company mergers. By \ndefinition, mergers mean less competition and less competition means \nhigher prices.\n  Fourth, we should prohibit the export of Alaska North Slope crude \noil. The GAO reported that the lifting of the ban in 1995 increased the \nprice of crude oil by about a dollar per barrel.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join with me in supporting this CAFE \nmotion. It is good energy policy and good environmental policy.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to address an \nissue today that means an awful lot to Montanans. That issue is the \nvery right to have access to a choice of cars and trucks that will meet \nthe rigorous needs of rural life. I don't know how many of those \nlistening today have driven in Montana, but it is a much different \nstory than driving in more densely populated states. CAFE standards \nhave a huge effect on Montanans in a lot of different ways that many \npeople here today would not understand.\n  Today, some of my colleagues have cited statistics about the impact \nof large vehicles harming occupants of smaller vehicles. This is \nextremely unfortunate, but large vehicles are not a luxury. For many of \nus they are a necessity. Just as 18 wheeled diesel trucks keep our \ncountry's goods moving on our interstate system, large vehicles are a \nnecessity to keep our rural economies alive. Hauling a heifer to market \njust is not feasible in a Geo Metro.\n  Now, in the Washington, D.C. area, there are many more small, \neconomical cars on the road than there are in Havre, Montana. But, I \nhave to remind you that in Montana we have winter for a large part of \nthe year. A long, cold winter with plenty of snow and ice. It is the \nkind of weather that makes 4-wheel drive a life saving device. When you \nare driving your family down the road in the middle of December and the \nweather is miserable and cold, you want to be confident you will all be \nsafe. This generally means a sturdy vehicle with four-wheel drive. \nIt'll help you stay on the road, which is important considering it \ncould be a very long time before you see anyone else, and the nearest \ntown could be 80 miles away. If you are unfortunate enough to slide off \nof a two-lane road in the black of night it is nice to know your family \nwill be protected. This is the reality in parts of Montana, as hard as \nit is for some of my colleagues in the Senate to imagine.\n  Similarly, when you live in an area of Montana that is geographically \nisolated, and there are very few that are not, you need to be prepared \nto buy more than one bag of groceries at a time. Maybe you need to buy \na month's worth of groceries, and feed for the animals, and fence \nposts, any other odds and ends you might need and bring them all home \nat the same time. How you will fit that all into a little car is a \nmystery. You'd better leave the kids home, that's for sure\n  Besides that fact that stricter CAFE standards could hurt rural \nMontanans and the general safety issues that concern me, I think there \nis more at stake here. We are basically telling consumers that they \nhave no right to choose the car they want to drive. This isn't right. \nIn recent years, the American automobile industry has made great \nstrides in developing better cars in every possible way. On the whole, \nour cars are becoming safer, and cleaner than ever before. This \ningenuity is what makes American industry great.\n  We have done a good job of making sure the manufacture of automobiles \nis consistent with the environmental goals we want to reach. But to \nstep aside and allow federal regulators to enact a blanket policy that \npunishes those people who use large vehicles as a necessity of every \nday life, and stifle the right to choice for rural consumers, is the \nwrong approach.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I support the Senate motion to instruct the Conferees \non fuel economy standards. This issue has been controversial in my \nstate, and I believe its effect on automobile fuel economy standards is \nnot well understood.\n  My vote today is about Congress getting out of the way and letting a \nfederal agency meet the requirements of federal law originally imposed \nby Congress. I support this motion because I am concerned that Congress \nhas for more than 5 years blocked the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration (NHTSA), part of the federal Department of \nTransportation (DOT), from meeting its legal duty to evaluate whether \nthere is a need to modify fuel economy standards by legislative rider \nsince Fiscal Year 1996. The motion instructs the Conferees not recede \nto Section 318 of the House bill.\n  As I made clear last year, I have made no determination about what \nfuel economy standards should be. NHTSA is not required under the law \nto increase fuel economy standards, but it is required to examine on a \nregular basis whether there is a need for changes to fuel economy \nstandards. NHTSA has the authority to set new standards for a given \nmodel year taking into account several factors: technological \nfeasibility, economic practicability, other vehicle standards such as \nthose for safety and environmental performance, and the need to \nconserve energy. I want NHTSA to fully and fairly evaluate all the \ncriteria, and then make an objective recommendation on the basis of \nthose facts. After NHTSA makes a recommendation, if it does so, I will \nthen consult with all interested parties--unions, environmental \ninterests, auto manufacturers, and other interested Wisconsin citizens \nabout their perspectives on NHTSA's recommendation.\n  However, just as the outcome of NHTSA's assessment should not be pre-\njudged, the language of the House rider certainly should not have so \nblatantly pre-judged and precluded any new objective assessment of fuel \neconomy standards. Section 318 of the House bill, identical to last \nyear's language, states:\n\n       None of the funds in this Act shall be available to \n     prepare, propose, or promulgate any regulations pursuant to \n     title V of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act \n     (49 U.S.C. 32901 et seq.) prescribing corporate average fuel \n     economy standards for automobiles, as defined in such title, \n     in any model year that differs from standards promulgated for \n     such automobiles prior to enactment of this section.\n\n  The House language effectively prevents NHTSA from collecting any \ninformation about the impact of changing the fuel economy standards in \nany way. Under the House language, not only would NHTSA be prohibited \nfrom collecting information or developing standards to raise fuel \neconomy standards, it couldn't collect information or develop standards \nto lower them either. The House language assumes that NHTSA has a \nparticular agenda, that NHTSA will recommend standards which can't be \nachieved without serious impacts, and uses an appropriations bill to \ncircumvent the law's requirements to evaluate fuel efficiency and \nmaintain the current standards again for another fiscal year. I cannot \nsupport retaining this rider in the law.\n  The NHTSA should be allowed to provide Congress with information \nabout whether fuel efficiency improvements are possible and advisable. \nCongress needs to understand whether or not improvements in fuel \neconomy can and should be made using existing technologies. Congress \nshould also know which emerging technologies may have the potential to \nimprove fuel economy. Congress also needs to know that if improvements \nare technically feasible, what is the appropriate time frame in which \nto make such changes in order to avoid harm to our auto sector \nemployment. I don't believe that Congress should confuse our role as \npolicymakers with our obligation to appropriate funds. Changes in fuel \neconomy standards could have a variety of consequences. I seek to \nunderstand those consequences and to balance the concerns of those \ninterested in seeing improvements to fuel economy as a means of \nreducing gasoline consumption and associated pollution.\n  I deeply respect the views of those who are concerned that a change \nin fuel economy would threaten the economic prosperity of Wisconsin's \nautomobile industry. I have heard strongly\n\n[[Page S5213]]\n\nfrom my state that a sharp increase in fuel economy standards, \nimplemented in the very near term, will have serious consequences. I \nwant to avoid consequences that will unduly burden Wisconsin workers \nand their employers. In the end, I would like to see that Wisconsin \nconsumers have a wide range of new automobiles, SUVs, and trucks \navailable to them that are as fuel efficient as can be achieved while \nbalancing energy concerns with technological and economic impacts. That \nbalancing is required by the law. I fully expect NHTSA to proceed with \nthe intent to fully consider all those factors.\n  In supporting this motion, I take the position that the agency \nresponsible for collecting information about fuel economy be allowed to \ndo its job, in order to help me do my job. I expect them to be fair and \nneutral in that process and I will work with interested Wisconsinites \nto ensure that their views are represented and the regulatory process \nproceeds in a fair and reasonable manner toward whatever conclusions \nthe merits will support.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished minority whip be permitted to proceed for a unanimous \nconsent and that I then be accorded the floor immediately following.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For how long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For 4 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding an agreement is worked out so we do \nnot need a vote.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct. We are prepared to implement that \nagreement now, if we have permission.\n  Mr. REID. We have a unanimous consent agreement that has been worked \non all day that is now ready to be entered, next week.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is also correct.\n  Mr. REID. Could we proceed with either one of the two unanimous \nconsent agreements?\n  Mr. GORTON. With the permission of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it may be my remarks will be shorter. If \nthey take a brief period of time, I am happy to let that go forward, \nwith the understanding that I will have the floor immediately after.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Massachusetts that people literally \nhave been waiting all day. We need something on the record indicating \nthere will be no votes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to accommodate my colleagues. It will probably \nbe shorter if they start and do it rather than talk about doing it.\n\n\n               Motion to Instruct Conferees, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have at the desk a revised motion to \ninstruct the conferees on the Transportation appropriations bill. I ask \nunanimous consent it be in order to consider it and it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the motion be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n       I move that conferees on the part of the Senate on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the \n     Senate to the bill (H.R. 4475) be instructed, and are hereby \n     instructed, to accept section 318 of the bill as passed by \n     the House of Representatives, but to authorize the Department \n     of Transportation, pursuant to a study by the National \n     Academy of Sciences in conjunction with the DOT, to \n     recommend, but not to promulgate without approval by a Joint \n     Resolution of Congress, appropriate corporate average fuel \n     efficiency standards;\n       Provided, however, that any such study shall include not \n     only those considerations outlined in 49 USC section 32902(F) \n     but also the impact of any such proposal on motor vehicle \n     safety, any disparate impact on the U.S. automotive sector, \n     and the effect on U.S. employment in the automotive and \n     related sectors, and any other factors deemed relevant by the \n     National Academy of Sciences or the committee of conference.\n       The National Academy of Sciences shall complete its study \n     no later than July 1, 2001, and shall submit the study to \n     Congress and the Department of Transportation.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, essentially we have had a debate over the \nrefusal to allow anybody in the Transportation appropriations bill to \nbe used to study, propose, or promulgate new corporate average fuel \neconomy standards. The proponents of the original instruction have \nstated they did not wish for the Department of Transportation to be \nauthorized to promulgate any such new rules without the consent of \nCongress or without another vote in Congress but that they felt it \ninappropriate to prevent studying what technology now permits us to do \nwith respect to such standards.\n  This revision simply allows the House provision to go into effect \nwith respect to the old 1975 law. However, it also tells the conferees \nto authorize a study by the National Academy of Sciences in conjunction \nwith the Department of Transportation that by July 1 of next year will \nrecommend but will not promulgate, without approval by a joint \nresolution of Congress, appropriate corporate average fuel economy \nstandards.\n  It also expressly states that they shall consider safety--which was a \nmajor part of the debate here--and the impact on the automobile and \nmanufacturing business in the United States.\n  It will last only, of course, for the fiscal year 2001 because this \nis an appropriations bill, but we hope by that time we will have \nsomething that we can debate that will be real in nature rather than \njust theoretical.\n  I ask unanimous consent my motion be considered a motion for me, for \nmy distinguished colleague from Nevada, Mr. Bryan; the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein; and the three Members who have debated \nagainst this, both Senators from Michigan, and the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Ashcroft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to be clear that this language \ninstructs the conferees to accept section 318 in the House bill. Those \nare the words in this motion.\n  In addition, one of the specific factors in the study we look at is \n``the disparate impact, if any, on the U.S. automotive sector.'' Then \nit issues the words, ``and any other factors deemed relevant by the \nNational Academy of Sciences or the committee of conference.''\n  My question to the Senator from Washington is whether or not in his \njudgment the fairly lengthy list of factors which are relevant to this \nquestion, which are set forth in Senate bill 2685, a bill which was \nintroduced, I believe, by Senators Ashcroft and Abraham, myself, and a \nnumber of others, whether in his judgment those factors would be \nincluded as being relevant in any study?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I answer my friend from Michigan that I \nbelieve the widest range of considerations should be a part of this \nstudy, including, of course, those that the Senator from Michigan has \nset forth, and for that matter anything else the National Academy of \nSciences considers to be relevant.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And the answer specifically is what?\n  Mr. GORTON. The answer to the question was yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the floor. I have imposed upon my \nfriend from Massachusetts. This was supposed to be just a brief dialog \nwhile we entered a unanimous consent request. He only requested 4 \nminutes and he has yielded to get this done. We have now taken 8 or 9 \nminutes. I don't think that is fair.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent following the statement of the \nSenator from Massachusetts, after his 4 minutes, we then return to \nconsideration of the motion to instruct, and that I be permitted to \nspeak at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I wonder if we could enter the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Has this motion been adopted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No motion has been adopted.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest this motion be agreed to if there is no further \ndebate.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I object.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And the speech of the Senator from Michigan, relative to \nthe motion, be inserted prior to adoption of the motion.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I ask my colleague to suspend. We have run into a couple \nof\n\n[[Page S5214]]\n\npotential language issues that I need a couple of minutes to explore. I \ncan assure my colleague it is not my purpose to delay, but there are \nsome language changes here that we need to check out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the right \nto reclaim the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I had a feeling my 4 minutes was going to \nbe shorter than their 4 minutes. But here is what I am willing to do. I \nwant to try to accommodate my colleagues. I think it is important. I \nknow how important these critical moments are. You want to try to make \nit work when you can.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I know we want to move as quickly as \npossible to the digital signature, e-signature legislation. Obviously, \nwe have to finish the action on the proposed motion to instruct. My \ncomment on the proposal submitted by the Senator from Washington is \nthat I think it moves in a very positive direction.\n  I have introduced legislation in the Senate for the past several \nCongresses, attempting to establish what I consider to be a more \nappropriate way of considering issues related to corporate average fuel \neconomy. Specifically, I feel the current considerations are not broad \nenough. We do not take into account--as I indicated in my speech \nearlier today--the impact on employment in the United States and, more \nspecifically, in the automotive industry. We do not take into account \nsafety; we do not take into account similar factors that matter to the \npeople I represent.\n  The proposal is to have a study conducted by the National Academy of \nSciences that would look specifically at those considerations, as well \nas many others that the Academy or the conference committee would \nrecommend--as the Senator from Washington indicated in the colloquy \nwith my colleague from Michigan--and other criteria that we have \nincluded in legislation that I have introduced in this and previous \nCongresses.\n  The other thing which I have always felt is relevant to this process \nis how the role of Congress should be enhanced. I mentioned this \nearlier today in my remarks. I believe something as directly \nsignificant to the economy of the United States as the automobile \nindustry, and specifically the CAFE standards' impact on that industry, \nare issues that Congress ought to have an ultimate role in addressing. \nI am happy the provisions here would subject any changes--at least in \nthis fiscal year--to the approval of Congress by a joint resolution. I \nthink that makes a lot of sense, because that would put the elected \nofficials of this country--not the unelected bureaucrats of this \ncountry--in the position of making the significant determinations that \nwill impact our economy.\n  For both those reasons I think this approach makes sense for this \nfiscal year. It keeps intact the freeze which we have had in recent \nyears, so there will not be an increase or change in corporate average \nfuel economy standard generated through the process that has existed \nunder United States Code. But at the same time, it does provide those \nwho wanted a study the opportunity to have one conducted by the \nNational Academy of Sciences. It also gives Congress a much more direct \nrole in any changes that might occur during the upcoming year. And it \ndoes, I think, acknowledge the very important criteria beyond simply \nthe question of appropriate levels of fuel economy--criteria like \nsafety, criteria like employment. Criteria that relate to our economy \nwould also be taken into consideration.\n  So I believe this makes sense as now submitted to this body. I hope \nwe can quickly act on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion, as \nmodified.\n  The motion, as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair appoints \nMr. Shelby, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bond, Mr. Gorton, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Byrd, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Inouye conferees on \nthe part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada had a question \nabout the duration of the motion that was just agreed to. It probably \nwould have been better to have stated that it expires on September 30, \n2001, as does the entire bill on that date. I know he wished my \nassurance and the assurance of the people on the other side, Senator \nLevin, that it is our intention, and we will make that clear in any \nfinal conference committee report that this is a 1-fiscal-year \nprovision only and that the entire provision expires at the end of \nfiscal year 2001.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments. To be \nsure, we are saying the entire provision, as I understand the \nobservation of the Senator from Washington, all the language \nincorporated in this motion will expire September 30, 2001.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. May I ask the Senator one other question?\n  Mr. GORTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. BRYAN. There was some discussion about the use of the words \n``recommend'' and ``proposed.'' Can the Senator state his intention \nwith respect to that language?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Michigan asked we use ``recommend'' \nrather than ``proposed.'' I think it is a distinction without a \ndifference. The operative language here is nothing can go into effect \nunless Congress has approved it. Whether it comes in the form of a \nrecommendation from the Department of Transportation or proposal from \nthe Department of Transportation, Congress has to approve it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Perhaps our recollection is different, but I am not sure \nit makes a major difference. My recollection is in the original draft \nof this motion, the Senator from Washington had used the word \n``recommend.'' I may be wrong on this, but this is my recollection, \nwhich I have shared with my good friend from Nevada so we are all \nstraight with each other, as we always are.\n  The word at some point was changed to ``proposed,'' and then a number \nof us on this side of the issue urged the word ``recommend\" be used \ninstead of ``proposed'' to avoid any implication that this was a \nproposed rulemaking. That was the reason that word did have some \nrelevance. There is no intention here that there be a proposed \nrulemaking which be authorized in any way by this motion. The word \n``proposed'' could create an implication which was unintended, whereas \nthe word ``recommend'' does not have that implication.\n  That was my recollection. If I am wrong on that, then I certainly \nwant my friend from Nevada to know historically that was my \nrecollection, and that is what I represented to him.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I appreciate the explanation of the Senator from Michigan. \nI say with great respect, I believe and I recall--and I may be in error \nas well--that the language ``proposed'' was originally offered by my \nfriend from Michigan. I know he has a different recollection, and we \nare not, obviously, going to resolve it. I know he has been acting in \ngood faith, and I know he knows I have been asking in good faith.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That question, of whether the words ``recommend\" or \n``proposed,'' in any event, was explicitly discussed among all of us \nwho were involved in this revised motion, and it was important to those \nof us who opposed the original motion that the word ``recommend'' be \nused for the reason I just gave.\n\n  If the recollection of the Senator from Washington is the word \n``proposed'' originally was made by me, if in fact that is true, so be \nit. That is not my recollection. Nonetheless, it did become an issue in \ndiscussion whether the word be ``proposed\" or ``recommend,'' and it \nbecame important to those of us opposing the motion that the word \n``recommend'' be used to avoid that implication which everybody said \nwas not intended.\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. In one minor respect, the senior Senator from Michigan is \nin error. My own handwritten first draft said ``proposed.'' I simply \nacceded to the recommendation of the Senator from Michigan that we use \nthe word ``recommend.''\n  Clearly, what we are speaking about is the promulgation of a rule, \nand nothing can be promulgated by the Department of Transportation \nwithout approval of a joint resolution of Congress. So whether it \nrecommends or proposes, they are going to have to come here before any \nrule takes place.\n  In connection with my earlier answer, all of these bars are off in a \nyear. We will be right back here next year, I hope maybe not debating \nthe same issue. I hope we may have been able to reach a conclusion on \nit.\n  Finally, the point of all these words, what we are now doing is \ninstructing our conferees to a conference with the House of \nRepresentatives, and it is the words and the requirement that come out \nof that conference committee, of course, that will govern actual future \naction.\n  My intention as a member of that conference committee, and perhaps \nthe only one in this colloquy who is a member of that conference \ncommittee, will be to see to it that we have a very thorough study of \nthis subject. I hope, like my colleagues from Michigan, that it will \nrecommend stronger corporate average fuel economy standards, but I am \nwilling to listen to the experts in that connection. If it does, I will \nsupport them in this body, but if something else happens, we will be \ndebating this issue again next year. The law that applies to corporate \naverage fuel economy standards today will apply when this fiscal year \nis over once again, and the same kind of rulemaking will take place \nthen.\n\n  I hope I have not spoken too long on this subject, but I think we \nought to get on with it now and do the job that needs to be done.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to indicate I was actually \nspeaking on the floor at the time that the initial exchange of \ndocuments took place, but from the point at which I concluded my \nremarks and began discussing this issue with the Senator from Michigan \nand the Senator from Washington, it was certainly my understanding that \nthe intention, and certainly our side's intention, in urging the word \n``recommend'' be employed was to make precisely the distinction which \nmy colleague from Michigan just indicated. Certainly there was an \nimportant element to that change from my point of view, as I know there \nwas from his.\n  I am hopeful as the process moves forward that it will do so in the \nconstructive way we have outlined. We ought to make clear a rulemaking \nprocedure is where ``a proposed set of rules'' would be the term of art \nused. For a study, which is what we intended here--a recommendation is \ndifferent from the proposal that might stem from an actual rulemaking. \nThat is my interpretation of the discussions in which I at least took \npart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/15/senate-section/article/S5215-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the conference agreement on digital \nsignatures that is going to be overwhelmingly approved tomorrow morning \nmay be the big sleeper of this Congress, but it certainly was not the \n``big easy.''\n  The fact of the matter is, when we started on this in March of 1999, \nSenator Abraham and I envisioned a fairly simple interim bill. We were \nlooking at electronic signatures to make sure that in the online world, \nwhen you sent an electronic signature, it would carry the same legal \nweight as a ``John Hancock'' in the offline world.\n  But as we prepared--after this passed the Commerce Committee--to move \nforward with a pretty innocuous bill, the financial services and \ninsurance industries came to us with what we thought was a very \nimportant and thoughtful concept; and that was to revolutionize e-\ncommerce, to go beyond establishing the legal validity of e-signatures \nto include electronic records, keeping important records \nelectronically. We were told by industry--and correctly so--that this \nwould give America a chance to save billions and billions of dollars \nand thousands of\n\n[[Page S5216]]\n\nhours, as our companies chose to spend their funds on matters other \nthan paper recordkeeping.\n  At the same time, the consumer groups that sought this proposal were \nextremely frightened. They saw this as an opportunity for unscrupulous \nindividuals to come on in and rip off senior citizens, to foreclose on \npeople's homes, to cut off health insurance, and things of that nature, \nby just perhaps an e-mail into cyberspace.\n  Chairman McCain is here. This is truly a bipartisan effort in every \nrespect. I had a chance to work with my senior colleagues on this side, \nSenator Leahy, Senator Hollings, Senator Sarbanes, and our friend \nSenator Kerry, who is here. And let me tell you, it ultimately took \nthree Senate committees 8 months and thousands of hours to get it done. \nWe had to bring together key principles of what is known as the old \neconomy, such as consumer protection and informed consent, and fuse \nthem together with the principles of the new economy and the online \nworld, and the chance to save time and money through electronic records \nand electronic signatures.\n  What we tried to say, on this side of the aisle, and what we were \nable to get a bipartisan agreement around, is the proposition that \nconsumer rights are not virtual rights. We have to make sure--and we \nhave it in this legislation--that the protections that apply offline \nwould apply online. We were able to do it without enduring all kinds of \nunnecessary redtape and bureaucracy. I wanted the bill to unleash the \npotential of electronic signatures and records for industry without \nshattering a cornerstone of American commerce: the right of individual \nconsumers to have meaningful and informed consent and to keep accurate \nrecords of their contracts and transactions.\n\n  I believe the conference agreement before the Senate has met the \nchallenge of protecting consumer rights in the new economy.\n  Consumer rights are not virtual rights. Consumers must enjoy the same \nbasic rights in the online world as they have in the off-line world. \nThrough the electronic consumer consent provision in Section 101(c) \nthat I authored with Senators Leahy, Hollings and Sarbanes, I believe \nwe have adequately translated offline consumer protections into online \nconsumer protections.\n  Let me just spend a minute describing this key provision of the \nconference agreement. This provision requires that consumer consent \nmust be meaningful. We all know of cases where someone said, ``Just e-\nmail me that document,'' only to have that person call later, saying \n``Gee, I couldn't open the document, can you fax it to me?'' I can't \nrecall how many times this exact thing happened to our own staff during \nthe negotiation of this agreement.\n  Meaningful consumer consent doesn't mean being given a pageful of \nhardware and software specification gobbledygook. It means consenting \nelectronically so that a consumer knows he or she can receive, read and \nretain the information in an electronic record.\n  Section 101(c) provides that if a statute, regulation or other rule \nof law requires that information relating to a transaction be provided \nor made available to a consumer in writing, the vendor can use \nelectronic means if the consumer, prior to consenting, has been given a \nclear and conspicuous statement of his or her rights. The consumer must \nbe informed of the option of getting the record on paper, and what the \nconsequences are if he or she later withdraws the electronic consent in \nfavor of returning to paper records. Some vendors, for example, may be \nable to achieve considerable savings by using electronic records, and \noffer customers a much more attractive price for doing business online \nrather than through traditional paper and snail mail. But a vendor \nmight not want to be locked into a lower price if the buyer reverts to \npaper later in the life of the contract. This provision will assure a \nconsumer will be informed up front of any change in the cost if the \nconsumer withdraws consent to receive records electronically subsequent \nto consummation of the contract. This could happen, for instance, if a \nconsumer finds he cannot access the documents electronically, or the \nvendor chooses to upgrade his software and the consumer does not want \nto go to the expense of upgrading his system to accommodate the change.\n  The consumer must also be informed of the hardware and software \nnecessary to access and retain records electronically, how to withdraw \nelectronic consent, how to update information needed to contact the \nconsumer electronically, the categories of records that will be \nprovided or made available electronically, how a consumer may request a \npaper copy of an electronic record and whether a fee will be charged \nfor such copy. If a vendor changes the electronic system used to obtain \nthe original consent electronically, the vendor must obtain the consent \nelectronically again using the new system and the same two-way consent \nprocess.\n  Most importantly, the consumer must consent electronically or confirm \nhis or her consent electronically in a manner that reasonably \ndemonstrates that the consumer can access the information in the \nelectronic form that will be used to provide the information. This is \ncritical. ``Reasonably demonstrates'' means just that. It means the \nconsumer can prove his or her ability to access the electronic \ninformation that will be provided. It means the consumer, in response \nto an electronic vendor enquiry, actually opens an attached document \nsent electronically by the vendor and confirms that ability in an e-\nmail response.\n  It means there is a two-way street. It is not sufficient for the \nvendor to tell the consumer what type of computer or software he or she \nneeds. It is not sufficient for the consumer merely to tell the vendor \nin an e-mail that he or she can access the information in the specified \nformats. There must be meaningful two-way communication electronically \nbetween the vendor and consumer.\n  At the heart of these provisions is the concern--shared by many in \nthe industry as well--that electronic communication, e-mail, is not as \nreliable or as ubiquitous as traditional first class mail. Until \nadvances in electronic mail technology eliminate such concerns and \nuntil the vast majority of Americans are comfortable using the \ntechnology of the New Economy, consent to use electronic records \nrequires special care and attention. Because of such concerns, there \nare some areas where the use of electronic notice and records are \nsimply not appropriate today. Section 103 of the conference agreement \nrecognizes this by continuing to require paper notice. These areas \ninclude shutting off a consumer's utilities, canceling or terminating \nhealth insurance or benefits or life insurance benefits, foreclosing on \nsomeone's primary residence, recall of a product that risks endangering \nhealth or safety and documents required to accompany the transportation \nor handling of hazardous materials, pesticides, or other toxic or \ndangerous materials. What happens, for example, if a hazmat truck \nloaded with toxic waste spills its cargo, endangering a community, and \nthe only notice about the hazardous cargo was posted on the company's \nwebsite? Is it fair to allow a mortgage lender to foreclosure on \nsomeone's home just because their ISP went out of business and they \nweren't receiving their payment notices electronically? The exceptions \nwe fought for in this section of the conference agreement will protect \nconsumers.\n  Before paying tribute to those who worked so hard on this bill. I \nbelieve it is important to the legislative history to say a brief word \nabout the process. This is necessary because, unfortunately, statements \nare being made or inserted in the Record and colloquies are being \noffered that seek to weaken, undermine and even directly contradict the \nactual words of the text of the Conference Agreement. This appears to \ncome from some quarters that do not share the majority view of those \nwho signed the Conference documents. As one of the principal sponsors \nof the Senate measures, S. 761, I am compelled to point out that the \nactual text of the legislation can and should stand on its own.\n  The negotiations that led to the final legislative document were very \ndifficult and contentious. Because of this, part of the agreement on \nthe final language included a commitment--a sort of ``gentleman's \nagreement'' if you will--from all the signers of the Conference \nAgreement not to prepare the normal Statement of Managers that \naccompanies a Conference document. There is no Statement of Managers \nfor\n\n[[Page S5217]]\n\nS. 761, and no one should pretend there is. As one of the key managers \nfor the Senate, I can attest that I did not participate in negotiating \nsuch a document, not did I acquiesce to one prepared by another party \nor parties or sign one.\n  The conference agreement is the product of many, many long days and \nnights of negotiations. Commerce Committee Chairman McCain, Ranking \nDemocrat Senator Hollings, Senators Leahy and Sarbanes, and Senator \nAbraham all contributed to this product. The efforts of our \ndistinguished colleagues in the House, Commerce Committee Chairman \nBliley and Ranking Democrat John Dingell, were critical in this \nprocess. I would also like to recognize some of the key staff and \nAdministration officials who did yeoman work to produce this agreement. \nIn particular, Senator Hollings' Counsel, Mosses Boyd, and his Commerce \nCommittee Staff Director, Kevin Kayes, Senator Leahy's outstanding \nJudiciary counsel, Julie Katzman, Senator Sarbanes' Banking Staff, \nMarty Gruenberg and Jonathan Miller. Chairman McCain's very able and \npatient counsel, Maureen McLaughlin, and Senator Abraham's lead staffer \non this bill, Kevin Kolevar. Sarah Rosen-Wartell of the White House \nstaff and Commerce Department General Counsel Andy Pincus also deserve \npraise for their hard work on this bill.\n  This conference agreement came perilously close on more than one \noccasion to running off the rails, but each time the will was found to \nresume negotiations and try to bring the conference to a close. This is \nalso a tribute to the hard work of a handful of consumer and industry \ngroups who did not want to give up on the process. I urge my colleagues \nto vote for this agreement, which lays another important cornerstone \nfor electronic commerce.\n  At the end of the day, this is not a perfect bill. I do not think any \nof the conferees would argue that it is. But it is a very good bill. It \nis a very good bill because, as a result of three Senate committees and \nthousands of hours, we took key principles of what was known as the old \neconomy--consumer protection, informed consent, making sure that the \nvulnerable, the elderly, and people for whom the home and health care \nare lifeline concerns--we ensured that they will be protected, while at \nthe same time allowing those in the financial services industry, who \ncame to us with sensible suggestions for saving time and money--by \ntaking records from paper to the electronic world--to have their \nconcerns addressed, while at the same time being true to fundamental \nvalues of consumer protection and the fusing together of the new and \nthe old economy. That is what I think makes this legislation so \nspecial.\n  Chairman McCain is here. He and his staff did an extraordinary job, \nas did Senator Abraham. I cannot say enough good things about four \nsenior Democrats--Senator Leahy, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Hollings, \nand Senator Kerry--because they helped us champion those consumer \nprotection principles that were so important and helped us get this \nbill done right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Oregon in \nexpressing support for what we have achieved here. I begin by thanking \nSenator McCain, Senator Sarbanes, and Senator Hollings for their \nleadership. They helped to create the climate within which we were able \nto finally get together with the House leadership.\n  But also I thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon. He is \nextraordinarily knowledgeable in this arena and very creative. And he \nworks hard at it. He really has helped to shape the outcome of this in \na significant way. I think he has done a very good job of outlining the \ntensions that existed here.\n  Many of us thought, at the outset of this endeavor, that we could \naccomplish this quickly. We ran into, as he said, complications along \nthe road. The key to many of us was that even as we provided the legal \ncapacity for electronic signatures to take place and certain \nrecordkeeping to take place, we did not want to diminish the rights of \nour citizens to have access to information about them, we did not want \ntheir ability to be able to make corrections to be diminished somehow. \nWe did not want to diminish their right to know about themselves or \nabout their own transactions in a way that would diminish their \nposition in the marketplace. And that is a difficult thing. We worked \nthrough that. I think we are still going to be working through that for \nsome time.\n  But the important thing is that this phenomenon, this revolution that \nis taking place in America and across the globe in how we do business, \nneeded to be----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield me 30 more seconds?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the Senator 30 more seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. That revolution needed to be able to continue in its most \ncreative form and, frankly, with the best upside possible for the \npeople to whom we are all accountable, who are the consumers, the \ncitizens, and the people who ultimately we want to have benefit from \nthis. I think this legislation is very positive in that regard.\n  I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, for \nhis leadership and his courtesy in letting the usually mostly abused \nand beleaguered minority take a dominant position at the outset of the \ndebate. It is characteristic of him that he allowed us to do that. It \nis a very momentary glimpse of freedom we are not used to. We thank him \nfor that. It is just whetting our appetite and only makes us work \nharder to have that dominant position forever.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate both my friend from Oregon \nand my friend from Massachusetts for their work on this bill. I \nappreciate their comments. It is a great pleasure to work with both of \nthem on the Commerce Committee.\n  I think sometimes it is worthy of note, in these days of tension, \nthat on the Commerce Committee we have a great habit of working in a \nbipartisan fashion. I would argue that no bill that I know of has been \nreported out of our committee that was not a bipartisan effort. No bill \nhas been reported out, that I know of in the years that I have been the \nchairman, that was strictly along party lines.\n  Mr. President, tonight the Senate considers the conference report for \nS. 761, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. \nBefore I summarize the bill, I want to note for the Record the \nimportance of this measure.\n  The bipartisan legislation would be a significant achievement for \nthis Congress and the American people. Today in America we are in the \nmidst of a phenomenal transformation from the industrial age to the \ninformation age.\n  Even as we speak, Americans are on the Internet, browsing, \nresearching, and experiencing in ever-greater numbers. They are also \nbuying. In fact, electronic commerce is one of the principle engines \ndriving our Nation's unprecedented economic growth. For example, \nForrester Research has estimated that consumer spending online will \ntotal $185 billion by 2003. During this past holiday season alone, \nonline merchants transacted an estimated $5-7 billion dollars worth of \ncommerce--a 300% increase in business from 1998.\n\n  But one great barrier to the continued growth of Internet commerce is \nthe lack of consistent, national rules governing the use of electronic \nsignatures. A majority of States have enacted electronic authentication \nlaws, but no two of these laws are the same. This inconsistency deters \nbusinesses and consumers from using electronic signature technologies \nto authorize contracts or transactions.\n  This bipartisan legislation can eliminate this unnecessary barrier to \nthe growth of electronic commerce by providing consistent, fair rules \ngoverning electronic signatures and records.\n  This bill will do the following:\n  It would ensure that consistent rules for validating electronic \nsignatures and transactions apply throughout the country. Thus \nproviding industry with the legal certainty needed to grow electronic \ncommerce.\n  It empowers businesses to replace expensive warehouses full of \nawkward and irreplaceable paper records with electronic records that \nare easily searched or duplicated. Moreover,\n\n[[Page S5218]]\n\nState and Federal agencies are prohibited from requiring a business to \nkeep paper records except under extreme circumstances--where they can \nshow a compelling government interest. To prevent abuses of electronic \nrecordkeeping, however, the bill also authorizes regulatory agencies to \ndefine document integrity standards that are necessary to insure \nagainst fraud.\n  It would also ensure that private commercial actors get to choose the \ntype of electronic signatures that they want to use. This will ensure \nthat the free market--not government bureaucrats--will determine which \ntechnologies succeed. To that end, the legislation also prohibits \nStates or Federal agencies from according ``greater legal status or \neffect'' to one specific technology.\n  And this bill recognizes that without consumer confidence, the \nInternet can never reach its full potential. Thus, this bill empowers \nconsumers to conduct transactions or receive records electronically \nwithout foregoing the benefits of State consumer disclosure \nrequirements.\n  Specifically, the bill would provide that when consumers choose to \nconduct transactions or receive records electronically, electronic \nrecords can satisfy laws requiring a written consumer disclosure if: \nconsumers have been given a statement explaining what records they are \nagreeing to receive electronically, the procedures for withdrawing \nconsent, and any relevant fees, and consumers consent, or confirm \nconsent electronically, in a manner that reasonably demonstrates that \nthey can actually access the information.\n  The goal of these consumer protection provisions is basic fairness. \nTo that end, if a business changes hardware or software requirements in \na way that precludes the consumer from accessing or retaining the \nrecords, the consumer can withdraw consent--without a fee.\n  But the bill also ensures that these consumer protections do not \nbecome unduly burdensome as technology advances. Thus, for example, the \nbill provides that a Federal regulatory agency can exempt categories of \nrecords from the consumer consent provisions if this would eliminate a \nsubstantial burden on e-commerce without jeopardizing consumers.\n  I also note that the bill directs the Secretary of Commerce and the \nFederal Trade Commission to report to Congress on the benefits and \nburdens of the bill's consumer protection provisions. It also directs \nthe Secretary of Commerce to report to Congress within 12 months on the \neffectiveness of delivering consumer notices via email.\n  This is important legislation, and my colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Abraham, is to be commended for his foresight in introducing \nthis legislation. He is responsible for the formulation of it. He has \nshepherded it through for many months. I commend him for his work on \nthis legislation. It is safe to say this legislation and conference \nreport would not be here today if not for the efforts of Senator \nAbraham. I also commend Senators Stevens, Burns, Wyden, Leahy, Hollings \nand Sarbanes for their commitment to bipartisan agreement on the \ncritical issues raised by this legislation. And, I thank Chairman \nBliley and ranking member Dingell in the House, for their dedication \nand leadership on this issue.\n  Reaching a bipartisan agreement on the issues raised by this \nlegislation has not been easy. In fact, the conferees to this bill have \nspent months considered the often-conflicting views of various \nindustries, consumer protection groups, State governments and federal \nagencies.\n  Needless to say, the bill that emerged from this broad and \ncontentious process had to try to strike a fair balance between the \noften-conflicting interests of these groups. As a result, some factions \nmay have had doubts about the bill because they thought that a narrower \nor partisan legislative process might have produced a bill more slanted \ntowards their narrow interests.\n  But that sort of thinking is short-sighted and fatally flawed: Where \nthis legislation is concerned, a narrow or partisan approach would have \njeopardized the growth of electronic commerce. This would have harmed \nbusinesses, consumers and the national economy--including the same \nspecial interests that a narrower approach might have sought to favor.\n  We must recognize that this bill represents one step in the \ncontinuing--and unfinished--process of integrating electronic \ntransactions and the Internet into the mainstream of American commerce. \nThis process of integration must continue if we are to continue to \nenjoy the unprecedented economic growth that e-commerce and technology \nhave helped bring to this country.\n  But electronic commerce cannot continue to grow and develop without \nbroad support from consumers, businesses and governments. Consumers \nwill not support electronic commerce if they discover that electronic \ntransactions strip them of traditional protections.\n  Nor will businesses support electronic commerce if they cannot \nrealize the cost savings it offers. Finally, governments may not enact \nlaws supporting electronic commerce should such transactions strip \ntheir citizens of rights that they have previously enjoyed.\n  Electronic signatures legislation must, therefore, balance the \ninterests of these various groups without unduly favoring any of them: \nit must give electronic commerce the certainty it needs to grow while \npreserving the consumer protections that States have chosen to apply in \npaper-based commercial transactions.\n  The broad and bipartisan support enjoyed by this legislation is the \nsurest sign that it has achieved its most important objective: It has \nstruck a fair balance between competing interests that will ensure \ncontinued broad support for the growth of electronic commerce.\n  Mr. President, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National \nCommerce Act is a positive, confidence-creating tool that will allow \nthe Internet to continue to develop towards its full potential as a \nconduit for information, communication and commerce. It will enable \nbusinesses and consumers alike to rely on digital signatures regardless \nof their physical location. Uniform standards for digital signatures \nwill decrease costs while increasing certainty and consumer confidence. \nThe value of these public benefits should not be underestimated.\n  In closing, I want again to thank Chairman Bliley, and Ranking Member \nDingell in the House for all of their work. In the Senate, I note the \nhard work of the ranking member of the committee, Mr. Hollings, Senator \nWyden, and others. Without their efforts this bill would not be before \nus today. I especially, again, recognize the incredible job done by \nSenator Abraham, the original sponsor of the legislation, the original \nshepherd, the person who played a key and vital role in the formulation \nof these final agreements.\n  Given the importance of these issues to consumers, businesses and our \nglobal economy, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a listing of the groups that support S. \n761 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                       Groups that support S. 761\n\n       1.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally \ngoing to be considering the conference report on S. 761, the Electronic \nSignatures and Global and National Commerce Act.\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\n  I wish to be compassionate this Thursday evening. Tomorrow when the \ndelayed votes occur, I will be in Vermont. But I am never sorry to be \nin Vermont. I will regret missing the final tally. I was honored to \nserve as a conferee and to help develop the conference report. I signed \nthe conference report. I supported final passage. I go back to my \nnative State secure in the knowledge that this will pass overwhelmingly \nwith strong bipartisan support.\n  The legislation is intended to permit and encourage the continued \nexpansion of electronic commerce and promote public confidence in the \nintegrity and reliability of online commerce. These are worthy goals--\ngoals I have long sought to advance. For example, in the last Congress, \nmany of us worked together to pass the Government Paperwork Elimination \nAct. That gave a framework for the Federal Government's use of \nelectronic forums and also electronic signatures.\n  Many of us have worked together in a very successful, bipartisan \neffort to promote the widespread use of inscription and to relax \noutdated export controls in this critical technology for ensuring the \nconfidentiality and integrity of online communications and storing of \ncomputer information. We have areas as diverse as enhancing copyright, \nto patent potential for technology, to addressing the problems of \ncybercrime. We have been able to work together in a constructive, \nbipartisan way to make real progress to allow electronic commerce to \nflourish.\n  The conference report is a product of such bipartisan cooperation. We \nall know there were some bumps along the way. At one point, industry \nrepresentatives were warned against even speaking with Democrats. \nFortunately, those warnings were not heeded, and the final product is \nbipartisan.\n  I commend Chairman Bliley from the other body, and Chairman McCain \nfrom this body, for making this a real conference in which all \nconferees--Republicans and Democrats--had an opportunity to air their \nconcerns and contribute to the final report.\n  All of us might have written some provision differently. But the \nconference report is, as conference reports should be, a solid and \nreasonable consensus bill that brought in the best of each of us.\n  It will establish a Federal framework for the use of electronic \nsignatures for contracts and records to preserve essential safeguards \nand protect consumers.\n  It is geared to the five basic principles articulated by the \nDemocratic Senators in a letter dated March 28, 2000, which assures \neffective consumer consent for the replacement of paper notices with \nelectronic notices.\n  It ensures that electronic records are accurate.\n  It enhances legal certainty for electronic signatures.\n  It avoids unnecessary litigation.\n  It avoids unintended consequences in areas outside the scope of the \nbill by providing clear Federal regulatory authority.\n  It avoids facilitating predatory or unlawful practices.\n  This is not rocket science. But they want to make sure the American \npeople can trust the electronic world as they trust paperwork. The \nAmerican public have enough concern when they go online. They worry \nwhether their privacy will be protected and whether damage by a \ncomputer virus will hurt their computer, whether a computer hacker will \nsteal personal information or adopt their identity, wreak havoc with \ntheir good name, or whether their children will meet a sexual predator. \nThese are all drags on electronic commerce and show the people have to \nbe concerned.\n\n  The AARP found that of consumers over the age of 45, half of them \nworry that electronic contracts will give them less protection than \npaper contracts. That is what we want to avoid.\n  The United States has been the incubator of the Internet throughout \nits infancy. And the world closely watches whenever we in our country \ndebate or enact policies that affect the Internet. That is another \nreason why we must act carefully and intelligently when we pass \nInternet-related laws. The rest of the world watches and follows our \nexample.\n  We have produced a charter for the next growth phase of e-commerce. \nThis bill will be closely watched, widely read, and will be emulated \nacross the world. Because of that and because most Americans want to \nmake sure we can take our consumer laws for granted, we are presented \nthe most significant consumer issues of a decade or longer. We have \nimproved what the bill almost became considerably, to the benefit of \nconsumers and in the interests of the smooth and sensible forward \nprogress of Internet commerce.\n  This bill does strike a constructive balance. It advances electronic \ncommerce but doesn't terminate or mangle the basic rights of consumers.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally considering \nthe conference report on S. 761, ``The Electronic Signatures in Global \nand National Commerce Act''. I wish that we could pass it tonight. \nTomorrow, when the delayed vote occurs, I will be in Vermont. While I \nam never sorry to be in Vermont, I will regret missing the final tally. \nI was honored to serve as a conferee and help develop the conference \nreport. I signed the conference report and support its final passage. I \ngo back to my native State secure in the knowledge that it will pass \noverwhelmingly.\n  This legislation is intended to permit and encourage the continued \nexpansion of electronic commerce and to promote public confidence in \nthe integrity and reliability of online promises. These are worthy \ngoals, and they are goals that I have long sought to advance.\n  For example, in the last Congress, many of us worked together to pass \nthe Government Paperwork Elimination Act, which established a framework \nfor the federal government's use of electronic forms and electronic \nsignatures. Many of us have worked together in a successful bipartisan \neffort to promote the widespread use of encryption and relax out-dated \nexport controls on this critical technology for ensuring the \nconfidentiality and integrity of online communications and stored \ncomputer information. In areas as diverse as enhancing copyright and \npatent protections for new technologies and updating our criminal laws \nto address new forms of cybercrime, we have been able to work together \nin a constructive, bipartisan way to make real progress on a sound \nlegal framework for electronic commerce to flourish.\n  The conference report is the product of such bipartisan cooperation. \nI think we all know that there were some bumps along the way. At one \npoint, industry representatives were warned against even speaking with \nany Democrats. But the final product is bipartisan. It is an example of \nCongress at work rather than at loggerheads. It is legislators \nlegislating rather than politicians posturing and unnecessarily \npoliticizing important matters of public policy.\n  I commend Chairman Bliley and Chairman McCain for making this a real \nconference, in which all conferees, Republican and Democratic, had an \nopportunity to air their concerns and contribute to the final report. \nWe all might have written some provisions differently, but the \nconference report is a solid and reasonable consensus bill that will \nestablish a Federal framework for the use of electronic signatures, \ncontracts, and records, while preserving essential safeguards \nprotecting the Nation's consumers.\n  The conference report adheres to the five basic principles for e-sign \nlegislation articulated by the Democrat Senators in a letter dated \nMarch 28, 2000.\n  It ensures effective consumer consent to the replacement of paper \nnotices with electronic notices.\n  It ensures that electronic records are accurate, and relevant parties \ncan retain and access them.\n  It enhances legal certainty for electronic signatures and records and \navoids unnecessary litigation by authorizing regulators to provide \ninterpretive guidance.\n  It avoids unintended consequences in areas outside the scope of the \nbill by providing clear federal regulatory authority for records not \ncovered by the bill's ``consumer'' provisions.\n  And, it avoids facilitating predatory or unlawful practices.\n  These principles are not rocket science but are simply intended to \nensure that the electronic world is no less safe for American consumers \nthan the paper world. The American public has enough concern when they \ngo online. They worry whether their privacy will\n\n[[Page S5220]]\n\nbe protected, whether a damaging computer virus will attack their \ncomputer, whether a computer hacker will steal their personal \ninformation, adopt their identity and wreak havoc with their good \nnames, or whether their kids will meet a sexual predator. These worries \nare all serious drags on electronic commerce.\n  An AARP survey of computer users over the age of 45 released on March \n31st found that almost half of respondents already think that \nelectronic contracts would give them less protection than paper \ncontracts, while only one-third believe they would have the same degree \nof protection. With this conference report, we have avoided aggravating \nconsumers' worries. Companies doing business online want to reassure \nconsumers and potential customers that their interests will be \nprotected online, not heighten their concern about electronic commerce. \nOur conference report should be helpful in this regard.\n  Mr. President, the United States has been the incubator of the \nInternet through its infancy. The world closely watches whenever we \ndebate or enact policies that affect the Internet, and that is another \nreason why we must act carefully and intelligently whenever we pass \nInternet-related laws. What we have produced here is the charter for \nthe next growth phase of e-commerce, and this bill will be closely read \nand widely emulated. Because of the potential this bill had for \neviscerating scores of basic state consumer protection laws that most \nAmericans today take for granted, this bill also has presented us with \nperhaps the most significant consumer issues of a decade or longer--not \nfor what, thank goodness, this bill is in its final form, but for what \nthis bill nearly became in its earlier stages. To the benefit of \nconsumers and in the interest of the smooth and sensible forward \nprogress of Internet commerce, this bill largely strikes a constructive \nbalance. It advances electronic commerce without terminating or \nmangling the basic rights of consumers.\n  Before I discuss specific provisions of the conference report, I note \nthat I saw in the Congressional Record of the House proceedings a \nstatement by Chairman Bliley that is formatted like a managers' \nstatement of a conference report. I feel I must clarify that those are \nMr. Bliley's views, not a statement of the managers. In fact, I saw it \nfor the first time today, when I picked up the Congressional Record, \nand have not yet had a chance to study it thoroughly.\n  I will now describe how the conference report gives effect to the \nDemocratic Senators' five basic principles.\n  First, the conference report will ensure informed and effective \nconsumer consent to the replacement of paper notices and disclosures \nwith electronic notices and disclosures, so that consumers are not \nforced or tricked into receiving notices and disclosures in an \nelectronic form that they cannot access or decipher.\n  Under the House bill, a business could obtain a consumer's \n``consent'' simply by specifying the hardware and software needed to \naccess the notices and disclosures. This approach would have done \nlittle or nothing to protect technologically unsophisticated consumers, \nwho may not know whether they have the necessary hardware and software \neven if the technical specifications are provided.\n  I maintained that any standard for affirmative consent must require \nconsumers to consent electronically to the provision of electronic \nnotices and disclosures in a manner that verified the consumer's \ncapacity to access the information in the form in which it would be \nsent. Such a mechanism provides a check against coercion, and \nadditional assurance that the consumer actually has an operating e-mail \naddress and the other technical means for accessing the information.\n  Section 101(c) of the conference report requires the use of a \ntechnological check, while leaving companies with ample flexibility to \ndevelop their own procedures. The critical language, which Senator \nWyden and I developed and proposed, provides that a consumer's consent \nto the provision of information in electronic form must involve a \ndemonstration that the consumer can actually receive and read the \ninformation. Section 101(c) also provides that if there is a material \nchange in the hardware or software requirements needed to access or \nretain the information, the company must again verify that the consumer \ncan receive and read the information, or allow the consumer to withdraw \nhis or her consent without the imposition of any conditions, \nconsequences or fees. In addition, prior to any consent, a consumer \nmust be notified of his or her rights, including the right to receive \nnotices on paper and any available option for reverting to paper after \nan electronic relationship has been established.\n  Senator Gramm has criticized the conference report on the ground that \nits technological check on consumer consent unfairly discriminates \nagainst electronic commerce. But those most familiar with electronic \ncommerce have never seriously disputed the need for a technological \ncheck. In fact, many high tech firms have acknowledged that it is good \nbusiness practice to verify that their customers can open their \nelectronic records, and many already have implemented some sort of \ntechnological check procedure. I am confident that the benefits of a \none-time technological check far outweigh any possible burden on e-\ncommerce, and it will greatly increase consumer confidence in the \nelectronic marketplace.\n  Let me make special note of section 101(c)(3), a late addition to the \nconference report. Without this provision, industry representatives \nwere concerned that consumers would be able to back out of otherwise \nenforceable contracts by refusing to consent, or to confirm their \nconsent, to the provision of information in an electronic form. At the \nsame time, however, companies wanted to preserve their autonomy as \ncontracting parties to condition their own performance on the \nconsumer's consent. For example companies anticipated that they might \noffer special deals for consumers who agreed not to exercise their \nright to paper notices. Section 101(c)(3) makes clear that failure to \nsatisfy the consent requirements of section 101(c)(1) does not \nautomatically vitiate the underlying contract. Rather, the continued \nvalidity of the contract would turn on the terms of the contract \nitself, and the intent of the contracting parties, as determined under \napplicable principles of State contract law. Failure to obtain \nelectronic consent or confirmation of consent would, however, prevent a \ncompany from relying on section 101(a) to validate an electronic record \nthat was required to be provided or made available to the consumer in \nwriting.\n\n  I should also explain the significance of section 101(c)(6), which \nwas added at the request of the Democratic conferees. This provision \nmakes clear that a telephone conversation cannot be substituted for a \nwritten notice to a consumer. For decades, consumer laws have required \nthat notices be in writing, because that form is one that the consumer \ncan preserve, to which the consumer can refer, and which is capable of \ndemonstrating after the fact what information was provided. Under \nappropriate conditions, electronic communications can mimic those \ncharacteristics; but oral notice over the telephone will never be \nsufficient to protect consumer interests.\n  Second, the conference report will ensure that electronic contracts \nand other electronic records are accurate and that relevant persons can \nretain and access them. Consumers must be able to retain electronic \nrecords and must have some assurance that they provide reasonable \nguarantees of the accuracy and integrity of the information that they \ncontain.\n  Under section 101(e) of the conference report, the legal effect of an \nelectronic contract or record may be denied if it is not in a form that \ncan be retained and accurately reproduced for later reference and \nsettlement of disputes. This means that the parties to a contract may \nnot satisfy a statute of frauds requirement that the contract be in \nwriting simply by flashing an electronic version of the contract on a \ncomputer screen. Similarly, product warranties must be provided to \npurchasers in a form that they can retain and use to enforce their \nrights in the event that the product fails.\n  Third, the conference report will enhance legal certainty for \nelectronic signatures and records and avoid unnecessary litigation by \nauthorizing Federal and State regulators to provide\n\n[[Page S5221]]\n\ninterpretive guidance. Even with the representation on this conference \nof Members from committees of varied jurisdiction, we could not begin \nto think of every circumstance that might arise in the future as to \nwhich this legislation will apply. It was therefore essential to \nprovide regulatory agencies with sufficient flexibility and \ninterpretive authority to implement the statutes modified by the \nlegislation.\n  Most importantly, the conference report preserves substantial \nauthority for Federal and State regulators with respect to record-\nkeeping requirements. In a letter dated May 23, 2000, the Department of \nJustice expressed concern that an early draft of the conference report, \nproduced by certain Republican conferees, would ``seriously undermine \nthe government's ability to investigate, try and convict criminals who \nalter or hide required records in programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, \nand federal environmental laws.'' The Department explained:\n\n       Record Retention. As presently drafted, the bill leaves the \n     public at risk for serious waste, fraud, and abuse. For \n     example, under the current bill, there is nothing to prevent \n     a Medicare contractor from retaining its financial records on \n     a spreadsheet (such as Excel or Quattro Pro). However, \n     because those programs generally contain no security features \n     to monitor changes to the files they create, anyone could \n     change one number on a spreadsheet, which would then change \n     all other numbers affected by the impermissible entry, \n     reflecting a financial picture different from the reality. \n     The government could have its hands tied in seeking to \n     establish rules to ensure that such records could not be \n     altered.\n\n  The Department's concerns regarding the Federal Government were \nshared by the States, whose regulators need and deserve the same \nflexibility as Federal regulators. This is particularly true in areas \nwhere the States are the primary regulators, as they are with respect \nto insurance and State-chartered banks. Having pressed this point \nthroughout the conference, I am pleased that the final report treats \nFederal and State regulators with equal respect, and that it has won \nthe support of the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n  Under earlier drafts of this conference report, as in H.R. 1714 as \npassed by the House, a requirement that a record be retained could be \nmet by retaining an electronic record that accurately reflected the \ninformation set forth in the record ``after it was first generated in \nits final form as an electronic record.'' By striking that final \nphrase, we made clear that agencies, through their interpretive \nauthority, can ensure that electronic records remain accurate \nthroughout the period that they are required by law to be retained. For \nadditional certainty, we expressly authorized agencies to set \nperformance standards to assure the accuracy, integrity, and \naccessibility of records that are required to be retained and, if \nnecessary, to require retention of a record in paper form. We also \ndelayed the effective date of the Act with respect to record retention \nrequirements, to give agencies time to put in place appropriate \nregulations designed to assure effective and sustainable record \nretention, and to prevent companies from retaining materials in any \neasily alterable form that they chose until regulations are \nforthcoming. Together, these changes will avoid facilitating lax \nrecord-keeping practices that could impede the enforcement of program \nrequirements, anti-fraud statutes, environmental laws, and many other \nlaws and regulations.\n  Fourth, the conference report will avoid unintended consequences for \nlaws and regulations governing ``records'' outside its intended focus \non business-to-consumer and business-to-business transactions. I was \nseriously concerned that the sweeping legislation passed by the House \nwould allow hazardous materials transporters to provide truckers with \nthe required description of the materials via electronic mail, so that \nkey information might not be available to clean-up crews in the event \nan accident disabled the driver. Similarly, I worried that the House \nbill would allow employers to provide OSHA-required warnings on a Web \nsite rather than on a dangerous machine.\n\n  The conference report raises no such concerns. For one thing, it \nspecifically excludes from its scope any documents required to \naccompany the transportation or handling of hazardous materials, \npesticides, and other toxic or dangerous materials. For another thing, \nit expressly preserves all Federal and State requirements that \ninformation be posted, displayed or publicly affixed. In addition to \nallaying concerns about OSHA-warnings, this provision ensures that the \nbill will not inadvertently undermine Federal and State labeling \nrequirements, such as requirements that poisonous products be labeled \nwith the skull and crossbones symbol.\n  Perhaps more importantly, the scope of the legislation has been \nnarrowed. As reported by the conference committee, the bill covers \nsignatures, contracts and records relating to a ``transaction'' in or \naffecting interstate or foreign commerce, with the critical term--\n``transaction''--defined to mean ``an action or set of actions relating \nto the conduct of business, consumer, or commercial affairs between two \nor more persons.'' The conferees specifically rejected including \n``governmental'' affairs in this definition. Thus, for example, the \nbill would not cover records generated purely for governmental \npurposes, such as regular monitoring reports on air or water quality \nthat an agency may require pursuant to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water \nAct, Safe Drinking Act, or similar Federal or State environmental laws.\n  Fifth and finally, the conference report avoids the problem created \nby many earlier drafts, including the House bill, of potentially \nfacilitating unfair and deceptive practices. It does this through a \nbroad savings clause which clarifies that the bill does not limit any \nlegal requirement or prohibition other than those involving the \nwriting, signature, or paper form of a contract. Laws--including common \nlaw rules--that prohibit fraud, unfair or deceptive trade practices, or \nunconscionable contracts are not affected by this Act. A wrongdoer may \nnot argue that fraudulent conduct that complies with the technical \nrequirements of section 101(c) is beyond the reach of anti-fraud laws. \nBy the same token, a consumer is always entitled to assert that an \nelectronic signature is a forgery, was used without authority, or \notherwise is invalid for reasons that would invalidate the effect of a \nsignature in written form.\n  This legislation has come a long way in conference. It is far from \nthe reckless bill it was in danger of becoming. Still, it is far from \nperfect. As a general matter, I believe it may still be unduly \npreemptive of State regulatory and record-keeping authority. It is \nironic that the same Members who claim to be vigilant guardians of \nStates' rights are so quick to impose broad Federal mandates on the \nStates when it suits their political interests. The majority has failed \nto explain why the expansion of the Internet justifies jettisoning the \nfederalist principles that have governed our Republic for more than two \ncenturies. I have worked hard, in connection with this bill and others, \nto preserve State authority in areas traditionally reserved to the \nStates, particularly where there is no conflict between the Federal \ngoals and State jurisdiction. We should preempt State authority only \nwhen there is a demonstrated need to establish a national standard, and \neven then, only for as long as is necessary.\n\n  That being said, the conference report appropriately rejects the \nmassively preemptive approach taken by earlier versions of this \nlegislation, including the House-passed bill. As the National \nGovernors' Association observed in a letter to Congress dated March 14, \n2000, ``H.R. 1714's ambiguity with respect to preemption [was] very \ntroubling''. It authorized States to ``modify, limit, or supersede'' \nthe Federal statute by adopting the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act \n(UETA), but then rendered this authorization irrelevant by stating that \nno State law (including UETA) was effective to the extent that it was \ninconsistent with the Federal statute or technology specific.\n  By contrast, the conference report does not preempt the laws of those \nStates that adopt UETA, so long as UETA is adopted in a uniform manner. \nSuch exceptions to UETA as a State may adopt are preempted, but only to \nthe extent that they violate the principle of technological neutrality \nor are otherwise inconsistent with the Federal statute. This affords \nStates considerable flexibility; for example, a\n\n[[Page S5222]]\n\nState may enact UETA to incorporate the consumer consent procedures set \nforth in section 101(c).\n  In addition, section 104(a) of the conference report expressly \npreserves governmental filing requirements. Federal agencies are \nalready working toward full acceptance of electronic filings, pursuant \nto the schedule established by the Government Paperwork Elimination \nAct. I am confident that State agencies will follow our lead. Until \nthey are technologically equipped to do so, however, they have an \nunqualified right under section 104(a) to continue to require records \nto be filed in a tangible printed or paper form.\n  I have a number of other concerns about the conference report. In \nparticular, I am troubled that the conference report fails to provide a \nclear Federal rule--or, indeed, any rule at all--concerning how it is \nintended to affect requirements that information be sent, provided, or \notherwise delivered. The absence of a delivery provision is \nparticularly conspicuous given the fact that the prototype for this \nlegislation does include such a provision. Section 8(a) of UETA \nprovides that if a law requires information to be sent in writing to \nanother person (but does not specify a particular method of delivery), \nthe requirement is satisfied if the information is sent in an \nelectronic record that the recipient can retain. Under section 8(b), if \na law requires information to be sent by a specified method--whether by \nregular U.S. Mail, express mail, registered mail, certified mail, or \nanother method--then the information must be sent by the method \nspecified in the other law, except that parties may contract out of \nregular mail requirements to the extent permitted by the other law. \nUETA also contains a detailed rule for determining when an electronic \nrecord is sent, and when it is received.\n  The conference report touches upon the issue of delivery in section \n101(c)(2)(B), but only with respect to specified methods that require \nverification or acknowledgment of receipt, such as registered or \ncertified mail. What happens to State law requirements that a notice be \nsent by first-class mail or personal delivery? How about a law that \nrequires information to be provided, sent, or delivered in writing, but \ndoes not specify a particular method of delivery? I raised these \nquestions during the conference, but the conference report provides few \nanswers.\n\n  The conference report does provide some guidance in the case of \nStates that enact UETA. In such States, section 8(a) of UETA will \ngovern with respect to general delivery requirements, and section \n8(b)(2) of UETA will govern with respect to requirements that \ninformation be delivered by a specified method, subject to section \n102(c) of the federal legislation. Section 102(c) prevents States that \nenact UETA from circumventing the federal legislation through the \nimposition of new nonelectronic delivery methods. Thus, States enacting \nUETA may continue to prescribe specific delivery methods, so long as \nthere is an electronic alternative for any nonelectronic delivery \nmethods.\n  This leaves the question of how the Federal legislation will affect \nFederal delivery requirements and State delivery requirements in non-\nUETA States. Because our bill is silent on this question, and because \nrepeal and preemption by implication are disfavored, a court or agency \ninterpreting the legislation could reasonably conclude that these \nFederal and State delivery requirements remain in full force and \neffect. Indeed, this interpretation is practically compelled by the \nplain language of the legislative text. It does, however, have the \npotential to undermine one of our key legislative objectives--that is, \nthe elimination of unintended and unwarranted barriers to electronic \ncommerce. For this reason, it will be tempting to discern in this \nlegislation some sort of plan to permit electronic delivery of \ninformation whenever delivery is required by law, even when the law \nspecifies a particular method by which delivery must be made. Let me \nassure the courts and regulators that have occasion to read these words \nthat this legislator had no such plan.\n  Had we in fact addressed this issue in conference, my goal would have \nbeen to ensure that any specific requirement that information be sent \nor delivered not be relaxed or weakened through this Act. I believe an \nelectronic method of delivery should be at least as reliable, secure, \nand effective as the method it replaces. Thus, a law that requires \ninformation to be delivered to a person by first class mail should not \nbe satisfied simply by posting the information on a Web site; at a \nminimum, the person must also be notified of the location and \navailability of the information. Nor is information delivered, in my \nview, if it is electronically posted for an unreasonably short period \nof time, or sent electronically in a manner that inhibits the ability \nof the recipient to store or print the information.\n  Having failed to address the issue of delivery, we may be compelled \nto revisit the issue at a later date. We will, by then, have the \nbenefit of the Commerce Department's study under section 105(a) of the \nconference report, regarding the effectiveness and reliability of \nelectronic mail as compared with more traditional methods of delivery.\n  Another troubling provision in the conference report appears at the \nend of section 101, and concerns the liability of insurance agents and \ninsurance brokers. This provision appeared for the first time in a \nconference draft produced by the Republican conferees on May 15th. In \nits original incarnation, this provision gave insurance agents and \nbrokers absolute immunity from liability if something went wrong as a \nresult of the use of electronic procedures. This was not just a shield \nfrom vicarious liability, or even from negligence; rather, it was an \nabsolute shield, which would protect insurance agents and brokers from \ntheir own reckless or even wilful conduct. No matter that insurance \nagents and brokers are perfectly capable of protecting themselves \nthrough their contracts with insurance companies and their customers. \nSenator Hollings and I opposed the provision as unnecessary and \nindefensible as a matter of policy, and we succeeded in transforming it \ninto a clarification that insurance agents and brokers cannot be held \nvicariously liable for deficiencies in electronic procedures over which \nthey had no control. In this form, the provision remains in the bill as \na stark reminder of the power of special interests.\n  Section 104(d)(1) is another political compromise that blemishes this \nconference report, although I believe its actual impact will be \nnegligible. It provides that Federal agencies may exempt a specified \ncategory or type of record from the consumer consent requirements of \nsection 101(c), but only if such exemption is ``necessary'' to \neliminate a ``substantial'' burden on electronic commerce, and it will \nnot increase the material risk of harm to consumers. While Chairman \nBliley indicated in his floor statement yesterday that this test should \nnot be read as too limiting, the opposite is true. The test is, and was \nintended to be, demanding. The exemption must be ``necessary,'' and not \nmerely ``appropriate,'' as Chairman Bliley suggested. It should also be \nnoted that the conferees considered and specifically rejected language \nthat would have authorized State agencies to exempt records from the \nconsent requirements.\n  Finally, I want to discuss the concept of technology neutrality that \nis so central to this bill. This legislation is, appropriately, \ntechnology neutral. It leaves it to the parties to choose the \nauthentication technology that meets their needs. At the same time, it \nis undeniable that some authentication technologies are more secure \nthan others. Nothing in the conference report prevents or in any way \ndiscourages parties from considering issues of security when deciding \nwhich authentication technology to use for a particular application. \nIndeed, such considerations are wholly appropriate.\n  Pursuant to the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, passed by the \nprevious Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has \nadopted regulations to permit individuals to obtain, submit and sign \ngovernment forms electronically. These regulations direct Federal \nagencies to recognize that different security approaches offer varying \nlevels of assurance in an electronic environment and that deciding \nwhich to use in an application depends first upon finding a balance \nbetween the risks associated with the loss, misuse or compromise of the \ninformation,\n\n[[Page S5223]]\n\nand the benefits, costs and effort associated with deploying and \nmanaging the increasingly secure methods to mitigate those risks.\n\n  The OMB regulations recognize that among the various technical \napproaches, in an ascending level of assurance, are ``shared secrets'' \nmethods (e.g., personal identification numbers or passwords), digitized \nsignatures or biometric means of identification, such as fingerprints, \nretinal patterns and voice recognition, and cryptographic digital \nsignatures, which provide the greatest assurance. Combinations of \napproaches (e.g., digital signatures with biometrics) are also possible \nand may provide even higher levels of assurance.\n  In developing this legislation, the conference committee recognized \nthat certain technologies are more secure than others and that \nconsumers and businesses should select the technology that is most \nappropriate for their particular needs, taking into account the \nimportance of the transaction and its corresponding need for assurance.\n  Mr. President, the benefits of electronic commerce should not, and \nneed not, come at the expense of increased risk to consumers. I am \ndelighted that we have been able to come together in a bipartisan \neffort in which Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and House are \njoining in s-sign legislation that will encourage electronic commerce \nwithout sacrificing consumer protections. I want to commend Senator \nHollings, Senator Sarbanes and Representative Dingell, the ranking \nDemocrats on the other Committees participating in the House-Senate \nConference, for their leadership and steadfast efforts on behalf of our \ndual objectives. I thank Chairman Bliley and Chairman McCain for \nallowing the conference process to work and to result in a report that \nso many of us can support. I also want to praise Senator Wyden for his \ndedication to this project and for never losing sight of the need to \ncreate a balanced bill. It has been a privilege to work with all of \nthese distinguished Members on this landmark legislation.\n  I am profoundly grateful to the Administration for its work on this \nlegislation. Andy Pincus, Sarah Rosen Wartell, Michael Beresik, Gary \nGensler, and Gregory Baer, in particular, have devoted countless hours \nto ensuring that the conference report will create a reasonable and \nresponsible framework for electronic commerce.\n  I would also like to thank the Senate and House staff who worked so \nhard to bring this matter to a reasonable conclusion. On my staff, \nJulie Katzman and Beryl Howell. In addition, Maureen McLaughlin, Moses \nBoyd, Carol Grunberg, Marty Gruenberg, Jonathan Miller, Kevin Kayes, \nSteve Harris, David Cavicke, Mike O'Rielly, Paul Scolese, Ramsen \nBetfarhad, James Derderian, Bruce Gwinn, Consuela Washington, and Jeff \nDuncan--all deserve credit for their role in crafting the consensus \nlegislation that the Senate passes today. Thanks, too, to House \nLegislative Counsel Steve Cope, for his technical assistance and \nprofessionalism throughout this conference.\n  This conference report enjoys strong bipartisan and bicameral \nsupport. It passed the House of Representatives yesterday by an \noverwhelming majority. It has been well received by industry and \nconsumer representatives alike, by the States as well as by the \nAdministration. I urge its speedy passage into law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to rise this evening to \ndiscuss legislation that I am very confident we will pass tomorrow--the \nconference report to S. 761, the Electronic Signatures and Global \nNational Commerce Act. This is the culmination of nearly two years' \neffort, and I deeply appreciate all of the generous assistance on the \npart of my colleagues who helped move this bill through the legislative \nprocess.\n\n  I believe that hindsight will prove this to be one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation to emerge from the 106th Congress. This \nlegislation will eliminate the single most significant vulnerability of \nelectronic commerce, which is the fear that everything it revolves \naround--electronic signatures, contracts, and other records--could be \nrendered invalid solely by virtue of their being in ``electronic'' \nform, rather than in a tangible, ink and paper format.\n  This bill will literally supply the pavement for the e-commerce lane \nof the information superhighway. What we do today truly changes \ntomorrow, and I am certain that this legislation will prove to have a \ntremendous positive impact on electronic commerce--and on the general \nhealth of our economy--for decades to come.\n  Mr. President, thanks to the development of secure electronic \nsignatures and records, individuals, businesses, and even governments \nare increasingly able to enter transactions without ever having to \ntravel--whether the travel is a short drive across town or a thousand-\nmile flight. They are turning on a computer and opening e-mail, rather \nthan scheduling drop-offs at mailboxes or pick-ups from courier \nservices.\n  They are able to transact now, rather than ``tomorrow, before 10AM'', \nor over the next few days, depending on mail volume (and, of course, \nexcept for on Sunday). They are paying transactions costs in the \nfractions of cents, rather than in 33 cent increments. And as we move \nforth into the electronic world, ``they'' will increasingly include \neven the smallest businesses and consumers, who will find themselves \nable to take advantage of many of the technologies and efficiencies \navailable only to the largest of firms.\n  Even now, consumers are realizing the time and cost benefits of \nelectronic commerce at a rapidly escalating rate. On-line catalogs are \neverywhere, all the time, and always in competition to provide the best \nservice at the lowest price. And for the average family in America, on-\nline lending and real estate brokerage services are making the most \nsignificant of all purchases--the purchase of a family home--available \nover the Internet. Changes to home-buying over the near term will be \ndramatic. Rapid document and service delivery will reduce a transaction \ntypically measured in days or weeks to minutes or hours, and the \nability of a consumer to quickly assess the rates offered by scores of \nlenders will increase competition and lower mortgage costs and rates \nfor every consumer. Mr. President, Franklin Raines, the Chairman and \nCEO of Fannie Mae, told an investor conference in May that ``. . . the \napplication of electronic commerce to the U.S. mortgage finance \nindustry should help the U.S. homeownership rate reach 70 percent over \nthe next decade.'' Mr. President, and Chairman Raines, I look forward \nto that future.\n  But for e-commerce to continue growing, we must have a consistent, \npredictable, national framework of rules governing the use of \nelectronic signatures and records. Current legal inconsistencies are \ndeterring businesses from fully utilizing electronic signature \ntechnologies. And the ability of one court, in one jurisdiction, to \nrule against the validity of a contract solely because of its \nelectronic form threatens to destabilize the entirety of electronic \ncommerce--bringing down the whole house of cards.\n  The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law has \ndeveloped a uniform system for the use of electronic signatures. Their \nproduct, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, or UETA, is an \nexcellent piece of work and I look forward to its enactment in all \nfifty states. But as some state legislatures are not in session next \nyear, and as other states face more immediately pressing issues, it \nwill likely take three to four years for all the states to enact the \nUETA.\n  That is a long time in the high-technology sector--far too long to \npermit, when this Congress possesses the ability to bridge the gap.\n  With this in mind, Mr. President, in November of 1998--shortly after \nthe passage of the first electronic signature legislation, the \nGovernment Paperwork Elimination Act, which I also co-authored with my \nfriend, Senator Wyden--I initiated a series of discussions with both \nindustry and states for the purpose of developing a plan to foster the \ncontinued growth of electronic signatures and electronic commerce. In \nJanuary of 1999, my staff had produced draft legislation which I \ninvited Chairman Bliley to consider introducing in the House of \nRepresentatives. Over the next several months, Senator Wyden and I \nworked with Republicans and Democrats in both chambers to refine this \nlegislation. On March 25 of 1999,\n\n[[Page S5224]]\n\nSenators Wyden, McCain, Burns, Lott, and I introduced the ``Millennium \nDigital Commerce Act'' (S. 761); Representative Anna Eshoo introduced \nthe House companion later that day. My staff continued to consult with \nChairman Bliley in order to refine our substantive approach to this \nissue, and his electronic signature legislation, H.R. 1714, was \nintroduced on May 6, 1999. As I noted, S. 761 was the first electronic \nsignature bill introduced in the 106th Congress. Thanks to the gracious \nassistance of Chairman McCain, our bill received its first hearing in \nthe Senate Commerce Committee on May 27 of last year. On June 23 it was \npassed out of the Commerce Committee on a unanimous 19-0 vote. I would \nnote that the version of the bill passed out by the Committee included \nprovisions regarding both electronic signatures and electronic records.\n  During the fall of 1999, we made several attempts to pass this bill \nby unanimous consent agreement in the Senate, but unfortunately, we \nwere unable to proceed because several Members had concerns relating to \nthe inclusion of electronic records in the legislation. Given our need \nto accommodate the Senate's schedule, we made a decision to pass a \nsubstitute bill that excluded the records provisions, and the Abraham-\nWyden-Leahy substitute amendment passed the Senate unanimously on \nNovember 19, 1999.\n  At the time the Senate passed S. 761, Senator Lott and I made clear \nour intention to work for inclusion of electronic records provisions in \nthe final bill. I am pleased to say that with much effort, the bill is \nbeing passed today as conceived nearly two years ago--granting legal \ncertainty to both electronic records and signatures.\n  Mr. President, at this point I would like to speak to several of the \nkey principles of this legislation, which I believe will provide the \nlegal framework needed for the continued growth of e-commerce.\n  The general rule of this legislation ensures the legal certainty of \ne-commerce in very clear, targeted terms: ``a signature, contract, or \nother record \n. . . may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability \nsolely because it is in electronic form''.\n  Mr. President, the word ``solely'' is pivotal in this context: it \nmeans that electronic writings are not to be discriminated against, but \ninstead are to be judged according to existing principles of contract \nlaw.\n  With this language, the ``achilles heel'' of all of e-commerce is \nprotected--the ``electronic'' nature of a contract will not be used to \nattack the validity of a contract.\n  Mr. President, I view this as my single most important contribution \nto the future of electronic commerce, and would like to thank Senators \nMcCain, Wyden, Gramm, and Hatch for their counsel and support in \nwriting this section of the legislation.\n  This section of the legislation was added to ensure that no ambiguity \nexisted with respect to our treatment of existing contract law. \nAlthough we strongly believe that our General Rule is formulated in the \nleast onerous incarnation, Section 101(b) clarifies that principles of \ncontract law, which have been established over a millennium of \ncommerce, remain in effect and should continue to guide transactions \nnationwide. It is the strong belief of the conference that the decision \nwhether or not to participate in electronic commerce is completely \nvoluntary, and if the parties decide to do so, the bill grants parties \nto a transaction the freedom to determine the technologies and business \nmethods to employ in the execution of an electronic contract or other \nrecord.\n\n  Under the consent provisions, a consumer must affirmatively consent \nto the provision of records in electronic form, and there must be a \nreasonable demonstration that the consumer can access electronic \nrecords. For the immediate future, the conference envisions this \n``electronic consent'' to take the form of either a web-page based \nconsumer affirmation, or a reply to a business' electronic mailing \nwhich includes an affirmation by the consumer that he or she could open \nprovided attachments. I eagerly await future technology developments \nthat render the burdens this section imposes on consumers and \nbusinesses obsolete.\n  This provision, in combination with the simple fact that the use of \nelectronic records by a consumer and right to contract generally are \ncompletely voluntary, should ensure that no consumer will be forced by \nany business to accept any electronic document that the consumer does \nnot wish to receive.\n  It is well worth noting that the term ``consumer'' does not include \nbusiness-to-business transactions, which will allow businesses to take \nfull advantage of the efficiency opportunities presented by this \nlegislation.\n  As I have noted, the central purpose of this legislation is to \nestablish a nation-wide baseline for the legal certainty of electronic \nsignatures and records. The States themselves have recognized the need \nfor uniformity in laws governing e-commerce, and in July of last year, \nthe National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law (NCCUSL) \nreported out model legislation designed to unify state law in a market-\noriented, technology-neutral approach. I believe that the eventual \nadoption of UETA by all 50 states in a manner consistent with the \nversion reported by NCCUSL will provide the same national uniformity \nwhich is established in the Federal legislation. For that reason, and \nat my insistence, when a state adopts the ``Uniform Electronic \nTransactions Act'' (UETA) as reported by NCCUSL, the federal preemption \nprovided in this bill is superceded. In the meantime, the preemption \ncontained in the Federal Act will ensure a uniform standard of legal \ncertainty for both electronic signatures and electronic records.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address two additional points related \nto preemption. First, UETA includes a provision that permits a state to \nprescribe ``delivery methods'' for various records. I saw this as a \npotential loophole to the bill, which would allow a state to circumvent \nthe intent of the general rule and require that an electronic document \nbe delivered via physical methods--most likely ``first class'' mail. It \nshould be clear to all that the federal legislation would not permit \nsuch a delivery method requirement, and we have specified as much in \nthe preemption section. Second, I believed that the House version of \nthe preemption was unnecessarily overbroad, and went so far as to \nseriously hamper the ability of a state or local government to perform \nthose governing functions entrusted to it by the citizens. I am pleased \nthat the conference agreed with my opinion, and that the language was \nchanged in response.\n  The ``consumer protection'' provisions of this legislation specify \nthat any notice of product recalls or cancellation, or termination of \nutility services, among other items, are to be excluded from the scope \nof this legislation. This means, of course, that the validity of these \nnotices may be denied solely because they are in electronic form. I \nhope that industry does not shy away from providing these notices \nelectronically--as well as in paper--as it seems to me that electronic \n``anyplace, anytime'' notification of a product recall or utility \nshutoff would be extremely valuable. Especially to a resident of \nnorthern Michigan on business or vacation travel, whose furnace was \nsubject to recall during the dead of winter.\n  Mr. President, because of the benefits of ``anyplace, anytime'' \nnotice--and especially in light of the strong consent provisions in the \nbill--I believe consumers should be free to choose to receive any type \nrecord electronically, even those expressly precluded in this \nlegislation. I hope the appropriate regulatory agencies will utilize \nthe authority granted in this bill to allow all records, even those \nprecluded from electronic transmission by this legislation, to be sent \nelectronically.\n  The Legislation does not prevent states from establishing standards \nfor electronic transactions with their constituents. Just as the \nGovernment Paperwork Elimination Act provided the Federal government \nthe authority to set standards for electronic regulatory filing and \nreporting, so too should the States have the ability to set standards \nfor electronic submission with a State or political subdivision. And, \nlike any business, the Federal government and the States also have the \nability to establish procedures and standards for procuring goods and \nservices online.\n  The bill directs the Department of Commerce and Office of Management \nand Budget to report on Federal laws and regulations that might pose \nbarriers to e-commerce and report back to\n\n[[Page S5225]]\n\nCongress on the impact of such provisions and provide suggestions for \nreform. Such a report will serve as the basis for Congressional action, \nor inaction, in the future.\n  This was one of the final sections of the language to be modified in \nresponse to my concerns. The original proposal by the Administration to \ndeny legal validity for records required to be retained by Federal or \nState law or regulation until October 1, of 2001 was, in my opinion, \nneedlessly excessive and punitive to those consumers and businesses \nprepared to leap now into the electronic age. I maintained that Federal \nand State agencies should be provided only six months time to develop \nstandards to ensure document validity and integrity, so as to not \ninappropriately burden the private sector. Objective individuals \noutside the process with experience in developing and implementing \nregulations at the Federal and State level assured me that six months \nwas feasible. In the end, however, we effectively agreed upon an eight-\nmonth delayed implementation. And finally, language which House \nnegotiators insisted upon which would have needlessly created an uneven \nplaying field for the financial services industry was also dropped at \nmy request.\n  Since the Internet is inherently an international medium, \nconsideration must be given to the manner in which the U.S. will \nconduct business with overseas governments and businesses. This \nlegislation therefore sets forth a series of principles for the \ninternational use of electronic signatures. In the last year, U.S. \nnegotiators have been meeting with the European Commissioners to \ndiscuss electronic signatures in international commerce. In these \nnegotiations, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the State Department \nhave worked in support of an open system governing the use of \nauthentication technologies. Some European nations oppose this concept, \nhowever. For example, Germany insists that electronic transactions \ninvolving a German company must utilize a German electronic signature \napplication. I applaud the Administration for their steadfast \nopposition to that approach. This bill will bolster and strengthen the \nU.S. position in these international negotiations by establishing the \nfollowing principles as the will of the Congress:\n\n  One, paper-based obstacles to electronic transactions must be \neliminated.\n  Two, parties to an electronic transaction should choose the \nelectronic authentication technology.\n  Three, parties to a transaction should have the opportunity to prove \nin court that their authentication approach and transactions are valid.\n  Four, the international approach to electronic signatures should take \na non-discriminatory approach to electronic signature. This will allow \nthe free market--not a government--to determine the type of \nauthentication technologies used in international commerce.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that adoption of these principles will \nincrease the likelihood of an open, market-based international \nframework for electronic commerce.\n  Mr. President, two years ago I believed that if we, as a body, could \nmaintain a spirit of bipartisanship and a strong commitment to \nprinciples of free commerce, that we were poised to produce the \nlandmark accomplishment of this Congress. Well we took these \ncommitments seriously, and I believe our work product will be hailed \nfor generations to come as the grounds upon which the dream of a \nprosperous new economy became a reality--and well beyond our \nexpectations.\n  I am pleased to say that we have already begun work on the next \nlegislative effort to help this nation shift to the electronic world, \naddressing the apportionment of liability for violations of duty and \ntrust, and the protection of information and user confidentiality in \nelectronic commerce. Mr. President, I welcome the help of my colleagues \nwho have been with me in the effort to protect electronic signatures \nand records, I look forward to again working closely with the states \nand industry, and I hope to deliver to the American public \ncorresponding legislation that is as well-contemplated and effective as \nS. 761 in the next Congress.\n  Before I close, there are a number of individuals whom I would like \nto thank for their hard work, and without exception, for their \nendurance. First, I would like to recognize Chairman McCain for his \nassistance and dedication to this effort. The Chairman was one of the \noriginal cosponsors of this legislation, and lent a great deal of \nsupport well before any of the current attention was being paid to the \nissue of the legal certainty of electronic commerce. Senator McCain's \nconstant momentum eliminated many obstacles over the past 18 months and \nkept this process moving forward.\n  Without his efforts and those of Mark Buse and Maureen McLaughlin of \nthe Senate Commerce Committee staff, I certainly wouldn't be making \nthis statement today.\n  I would also like to sincerely thank my friend, Senator Phil Gramm, \nChairman of our Banking Committee, whose dedication to those important \nprinciples of economic freedom was a key ingredient in guiding our \nlegislation through the past year and a half.\n  The expertise which he and his staffers Geoff Gray and Wayne \nAbernathy brought to the table was absolutely indispensable. Senator \nGramm ensured that this legislation's propound impact on the financial \nservices industry will be a positive one.\n  I also want to acknowledge our Judiciary chairman, Senator Hatch, who \nI understand will not be participating in the final vote on this \nlegislation tomorrow due to another commitment, but he and his staff \nlikewise worked very closely with us throughout this effort.\n  The support and counsel of Senator Wyden, my partner in introducing \nthis bipartisan bill last year, has also been essential to bridging the \nconceptual differences between colleagues on both sides of the aisle. \nDespite the different approaches we occasionally endorsed, I could \nalways count on his sincere efforts to find common ground on this \nlegislation. Senator Wyden and his legislative director, Carole \nGrunberg did yeoman's work on this bill, and for that I wish to express \nmy true appreciation.\n  I also commend Senator Pat Leahy and his counsel, Julie Katzman for \ntheir contributions to this bill. Indeed, we worked hard in putting \ntogether the ingredients that made up the Senate version of this \nlegislation, the final amendment which was adopted by the Senate when \nwe passed this last year. Senator Leahy's continuing interest, \ninvolvement, and support were very important to our success.\n  I must also express my gratitude to the Senate leadership for their \npatience as well as their persistence in moving this legislation. I \ntruly appreciate the assistance of Dave Hoppe, Jack Howard, Jim \nSartucci, and Rene Bennett of the Senate Majority Leader's staff.\n  I would also like to give thanks to Massachusetts Governor Paul \nCellucci for his assistance and support through the process of drafting \nthis legislation. Massachusetts should be proud of the work done by \ntheir Governor and his staff on this bill, especially the Governor's \nSpecial Counsel for e-commerce, Daniel Greenwood, to assure that state \nand federal law governing e-commerce are complimentary.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize the efforts of three members of my \nown staff who are here tonight. My legislative assistant, Kevin \nKolevar, my Judiciary Committee Counsel, Chase Hutto, and my \nAdministrative Assistant Cesar Conda.\n  I thank them for their tireless efforts and loyalty, and recognize \nthey possess both the tremendous vision necessary to conceive of this \nlegislation back in November of 1998, and the dedication to bring it to \nthe point of final passage today.\n  I would just indicate that without these three gentleman and their \nhard work, numerous impasses that seemed to have doomed this \nlegislation would not have been surmounted. Their willingness to \ncreatively examine the problems we were confronting and come up with \nnew approaches that offered all the participants an opportunity to work \ntogether to find a common ground were absolutely indispensable to this \nsuccess. I certainly can attest to the long hours that were put in by \nthese individuals to make sure that we completed this project and that \nwe are in a position to pass this legislation.\n  As people look back on this effort, and I think they will with a \nsense that\n\n[[Page S5226]]\n\nthis was an important achievement, all three of these individuals will \nbe accorded the praise they deserve for their efforts.\n  In closing, let me urge my colleagues to support final passage of the \nconference report tomorrow morning. I believe that we are passing a \nvery important, landmark piece of legislation that will provide a \nstimulus to the new economy the likes of which we have not previously \nseen. I believe it is one of the most important steps we can take as a \nCongress to remove some of the barriers and impediments that might \nprevent us from fully enjoying the benefits of the new technologies, \nand I believe that as it becomes the law of the land, and subsequently \nas it is used as a basis for the entering into of transactions through \ne-commerce, we will look back on these achievements with great pride. I \nam happy to have been part of it. I thank all of my colleagues who made \nthis possible.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report on the Millennium Digital Commerce Act, a bill which \nI believe will help us remove one of the most imposing barriers to the \ngrowth of electronic commerce--the lack of a way to verify the validity \nof contracts entered into over the web.\n  As the Internet becomes more ubiquitous in society and the lines \nbetween paper and electronic worlds blur, it is crucial that we find \nways to adapt older regulatory structures such as contract law to the \nnew world of Internet commerce. By providing a framework for digital \nsignatures, the Millenium Digital Commerce Act will do just that, and \nI'm pleased that we're about to send it to the President's desk for \nsignature.\n  I'm particularly pleased that the conferees were able to work through \nsome of the complicated consumer protection issues on this bill. \nThroughout the conference negotiations, there were those who suggested \nthat we should use this bill to relax some of our most important \nconsumer protection laws. I appreciate the efforts of Senators Leahy, \nMcCain, Abraham and others in working to temper these efforts, and \nbelieve that the final product is much better for it.\n  While I strongly support this legislation, I regret that a prior \ncommitment will prevent me from being here tomorrow to vote in favor of \nit. In my absence, I urge each of my colleagues to support this \nlandmark agreement, which will help the Internet realize its full \npotential.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last night the other body overwhelmingly \napproved the conference report accompanying S. 761, the Electronic \nSignatures in Global and National Commerce Act, by a vote of 426-4. The \nSenate is expected to take the report up soon.\n  I support the conference report on S. 761 because paper-less \ntransactions will give our Information Age economy a boost, and allow \npersons to shop for goods and services once unavailable on the \nInternet.\n  The ability to make binding contracts online, that reach across state \nborders, will drive down transaction costs. The financial industry \nalone expects to save millions of dollars a year due to efficiencies \nderived from electronic signatures.\n  Consumers will save money and time, also. With electronic signatures \npersons will no longer need to sign certain contracts in person or \ncommunicate via mail. Now, persons will be able to enter into contracts \nand purchase items, like care loans, from the comfort of their own \nhomes. Certainly, consumers will save money with this new level of \ncompetition, and save time conducting their daily affairs.\n  As people are able to conduct more and more business transactions \nonline, I think we'll look back one day and try to remember what it was \nlike without electronic signatures.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to this bill becoming law.\n  Mr. GRAMM, Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport on S. 761, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National \nCommerce Act, also known as the E-SIGN bill. The bill establishes a \nuniform national standard for treating electronic signatures, contracts \nand disclosures are legally binding in the same way that physical \nsignatures, paper contracts and paper disclosures are legally binding. \nThe bill will allow American businesses to become more efficient and \nproductive through use of the Internet and other forms of electronic \ncommerce, rather than being forced to use paper for all binding \nagreements. Further, it will expand for consumers everywhere the \navailability of products and services as well as permit tremendous time \nsavings. With consumers no longer bound by expensive and time-absorbing \nrequirements to complete transactions through the mail or in person, \nconsumer costs will decline and choices will grow. Working from home \ncomputers, people will increasingly be able to pay bills, apply for \nmortgages, trade securities, and purchase goods and services wherever \nand whenever they choose. The reach of the consumer will extend around \nthe globe.\n  Mr. President, Senator Spencer Abraham deserves the lion's share of \nthe credit for this legislation. He began this process back in 1998, \nfathering not only the Senate bill, but subsequently generating \ninterest on the House side. He continued providing technical and \ndrafting assistance throughout the process. Without Senator Abraham's \npersistence, and his clear, constant vision of what we need to \naccomplish, there would be no bill.\n  This legislation will have a profound impact on the financial \nservices industries. ``Electronic records'' is the term in the \nlegislation that would encompass the disclosures that banks and other \nfinancial services companies must provide to consumers. Unlike the \nSenate bill, the House-passed bill included references to ``electronic \nrecords'' throughout the provisions of the bill. By including \nelectronic records along with electronic signatures, the House bill \nextended the scope of the bill to cover disclosures required under \nvarious laws and regulations.\n\n  Far more than other industries, financial services companies such as \nbanks, insurance companies and securities firms are impacted by these \ndisclosure laws. Not only these industries, but these disclosure laws \nthemselves fall under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I am \npleased that members of the Banking Committee were able to serve on the \nconference committee to ensure that these provisions were drafted in an \nappropriate and workable fashion.\n  There remain some problems with the bill, but I do not believe them \nto be overwhelming. There are those who are fearful of the electronic \nmarket place, and that fear found its expression in the debates in the \nconference committee. It found its expression in provisions in this \nbill that apply standards to electronic commerce that are not applied \nto paper commerce. That is not unusual. Every major technological \nadvance has met with fear before its full benefits were embraced. It \nmay seem odd, but not over one hundred years ago there was a very \nspirited congressional debate about whether it was safe to buy an \nautomobile for transporting the President. Voices were loudly raised in \nCongress that automobile transportation was not safe, that it was too \nrisky to let the President be transported in anything other than a \nhorse-drawn carriage. Governments passed restrictions on automobile use \nthat should silly to us today.\n  I believe that many of the fears that have been raised about \nelectronic commerce will very soon sound silly. In fact, many of them \ndo not make much sense today. That is why I am pleased that this \nlegislation will allow the regulators to remove many of these onerous \nrestrictions if the fears prove unfounded, as I expect that they will. \nAnd as I expect the fear to prove unfounded, I expect the regulators to \nact vigorously to remove unnecessary restrictions and requirements. \nElectronic commerce should labor under no greater regulatory \nrestrictions than does the quill pen, if this is to be a system for the \ntwenty-first century.\n  We will watch very closely the development of electronic commerce. If \nthis legislation proves to put an unnecessary burden on electronic \ncommerce, and if the regulators fail to act, or if legislation is \nneeded, we will then take vigorous action in the Congress to correct \nthe situation and make the purposes of this legislation a reality.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this bill includes a critical measure \nto make .08 the national drunk driving standard.\n  Chairman Shelby and I both care deeply about improving transportation\n\n[[Page S5227]]\n\nacross this country, but we also share a commitment to making sure our \ntransportation systems are as safe as possible. One of the most \nimportant things we can do to keep our families safe on our nation's \nroads is to keep drunk drivers off those roads.\n  Mr. President, the Senate already voted in favor of the .08 standard \nin 1998. The Senate overwhelming passed the Lautenberg-DeWine .08 \namendment to TEA-21 by a vote of 62-32.\n  But, ultimately, the American public did not get the safety \nlegislation that they deserved when a national .08 standard was not \nincluded in the final TEA-21 conference report that was sent to the \nPresident.\n  The TEA-21 conference report removed the Senate-passed .08 standard \nand replaced it with an incentive grant program, that, while well \nintentioned, frankly is not working. Only two states have passed .08 \nBAC since TEA-21 was enacted two years ago and it seems very unlikely \nthat any other state will be motivated by the incentive grants over the \nnext few years.\n  Mr. President, we have learned with other effective drunk driving \nlegislation such as the minimum 21 drinking age and zero tolerance that \nweak incentive programs do not work--but national standards do.\n  I would assure my colleagues that the .08 provisions in this bill \ntoday do not alter the TEA-21 incentive grant program. So if your state \nis receiving incentive grant funds, you will continue to receive every \ncent you are entitled to under the current program.\n  For over a decade--in both Republican and Democratic Administrations, \nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been telling \nCongress that the .08 standard is the best way to ensure safety on our \nroads and lower the number of fatalities which result from drunk \ndriving.\n  In fact, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) \nestimates that a national .08 standard will save approximately 500 \nlives per year.\n  Make no mistake--drivers at .08 are drunk and should not be on the \nroad. According to NHTSA, at .08, drivers are impaired in their ability \nto steer, brake, change lanes, use good judgment and focus their \nattention.\n  Their ability to perform these critical tasks may decrease by as much \nas 60 percent.\n  We must keep these drivers off the road in order to keep our families \nsafe.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues for including the .08 provisions in \nthis bill today. Now we look to the House of Representatives to follow \nour lead and work with us to produce a conference report that retains \nthis critical safety legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the passage \nof the conference report on S. 761, the electronic signatures bill. \nThis legislation was originally considered and reported by the Commerce \nCommittee. The initial purpose of the legislation was to legalize the \nuse of digital signatures for contracting electronically, mostly via \nthe internet. The States for several years had been working on adopting \na model law--the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act (UETA)--which was \nto be adopted by the States for the purpose of creating uniformity. \nThis process was to be akin to the adoption of the Uniform Commercial \nCode (UCC). However, a number of industries, most notably those in the \nhigh-tech field, felt that it could take years for all States to adopt \nthe model law. Thus, they sought Federal preemption. Bills eventually \nwere introduced in both Chambers. Senator Abraham introduced the \nlegislation in the Senate, and Congressman Bliley introduced \nlegislation in the House (H.R. 1714).\n  As noted, the Senate bill--introduced on March 25, 1999--was referred \nto and considered by the Commerce Committee. After holding a hearing on \nMay 27, 1999, the committee reported the bill on June 23, 1999. At that \ntime, we were advised that the general purpose of the bill was to \nestablish a Federal temporary and backup law, so as to ensure the \nnational use of electronic signatures until the model law was adopted \nby the States.\n  During the committee's consideration of S. 761, I indicated that I \ndid not have a problem with establishing uniformity; however, because \nthe legislation ultimately affects State contract law, I was concerned \nabout preserving the right of States to adopt their own laws, given \nthat States already were working on the adoption of a model law. In the \nfield of commercial law, the States had a similar experience with the \nUCC. Thus, I saw no reason to prevent the States from adhering to the \nsame process with respect to digital signatures. I made it clear to \nSenator Abraham that I would not support the bill--in fact, that I \nwould seek to block its passage--if the legislation did not preserve \nthe autonomy of States to adopt the model law that they were \nconsidering. I also sought to make sure States were able to adopt the \nmodel law in a manner consistent with their consumer protection laws. \nSenator Abraham and I were able to come to an agreement so as to ensure \nthat the legislation, as reported by the committee, was consistent with \nthese principles. The legislation was unanimously reported by the \ncommittee on June 23, 1999.\n  Once reported, Senator Leahy worked to procure a number of changes \ndesigned to ensure the non-applicability of the bill to certain \nagreements, including marital and landlord tenant relationships. The \nlegislation was passed by the Senate on November 19, 1999.\n  I should note that before final passage of the bill, I objected to \nits passage by unanimous consent because of the inclusion of language \nproviding that the legislation applied to the business of insurance. I \nobjected because that language was not in the Senate bill as reported \nby the Commerce Committee, but more significantly, I objected because \ninsurance companies are regulated by the States. Because the matter had \nnot been addressed by the Commerce Committee, and because insurance is \nunder the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, I wanted some \nclarification on the issue, and assurance that the issue of State \ninsurance regulation would be addressed in the legislative conference \non the bill. Senator Abraham, through a colloquy, agreed that the issue \nwould be addressed during conference discussions.\n  The House bill--H.R. 1714--was passed last November as well. It, \nhowever, was more extensive, and severe, than the Senate bill. It did \nnot provide regulatory flexibility to the States to allow them to adopt \nthe model law in conformance with their consumer protection laws; it \nincluded provisions regarding Government electronic filing and record \nkeeping--which was beyond the original purpose of the legislation; and \nprovisions specifying the manner in which consumers' consent could be \nobtained for the use of electronic signatures. Reservations and \nopposition to the bill were heard from state officials and the consumer \ncommunity.\n  These groups had a right to be concerned about the bill. The \nlegislation, pursuant to its ``consent provisions'' would have allowed \nconsumers to be easily induced into giving their consent to contract \nelectronically, even if they didn't own or have access to a computer. \nIn other words, pursuant to certain inducements by a commercial \nentity--i.e., through an offer that the consumer could get the product \ncheaper if he or she agreed to a transaction electronically--consumers \ncould have been placed in positions whereby they walked away from a \ncommercial agreement in person without any paper or documentation and \npotentially no means of accessing the actual contents of the agreement \nlater, including any additional notices or disclosures they're required \nto receive with consumer purchases. With respect to the record \nretention requirements that states impose on commercial entities, such \nas insurance companies, the legislation, would have substantially \nundermined the ability of States to ensure that businesses retained \nimportant documents, such as financial statements and records, and that \nStates retained access to those documents.\n  The conference discussions on the bill began between the Senate and \nHouse immediately after the Senate conferees were appointed in March of \nthis year. Subsequently, however, the majority staff of the Senate and \nHouse began to convene among themselves. On May 15, the majority \npresented a draft conference agreement to the Democratic Members. After \nreviewing the document, I made it clear that not only would I not \nsupport the proposal, but if offered up, I would do all I could to kill \nthe measure. I should note, however, that every other Democratic\n\n[[Page S5228]]\n\nMember of the conference--Senators Leahy, Sarbanes, Wyden, Kerry, \nInouye, and Rockefeller as well as Congressman Dingell and Congressman \nMarkey--in addition to the administration, opposed the measure. In \nlight of this opposition, the majority Members, and the high-tech \nindustry, knew they would not achieve passage of the proposal.\n  The problems with the draft include the following:\n  Similar to the House bill, it would have allowed businesses to induce \nconsumers into signing and consummating contracts electronically even \nin face to face transactions. Consequently, a person could walk away \nfrom a major agreement without any paperwork. The actual agreement \nwould have been e-mailed to the purchaser. In that situation, however, \nthe consumer would have no way of proving that the document that he or \nshe received by e-mail is the deal that he or she actually agreed to. \nMoreover, there would be no paperwork on warranties and no guarantee \nthat a person could access the documents if that person doesn't own a \ncomputer or doesn't have the proper computer software of hardware.\n\n  Additionally, the draft provided that after a consumer consented, in \nthe event a company changed the hardware or software that prevented the \nconsumer from receiving or reviewing the document, the burden would \nhave been on the consumer, not the company to purchase the correct \nhardware and software.\n  The draft also included the onerous record retention provisions of \nthe House bill.\n  After the draft was rejected by the Democratic Members, I suggested \nto my friend, Tom Bliley, the chairman of the Conference, that the only \nway a bill was going to pass this year was that it had to be an \nagreement of a bipartisan nature. Given that Congressman Bliley's bill \nwas so far different from where most Democrats were, I knew that if we \ncould come to an agreement, we could achieve a bipartisan measure. He \nagreed. I suggested that he meet with a group of Democratic Members and \nthe representatives of the administration to develop a bipartisan draft \nto present to the conference. He agreed to this recommendation as well. \nSubsequently, his staff met with Democratic staff members and \nrepresentatives of the administration and eventually constructed a \nbipartisan Conference draft. That document included major revisions of \nthe consumer consent, preemption and record retention provisions. Those \nprovisions provided significantly more protections to consumers and \nprotections of state regulatory authority.\n  When the draft was first presented to the conference, there were \nobjections. However, it led to a second bipartisan discussion between \nthe Democratic Members, along with the Administration and the two \nRepublican principals, Congressman Bliley and Senator McCain--who also \nrecognized the need for a bipartisan consensus. Through the efforts of \nSenator McCain, we eventually were able to agree on a final draft of \nthe bipartisan measure.\n  I am proud to say that the final conference report includes major \nprotections for consumers and the States. Does it include all I would \nhave liked for it to? Of course not. However, it does represent a \ncommendable effort by Republican and Democratic conferees to put forth \na law that accomplishes the original goal of establishing a legal \nframework for the new digital world, while maintaining important \nprotections for American consumers. I have joined with Senators \nSarbanes and Wyden introducing an explanatory statement of the \nlegislation, which details how the  bill affects consumers and State \ngovernments. I would, however, like to highlight a few important \nprovisions:\n\n  (1) The agreement ensures that consumers, when giving consent to do a \ntransaction electronically, before their consent can be valid, must be \ninformed of their right to receive records in paper, and of the right \nto withdraw their consent once given, and that there be some \ndemonstration that the consumer can actually access and retain the \ndocument.\n  (2) It ensures that consumers are able to withdraw consent to receive \ntheir required notices under the contract in the event the provider \nchanges the hardware or software in a manner which prevents the \nconsumer from accessing and retaining the document, without costs and \nfees.\n  (3) It preserves state unfair and deceptive trade practices laws, so \nas to ensure that the use of electronic signatures and electronic \ntransactions cannot be used to evade the requirements and prohibitions \nof these laws.\n  (4) It preserves important aspects of Federal and State record \nretention laws and requirements, and gives States some reasonable time \nto conform their regulations in light of the legislation's affirmation \nof electronic record retention by regulated industries.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend Congressman Bliley, and \nSenator McCain for their efforts to forge an agreement on the \nlegislation. I also want to commend all my Democratic colleagues and \ntheir staff, and the representatives of the administration for their \nadmirable work on this legislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to bring to \nthe floor of the Senate this conference report of S. 761, the \nElectronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, along with \nmy colleagues from the Commerce and Judiciary Committees.\n  First and foremost, the success of this effort is the result of the \nleadership of Chairman Bliley and Chairman McCain. Their commitment to \nworking in a bipartisan manner ultimately carried the day.\n  I also want to thank Senator Hollings, Senator Leahy, Senator Wyden, \nand Representative Dingell. Without the leadership exhibited by these 4 \nmembers, and the long hours, hard work, and dedication of their key \nstaff (Moses Boyd, Kevin Kayes, Julie Katzman, Carol Grunberg, Consuela \nWashington, and Bruce Gwinn) we would never have reached this \nagreement.\n  Finally, the Administration, through its representatives from the \nCommerce and Treasury Departments (Andy Pincus and Gary Gensler), as \nwell as the White House (Sarah Rosen-Wartell), played a crucial and \nconstructive role in putting together the package we have before us.\n  Mr. President, I support this bipartisan conference report. This new \nlaw creates a solid legal foundation upon which electronic commerce can \ngrow and prosper, with benefits for many consumers and businesses.\n  It is apparent to all of us that more and more business will be done \non-line in the future, and that this will be true both for business-to-\nbusiness commerce and for consumer transactions.\n  We need to be mindful, however, that while this trend will likely \ncontinue, many Americans do not today participate in the electronic \nworld. Indeed, they cannot participate in this world in any meaningful \nway.\n  To make this point, I want to share with my colleagues the findings \nof a July, 1999 Commerce Department report entitled ``Falling Through \nthe Net: Defining the Digital Divide.''\n  First, about 70 percent of Americans do not yet have access to the \ninternet;\n  Urban households with incomes of $75,000 and higher are more than \ntwenty times more likely to have access to the internet than rural \nhouseholds at the lowest income levels and they are more than nine \ntimes more likely to have a computer at home;\n  Whites are more likely to have access to the internet from home than \nBlacks or Hispanics have from any location;\n  Regardless of income level, Americans living in rural areas lag on \ninternet access. At the lowest income levels, those in urban areas are \nmore than twice as likely to have access than rural families with the \nsame income.\n  These facts are alarming. More distressing, is the fact that, as bad \nas these numbers are, the trends are moving in the wrong direction. The \nCommerce Department reports that the digital divide is actually \ngrowing.\n  For example, the gap between white and minority households has grown \n5 percentage points in just one year, from 1997 to 1998.\n  The gap, based both on education and income increased by 25 and 29 \npercent in the past year, respectively.\n  These dramatic and disturbing findings underline the importance of \nensuring that, as we move to an electronic world, we make sure that \nlongstanding consumer protections survive the transition. Many of us \nmade clear from the\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\nbeginning that our goal was to ensure equivalent consumer protections \nfor transactions conducted in the paper and electronic worlds. We have \nlargely achieved that goal.\n  First among these protections is the common sense provision \nincorporated in the report that consumer consent to engage in \nelectronic commerce be given electronically. This is a protection \nagainst unscrupulous and abusive practices as well as inadvertent \nmistakes by well meaning vendors.\n  Electronic consent will greatly enhance the consumer confidence to do \nbusiness on-line, without resulting in additional burden on \nbusinesses--they are, after all, already committed to communicating \nwith the consumer electronically.\n  The best demonstration of the importance of electronic consent is the \nfact that the initial conference draft that was provided to Conferees \nwas circulated via e-mail. Yet, despite the fact that our staff is more \ntechnologically sophisticated than the average American consumer, many \nof them were unable to download the document and had to have paper \ncopies hand delivered.\n  Now, imagine if that was a notice of change in mortgage servicing, or \na notice that health insurance benefits are being cut back, or that \nauto insurance is being cancelled. That family could very well find \nitself with a sick child on no health insurance.\n  Electronic consent would have avoided that problem by ensuring that \nthe consumer is able to read the records provided.\n  Electronic consent is not, as some people have sought to portray it, \nrelevant only for a transitional period. Compatibility among systems is \nalways important to check, given the significance of the records being \ntransmitted. In addition, the U.S. mail is free to receive and comes to \nyour door. You do not need a computer to receive the mail. You do not \nneed to pay for an internet service provider, and you do not need to go \nto a public library to fain access to a computer if you don't have one \nat home. For all these reasons, electronic consent will be as important \nin the future as it is today.\n  Other concerns I had have also been addressed in this report.\n  We have provided both federal and state agencies with the authority \nto interpret and issue guidance on the proposed law. Providing this \ninterpretive authority will provide businesses with a cost-effective \nway of getting guidance in how to implement the new law. Without this \nauthority, these questions would have to have been answered by the \ncourts, after extensive and expensive litigation. We have avoided that \nproblem.\n  the conference report gives law enforcement agencies of federal and \nstate governments the authority they need to detect and combat fraud, \nincluding the ability to require the retention of written records in \npaper form if there is a compelling governmental interest in law \nenforcement.\n  Let me raise one specific example, among many, of where this \nprovision ought to be exercised. The Securities and Exchange Commission \nshould use this provision to require brokers to keep written records of \nagreements required to be obtained by the SEC's penny stock rules. \nInvestors in the securities markets have been the victims of penny \nstock abuse for more than a decade. The SEC must exercise every tool at \nits disposal to fight this kind of fraud.\n  Finally, we narrowed the scope of the legislation to ensure that \ncertain notices that simply cannot effectively be made electronically, \nsuch as documents carried by vehicles hauling hazardous materials, will \ncontinue to be in paper form.\n  As many of you know, it was not at all clear that we were going to be \nable to deliver this bipartisan, largely consensus product to the \nfloor. There were many times when negotiations threatened to unravel.\n  But we stuck to it; we continued to show a willingness to consider \nand reconsider many issues that came up, even after agreement on many \nof those issues was achieved. Eventually, we were able to close the few \nremaining gaps and come to a final compromise.\n  Mr. President, these changes make this a good piece of legislation \nworthy of our support. I urge all my colleagues to do so, and, once \nagain, commend the leaders who brought this effort to a successful \nconclusion.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to insert for the Record some more \nspecific observations on a number of provisions of the legislation on \nbehalf of Senator Hollings, Senator, Wyden, and myself. I think this \nwill be helpful given the fact that no statement of managers was \nincluded with the final legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement of Senators Hollings, Wyden, and Sarbanes Regarding the \n       Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act\n\n       We want to make a number of points about some of the \n     important provisions in the Act we are passing today.\n       1. Scope of Requirement. Section 101 (a). In recommending \n     that the Senate vote to pass this legislation, we would like \n     to clarify for members the kind of transactions that are \n     covered by the bill. You will note that the definition of \n     ``transaction'' includes business, commercial, or consumer \n     affairs. The Conferees specifically rejected including \n     ``governmental'' transactions. Members should understand that \n     this bill will not in any way affect most governmental \n     transactions, such as law enforcement actions, court actions, \n     issuance of government grants, applications for or \n     disbursement of government benefits, or other activities that \n     government conducts that private actors would not conduct. \n     Even though some aspects of such Governmental transactions \n     (for example, the Government's issuance of a check reflecting \n     a Government benefit) are commercial in nature, they are not \n     covered by this bill because they are part of a uniquely \n     Governmental operation. Likewise, activities conducted by \n     private parties principally for governmental purposes are not \n     covered by this bill. Thus, for example, the act of \n     collecting signatures to place a nomination on a ballot would \n     not be covered, even though it might have some nexus with \n     commerce (such as the signature collectors' contract of \n     employment).\n       General Rule of Validity. Section 101(a)(1) and (2). The \n     Conferees added the word ``solely'' in both sections \n     101(a)(1) and (2) to ensure that electronic contracts and \n     signatures are not inadvertently immunized by this Act from \n     challenge on grounds other than the absence of a physical \n     writing or signature. Companies and consumers should only be \n     able to agree to reasonable electronic signature \n     technologies. As the definition of the electronic signature \n     makes clear, the electronic signature is only valid under \n     this Act if the person intended to sign the contract. A \n     person accepting an electronic signature should have a duty \n     of care to determine if the signature really was created by \n     the person to whom it is attributed.\n       Preservation of Rights and Obligations. Section 101(b)(1). \n     The Conferees added a new Section 101(b)(1) which provides \n     that this Title I does not ``limit, alter, or otherwise \n     affect any requirement imposed by a statute, regulation, or \n     rule of law relating to the rights and obligations of persons \n     under such statute, regulation, or rule of law other than a \n     requirement that contracts or other records be written, \n     signed, or in nonelectronic form.'' This savings clause makes \n     clear that existing legal requirements that do not involve \n     the writing, signature, or paper form of a contract or other \n     record are not affected by Title I. As a result, laws or \n     regulations or common law rules that prohibit fraud or unfair \n     trade or deceptive practices or unconscionable contracts are \n     not affected by this Act. The use of the word ``solely'' \n     throughout section 101(a) is intended to ensure a contract, \n     notice or disclosure which is provided electronically gains \n     no additional validity or sanctity against challenge just \n     because it is in electronic form. The validity of a consent \n     obtained as the result of an unfair or deceptive practice can \n     be challenged and found to be invalid, in which case any \n     records which were provided electronically will be deemed to \n     not have been provided to the consumer. Thus, for example, a \n     transaction into which a consumer enters electronically is \n     still subject to scrutiny under applicable state and Federal \n     laws that prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices. \n     So, if a consumer were deceived or unfairly convinced in some \n     way to enter into the electronic transaction, state and \n     Federal unfair and deceptive practices laws might still apply \n     even though the consumer was properly notified of their \n     rights under Section 101(c) and consented to the electronic \n     notices and contract was properly obtained. In other words, \n     compliance with the Act's consumer consent requirements does \n     not make it unnecessary for the transaction and parties to \n     the transaction to comply with other applicable statutes, \n     regulations or rules of law. The basic rules of good faith \n     and fair dealing apply to electronic commerce.\n       Preservation of Rights and Obligations. Section 101(b)(2). \n     The Act specifically avoids forcing any contracting party--\n     whether the Government or a private party--to use or accept \n     electronic records and electronic signatures in their \n     contracts. Thus, for example, where the Government makes a \n     direct loan, the bill would not require the use or acceptance \n     of electronic records or signatures in the loan transaction, \n     because the Government would be a party to the loan contract. \n     The Conferees recognized that, in some instances, parties to \n     a contract might have\n\n[[Page S5230]]\n\n     valid reasons for choosing not to use electronic signatures \n     and records, and it is best to allow contracting parties the \n     freedom to make that decision for themselves.\n       Protections Against Waste, Fraud and Abuse. Sections \n     101(b)(2), 102(b) and 104(b)(4). Members should note that \n     several provisions of the Conference report are designed to \n     address concern about protecting taxpayers from waste, fraud \n     and abuse in connection with government contracting or other \n     instances in which the government is a market participant. \n     For example, Sections 101(b)(2), 102(b) and 104(b)(4) and \n     others give agencies significant latitude to accept, reject, \n     or place conditions on the use of electronic signatures and \n     records when the government is acting like a market \n     participant.\n       Consent to Electronic Records. Section 101(c)(1). The House \n     bill included an amendment that required that consumers \n     affirmatively consent before they can receive records \n     (included required notices and disclosures and statements) \n     electronically that are legally required to be provided or \n     made available in writing. Special rules apply to electronic \n     transactions entered into by consumers. It is the Congress' \n     intent that the broadest possible interpretation should be \n     applied to the concept of ``consumer.'' The definition in \n     Section 106(1) is intended to include persons obtaining \n     credit and insurance, even salaries and pensions--because all \n     of these are ``products or services which are used primarily \n     for personal, family or household purposes'' as the word is \n     defined in the Act. Amongst the other changes to this section \n     made in Conference, the Conferees added an important new \n     element: Section 101(c)(1)(C) of the Conference Report \n     requires that the consumer ``consents electronically, or \n     confirms his or her consent electronically, in a manner that \n     reasonably demonstrates that the consumer can access \n     information in the electronic form that will be used to \n     provide the information that is the subject of the consent.'' \n     The purpose of this provision is to ensure that, when \n     consumers agree to receive notices electronically, that they \n     can actually open, read, and retain the records that they \n     will be sent electronically. The Act requires that consumers \n     consent electronically--or confirm their consent \n     electronically--in either case, in a manner that allows the \n     consumer to test his capacity to access and retain the \n     electronic records that will be provided to him. The \n     consumer's consent to receive electronic records is not valid \n     unless it is confirmed electronically in a manner meeting the \n     specific requirements of Section 101(c)(1)(C)(ii).\n       Today, many different technologies can be used to deliver \n     information--each with its own hardware and software \n     requirements. An individual may not know whether the hardware \n     and software on his or her computer will allow a particular \n     technology to operate. (All of us have had the experience of \n     being unable to open an e-mail attachment.) Most individuals \n     lack the technological sophistication to know the exact \n     technical specifications of their computer equipment and \n     software. It is appropriate to require companies to establish \n     an ``electronic connection'' with their customers in order to \n     provide assurance that the consumer will be able to access \n     the information in the electronic form in which it will be \n     sent. This one-time ``electronic check'' can be as simple as \n     an e-mail to the customer asking the customer to confirm that \n     he or she was able to open the attachment (if the company \n     plans to send notices to the customer via e-mail attachments) \n     and a reply from the customer confirming that he or she was \n     able to open the attachment. This responsibility is not \n     unduly burdensome to e-commerce. As a matter of good customer \n     relations, any legitimate company would want to do confirm \n     that it has a working communications link with its customers.\n       Preservation of Consumer Protections. Section 101(c)(2)(A). \n     The Conferees preserved an important provision from the House \n     bill which provides that: ``nothing in this title affects the \n     content or timing of any disclosure or other record required \n     to be provided or made available to any consumer under any \n     statute, regulation, or other rule of law.'' State and \n     federal law requirements on delivering documents have not \n     been addressed in this Act. The underlying rules on these \n     issues still prevail. It is our view that records provided \n     electronically to consumers must be provided in a manner that \n     has the same expectation for the consumer's actual receipt as \n     was contemplated when the state law requirement for \n     ``provided'' was passed. So, for example, if a statute \n     requires that a disclosure be provided within 24 hours of a \n     certain event and that the disclosure include specific \n     language set forth clearly and conspicuously. That \n     requirement could be met by an electronic disclosure if \n     provided within 24 hours of that event, which disclosure \n     included the specific language, set forth clearly and \n     conspicuously. However, simply providing a notice \n     electronically does not obviate the need to satisfy the \n     underlying statute's requirements for timing and content.\n       Section 101(c)(3) is a narrow saving clause to preserve the \n     integrity of electronic contracts: just because the \n     consumer's consent to electronic notices and records was not \n     obtained properly does not mean that the underlying contract \n     itself is invalid. This provision only affects electronic \n     records, it simply means that an electronic consent which \n     fails to meet the requirements of section 101(c) does not \n     create a new basis for invalidating the electronic contract \n     itself.\n       Retention of Contracts and Records. Section 101(d)(1) and \n     Section 104(b)(3). The Conferees added provisions that state: \n     ``if a statute, regulation, and other rule requires that a \n     contract or other record relating to a transaction . . . be \n     retained,'' the requirement is met by retaining an electronic \n     record of the information that ``accurately reflects the \n     information'' and ``remains accessible'' to all who are \n     entitled to it ``in a form that is capable of being \n     accurately reproduced for later reference. . . .'' Moreover, \n     Federal or State regulatory agencies may interpret this \n     requirement to specify performance standards to ``assure \n     accuracy, record integrity, and accessibility of records that \n     are required to be retained.'' Moreover, these performance \n     standards can be specified in a manner that does not conform \n     to the technology neutrality provisions, provided that the \n     requirement serves, and is substantially related to the \n     achievement of, an important governmental objective. These \n     record retention provisions are essential to the capacity of \n     Federal and State regulatory and law enforcement agencies to \n     ensure compliance with laws. For example, the only way in \n     which a government agency can determine if participants in \n     large government programs are complying with financial and \n     other requirements of those programs may be to require that \n     records be retained in a form that can be readily accessible \n     to government auditors. Similarly, agencies must be able to \n     require that companies implement anti-tampering protections \n     to ensure that electronic records cannot be altered easily by \n     money launderers or embezzlers or others seeking to hide \n     their illegal activity. Without the ability of these agencies \n     to ascertain program compliance through electronic record \n     retention, taxpayers could be exposed to far greater risk of \n     fraud and abuse. Similarly, bank and other financial \n     regulators need to require that records be retained in order \n     that their examiners can insure the safety and soundness of \n     the institutions and their compliance with all relevant \n     regulatory requirements.\n       Accuracy and Ability to Retain Contracts and Other Records, \n     101(e). The Conferees added new language in section (e) of \n     101 to establish that a contract or record which is required \n     under other law to be in writing loses its legal validity \n     unless it is provided electronically to each party in a \n     manner which allows each party to retain and use it at a \n     later time to prove the terms of the record.\n       Exemptions to Preemption. Section 102(a) allows a state to \n     ``modify, limit or supersede section 101'' in one of two \n     ways: (1) by passing the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act \n     (``UETA'') as approved and recommended for enactment by the \n     National Conferences of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws \n     in 1999, or (2) by passing another law which specifies the \n     requirements for use or acceptance of electronic records and \n     electronic signatures which is consistent with this Act. \n     These choices for states are not mutually exclusive. Of \n     course, the rules for consumer consent and accuracy and \n     retainability of electronic records under this Act shall \n     apply in all states that pass the Uniform Electronic \n     Transaction Act or another law on electronic records and \n     signatures in the future, unless the state affirmatively \n     and expressly displaces the requirements of federal law on \n     these points. A state which passed UETA before the passage \n     of this Act could not have intended to displace these \n     federal law requirements. These states would have to pass \n     another law to supercede or displace the requirements of \n     section 101. In a state which enacts UETA after passage of \n     this Act, without expressly limiting the consent, \n     integrity and retainability subsections of 101, those \n     requirements of this Act would remain in effect. The \n     general provisions of UETA, such as the requirement for \n     agreement to receive electronic records in UETA are not \n     inconsistent with and do not displace the more specific \n     requirements of section 101, such as the requirement for a \n     consumer's consent and disclosure in section 101(c).\n       It is important to note that Section 103(b) lists certain \n     notices which are exempted from the coverage of section 101 \n     (such as notices of cancellation of utility service or \n     insurance coverage). The legal result is that section 101 \n     simply does not apply to the notices listed in section 103. \n     Under section 102(a) a state only has the authority to \n     modify, limit or supercede the coverage of section 101. We \n     specifically intend that a state may not use its authority \n     under section 102, to authorize solely electronic records of \n     those notices listed in section 103.\n       Prevention of Circumvention. Section \n     102. Section 8(b)(2) of UETA allows \n     States to impose delivery requirements for electronic \n     records. Section 102(c) has the limited purpose of ensuring \n     that the state does not circumvent Titles I or II of this Act \n     by imposing nonelectronic delivery methods. Thus, provided \n     that the delivery methods required are electronic and do not \n     require that notices and records be delivered in paper form, \n     States retain their authority under Section 8(b)(2) of UETA \n     to establish delivery requirements.\n       We believe that Title II of this Act separately addresses \n     transferable records by establishing rules for creating, \n     retaining and providing these records electronically. This \n     Act places no limitation on a state's right to add consumer \n     protections to transferable records.\n       Preservation of Existing Rulemaking Authority. Section \n     104(b). This Act will affect requirements that are imposed by \n     Federal and State statutes, regulations, and rules of law. No \n     one agency that is charged with interpreting its provisions; \n     instead, under Section\n\n[[Page S5231]]\n\n     104(b), regulatory agencies that have authority to interpret \n     other statutes may interpret Section 101 with respect to \n     those statutes to the extent of their existing interpretative \n     authority. This provision provides important protection to \n     both affected industry and consumers. It is impossible to \n     envision all of the ways in which this Act will affect \n     existing statutory requirements. This interpretative \n     authority will allow regulatory agencies to provide legal \n     certainty about interpretations to affected parties. \n     Moreover, this authority will allow regulatory agencies to \n     take steps to address abusive electronic practices that might \n     arise that are inconsistent with the goals of their \n     underlying statutes. For example, if a broker were to deceive \n     a person into pledging equity in their home for a loan based \n     on false representations about the loans terms and \n     conditions, the broker's action could be challenged under any \n     applicable statute that prohibited such deception and false \n     representations, even if the consumer executed the loan \n     documents electronically and consented to the use of the \n     electronic contract and records in compliance with the terms \n     of this Act. Without this authority, predators might argue \n     that this Act somehow immunizes the abusive practice, \n     notwithstanding the underlying statutory requirement, and \n     consumers and competitors would have to wait for resolution \n     of the issue through litigation.\n       I would also like to clarify the nature of the \n     responsibility of government agencies in interpreting this \n     bill. As the bill makes clear, each agency will be proceeding \n     under its preexisting rulemaking authority, so that \n     regulations or guidance interpreting section 101 will be \n     entitled to the same deference that the agency's \n     interpretations would usually receive. This is underlined by \n     the bill's requirements that regulations be consistent with \n     section 101, and not add to the requirements of that section, \n     which restate the usual Chevron test that applies to and \n     limits an agency's interpretation of a law it administers. \n     Giving each agency authority to apply section 101 to the laws \n     it administers will ensure that this bill will be read \n     flexibly, in accordance with the needs of each separate \n     statute to which it applies.\n       Any reading under which courts would apply an unusual test \n     in reviewing an agency's regulations would generate a great \n     deal of litigation, creating instability and needlessly \n     burdening the courts with technical determinations. Likewise, \n     because these regulations will be issued under preexisting \n     legal authority, and challenges to those regulations will \n     proceed through the methods prescribed under that preexisting \n     authority, whether pursuant to the Administrative Procedure \n     Act or some other statute. Again, this will ensure that any \n     challenges to such regulations are resolved promptly and \n     minimize any resulting instability and burden. Of course, \n     such regulations must satisfy the requirements of the Act.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been more than a year now since the \nColumbine tragedy, and still regrettably our friends on the other side \nof the aisle refuse to act on commonsense, sensible gun legislation. I \nunderstand the divisions in the Senate and in the country on the issue \nof guns. I am certainly not unmindful of the truth to some people's \nassertions regarding the degree to which personal responsibility enters \ninto the actions of anybody with respect to guns.\n  Obviously, we need to create greater accountability on a personal \nlevel with respect to those actions. But common sense tells every \nsingle American that there are also basic things we can do to make this \ncountry safer for our children, things we can do to keep guns out of \nthe hands of our children, things we can do to make our schools safer, \nways in which guns themselves can become safer. I am deeply troubled by \nthe numbers of people, particularly the number of children who have \nbeen wounded or killed by gunfire since Columbine, and who are killed \nand wounded by gunfire each year in this country.\n  All we are asking is that the juvenile justice conference meet, that \nthe Senate do its business, that they finish the business, issue their \nreport, and that the Congress have the courage and the willingness to \nvote on the conference report.\n  Until we do act, many of us on this side of the aisle--I would say \nthe Democratic caucus--is prepared to read the names of those who have \nlost their lives to gun violence over the past year. We will continue \nto do so every single day that the Senate is in session.\n  The following are the names of people who were killed by gunfire, 1 \nyear ago today:\n  Latonia Davis, 21, Charlotte, NC; Jacob B. Dodge, 24, Madison, WI; \nElvin R. Dugan, 33, Oklahoma City, OK; Marcus E. Gray, 39, Chicago, IL; \nDante Green, 26, Washington, DC; Dwayne Pate, 32, Washington, DC; \nCharles Vullo, 42, Houston, TX; Brandon Williams, 3, Hollywood, FL; \nLennox Williams, 49, Hollywood, FL; Mae William, 44, Hollywood, FL; \nUnidentified male, 63, Portland, OR.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in releasing the juvenile justice bill \nfrom its prison and empowering the Senate to do its job and to pass the \njuvenile justice bill, which will make this country safer for our \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/15/senate-section/article/S5231-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5231-S5236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ADD-ONS, INCREASES, AND EARMARKS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, the Department of Defense authorization \nbill that we will resume on Monday contains a ``buried gem.'' This is \nan amendment that several Senators from both sides of the aisle have \nbeen working on for some time. In addition, many members in the other \nbody also have been very supportive of this effort in general.\n\n[[Page S5237]]\n\n  This ``buried gem'' is a provision that will allow military personnel \nand dependents stationed overseas to participate in a program very \nsimilar to the WIC--the Women, Infants and Children--nutrition program. \nThe WIC program in this country has enjoyed full, bipartisan support \nfor many years, and this new provision provides that our forces abroad \nwill be entitled to benefit from a very similar program with \neligibility calculated under very similar rules.\n  The chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \nCommittee, Senator Lugar, and the ranking member, Senator Harkin, along \nwith the chairman of the nutrition subcommittee, Senator Fitzgerald, \nworked together with me and other members of the Committee on this WIC \nin the military issue. We received valuable input on this recent \namendment from the DOD and the military liaison offices, as well as \nfrom the Department of Agriculture. We are grateful for that \nassistance.\n  I know that many of us worked together last year on this issue also. \nLast year, I introduced the bill, Strengthening Families in the \nMilitary Service Act of 1999 (S. 1162), which was designed to provide \nWIC benefits to military personnel and to certain civilian personnel, \nstationed overseas.\n  In my floor statement on May 26 of last year, I noted that ``if it \nmakes sense to allow those stationed in the United States to \nparticipate in WIC, it makes sense to allow those stationed overseas to \nhave the important nutritional benefits of that program. Why should \nfamilies lose their benefits when they are moved overseas?''\n  A former staff person, Janet Breslin, who worked for me as Deputy \nChief of Staff of the Senate Agriculture Committee and now is stationed \nin Japan with her husband, sent me a note saying:\n\n       WIC can make all the difference to an at-risk baby or \n     pregnant mother. There is a specific need here in Okinawa. \n     Our young families make the long trip to Japan to represent \n     their country. They are separated from family and friends \n     back home. Because we have limited base housing, some are \n     forced to live off-base for months or a year. During this \n     time the family faces the high cost of living in Japan, \n     especially high utility fees and food costs. For many, huge \n     phone bills home put many families in a financial pinch.\n       If these at-risk families were in the United States, they \n     would qualify for WIC, which would provide nutritious dairy \n     and other food products for the family. However, due to a \n     legal quirk, WIC is not available for Americans on overseas \n     military bases.\n       This effort, by you and others, would help reduce the \n     pressure on these young families, improve the health of \n     mother and baby, and enhance the quality of life for \n     Americans serving their country halfway around the world.\n\n  Janet perfectly summarized why we should provide WIC to our military \npersonnel overseas.\n  My bill, and the amendment included in the DOD bill, provide that the \nSecretary of Defense will administer such a program under rules similar \nto the WIC program administered by the Secretary of Agriculture within \nthe United States.\n  For 26 years the WIC program has provided nutritious foods to low-\nincome pregnant, post-partum and breast-feeding women, infants, and \nchildren who are judged to be at a nutritional risk.\n  It has proven itself to be a great investment: For every dollar \ninvested in the WIC program, an estimated $3 is saved in future medical \nexpenses. WIC has helped to prevent low birth weight babies and \nassociated risks such as developmental disabilities, birth defects, and \nother complications. Participation in the WIC program has also been \nlinked to reductions in infant mortality.\n  These same benefits should be provided overseas to military families \nwho are serving our country, living miles from their homes on military \nbases in foreign lands, and whose nutritional health is at risk. If \nthey were stationed within our borders, their diets would be \nsupplemented by the WIC program, and they would receive vouchers or \npackages of healthy foods, such as fortified cereals and juices, high \nprotein products, and other foods especially rich in needed minerals \nand vitamins.\n  My staff has been in direct contact with military officials on this \nmatter and they have expressed a strong desire for this reform. I know \nthat many Vermonters stationed overseas want WIC benefits to be offered \nat their bases. We should not turn our backs on these Americans \nstationed abroad.\n  My bill last year, and this amendment, disregard the value of in-kind \nhousing assistance in calculating eligibility which increases the \nnumber of women, infants and children that can participate and makes \nthe program similar to the program in the United States. This is the \ncorrect approach--let's not shortchange our service personnel stationed \noverseas.\n  The average monthly food cost would be around $30 to $35 for each \nparticipant, based on Department of Defense estimates of the cost of an \naverage WIC food package in military commissaries. As many as 40,000 to \n50,000 persons could be eligible for this program, but it is uncertain \nhow many of those would apply. In the United States, 80 percent of \nthose who are eligible actually apply.\n  Administration costs--which include medical, health and nutrition \nassessments--are likely to be about $10 per month per participant. We \nknow from experience that each dollar spent on WIC is a very wise \ninvestment, which is why I am very pleased that this amendment was \naccepted today.\n  I want to thank several Senate staff members who have worked on this \nissue, including Ed Barron and Elizabeth Darrow on my staff, Dave \nJohnson and Carol Dubard with Chairman Lugar, Mark Halverson and Lowell \nUnger with Senator Harkin, and Terry Van Doren with Senator Fitzgerald. \nJoe Richardson of CRS was also very helpful, as he has been over the \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/15/senate-section/article/S5237-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary Vermonter, John James Daley, who passed away last night \nat the age of 76. Mr. Daley leaves behind a devoted wife, a loving \nfamily and a grieving community which will miss his leadership and \nexample.\n  Jack, as he was known, was born in my hometown of Rutland, Vermont on \nJune 21, 1923 to John M. and Bridget C. Daley. He attended Norwich \nUniversity and proudly served as a member of the United States Marine \nCorps in the Phillippines and other parts of Asia. He found his niche \nas a public servant in 1956 when he was elected to the Rutland Board of \nAldermen. From there he served as mayor for two years from 1961 to \n1965, becoming the youngest man ever to have held the position.\n  In November of 1965 Jack was elected Lieutenant Governor of Vermont \nand served two terms with Governor Phil Hoff. Jack continued his career \nas a role model and advisor when he joined the Rutland Public School \nsystem as a teacher for many years. Through his lectures and by acting \nas a role model, he enriched the minds of our Vermont youth as he \ntaught history, citizenship and American government. In 1981\n\n[[Page S5238]]\n\nJack returned to the office of mayor and from there continued his \nlegacy as he was reelected in 1983 and 1985. He continued to represent \nthe interests of his hometown as he sought and served two terms in the \nVermont House representing Rutland District 6-2.\n  Jack was a devoted family man. More than fifty years ago he married \nanother Rutland native, Mary Margaret Creed. Together they became the \nproud parents of eleven children, nine girls and two boys. Mary's \neverlasting energy allowed her not only to raise their own eleven \nchildren but tirelessly work as a nurse in the nursery at the Rutland \nHospital helping to care for the children of others. Ceaseless in her \ndedication, she continues to help out when needed despite her \nretirement.\n  Today, I pay tribute to the accomplishments of this public servant, \nfather, husband and my friend, John James Daley. Today, Rutland and the \nentire state of Vermont grieve for a great man. Farewell, Jack. You \nwill be truly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/15/senate-section/article/S5238-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NATIONAL SERVICE--LEARNING LEADER SCHOOL AWARD WINNERS\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Corporation for National \nService recently announced the winners of the second annual National \nService--Learning Leader Schools Program, a Presidential Award that \nrecognizes schools for excellence in service-learning.\n  Learn and Serve America, one of the three national service programs \nof the Corporation for National Service, is sponsoring the Leader \nSchools initiative. In its second year, the Leader Schools program is \nhonoring 34 middle schools and 32 high schools in 31 states for \nthoughtfully and effectively combining academic subjects with community \nservice in a way that benefits students, teaches civic responsibility, \nand strengthens communities.\n  Service-learning is expanding in the United States. The Department of \nEducation found that in 1984, only 27 percent of all high schools had \nschool-sponsored community service projects and only 9 percent offered \nservice-learning. By the 1998-99 school year, those numbers rose to a \nremarkable 83 percent and 46 percent, respectively.\n  Three schools in Massachusetts--Wareham High School and Wareham \nMiddle School in Wareham and Tantasqua Regional Junior High School in \nFiskdale have been leaders in our state on service-learning and were \nhonored as National Service Learning Leader Schools this year. I \ncommend each of these schools for the important work they have \naccomplished in making community service an integral part of school \nlife. These schools are impressive models for Massachusetts and for the \nnation.\n  The Leader Schools program is not simply an awards program. The \nschools being honored are making a two year commitment to assist other \nschools through mentoring and coaching, thereby contributing to the \nspread of service-learning throughout the country.\n  The Corporation for National Service also administers AmeriCorps, the \ndomestic Peace Corps that is engaging Americans in extensive, service \nactivities in this country. In addition, the Corporation administers \nthe National Senior Service Corps which enables nearly half a million \nAmericans age fifty-five and older to share their time and talents to \nhelp solve local problems.\n  All of these outstanding programs are achieving great success under \nthe strong leadership of our former colleague in the Senate, Harris \nWofford, the chief executive officer of the Corporation.\n  The sixty-six Leader Schools will be honored in a ceremony at the \nKennedy Center this week. These schools are true leaders in education \nreform. I commend them for their academic achievements and their \ncontributions to our country through community service, and I ask the \nlist of the Leader Schools may be printed in the Record.\n\n             2000 National Service--Learning Leader Schools\n\n       Academy for Science and Foreign Language, Huntsville, AL; \n     Eureka Senior High School, Eureka, CA; Irvington High School, \n     Fremont, CA; Howard High School of Technology, Wilmington, \n     DE; Wakulla Middle School, Crawfordville, FL; Neptune Middle \n     School, Kissimmee, FL; Bay High School, Panama City, FL; \n     Taylor County High School, Perry, FL; Carol Shores High \n     School, Tavernier, FL; Waiakea High School, Hilo, HI; Punahou \n     School, Honolulu, HI; President George Washington Middle \n     School, Honolulu, HI; Bettendorf High School, Bettendorf, IA; \n     Resurrection High School, Chicago, IL; Field Middle School, \n     Northbrook, IL, Paoli Senior High School, Paoli, IN; Warren \n     Central High School, Bowling Green, KY; North Laurel Middle \n     School, London, KY; East Jessamine Middle School, \n     Nicholasville, KY; Tantasqua Regional Jr. High School, \n     Fiskdale, MA; Wareham High School, Wareham, MA; Wareham \n     Middle School, Wareham, MA;\n       Phillips Middle School, Phillips, ME; Lahser High School, \n     Bloomfield Hills, MI; Romulus High School, Romulus, MI; \n     Fulton Academy, Fulton, MO; Tupelo Middle School, Tupelo, MS; \n     Chief Joseph Middle School, Bozeman, MT; Lewistown Junior \n     High School, Lewistown, MT; Ramsey Street Alternative Middle \n     School, Fayetteville, NC; Ferndale Middle School, Highpoint, \n     NC; Piedmont High School, Monroe, NC; Woodbury Middle School, \n     Salem, NH; Woodsville High School, Woodsville, NH; Cranford \n     High School, Cranford, NJ; Academy of the Holy Angels, \n     Demarest, NJ; Terence C.

Mr. President, July 26 will mark the 10th \nAnniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In the next few \nweeks we'll be holding a number of events here in Washington and around \nthe country to celebrate the ADA. And right now it looks like we can \nstart our party a little early.\n  I just found out that yesterday, Susan Sygall, a woman with a \ndisability, received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship. Each year, the \nMacArthur Foundation awards 20 or so unrestricted $500,000 grants to, \nand I quote, ``talented individuals who have shown extraordinary \noriginality and dedication. . . .'' These so-called ``genius grants'' \nare among the most prestigious in the world.\n  Susan is the Executive Director of Mobility International USA. \nMobility International's mission is to empower people with \ndisabilities, particularly women, through international exchange, and \nby providing information, technical assistance, and training to ensure \nthe inclusion of people with disabilities in international exchange and \ndevelopment programs.\n  Right now, Mobility International is, among other things, \nfacilitating a program to develop relationships between the disability \ncommunities in Vietnam and in the United States. Some of Susan's genius \nmust have rubbed off on us in the Foreign Operations Committee because \nwe encouraged USAID to fund disability rights programs in Vietnam. I \nhope that we can help the program again this year.\n  I strongly believe that for all of America's economic and military \nmight, our greatest strength will always be our democratic principles. \nThose principles have served as the foundation for aspiring democracies \neverywhere. As our own democracy matures, and the ADA is a testament to \nthat, it is essential that we export the lessons we have learned.\n  I have seen personally how the ADA has fostered disability rights \nactivism around the world and as the 10th Anniversary approaches I can \nthink of no better person to honor than Susan Sygall. A civil rights \nlaw is only as great as the people who bring it to life every day. \nThat's why when I hear about people like Susan, I know that the ADA's \nfuture is in good hands.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/15/senate-section/article/S5239-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5239]]\nCOMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF SEYMOUR, CONNECTICUT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to the \ntown of Seymour, nestled in the Lower Naugatuck Valley of Connecticut. \nLocated in New Haven County with the Lower Housatonic River nearby, \nSeymour offers its residents a wide variety of recreational activities, \nhistory, industry, and a strong sense of community with an emphasis on \neducation. Seymour was formally founded on June 24, 1850, when the \ntown's council held its first meeting. I rise today to congratulate \nSeymour on its Sesquicentennial anniversary, 150 years as a town, and \nto reflect for just a few moments on the rich history of this town.\n  The Naugatuck Valley increased in importance during the early 1800s \nbecause of its valuable natural resources and industrial growth. Due to \ndifferent manufacturing concerns and the desire to separate and become \ntheir own community, the town of Seymour, then called Humphreysville, \npetitioned the state legislature to become the town of ``Richmond.'' \nThomas H. Seymour, who was the Governor of the state of Connecticut, \npromised the people that if the town was named in his honor, the bill \nwould be accepted immediately. Evidently, the good people of the town \nagreed, for shortly thereafter the town of Seymour was formally \nconstituted.\n  Throughout the years, companies have prospered and grown in Seymour, \nparalleled by the development and expansion of the town itself. The \nH.P. & E. Day Company began in Seymour in 1865, and has developed into \nthe Waterman Pen Company of France, producers of some of the world's \nfinest fountain pens. Telegraph cables that could be placed underwater \nwere developed by Austin Goodyear Day in Seymour in the mid-nineteenth \ncentury, and continue to be produced by the Kerite Company, presently \nlocated on Day Street. With the vital shipping lanes of the Housatonic \nRiver, as well as the region's railroads and factories, Seymour \nflourished throughout the late nineteenth century, and within the town \na broad range of products--from copper to paper to bottled spring \nwater--was produced. Outside of the industrial diversity of Seymour, \none is immediately aware of the natural beauty of the area. Not only is \nthe Housatonic River one of New England's greatest assets, but it also \nprovides recreational activities such as canoeing and fishing for local \nresidents.\n  I have had the pleasure of visiting the town of Seymour on many \noccasions, and am always impressed with the natural beauty and \nspectacular resourcefulness of the residents. One thing that has \nlingered in my mind from past visits is the strong sense of community, \nand the emphasis on the importance of education. Seymour offers \nresidents an abundance of entertainment and activities through the \nSeymour Recreation Commission, a strong police force led by Police \nChief Michael E. Metzler, the Seymour Senior Center, cultural and \nperforming arts events through the Seymour Culture and Arts Commission, \nand celebrations of important national holidays such as Memorial Day \nthrough local events and parades. In the realm of education, \nSuperintendent Eugene A. Coppola has continued to uphold the fine \nreputation of local schools, which have seen recent increases in test \nscores, state-of-the-art expansion of Bungay Elementary School, the \nstrengthening of the core curriculum, and a majority of students \nparticipating in extracurricular activities. One of the most important \nfacets of the school system in Seymour is the DARE program, instilling \nin students the importance of remaining drug-free.\n  Seymour in the year 2000 is in many respects a great American town. \nIt is a place where businesses can prosper, where families can thrive, \nand where a sense of community permeates everyday life. In recognizing \nthis important anniversary in the life of the town, we pay homage to \nall those who have in the past contributed to making Seymour the \noutstanding place it is today.

A bill to ensure that all States participating in the \nNational Boll Weevil Eradication Program are treated equitably; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                 the boll weevil eradication equity act\n\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Boll \nWeevil Eradication Equity Act. Boll weevil infestation has caused more \nthan $15 billion worth of damage to the United States cotton crop, and \nthe nation's cotton producers lose $300 million annually. Texas is the \nlargest cotton producing state in the nation, yet the scope of this \nproblem extends beyond Texas. The ability of all states to eradicate \nthis pest would stop future migration to boll weevil-free areas and \nprevent reintroduction of the boll weevil into those areas which have \nalready completed a successful eradication effort.\n  We must continue to build upon the past success of the existing \nprogram that authorizes the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \nof the United States Department of Agriculture to join with individual \nstates and provide technical assistance and federal cost-share funds. \nThis highly successful partnership has resulted in complete boll weevil \neradication in California, Florida, Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia \nand North Carolina. These states received an average federal cost-share \nof 26.9 percent, with producers and individual states paying the \nremaining cost.\n  Since 1994, however, the program has expanded into Texas, \nMississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Oklahoma and New Mexico, \nbut the federal appropriation has remained relatively constant. The \naddition of this vast acreage has resulted in dramatically reducing the \nfederal cost share to only 4 percent, leaving producers and individual \nstates to fund the remaining 96 percent. This is not fair to the states \nnow participating in the program because federal matching funds to the \nstates enrolled in the early years of the program constituted almost 30 \npercent of eradication costs.\n  The National Cotton Council estimates that for every $1 spent on \neradication, cotton farmers will accrue about $12 in benefits. The bill \nI am introducing today will authorize a federal cost share contribution \nof not less than 26.9 percent to the states and producers which still \nmust contend with boll weevil infestation.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Boll Weevil Eradication \n     Equity Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) as of the date of enactment of this Act, infestation by \n     Anthonomus grandis (commonly known as the ``boll weevil'') \n     has caused more than $15,000,000,000 in damage to cotton \n     crops of the United States and costs cotton producers in the \n     United States approximately $300,000,000 annually;\n       (2) through the National Boll Weevil Eradication Program \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``program''), the Animal and \n     Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department of \n     Agriculture partners with producers to provide technical \n     assistance and Federal cost share funds to States in an \n     effort to eradicate the boll weevil;\n       (3) States that enrolled in the program before 1994 have \n     since been able to complete boll weevil eradication and were \n     provided a Federal cost share that accounted for an average \n     of 26.9 percent of the total cost of eradication;\n       (4) States that enrolled in the program in or after 1994 \n     account for 65 percent of the national cotton acreage and are \n     now provided an average Federal cost share of only 4 percent, \n     placing a tremendous financial burden on the individual \n     producers;\n       (5) the addition of vast acreage into the program has \n     resulted in an increased need for Federal cost share funds;\n       (6) a producer that participates in the program today \n     deserves not less than the same level of commitment that was \n     provided to producers that enrolled in the program before \n     1994; and\n       (7) the ability of all States to eradicate the boll weevil \n     would prevent further migration of the boll weevil to boll \n     weevil-free areas and reintroduction of the boll weevil in \n     those areas having completed boll weevil eradication.\n\n     SEC. 3. BOLL WEEVIL ERADICATION ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of Agriculture shall provide funds to pay \n     at least 26.9 percent of the total program costs incurred by \n     producers participating in the program.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this Act such sums as are \n     necessary for fiscal years 2001 through 2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 2733. A bill to provide for the preservation of assisted housing \nfor low income elderly persons, disabled persons, and other families; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n            affordable housing for seniors and families act\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise with great pride to \nintroduce the Affordable Housing for Seniors and Families Act. I am \nvery pleased to say that Senator Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator \nSarbanes are original cosponsors of this bill.\n  Even as our national economy flourishes, many Americans are \nstruggling to find safe, decent, sanitary, affordable housing. HUD \nestimates that 5.4 million families are either paying over half of \ntheir incomes for rent or living in substandard housing. Of these \nhouseholds, 1.4 million, or 26%, are elderly or disabled. The scarcity \nof affordable housing is particularly troubling for seniors and the \ndisabled who may require special structural accommodations in their \nhomes.\n  As Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation, \nand as a member of the Aging Committee, I feel a heightened sense of \nurgency in helping these special populations find housing. Thus, I am \npleased to offer a bill which: reauthorizes federal funding for elderly \nand disabled housing programs; expands supportive housing opportunities \nfor these special populations; codifies options to enhance the \nfinancial viability of the projects; assists sponsors in offering a \n``continuum of care'' that allows people to live independently and with \ndignity; offers incentives to preserve the stock of affordable housing \nthat is at risk of loss due to prepayment, Section 8 opt-out, or \ndeterioration; and modernizes current laws allowing the FHA to insure \nmortgages on hospitals, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. \nTogether, I believe these measures will help to fill the critical \nhousing needs of elderly and disabled families.\n  On September 27, 1999, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly \napproved the Preserving Affordable Housing for Senior Citizens in the \n21st Century Act (H.R. 202) by a vote of 405-5.\n\n[[Page S5242]]\n\n Several aspects of H.R. 202, which protected residents in the event \nthat their landlords did not renew their project based Section 8 \ncontracts, were included in the FY 2000 VA-HUD appropriations bill. The \nlegislation I offer today is modeled on the House-passed bill, without \nthe preservation provisions that have already been enacted. I would \nlike to take a few moments to highlight the major provisions of this \nbill.\n  The Section 202 elderly housing program and the Section 811 disabled \nhousing program each provide crucial affordable housing for very low-\nincome individuals, whose incomes are 50 percent or below of the area \nmedian income. By law, sponsors, or owners, of Section 202 or Section \n811 housing must be non-profit organizations. Many sponsors are faith-\nbased. The Affordable Housing for Seniors and Families Act will \nincrease the stock of Section 202 and 811 housing in several ways. \nFirst, it reauthorizes funding for Section 202 and 811 housing programs \nin the amount of $700 million and $225 million, respectively, in FY 01. \nSuch sums as are necessary are authorized for FY 02 through FY 04. \nSecond, it creates an optional matching grant program that will enable \nsponsors to leverage additional money for construction. Third, it \nallows Section 202 housing sponsors to buy new properties.\n  This legislation also codifies options giving owners financial \nflexibility to use sources of income besides the Section 202 and \nSection 811 funds. For instance, by requiring HUD to approve prepayment \nof the 202 mortgages, this bill allows sponsors to build equity in \ntheir projects, which can be used to leverage funding for capital \nimprovements or services for tenants. It gives sponsors maximum \nflexibility to use all sources of financing, including federal money, \nfor construction, amenities, and relevant design features. In order to \nraise additional outside revenue and offer a convenience to tenants, \nowners are permitted to rent space to commercial facilities. In the \ncases of both Section 202 and 811 housing, owners may use their project \nreserves to retrofit or modernize obsolete or unmarketable units. \nFinally, this bill allows project sponsors to form limited partnerships \nwith for-profit entities. Through such a partnership, sponsors can also \ncompete for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, and build larger \ndevelopments.\n\n  The importance of providing a ``continuum of care'' for seniors and \ndisabled persons to continue living independently is addressed in the \nAffordable Housing for Seniors and Families Act. For example, this bill \nhelps seniors stay in their apartments as they become older and more \nfrail by authorizing competitive grants for conversion of elderly \nhousing and public housing projects designated for occupancy by elderly \npersons to assisted living facilities. Responding to obstacles the \nhandicapped face in finding special-needs housing, it allows private \nnon-profits to administer tenant-based rental assistance for the \ndisabled. It also ensures that funding will continue to be invested in \nbuilding housing for the disabled by limiting funding for tenant-based \nassistance under the Section 811 program to 25% of the program's \nappropriation. Funding for service coordinators, who link residents \nwith supportive or medical services in the community, is authorized \nthrough FY 04. Moreover, service coordinators are permitted to assist \nlow-income elderly or disabled families in the vicinity of their \nprojects. Seniors who live in their own houses will be assisted by a \nprovision in Title V which allows them to maximize the equity in their \nhomes by streamlining the process of refinancing an existing federal-\ninsured reverse mortgage.\n  Title IV of this legislation focuses on preserving the existing stock \nof federally assisted properties as affordable housing for low and very \nlow-income families. Each year, 100,000 low-cost apartments across the \ncountry are demolished, abandoned, or converted to market rate use. For \nevery 100 extremely low-income households, having 30% or less of area \nmedian income, only 36 units were both affordable and available. Even \nin rural areas, the potential loss of assisted, affordable housing is \nvery real due to prepayment of mortgages, opt-out of assisted housing \nprograms upon contract expirations, frustration with government \nbureaucracy, or simply a recognition that the building would be more \nprofitable as market-rate housing. Title IV responds with a matching \ngrant program to assist state and local governments who are devoting \ntheir own money to affordable housing preservation. Likewise, it \nauthorizes a competitive grant program to assist nonprofits in buying \nfederally assisted property.\n  Current law allowing the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to \ninsure mortgages on hospitals, nursing homes, and assisted living \nfacilities has become outdated. Title V modernizes the law and removes \nbarriers to using FHA insurance for such facilities. Likewise, it \nrecognizes the integrated nature of healthcare by allowing the FHA to \nprovide mortgage insurance for ``integrated service facilities,'' such \nas ambulatory care centers, which treat sick, injured, disabled, \nelderly, or infirm persons.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important \nbipartisan legislation. In closing, I would like to express my \ngratitude to Senator Kerry for working closely with me on this \nimportant legislation. I also would like to thank Senator Sarbanes for \nhis cosponsorship.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2733\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, along with my colleagues, Senators \nSantorum and Sarbanes, I am introducing legislation which will help \naddress the lack of affordable housing for the most vulnerable \nAmericans--the elderly, disabled persons, and low-income families. This \nbill closes a number of gaps in the federal housing assistance programs \nfor these families, and ensures that programs designed to promote \naffordable housing can do so in this rapidly expanding economy.\n  As our economy flourishes at an unprecedented rate, many Americans \nhave prospered. However, as the economy grows, so too does the gap \nbetween rich and poor. Instead of finding opportunities in this new \neconomy, some Americans have found closed doors. This is especially \ntrue for low-income people who are being squeezed out of tight housing \nmarkets in my home state of Massachusetts and around the Nation.\n  Although a majority of elderly Americans live in decent, adequate and \naffordable housing, millions of elderly households require some \nassistance in order to afford housing that meets their needs. In fact, \nthere are eight elderly people waiting for each unit of assisted \nelderly housing in this country. Fourteen percent of people in \nMassachusetts are over 65 years of age, and one out of every ten of \nthese elderly persons has an income below the poverty level.\n  This bill expands upon the current program of providing affordable \nhousing, increasing housing opportunities for low-income elderly and \ndisabled persons, and bringing the program up-to-date. As Americans \ngrow older, housing programs must be altered to address the changing \nneeds of a generation that is living longer, and aging in place. This \nbill enables existing housing to be converted to assisted living \nfacilities to meet the needs of the elderly and disabled.\n  Assisted living is the fastest growing type of elderly housing in the \nU.S., and this legislation ensures that this supportive, and \nincreasingly necessary living arrangement, is available to all elderly \nand disabled Americans, regardless of income. By 2030, 20 percent of \nthis Nation's population will be over the age of 65, compared with only \n13 percent of the population today. As we make strides in medicine to \nallow older people to live longer, more active lives, we must also make \nsure that the services and structures are in place to support elderly \nAmericans. This bill is a step in this direction.\n  This bill also encourages the leveraging of federal funds, helping to \nincrease the stock of affordable housing. Public dollars alone are \nunable to meet the needs of low-income families. This legislation makes \nit easier for federal funds for disabled and elderly housing to be \ncombined with other sources of funding, including the Low-Income \nHousing Tax Credit, and private funds.\n  Not only will this bill increase the supply of affordable housing for \nthe elderly and disabled, it will help to preserve affordable housing \nfor all low-income households. A record high number of households, 5.4 \nmillion, have worst case housing needs, paying over 50 percent of their \nincome to housing costs or living in substandard housing. This is a 12 \npercent increase since 1991. At the same time that more Americans are \nfinding it increasingly difficult to find suitable and affordable \nhousing, the federal government has not been doing enough to preserve \nthe affordable housing that exists.\n  A number of provisions aim to ensure that affordable housing is \npreserved. This bill allows uninsured 236 project owners to retain \ntheir excess income for use in the project, helping to keep these \nowners in the program and ensuring that the units will remain \naffordable. In addition, this bill includes the preservation bill \nintroduced earlier this Congress by Senator Jeffords and myself, S. \n1318, to provide matching grants to States and localities devoting \nresources to the preservation of affordable housing. Cities, like \nBoston, which have dedicated a substantial amount of funds to the \nproduction and preservation of affordable housing units, would receive \nfederal funds to assist in their efforts under this provision, ensuring \nthat an even greater number of units are preserved.\n  I hope that this critical legislation will attract broad support. At \nthis time of prosperity, we cannot forget that while many Americans \nhave benefited, there are still too many people who cannot afford to \nmeet their basic housing needs. These people cannot be overlooked in \nthis era of economic growth. This legislation ensures that they won't \nbe.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr President, I come to the floor today in support of \nthe Affordable Housing for Seniors and Families Act introduced by \nSenators Kerry and Santorum.\n  This bill expands upon critical housing programs for both elderly and \ndisabled Americans. The Nation's population of elderly is growing \nrapidly. Between 1980 and 1997, the number of people over the age of 65 \ngrew by 33 percent. AARP estimates that by 2030, 20 percent of the \npopulation will be over 65 years of age, compared to only 13 percent of \nthe population today. We need to have programs in place to assist \ngrowing numbers of seniors.\n  AARP also estimates that there will be 2.8 million elderly people \nwho, by 2020, will have difficulty performing a number of basic \nfunctions such as eating, bathing, and dressing. As American's age, \ntraditional housing will have to change to accommodate the unique needs \nof those in their golden years. This bill will ensure that additional \nhousing opportunities exist where these Americans can receive the \nservices they need. This legislation allows\n\n[[Page S5251]]\n\ntraditional elderly and disabled housing to be converted to assisted \nliving facilities, to meet these growing needs.\n  We must not only work to ensure that adequate services are available, \nwe must work to increase the affordable housing stock. A recent study \nconducted by HUD indicates that 1.7 million low-income elderly are in \nurgent need of affordable housing. Nearly 7.4 million elderly \nhouseholds pay more than they can afford on housing, and there are more \nthan eight elderly people waiting for every unit of assisted elderly \nhousing.\n  In addition, HUD estimates that 1.4 million disabled Americans have \nworst case housing needs, meaning they pay over half of their income \nfor housing or live in substandard housing. The Consortium for Persons \nwith Disabilities conducted a study in 1998 which showed that there was \nnot one housing market in the U.S. where a disabled person receiving \nSSI benefits could afford rent based on federal guidelines.\n  The federal government is not doing enough to meet the needs of these \nlow-income people. This legislation assists us in meeting these needs. \nIt expands access to capital from both federal and non-federal sources \nfor elderly and disabled housing programs, helping to create new \nhousing opportunities for these communities. Providers of elderly and \ndisabled housing will be able to link with the Low-Income Housing Tax \nCredit, a crucial source of affordable housing funding, and other \nprivate funds.\n  This bill also ensures that the affordable housing which exists in \nthis country is maintained. This crucial stock of housing will be \npreserved through a matching grant preservation program authored by our \ncolleagues, Senators Kerry and Jeffords, which will reward States and \nlocalities spending resources to preserve affordable housing by giving \nthem federal dollars to assist in their efforts. This provision will \nhelp to ensure that as we increase the stock of affordable housing on \nthe front end, we are not losing units on the back end--our goal is to \nincrease available housing, not maintain the status quo.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction towards providing \nnecessary housing opportunities for those Americans that are too often \nforgotten. And many people in this nation enjoy the benefits of a \nprospering economy, so too are many Americans being left behind. This \nlegislation will ensure that more Americans have the opportunity to \nlive in safe and decent housing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD:\n  S. 2734. A bill to amend the United States Warehouse Act to authorize \nthe issuance of electronic warehouse receipts, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                 the Warehouse Improvement Act of 2000\n\n Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to revitalize and streamline the federal program governing \nagricultural commodity warehouses. This legislation, entitled the \n``Warehouse Improvement Act of 2000,'' will make U.S. agriculture more \ncompetitive in foreign markets through efficiencies and cost savings \nprovided by today's computer technology and information management \nsystems.\n  The Warehouse Act was originally enacted in 1916, and was \nsubsequently amended in 1919, 1923, and 1931. However, since that time, \nthe authorizing legislation for this program has seen little change. At \nthe same time, U.S. agriculture and our society has seen drastic \nchanges since the early part of the 20th century. Computer technology \nhas revolutionized our world and laptops and handheld computers have \nbecome almost commonplace. Now is the time for us to bring USDA's \nagricultural warehouse program out of the dark ages and into the \ninformation age.\n  The U.S. Warehouse Act does not mandate participation by warehouse \noperators that it regulates; it simply offers those who apply and \nqualify for licenses an alternative to state regulation. Currently, \nwarehouse licenses may be issued for the storage of cotton, grain, \ntobacco, wool, dry beans, nuts, syrup and cottonseed. According to the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, 45.5 percent of the U.S. off-farm grain \nand rice storage capacity and 49.5 percent of the total cotton storage \ncapacity is licensed under the Warehouse Act. In general, these paper \nwarehouse receipts that are issued under the Warehouse Act are \ndocuments of title and represent ownership of the stored commodity.\n  The Warehouse Improvement Act of 2000 will make this program more \nrelevant to today's agricultural marketing system. The legislation \nwould authorize and standardize electronic documents and allow their \ntransfer from buyer to seller across state and international \nboundaries. This new paperless flow of agricultural commodities from \nfarm gate to end-user would provide significant savings and \nefficiencies for farmers across the Nation.\n  In 1992, the Congress directed the Secretary of Agriculture to \nestablish electronic warehouse receipts for only the cotton industry. \nSince that time participation in the electronic-based program has grown \nto over half of the U.S. cotton crop. In 1996, for example, nearly 12 \nmillion bales of cotton, out of the total crop of approximately 19 \nmillion bales, were represented by electronic warehouse receipts. \nRecently, the cotton industry estimated that this electronic system \nsaves them 5 to 15 dollars per bale, a savings of over $275 million per \nyear. The legislation that I introduce today extends this electronic \nwarehouse receipt program to all agricultural commodities covered by \nthe U.S. Warehouse Act. This reduced paperwork, increased efficiency, \nand substantial time savings will certainly make U.S. agriculture more \ncompetitive in world markets, giving our U.S. farmers the upper hand.\n  In the short year and a half I have served in the U.S. Senate, I have \nintroduced two bills that have been delivered to the President's desk \nto help bring the United States Department of Agriculture into the \ninformation age. First, S. 1733, the Electronic Benefit Transfer \nInteroperability and portability Act of 2000, which improves the \nelectronic benefits transfer system that has provided significant \nsavings and efficiency to the food stamp program, was signed into law \non February 11 of this year (P.L. 106-171). And second, S. 777, the \nFreedom to E-File Act, requires USDA to set up a system to allow \nfarmers to file all USDA required paperwork over the internet. This \nlegislation unanimously passed both the House and Senate recently and \nis currently awaiting the President's signature. The legislation I am \nintroducing today follows these two pieces of legislation by requiring \nUSDA to use computer technology and information management systems to \nbetter serve farmers and the American public.\n  The Warehouse Improvement Act of 2000 is a positive step toward \nmoving the Department of Agriculture from the computer technology \n``dirt road'' to the information superhighway of the 21st century. It \nis common sense legislation and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this issue as the legislative session moves forward. I \nwould also like to thank a number of the Senate Agriculture Committee \nstaff who have worked tirelessly on this issue, including Michael Knipe \nand Bob White on Senator Lugar's staff and Terry Van Doren on my staff. \nThey have worked to build consensus among the USDA and the agricultural \nindustry to bring about these needed changes to improve the efficiency \nof our grain marketing system. In fact, this legislation enjoys the \nsupport of USDA, the Association of American Warehouse Control \nOfficials, the National Grain and Feed Association, the American Far \nBureau Federation, and various other commodity groups.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record \nfollowing the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2734\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote access to health care services in rural \nareas; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           health care access and rural equality act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the Health Care \nAccess and Rural Equality Act of 2000 (H-CARE).\n  This proposal is the result of a bipartisan and bicameral effort. I \nam proud to be joined by several cosponsors, including Senators \nGrassley, Daschle, Thomas, Harkin, Baucus, Kerrey, Jeffords, \nRockefeller, Roberts, Johnson, Lincoln, and Cochran. I would also like \nto thank our House companions for joining me as supporters of this \nproposal. In particular, would like to recognize Representatives Foley, \nPomeroy, Tanner, Nussle, McIntyre, Stenholm, Berry, and Lucas for their \nefforts. Working together, I believe we are taking important steps \ntoward improving health care access in our rural communities.\n  Also, I would like to thank the National Rural Health Association, \nthe Federation of American Health Systems, and the College of American \nPathologists for their support of this effort.\n  Last year, we received information that 12 of my State's 35 rural \nhospitals were in jeopardy of closing. In North Dakota, many areas do \nnot have hospitals within their county borders. This means that in some \nareas of my State, many communities depend on having access to one \nspecific rural health care facility. If this facility were to close, \nthis would leave residents in these areas without access to vital \nhealth care services.\n  We know that in many rural communities, Medicare patients make up the \nmajority of the typical rural hospitals' caseloads--in N.D., more than \n70 percent of most rural hospitals' patients are covered by Medicare. \nThis means that Medicare funding and changes to the program greatly \nimpact our small, rural providers.\n  Unfortunately, while our rural facilities may serve a \ndisproportionate number of Medicare patients, they are often forced to \noperate with merely half the reimbursement of their urban counterparts. \nFor example, Mercy Hospital in Devils Lake receives on average about \n$4,200 for treating a patient with pneumonia. In New York City, we know \nthat some hospitals receive more than $8,500 for treating the same \nillness. This disparity places our providers at a clear disadvantage.\n  Against the backdrop of this funding disparity, we know that rural \nproviders\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\nwere particularly hard hit by reductions in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997. Last year, N.D. hospitals were losing at minimum 7 percent on \nevery Medicare patient they serve. In some of our smaller communities, \nhospital margins fell as low as negative 21 percent. How can our \nhospitals be expected to survive at a 20 percent loss?\n  Recognizing the challenges that our communities were facing, I fought \nhard last year to offer relief to our rural providers. I am happy to \nsay that the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) brought more \nthan $100 million to our ND providers--but we must do more.\n\n  Even though the BBRA improved the outlook for our hospitals, N.D. \nfacilities are still in financial trouble--they are still projected to \nhave negative 4.9 percent margins by 2002. Continued funding shortfalls \nhave made it, and will continue to make it, impossible for our smallest \nrural hospitals to make needed building improvements; impossible for \nthem to provide patients access to updated technologies; and difficult \nfor them to competitively recruit and retain health care providers, \nparticularly to the most isolated, frontier areas.\n  For this reason, I rise to introduce H-CARE. This legislation offers \ntargeted relief to our most vulnerable rural providers, including: our \nsole community, critical access, and Medicare dependent hospitals.\n  In particular, H-CARE would offer a full inflation update to all \nrural hospitals. The BBA limited hospitals' inflation updates through \n2002. This has meant that our providers have not been allowed to \nreceive payments that are in line with the costs they incur for serving \nMedicare patients. H-CARE would close the gap on this funding \nshortfall.\n  Also, H-CARE permanently extends the important Medicare dependent \nhospital program, which is due to expire in 2006, and would offer these \nproviders more up-to-date funding. Currently, they are reimbursed based \non 1988 costs. As providers that serve at least a 60 percent Medicare \ncaseload, it is important that they receive appropriate Medicare \npayments.\n  In addition, H-CARE addresses several flaws in last year's Medicare \nadd-back bill that have adversely impacted our rural providers. For \nexample, many rural hospitals entered the Critical Access Hospital \n(CAH) program under the promise that they would receive adequate \nresources to keep their doors open. The BBRA inadvertently limited \nthese hospitals' ability to receive funding for providing lab services \nto their patients. H-CARE fixes this problem by ensuring CAHs once \nagain receive the funding they need to provide lab services.\n  For our sole community hospitals, H-CARE corrects an error in the \nBBRA which excluded some of these hospitals from receiving higher \nreimbursement rates based on more recent costs. H-CARE fixes this \nmistake by letting all sole community hospitals receive more up-to-date \npayments based on 1996 costs. This is particularly important for N.D. \nsince 29 of my state's 36 rural facilities are sole community \nhospitals.\n  Lastly, H-CARE would establish a loan fund that rural facilities \ncould access to repair crumbling buildings or update their equipment--\neligible facilities could receive up to $5m to make repairs and an \nextra $50,000 to help develop a capital improvement plan. H-CARE also \nincludes grants, in the amount of $50,000 per facility, that hospitals \ncould use to purchase new technology and train staff on using this \ntechnology.\n  In summary, this year, I will fight to enact these and other measures \nthat are vital to improving our rural health care system. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important effort.\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \ntoday to support introduction of the Health Care Access and Rural \nEquality Act of 2000, known as H-CARE.\n  I especially want to commend Senators Conrad and Grassley, and \nRepresentative Foley for the tremendous amount of effort they put forth \nin drafting this key legislation. As well, I commend a number of my \nother colleagues who have contributed immensely to the crafting of this \nbill, including Senators Daschle, Harkin, Roberts, Thomas, Kerrey, \nRockefeller, and Representatives Pomeroy, Tanner, Nussle, and McIntyre.\n  The bipartisan and bicameral support for this legislation signifies \nthe critical and often times desperate condition, that our rural \nhospitals are in due in large part to the unforeseen impact of the \nBalanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 and disparities in Medicare \nreimbursements for rural facilities.\n  Impact estimates and preliminary data suggest that the BBA cuts have \nfallen squarely on the shoulders of our rural hospitals who do not have \nthe operating margins to shoulder consecutive years of budgetary \ndeficits. Unfortunately, rural hospitals do not have the luxury of \ntrimming spending in one area to meet the needs in another. Recent cuts \nhave forced hospitals to eliminate important programs such as home \nhealth care or therapy services in order to operate within these tight \nbudget restraints.\n  Rural hospitals are charged with the responsibility to provide high-\nquality, compassionate care to individuals in times of need, especially \nour senior and disabled Medicare populations. However, it also seems \nevident to me that we have asked hospitals to do a day's work for an \nhour's pay.\n  The H-CARE Act works to restore some of the funding disparities that \nexist for rural hospitals and provides resources to ensure their \nsurvival.\n  Hospitals in my home state of South Dakota face a potential loss in \nMedicare revenues of nearly $171 million over five years if something \nis not done to help them.\n  Provisions in H-CARE including inflation updates for rural hospitals, \nprotection for Medicare Dependent Hospitals, support for the Critical \nAccess Hospitals Programs, creation of a capital infrastructure loan \nprogram, assistance to update technology, and increased reimbursement \nfor Sole Community Hospitals will allow rural facilities the necessary \nresources to keep their doors open.\n  We are talking about rural facilities such as the Medical Center in \nHuron, SD, which was forced to eliminate 24 full time positions to \ncompensate for Medicare cuts in their FY 2001 budget, or the hospital \nin Burke, SD, which had to cut $124,000 from their hospital this year \nto ensure their survival. These are just a few examples of the many \nstories that I've heard from hospitals administrators throughout my \nhome state of South Dakota.\n  Once again, I am please to join my colleagues today as an original \ncosponsor of the H-CARE Act and look forward to working with the full \nSenate to ensure quick and immediate action on this critically \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2736. A bill to provide compensation for victims of the fire \ninitiated by the National Park Service at Bandelier National Monument, \nNew Mexico; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  the cerro grande fire assistance act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say from the very beginning of \nthis discussion today, it has been a real pleasure to work with Senator \nBingaman and his staff--and I hope that is mutual--on putting together \na bill that we are going to introduce today. It is our best effort to \nput together a bill that permits the citizens of Los Alamos, the people \nwho reside there, whose houses or personal property were damaged or \ndestroyed, and businesses that existed, owned either by corporations or \nindividuals--the damage they might have suffered. This is just a \npartial list. I will read the list before we leave the floor.\n  This is an effort to compensate the Indian people for similar losses.\n  Mr. President, since May 4, 2000, it is now known that the National \nPark Service started a forest fire, a so-called prescribed burn, at \nBandelier National Monument in New Mexico. That was done during the \nheight of the fire season and, regrettably, as everyone now knows, that \nfire, which was expected to be a controlled burn by the Park Service in \nBandelier National Park, was not able to be controlled by those who \nwere called in to control it. The fire went right down the \nmountainside, ended up burning down the forest and parts of the \ncommunity of Los Alamos. The fire destroyed more than 425 residences.\n\n  I am going to start from the beginning with just one photo. Senator\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\nBingaman has others. He drove the streets while some of the fires were \nstill cooling off. As I understand it, Senator Bingaman could see the \nremnants of steam and heat, and the residue of fires that had not yet \ntotally burned out.\n  This is just one picture of the old town site. That means there is a \npart of the area that was built up by the Federal Government years ago \nwhen Los Alamos was a closed off and secret community, at which the \nfirst atomic bomb was being built. All of the science was put in place \nup there, and it was totally a secret city. Years later, while I was a \nSenator--I have been here 28 years--we tore down the walls and sold \nthose houses to individuals.\n  This is the way the fire looked as a house burned adjoining the trees \nand forests that surround Los Alamos. It was actually much worse than \nthat. But that is the best we can do in a photograph of this type.\n  The fire started on May 4, and by May 5 it was a full-fledged \nwildfire devouring everything in its path. Ultimately, it devoured \n48,000 acres of forest land and significant parts of the community \nwhere houses and businesses were owned by individuals.\n  During the time this fire burned out of control, our Nation was \ncelebrating the 50th anniversary of Smokey the Bear; that is, the date \nof his rescue from a raging forest fire in the Lincoln National Forest \nin NM.\n  For 50 years, Smokey the Bear had cautioned Americans to be careful. \nApparently, no one told the Park Service.\n  The decision was made to start a forest fire. The basis was a \nmiscalculation of the danger. The result was, believe it or not, about \n25,000 people were evacuated; 405 families lost their residences or \nhomes; two Indian pueblos lost land, livelihood, and sacred sites; and \n48,000 acres were transformed from a lush forest into a charcoal garden \ncovered in some places by 12 inches of ash.\n  The cost thus far to taxpayers just to fight the fire is perhaps $10 \nmillion.\n  We now have a couple of official reports. We have a 40-page report \ncalled ``Sierra Grande Prescribed Burn Investigative Report'' dated May \n18, 2000. It can be summarized.\n  Too little planning; too few followed procedures; too little caution; \ntoo little experience; too much dry underbrush; too much wind; too much \nadvice unheeded; and too late arrival of the ``hotshot'' experts; and, \nit was too bad.\n  It is more than too bad. It calls into question the policy with \nreference to prescribed burns. But that is an issue for another day. \nBut I am hopeful that serious discussions are taking place as to how we \nshould handle controlled burns in the future.\n  We have a catastrophe. It is a catastrophe that it started in the \nfirst place. There is no doubt about that.\n  It is a tragedy that it destroyed homes. There is no doubt about \nthat.\n  It is a disaster that fire disrupted businesses. It cost State and \nlocal governments millions of dollars. There is no disagreement about \nthat.\n  Imagine the horror of seeing your home reduced to ashes and the \nfreakishness of owning a concrete staircase to nowhere and calling it \nyour home as you come back to visit. The house is burned to the ground, \nand only cement steps remain.\n  Imagine seeing your neighborhood reduced to a row of brick chimneys \nand concrete foundations.\n  Consider the irony of a home burned to the ground while the wooden \ntree house stands unoccupied in the yard.\n  Imagine the task of sifting through the ashes for any unincinerated \nremnants of your life.\n  Think about the gawkers and the TV trucks driving through your \nneighborhood waiting to see if the first rains produce mudslides and/or \nfloods.\n  Imagine your life if you were they.\n  You want to go back to work, to get the kids back into a routine, but \nyour life is a series of back-to-back-meetings, dealing with \nappraisers, contractors, insurance, FEMA, SBA, and flood insurance.\n  Everyone involved wishes that the fire could be unset, the match \nunlit, the decision unmade, but there is no way to undo the \ncatastrophe.\n  The Federal Government can't undo the damage, but it can provide \nprompt compensation. That is the objective of the legislation that \nSenator Bingaman and I are introducing today. We have worked closely \nwith the administration, and I am pleased that they support this \nlegislation.\n  I am pleased to introduce legislation that starts the process of \nrebuilding lives. It provides an expedited settlement process for the \nvictims of the fire.\n  The first estimate of the cost that we are covering is an approximate \nnumber of $300 million. We will use $300 million as our approximate \ncost as we take this bill into conference on the MILCON bill and \nattempt to get it adopted in an expedited matter as part of that \nconference, along with the moneys needed to compensate the victims for \ntheir claims under this legislation. And there are moneys for other \ncomponents of the fire under other federal programs--$134 million for \nthe laboratory damage itself, which is a separate appropriations item.\n  To accomplish the goal of compensating fire victims in the most \nefficient and fair way possible, this legislation establishes a \ncompensation process through a separate Office of Cerro Grande Fire \nClaims at FEMA.\n  It provides for full compensation for property losses and personal \ninjuries sustained by the victims, including all individuals, \nregardless of their immigration status, small businesses, local \ngovernments, schools, Indian tribes, and any other entities injured as \na result of the fire.\n  Such compensation will include the replacement cost of homes, cars, \nand any other property lost or damaged in the fire, as well as lost \nwages, business losses, insurance deductibles, emergency staffing \nexpenses, debris removal and other clean-up costs, and any other losses \ndeemed appropriate by the Director of FEMA.\n  To make sure that this is an expedited procedure, within 45 days of \nenactment, FEMA must promulgate rules governing the claims process. \nAfter the rules are in place, FEMA must publish in newspapers and other \nplaces in New Mexico, an easy-to-understand description of the claims \nprocess in English and Spanish, so that everyone will know their rights \nand where and how to file a claim.\n  Once those rules are in place, victims will have 2 years to file \ntheir claims, and FEMA must pay those claims within 6 months of filing.\n  During the adjudication of each claim, FEMA is authorized to make \ninterim payments to victims so that those with the greatest need will \nnot be forced to wait a long time before receiving some form of \ncompensation from the government.\n  This bill also will reimburse insurance companies for the costs they \npaid to help rebuild Los Alamos and the surrounding communities. Under \nthis bill, insurance companies will be able to make subrogation claims \nagainst the government on behalf of themselves or their policyholders \nin same manner as any other victim of the fire.\n  I want the victims to know that this bill requires that they will \ncompensated before insurance companies.\n\n  The intent is to encourage insurance companies to settle with their \npolicyholders and then come to the government for compensation. That \nway, victims can get on with their lives as soon as possible, and \ninsurance companies can get reimbursed through the claims process \nwithout the need to proceed under the cumbersome Federal Tort Claims \nAct.\n  For victims whose insurance will not cover the complete replacement \ncost of their property loss or their personal injury, insurance \ncompanies should cover all that is required under their policies, and \nthe government will make up the difference.\n  Mr. President, I think that in this bill, we have developed a process \nwhich is fair, comprehensive, and efficient. Yet there will be some who \nbelieve, for whatever reasons, that they are not receiving what they \nare entitled from the government.\n  For those individuals, this bill preserves their right to sue under \nthe Tort Claims Act or to protest the final claims decision of FEMA. I \nhope that there will be few, if any, such lawsuits, but I believe we \nmust maintain the rights of individuals to proceed to court if they are \nunhappy with their claims award.\n  I think we have taken an excellent first step in proposing this \nclaims legislation. There is no way one bill can address every issue \nwhich might arise in every circumstance. Many of the details will be \ndetermined by the Fire\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\nClaims Office. I want my constituents to know that I will do all I can \nto monitor the process as it moves forward to ensure that New Mexicans \nare treated fairly and in accordance with the intent of this law.\n  All our citizens owe a tremendous gratitude to the workers at Los \nAlamos. We won the cold war because of their contributions. Today we \nenjoy our freedoms because of their dedication. We need their continued \ndedication to assure that those freedoms survive for our future \ngenerations. And they need our help to rebuild their lives and return \nto their vital missions.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the Cerro Grande Fire Assistance \nAct.\n  Citizens can choose not to take this claims approach provided for in \nthis legislation, and they can go to the Federal courts under the \nFederal Tort Claims Act. If they do, they will get no compensation \nunder this bill. That is their option.\n  If they choose the option provided under this bill and they go \nthrough it to get money for their damages--let's just take an item, \nsuch as a house which Senator Bingaman and I discussed. If there is a \ndispute as to the value of that house, and they are supposed to get the \nvalue for the replacement cost--if there is a dispute, this bill \nprovides an opportunity to use arbitration.\n  We have limited attorney's fees in this bill to 10 percent. We don't \nthink this is going to be a heavily litigated process. I repeat, if \ncitizens want to make their claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act, \nthis legislation does not preclude that, other than they have no right \nto claim anything under this bill.\n  We owe tremendous gratitude to the workers of Los Alamos. We won the \ncold war because of their efforts and their predecessors in the various \nactivities and scientific niches at this laboratory which has been run \nadmirably by the University of California.\n  Today, we enjoy some of our basic freedoms because in that cold war \nwith the Soviet Union we had great people in this community and a \ncouple of other communities, always staying ahead so people could be \nassured nuclear weapons would never be used against our people.\n  That laboratory is having some trouble besides the fire. When it all \nfinishes, we will still stand in awe at the fantastic brain trust that \nis assembled in the mountains of northern New Mexico. We have a sister \ninstitution in California, obviously, and an engineering institution in \nAlbuquerque called Sandia National Laboratories. They are three labs \nthat are tied together by scientific prowess and a commitment to serve \nAmerica in her needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici. \nI also want to state how much I have enjoyed working with him on this \nterrible subject. I think the ability of our offices to work together \nhas been admirable. We have come up with a plan that moves the process \nforward and closer to some real relief for the people who were damaged \nby this incident.\n  Mr. President, this was a disaster. This was a catastrophe. Let me \nshow three photos that make the case. This is a photo from space, from \na very high altitude, that shows the fire while it was burning, with \nthe smoke plume coming through northeastern New Mexico into Colorado, \ninto Oklahoma, and into west Texas. The photo shows the magnitude of \nwhat was involved. This was clearly the largest forest fire we have \never had in our State of New Mexico since they have been keeping \nrecords. It is very unfortunate that it was started by a controlled \nburn to which the Park Service agreed. That clearly makes this the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government. As a country, we need to step \nup and compensate people for their losses.\n  Let me show two other photos that make the case as to what was done. \nThis is a photo of one of the houses in Los Alamos with a car out \nfront. These people in Los Alamos were advised they needed to leave \ntheir homes, get in cars or on buses, and go down to Santa Fe to escape \nthe danger. They did. This is what they came back to a couple of weeks \nlater. Clearly, this is not the kind of a circumstance of which anyone \ncan be proud.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator views this scene while driving down the \nstreets?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I toured the community and the neighborhoods with James \nLee Witt, the head of FEMA, and with our Governor, Governor Johnson. We \nsaw the devastation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is a chimney?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is a chimney.\n  The people did not have time to even arrange to drive their cars out \nof town. Of course, all their personal belongings were in the houses. \nThe damage was total. The loss was total for the families who were \nburned out.\n  Another photo makes the case, a photo of the rubble that was left at \none of the sites. Here is a bicycle. I might add, the water lines in \nthese houses were still running. As we drove up and down the street, we \nsaw water spurting out of the water lines, but there would be no house. \nClearly, the devastation was enormous.\n  The people of Los Alamos and Senator Domenici made this point, and it \nhas been made many times: The people of Los Alamos were heroic in their \nresponse to this tragedy. They pulled together as a community. They \nhelped each other. They worked together to get their community back up \nand running. The people of the entire State came together and rallied \nto help the people who were injured. This was a period, and we are \nstill in it to some extent, a period where we have lots of fires going \non in New Mexico. It was not just the people who were injured in the \nCerro Grande fire who were requiring assistance. We had other fires in \nour State, including the Scott Able fire in southern New Mexico which \nwas very devastating, the fire at Ruidoso, the Viveash fire near Pecos.\n  Our job now, and what Senator Domenici and I are trying to do in this \nlegislation, is to put in place a mechanism so people can get as full a \nrelief as possible. We recognize you are not ever in a position to \ncompensate someone for all of this loss, but we want to compensate \npeople as fully as the Government can. We also, of course, want to do \nso as quickly as possible.\n  The reason this legislation is important, I believe--and I think this \nwas something which the administration officials, and Jack Lew with the \nOffice of Management and Budget agreed with entirely--is that the time \nit takes to go through the Tort Claims Act is extensive. History has \nshown that in many cases it is not satisfactory, that process has not \nbeen satisfactory. It was our conclusion, and the conclusion supported \nby the administration, that we should do a separate bill which would \nset up a different procedure that, hopefully, would give better \ncompensation to people, and do it much more quickly than is otherwise \npossible.\n  Senator Domenici pointed out we have gone to great lengths to not \ninterfere with the right of people to pursue their remedies under \ncurrent law, if they choose to do that. We have not changed the rules \nfor that. We have not in any way impeded that. But people have to make \na judgment after they consult with everyone involved--their attorneys \nif they have attorneys, or anyone else with whom they want to consult--\nmake a judgment as to whether to use the remedy, the process we are \nsetting up in this legislation, once this becomes law, or to use the \nprocess that is available to them under current law under the Tort \nClaims Act.\n  My own hope is that we have come up with a better alternative. That \nis my belief. That has certainly been our purpose. We hope people will \nsee it that way and that this legislation will result in more full \ncompensation, much more rapidly than would otherwise be possible, and \nthat people will be able to get on with their lives because of that.\n  The legislation has many aspects to it, which I discussed in detail. \nSenator Domenici went into some of that. Let me just say, the main \nthrust of it is to compensate people for injuries they receive, for \nloss of property, compensate businesses for losses they incurred, \ncompensate businesses and individuals, both, for financial losses that \nare directly traceable and attributable to this fire.\n  Clearly, we want this to be a fair process for those involved. At the \nsame time, we are anxious that it be done in a responsible way, so once \nit is over with, we can have an accounting for\n\n[[Page S5258]]\n\nwhat compensation was provided and the justification for it. I think \nthe American people will want that and should be entitled to that. I \nbelieve this will substantially improve the chances of folks getting \nfully compensated, as fully compensated as possible, as early as \npossible.\n  For that reason, I am pleased to join Senator Domenici in \ncosponsoring this legislation. I do think we have several steps, \nseveral hoops to jump through between now and when this becomes law. \nThere will be opportunities for us to fine-tune this as we go forward. \nI hope we can do that, but I hope we can go forward very quickly. He \nindicated our desire to have it included in some appropriations \nlegislation--the military construction appropriations bill--which is \npending now. I hope very much that can happen, and I hope that bill can \nget to the President very quickly with this included and can become \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, on May 4, 2000, a decision by the National Park \nService to conduct a prescribed burn in the Bandelier National Park \nchanged the lives of Los Alamos residents forever. What started as a \nprescribed burn of approximately 1,000 acres, turned into a fire that \nroared for 18 days and in the end charred over 47,000 acres. Soon after \nthe fire raged out of control, the National Park Service assumed \nresponsibility for the damage caused by the fire.\n  While we need to take another look at the Park Service's policy \nconcerning prescribed burns, we first need to take care of those that \nwere injured by the Park Service's actions. There will be time for \nhearings and investigations. But first, there are people that must be \nclothed, homes that must be rebuilt, and businesses that must pay their \nbills. We need to make sure our children are settled again before the \n2001 school year begins in 2 months. We need to clean up the debris and \nhazardous waste so families can think about rebuilding.\n  The Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Act that I am introducing with \nSenator Domenici today is what we believe represents the Government's \nresponsibility to the citizens of Los Alamos and the surrounding \npueblos.\n  The Cerro Grande fire didn't just burn 47,000 acres of national \nforest. This fire was so intense that it traveled several miles from \nthe point of origin to the town of Los Alamos, New Mexico. When the \nfire roared up the canyons in Los Alamos, it completely destroyed 385 \ndwellings and seriously damaged another 17 dwellings. Over 60 homes \nwere burned on 46th, 48th and Yucca Streets alone. Keep in mind that \nLos Alamos is not a large community and these numbers reflect a large \nmajority of the residents in those areas. This chart shows what used to \nbe single family homes on Arizona Avenue. It was one of the 50 homes \ndestroyed along Arizona Avenue.\n  This second picture shows the damage done along Alabama Avenue. The \nfourplexes across the street were spared but many of the fourplexes \nalong Alabama are no longer standing. Most of these fourplexes were \nbuilt between 1949 and 1954 by the federal government for the first \nworkers of the national laboratory. In the late 1960's the federal \ngovernment sold these homes to the residents of Los Alamos. On May 4th, \nmany of these homes were occupied by the original residents--\nindividuals who are now retired from the lab and enjoying their golden \nyears. Ten percent of the households destroyed belonged to senior \ncitizens. One such couple showed up to a town meeting to show me all \nthey had left of their former home--the wife had the burned door handle \nand the husband had the key in his pocket.\n  Other fourplexes that were destroyed were occupied by young families \nand the most recent generation of lab employees. 35% of the housing \nunits destroyed were being rented and 92 of those tenants were without \nany form of insurance. Many of these people are now without a home for \ntheir young families. One of the couples I spoke with after the fire \nwas a young couple expecting a child who lost their home and their \nadjoining rental unit. And I was recently informed that over 200 school \nchildren were burned out of their homes.\n  Driving through these neighborhoods that are now filled with \nblackened trees, melted swing sets and burned bicycles is a difficult \nthing to witness. This fire grew out of control so quickly, mostly \nbecause of the 60 mph winds that swirled through the controlled burn \narea, that most families had less than an hour to gather their \nbelongings and evacuate the mesa. Many others didn't have even that \nmuch time. As you can see by the numerous burned cars, many families \nwere unable to get both of their cars down the hill before the fire \nhit. In the end, 5% of the housing units in Los Alamos was destroyed by \nthis fire.\n\n  Despite the personal tragedy many of them suffered, the residents of \nLos Alamos came together and helped one another and supported the \nefforts of the hundreds of firefighters who fought long and hard to \ncontrol this monstrous blaze. Several Los Alamos restaurant owners \nreturned to Los Alamos during the height of the fire and donated their \ninventory and services to cook up meals at the local Elks Lodge for the \nfirefighters, police and National Guardsmen who were sent to this \nremote community. In addition, the outpouring of support from the \nnearby communities in setting up shelters and offering food and \nclothing was something I was proud to witness firsthand. This support \nalso included the shelters and individuals who volunteered to take in \nthe hundreds of animals that belonged to the over 20,000 residents \nevacuated from Los Alamos and White Rock.\n  The citizens of Los Alamos were heroic throughout this fire. \nResidents, like engineer Tony Tomei, were single-handedly trying to \nhelp save their neighborhoods from spreading wildlife. Tomei used his \ngarden hose to douse small spot fires and used a rake and shovel to \nextinguish burning debris. His all night efforts saved his own house \nand the house of one neighbor, much to the neighbor's surprise.\n  After returning from Los Alamos and viewing the extent of damage, I \nbegan work with Senator Domenici on legislation that would compensate \nthe people of Los Alamos, the surrounding pueblos, and the national \nlaboratory for the damages sustained. We have been working for over 3 \nweeks now with the Office of Budget and Management, the White House, \nand the citizens of New Mexico to come up with legislation that will \nprovide those who suffered personal and/or financial injury the most \nexpedient and thorough compensation possible. We have received input \nfrom a number of individuals who lost their homes, from business owners \nwho were shut down for up to a week, from the Los Alamos County Council \nand the governors of the San Ildefonso and Santa Clara Pueblos. While \nno one can truly be made whole after such a devastating experience, the \nrole of the federal government in this situation is to ensure that \npeople are adequately compensated for the losses resulting from the \nfire. Senator Domenici and I worked to come up with legislation that \nwould compensate New Mexicans as fully as possible, while still being \nsomething acceptable to the entire Congress.\n  Based on the numerous meetings we held with the people mentioned \nabove, we have come up with categories of damages that are compensable, \nincluding: property losses, business losses and financial losses. The \ngoal is to compensate individuals for losses that were not otherwise \ncovered by insurance or any other third party contribution.\n  For example, compensable property losses will include such things as \nuninsured property losses. This should address the problem many \nindividuals are facing after realizing that they were under insured for \ntheir homes or their personal property. The goal is this legislation is \nto provide individuals with the funds needed to repair or replace their \nreal and personal property using ``replacement value'' as a determining \nfactor. This means that individuals should receive the dollar amount \nneeded to rebuild their homes using current construction methods \nand materials, in line with current zoning requirements, and without a \ndeduction for depreciation. It also means that individuals should be \nprovided with the funds necessary to allow them to replace their \ndamaged personal property with property that provides them equal \nutility. Moreover, we realize that homeowners will need funds to cover \nthe cost of stabilizing and restoring their land to a condition \nsuitable for building after the debris is removed.\n\n[[Page S5259]]\n\n  The legislation will also compensate public entities for the damage \nto the physical infrastructure in the community. The county and other \ngovernmental entities will be able to seek compensation for the cost of \nrebuilding community infrastructure damaged by the fire, such as power \nlines, roads and public parks.\n  Compensable business losses will include such things as damage to \ntangible business assets, lost profits, costs incurred as a result of \nsuspending business for one week, wages paid to employees for days \nmissed during the fire, and other business losses deemed appropriate by \nthe Claims Office. This provision is intended to help business owners \nwho were forced to evacuate Los Alamos for up to 5 days. For people \nlike the local nursery owner, closing shop during Mothers' Day weekend \nand the short planting season in northern NM was devastating. While the \nresidents of Los Alamos disappeared from the community, the fixed \noverhead costs of the small business owners did not disappear.\n  Compensable financial losses will include economic losses for \nexpenses such as insurance deductibles, temporary living expenses, \nrelocation expenses, debris removal costs, and emergency staffing \nexpenses for our governmental entities. The intent is to assist victims \nin rebuilding and recovering incidental expenses that they would \notherwise not have incurred, had it not been for the Cerro Grande Fire. \nThis includes costs incurred by the claimant in proving his losses, \nincluding the cost of appraisals where necessary.\n  In addition, the pueblos will be eligible to seek compensation for \nthe damage to the forest lands on the pueblo and the impact of the fire \non their subsistence hunting, fishing, firewood, timbering, grazing and \nagricultural activities. Individual tribal members and wholly-owned \ntribal entities will be eligible to seek reimbursement through this \nclaims process for quantifiable losses. This means that the BIA will \nnot serve as a conduit for any settlement to an individual tribal \nmember or a tribe.\n  This legislation also intends to provide resources for the \nremediation that will be necessary to prevent future disasters because \nof flooding and mudslides. While we have experienced an unusually dry \nsummer in the Southwest, forecasters predict an earlier than usual \nmonsoon season and efforts must be made to shore up the burned \nhillsides and 70 foot canyon walls. The remediation effort will have to \nbe undertaken by several federal agencies, including the Department of \ninterior, the Agriculture Department and other entities with experience \nin this regard.\n  In order to expedite an individual's recovery, we have designed an \nadministrative claims process that will allow injured parties to seek \ncompensation for the expenses that were incurred, and were not \notherwise covered by a third party, as a result of the Cerro Grande \nfire. This legislation authorizes that claims process and establishes \nan Office of Cerro Grande Fire Claims which will be under the authority \nof the Director of FEMA. FEMA is directed to compensate the victims of \nthe Cerro Grande fire for injuries resulting from the fire and to \nsettle those claims in an expeditious manner. FEMA will be given \nauthority to hire an independent claims manager or other experts in \nclaims processing to oversee this large project. We feel that FEMA is \nthe best federal agency to handle this responsibility as they are \ncapable of the task and are familiar with the damages that are common \nin a disaster. I trust that the FEMA Director will assemble a team that \nthe community of Los Alamos can have confidence in and that will strive \nto settle claims to the benefit of those injured.\n\n  The Director of FEMA has 45 days to design this claims process and \npromulgate regulations for the claims office to follow. The regulations \nshould not be overly burdensome for the claimants and should provide an \nunderstandable and straight forward path to settlement. In the event \nthat issues arise concerning a settlement amount, the claimant will be \nable to enter into binding arbitration to settle any disputes with the \nclaims office. If a claimant would rather have the Director's decision \nreviewed by a judge, the claimant will be able to seek judicial review \nof the Director's decision in federal court. Claimants who believe they \nneed legal assistance as they proceed through this process should know \nthat attorneys' fees are provided for in this legislation, with a cap \nof 10%. And while we believe this administrative claims process is the \nmost efficient and reliable route for those seeking compensation, we \nare leaving the option of a federal tort action open to this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, there is nothing Senator Domenici or I can do to \nreplace the personal items and sentimental possessions that were \nconsumed by the Cerro Grande Fire. This federal compensation will do \nnothing to replace a coin collection collected over a lifetime or an \nheirloom inherited from a great-grandmother. However, the federal \ngovernment has the responsibility to try and restore the lives of the \npeople impacted by this horrible tragedy. The federal government \nstarted this mess and it is time the federal government started \ncleaning up this mess and fixing what was damaged.\n  Congress can start the recovery process by passing this legislation. \nI ask that my colleagues act quickly on this legislation as the season \nfor rebuilding this community is a short season for this city that sits \nhigh above the valley. I thank my colleagues for their support and for \ntheir willingness to do the right thing in this very unique situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I once again thank Senator Bingaman.\n  Part of the time these discussions were taking place in New Mexico, I \nwas not available to be there. As most people in New Mexico know, I \nhave been there twice, but I missed one occasion when Senator Bingaman \ngot to talk with the people. I thank him for that because he brought \nback a number of ideas. One of my staffers was present with him. Those \nideas are incorporated in this legislation.\n  In particular, let me repeat that the bill covers ``loss of \nproperty,'' and it says what that means; ``business losses,'' and it \nsays what that means; ``financial losses,'' and it says what that \nmeans. Then a ``summary of the claims process'' and a summary of the \nremedies and a summary of appeal rights.\n  The lead agency is going to be the Office of Cerro Grande Fire Claims \nwithin FEMA. James Lee Witt or his successor will oversee that office \nbut has the discretionary authority to designate an independent claims \nmanager to run the office, if he so desires.\n  We are not creating anything new, it will be FEMA. But if he wants an \nindependent claims manager, he has the latitude and authority to do \nthat. There will be a separate account for the victims of the Cerro \nGrande fire that will be separate from the disaster assistance fund. \nAlso, all of the money appropriated will be designated as an emergency.\n  I want to thank the staff who worked on this legislation. In my \noffice: Steve Bell, Denise Greenlaw Ramonas, Brian Benczkowski, James \nFuller and Veronica Rodriguez. From Senator Bingaman's office, Trudy \nVincent, Christine Landavazo, Sam Fowler and Bob Simon. I also want to \nthank Ann Bushmiller from the White House Counsel's office and \nElizabeth Gore from the Office of Management and Budget. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter from Jack Lew expressing the \nAdministration's support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2736\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

We are pleased that our work \n     together in a constructive dialogue has resulted in \n     legislation that will achieve this goal.\n       We are fully supportive of the Cerro Grande Fire Assistance \n     Act, which will help fully, fairly, and quickly compensate \n     those who have suffered losses as a result of this fire. We \n     urge Congress to move promptly to pass this essential \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jacob J.

A bill to amend the United States Grain Standards Act to \nextend the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to collect fees, \nextend the authorization of appropriations, and improve the \nadministration of that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n              the grain standards improvement act of 2000\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Grain \nStandards Improvement Act of 2000. I am pleased that the ranking \nminority member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, \nhas joined me as a cosponsor.\n  The United States Grain Standards Act was enacted in 1916 as a means \nof eliminating confusion resulting from the use of many different sets \nof grain standards applied by different grain inspection organizations \noperating without national coordination and supervision. Created by \nthis Act and operating within the United States Department of \nAgriculture (USDA), the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) sets \nand administers official grain standards and conducts grain inspection \nservices.\n  The Act authorizes FGIS to establish standards of ``kind, class, \nquality and condition for corn, wheat, rye, oats, barley, flax seed, \nsorghum, soybeans, mixed grain and such other grains as in the \nadministrator's judgment the usages of the trade may warrant and \npermit.'' The FGIS administrator is authorized to develop standards or \nprocedures for accurate weighing and weight certification and controls \nfor grain shipped in interstate or foreign commerce. The Act also \nestablished certain performance requirements for grain inspection and \nweighing equipment. The certainty of these standards and the \ncredibility and integrity of the inspection system has allowed our \ndomestic and international markets to flourish as a result.\n  But improvements are necessary to keep up with the changing markets. \nThe legislation that I am introducing today is based on legislation \nproposed by the Administration earlier this year. The Gain Standards \nImprovement Act of 2000 will reauthorize the collection of fees, the \nFGIS Advisory Committee, and funding for FGIS until September 30, 2005.\n  In order to keep up with advances in technology, FGIS needs \nflexibility in the way that commodity samples can be obtained. Grain \nmarketing patterns, quality attributes, and quality testing methods are \nchanging rapidly. New quality traits developed through biotechnology \nhave increased the speed of change. This Act will provide flexibility \nneeded by FGIS to continue to maintain an efficient sampling system.\n  In general, under current law, only one official federal inspection \nagency can operate within geographic boundaries. The 1993 amendments to \nthe Grain Standards Act provided for a pilot program that allowed for \nmore than one official inspection agency within a single geographic \narea at interior locations. These programs were successful in \nfacilitating the marketing of grain without jeopardizing the integrity \nof the system. This bill will permanently authorize this policy.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Association of State \nDepartments of Agriculture, the Association of American Warehouse \nControl Officials, the National Grain and Feed Association, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers Union and other \nagricultural commodity organizations.\n  The credibility and integrity of the United States grain inspection \nmust be maintained to allow U.S. producers to continue to feed the \nworld through our marketing system. The Grain Standards Improvement Act \nof 2000 will help FGIS to continue these high standards and increase \nthe economic efficiency of the U.S. grain marketing system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a section-\nby-section summary be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2737\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ADVISORY COMMITTEE.\n\n       Section 21(e) of the United States Grain Standards Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 87j(e)) is amended by striking ``2000'' and inserting \n     ``2005''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Grain Standards Improvement Act of 2000--Section-by-Section Summary\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       This Act may be cited as the Grain Standards Improvement \n     Act of 2000.\n     Section 2. Sampling for export grain\n       This section would provide FGIS with more flexibility in \n     obtaining samples of export grain. Currently, samples of \n     export grain can only be obtained after final elevation of \n     the grain. Historically, this has been a requirement due to \n     the breakage that can occur as the grain goes through an \n     export elevator. In many cases, this sampling procedure is \n     still appropriate. However, for value enhanced traits (e.g. \n     protein) that are not affected by handling, sampling and \n     testing prior to final elevation may be more appropriate. \n     Often it is not a simple process to perform these tests in a \n     field environment. Grain marketing patterns, quality \n     attributes, and quality testing methods are changing rapidly. \n     These changes are being expedited by quality traits developed \n     through biotechnology and new testing methods. In response to \n     these breakthroughs, new grain marketing programs are \n     evolving that require measurement of additional, more complex \n     quality attributes. Also, in order to maintain an efficient \n     and effective marketing system in the United States, grain \n     merchants are relying more on identity preserved programs to \n     assure acceptable quality with limited testing. These \n     merchants may need quality results on identity preserved \n     grain prior to final elevation. Flexibility in obtaining \n     samples would not jeopardize the representatives of the \n     samples obtained for inspection.\n     Section 3. Geographic boundaries for official agencies\n       This section would allow, under certain conditions, more \n     than one official agency to\n\n[[Page S5263]]\n\n     perform inspection and weighing services within a single \n     geographic area at interior locations. The 1993 amendments \n     provided for pilot programs to test such a change. These \n     programs were successful in that they facilitated the \n     marketing of grain without jeopardizing integrity of the \n     system. This section will give the Secretary the authority to \n     develop criteria similar to the current pilot programs.\n     Section 4. Authorization to collect fees\n       This section would extend, through fiscal year 2005, the \n     authority of the Secretary to charge user fees assessed for \n     the supervision of official agencies and to invest sums \n     collected.\n     Section 5. Testing of equipment\n       This section would eliminate the requirement for mandatory \n     annual testing for all equipment used in sampling, grading, \n     inspection, and weighing. Annual testing is not necessary or \n     appropriate for such equipment.\n     Section 6. Limitation on administration and supervisory costs\n       This section would provide that the administration and \n     supervisory costs for services, performed through fiscal year \n     2005, would be subject to the ceiling of 30 percent of total \n     costs for such services (excluding the costs of \n     standardization, compliance, and foreign monitoring \n     activities).\n     Section 7. Licenses and authorizations\n       This section would allow the Secretary to contract for \n     inspection and weighing services in addition to specified \n     sampling and technical functions. This allows the Secretary \n     greater flexibility in performing the duties required by the \n     Act.\n     Section 8. Grain additives\n       This section would prohibit disguising the quality of the \n     grain as a result of the introduction of nongrain substances \n     and other identified grains. The prohibition would include \n     the introduction of nongrain substances such as cinnamon, \n     vanilla, and bleach, and could apply to all grain whether \n     officially inspected or not. This prohibition will enhance \n     the integrity of the national grain marketing system.\n     Section 9. Authorization of appropriations\n       The section would extend, through fiscal year 2005, the \n     authorization for appropriations to cover standardization, \n     compliance, foreign monitoring activities and any other \n     expenses necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act \n     which are not obtained from fees and sales of samples.\n     Section 10. Advisory committee\n       This section would maintain an advisory committee through \n     fiscal year 2005. This committee represents the industry and \n     advises the Secretary in administering the Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 2738. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reduce \nmedical mistakes and medication-related errors; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n              the patient safety and errors reduction act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my good \nfriend Senator Frist to announce the introduction of the Patient Safety \nand Errors Reduction Act, a bill which will work toward increasing \npatient safety for all Americans.\n  Late last year, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report \nciting medical errors as the eighth leading cause of death in the \nUnited States, with as many as 98,000 people dying as a result each \nyear. More people die of medical mistakes than from motor vehicle \naccidents, AIDS, or breast cancer. The IOM report took a serious look \nat the problem of medical errors and provided some thoughtful \nrecommendations for change.\n  Last year I worked closely with Senator Frist to ensure that Congress \npass Senate Bill 580, the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999. \nThis newly passed legislation reauthorized by the Agency for Health \nCare Policy and Research, renamed it the Agency for Healthcare Research \nand Quality (AHRQ), and refocused its mission to support healthcare \nresearch on safety and quality improvement. I am pleased that AHRQ has \ndecided to dedicate more than $20 million for research on medical error \nreduction. This shows a real commitment by Dr. John Eisenberg and his \nagency to address the problem of medical errors.\n  Our bill will attack this problem in several ways. First, it will \nprovide a framework of support for the numerous efforts that are \nalready underway in the public and the private sectors. Second, it will \nestablish a Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety within \nthe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. And finally, it will \nprovide needed confidentiality protections for medical error reporting \nsystems.\n  I believe we can save thousands of lives by substantially reducing \nmedical mistakes over the next few years. We have a great opportunity \nto apply the safety lessons that we have already learned--both within \nhealth care and in other fields.\n  How can we prevent these mistakes? One lesson we have learned that \nwas repeated time and again in our hearings is that mandatory reporting \nof all errors and subsequent punishment of healthcare professionals \ndoesn't work very well.\n  Even good doctors and nurses make mistakes during the most routine of \ntasks. Clearly, the root cause of medical errors is more systemic. \nMedicine has some of the most advanced technology for treating patients \nand some of the most rudimentary systems for ensuring quality. Taking a \nlook at the systems that ensure patient safety will go farther in \naddressing the problem of medical errors rather than reprimanding any \none individual or group.\n  Over the past few decades we have seen one industry after another \nadopt the principles of continuous quality improvement. The government \nitself has instituted these principles, notably in its regulation of \naviation. Focusing on punishment will only deter improvement.\n  Having said that, we are not interested in sweeping problems under \nthe rug, but bringing them out into the open. And if an individual is \nharmed, this bill in no way limits the legal recourse that patients \nhave now. The confidentiality protections are just for information that \nis submitted under quality improvement and medical error reporting \nsystems. Patients and their lawyers will still have access to the \nentire medical record just like they do now.\n  Our bill also creates a new center for patient safety through AHRQ as \nthe IOM report recommended. This Center will collect information on \nmedical errors and serve as a center to develop strategies to reduce \nthem. It is likely that additional funding beyond the $20 million \nrecommended by the President will be needed for AHRQ's new role \noverseeing this center for patient safety.\n  We also need to allow for confidentiality--through peer review \nprotections--for information that is voluntarily submitted regarding \nmedical errors. This legislation provides for these protections.\n  Once the information is collected and analyzed, either through AHRQ \nor another deemed institution, such as the Vermont Program for Quality \nin Health Care, recommendations on ways to prevent errors need to be \ndeveloped and disseminated throughout the health care industry.\n  It is my hope that these recommendations will continue to be \nincorporated into survey instruments by organizations such as the Joint \nCommission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the \naccrediting body responsible for hospitals and other inpatient \nhealthcare settings. In this way, the health care industry can engage \nin the kind of continuous quality improvement that is vital to curbing \nerrors and saving lives. But a medical errors program will only succeed \nif hospitals, doctors and other health professionals support it and \nparticipate in it willingly.\n  Neither the IOM nor Congress discovered this problem. Health care \nprofessionals have been at work for some time in trying to address \nmedical errors. I hope that by becoming a partner in this process, the \nfederal government can accelerate the pace of reform and provide the \nmost effective structure possible.\n  I am pleased that our legislation has the support of many, including \nthe United States Pharmacopeia, the American Hospital Association, the \nAmerican Health Quality Association, the American College of \nPhysicians/American Society of Internal Medicine, the American \nPsychological Association, and the Institute for Safe Medication \nPractices.\n  Mr. President, we cannot afford to wait on this issue. This \nlegislation will raise the quality of health care delivered by \ndecreasing medical errors and increasing patient safety and I will work \nto ensure its enactment this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Moynihan,\n\n[[Page S5264]]\n\n        Mr. Roth, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2739. A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, to provide for \nthe issuance of a semipostal stamp in order to afford the public a \nconvenient way to contribute to funding for the establishment of the \nWorld War II Memorial; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n  semipostal stamp for the establishment of the world war ii memorial\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 2749, the \nWorld War II Memorial Postage Stamp Act. The purpose of this bill is to \nraise funds for the construction of the National World War II Memorial \nby issuing a special World War II Memorial ``semipostal'' stamp.\n  Mr. President, many events have shaped world history, but none so \ndramatically or so deeply as the Second World War. The war permanently \naltered lives, communities, and nations, at the same time speeding \nAmerica's rise as a superpower.\n  The National World War II Memorial will honor the 16 million \nAmericans who served in uniform during the war, the more than 400,000 \nwho gave their lives, and the millions more who supported the war \neffort at home. A symbol of the defining event of 20th-century America, \nthe Memorial will honor the spirit, sacrifice, and commitment of the \nAmerican people as well as the cause of freedoom from tyranny \nthroughout the world.\n  To date, the World War II Memorial Fund, chaired by Bob Dole, has \nraised approximately $92 million. Issuing a World War II Memorial Stamp \ncould raise millions more, helping the World War Memorial Fund reach \nits goal of $100 million needed to construct and maintain the Memorial. \nFurthermore, a new stamp would give every American the chance to play a \npart in building this monument to those who served our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I served this great country as a member of the Armed \nForces during World War II, and I know firsthand the sacrifices made by \nour Nation's veterans. It is my sincere hope that, thanks to this bill, \nthe National World War II Memorial will be a lasting symbol of American \nunity--and a timeless reminder of the moral strength that joins the \ncitizens of this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the legislation was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2739\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the establishment of Individual \nDevelopment Accounts (IDAs) that will allow individuals and families \nwith limited means an opportunity to accumulate assets, to access \neducation, to own their own homes and businesses, and ultimately to \nachieve economic self-sufficiency, and to increase the limit on \ndeductible IRA contributions, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n       the savings accounts are valuable for everyone act of 2000\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few moments this \nmorning and introduce a bill that I am calling the Savings Are Valuable \nfor Everyone Act, the SAVE Act of 2000.\n  Mr. President, as of February 1, 2000, the United States officially \nentered into the longest period of economic expansion in our history. \nThis means we have had nine years of continuous growth--a hard-earned \nachievement. During this time, we have had the first back-to-back \nfederal budget surpluses in 43 years, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 \nyears, and 20 million new jobs for people across America.\n  Clearly we are doing something right. However, that does not mean our \nwork is done. In order for this economic prosperity to reach its full \npotential, we must continue to provide more opportunities (not \nguarantees) to widen the ``winners' circle'' and allow all Americans to \nparticipate in our economic expansion.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the latest unemployment \nfigures show that most Americans do have jobs. The unemployment average \nis 4.1 percent and many states have even lower rates, such as Iowa with \n2.5 percent, New Hampshire with 2.7 percent, and Virginia with 2.8 \npercent. In some places across the country, there are some even higher \nspots, such as Howard County, Maryland, where the unemployment rate is \na remarkable 1.4 percent. However, because of the high cost of living, \nmany working families\n\n[[Page S5265]]\n\nstill struggle to make ends meet and are being forced to live from \npaycheck to paycheck, without any hope of saving for the future or \nbuilding the tangible assets which are so important to upward mobility.\n  I recently finished reading the book, ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' \nand discovered that when the authors of this book began interviewing \nmillionaires as part of their research, they were surprised to find \nmost of the wealthy people they spoke with didn't drive fancy sports \ncars, or have $5,000 gold watches or even live in fabulous mansions. \nThey were first-generation business people who, through aggressive \nsaving, sensible investing and frugal spending, had managed to \naccumulate a significant amount of assets.\n  While not everyone's goal in life is to become a millionaire, this \nbook does carefully outline the road to fiscal security and clearly \ndocuments the importance of saving.\n  I know that you will be as shocked as I was to learn that, while the \nnet worth of the typical American family has increased dramatically \nrecently, the net worth of families under $25,000 has actually been \ndecreasing. The Federal Reserve Board recently released a study which \nshowed that families earning under $10,000 a year had a medium net \nworth of $1,900 in 1989. This figure rose to $4,800 in 1995 but slipped \nto $3,600 by 1998. The net worth of families who earn less than $25,000 \nannually was $31,000 in 1995 but then dropped to $24,800 in 1998.\n  During this same time period, while the number of families who owned \na home or business rose overall, this figure among lower income \nfamilies has actually decreased. In 1995, 36.1 percent of families who \nearned less than $10,000 a year owned a home, however by 1998 this \nnumber had decreased to 34.5 percent. In 1995, 54.9 percent of families \nwho earn less than $25,000 annually owned their home but in 1998 this \npercentage was reduced to 51.7 percent.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to address this problem by introducing \nthe Savings Are Valuable for Everyone Act of 2000, or SAVE, which will \nhelp all families save for the future. The goal of SAVE is simple: help \nthe working poor build assets for themselves and to expand the IRA \nlimit to ensure retirement savings. The goal is not income \nredistribution, but instead it is to find ways that allow opportunities \nfor everyone, regardless of income, to build the productive assets that \nlead to economic security.\n  In order to help the working poor break the discouraging cycle of \nliving from paycheck to paycheck and to help the lower-middle class \nmove up the income ladder and save for the future, this measure \nprovides incentives for the accumulation of assets through the use of \nIndividual Development Accounts, or IDAs, while, at the same time, \nmaking it easier for the rest of America to save for retirement.\n  IDAs are matched savings accounts which are restricted to three uses: \n(1) post-secondary education/training; (2) small business start-up \ncosts; and (3) purchasing a first home. Private as well as state and \nlocal public sector funds can also be contributed to the account with a \nspecial tax credit of up to $500 a year attached to the private \ncontribution. Usually it takes two to four years for the account holder \nto accumulate enough funds to purchase the asset they were saving for \nand, before the money is released, they must complete an approved \nfinancial education course which is provided by the qualified financial \ninstitution or non-profit which holds the account.\n  All IDAs must be held at a ``qualified financial institutions,'' \nmeaning, any financial institution qualified to hold an IRA. IDAs are \navailable to all citizens or legal residents of the United States who \nare at least 18 years old and whose household income does not exceed 80 \npercent of the area median income, or AMI. At least 33 percent of the \nIDAs will be targeted to households which are at 50 percent or below \nthe AMI. Contributions made by a participant into an IDA are limited to \n$2,000 per year. While the individuals who open these accounts are \nencouraged to use the money for their own benefit, they may withdraw it \nto help a spouse or dependent open a business, buy a house, or further \ntheir education.\n  For example, one such program was started in March of 1999, by \nHibernia Bank Louisiana. They began pilot IDA programs in New Orleans, \nwith another one operating in Shreveport, to help low-income families \nsave for a house. So far, 11 families are participating in the New \nOrleans program, with seven already placed in homes of their own and \nfour shopping for one.\n  The program administrator said these 11 families ``absolutely would \nnot be in a position to buy a home at this time'' without this program. \nHibernia matches the account holders funds two-to-one up to a set \namount. The funds then can be used for home-buying costs, such as a \ndown payment or closing costs--lump sums that often can be prohibitive \nto working families on a tight budget.\n  In order to encourage the establishment of IDAs, two tax credits are \noffered. The first is available to participating financial \ninstitutions. For every dollar saved in an IDA, the qualified financial \ninstitution will provide a one to one match, limited to $500 per person \nper year. The financial institution would then be eligible for a 90 \npercent federal tax credit for matching funds provided.\n  The second tax credit is known as the IDA Investment Tax Credit. In \norder to leverage private sector investments and encourage broader \ncommunity involvement in this program, a 50 percent tax credit will be \navailable for investments in qualified non-profits, 501(c)(3)s or \ncredit unions, which can administer qualified IDA programs. However, in \norder qualify for this tax credit, at least 70 percent of the funds \nreceived must be used for financial education, program monitoring, and/\nor program administration. Any taxpayer can participate can participate \nas a donor.\n  It is important to remember that each IDA consists of two parallel \naccounts--one that the participants make his deposits into and one that \nthe donor makes their deposits of matching funds into. The interest \non the money in the participant's account would be taxed while all \nfunds in the matching account (including interest) would be tax free. \nOne could say that the participant's account is treated in a similar \nfashion to the way that the IRS treats IRAs and 401(k)s.\n\n  Already an estimated 3,000 people nationwide are taking advantage of \navailable pilot programs, which are run in partnership with more than \n100 nonprofit organizations and authorized financial institutions. This \nfact shows the strength of this plan: it serves as a catalyst for the \nrapid creation of public-private partnerships--between accountholders, \nbanks, foundations, policymakers and providers of financial education--\nthat are the hallmark of successful IDA programs.\n  As you can see, IDAs are not only good for individuals and their \nfamilies, they also are good for the future of our country. Russell \nLong once said, ``The problem with Capitalism is that there are not \nenough Capitalists.'' IDAs provide a tool with which our country can \naddress this age-old problem and help create more Capitalists. When \ncapitalism is combined with the proper social safety nets and \nincentives for asset development for those at all income levels, we \ncreate incentives for saving at all levels while you create a \ncapitalist system that works for everybody. These accounts are a sure-\nfire mechanism that will build assets and create wealth among the \nfamilies and communities who need help the most.\n  Economic analyses of the impact of a national IDA investment show \nthat for every dollar invested, a $5 return to the national economy \nwould result in the form of new businesses, new jobs, increased \nearnings, higher tax receipts and reduced welfare expenditures. \nHowever, it is important to realize that the Savings Accounts Are \nValuable for Everyone Act does not simply focus on the working poor. It \nalso provides savings incentives for the middle class by expanding the \ncurrent Individual Retirement Account limits from $2,000 a year to \n$3,500.\n  Currently, our tax code allows individuals to save up to $2,000 a \nyear in IRAs with income earned on the deposits either being tax \ndeferred until withdrawal, which can begin at age 59\\1/2\\, or, through \nthe use of the Roth IRA, the taxes can be paid up front on the money \ndeposited into the accounts. SAVE will make these accounts an even \nbetter tool for retirement saving by expanding the annual contribution \nlimits.\n  I firmly believe that we must find ways to shift our nation's policy \nfrom\n\n[[Page S5266]]\n\none of consumption to one of savings and wealth accumulation for all \nAmerican households. To understand why, one need only consider these \nfacts which were calculated by the Corporation for Enterprise \nDevelopment in Washington, D.C.:\n  One-half of all American households have less than $1,000 in net \nfinancial assets;\n  One-third of all American households and 60 percent of African-\nAmerican households have zero or negative net financial assets;\n  Forty percent of all white children and 73 percent of all black \nchildren grow up in households with zero or negative financial assets;\n  By some estimates, 13-20 percent of all American households do not \neven have a checking or savings account; and\n  Ten percent of all American households control two-thirds of the \nwealth.\n  We already have a tax code that provides over $300 billion in federal \ntax expenditures which are dedicated to asset building for middle- and \nupper-income wage earners and businesses, but tax-based incentives are \nstill out of reach for most lower- and middle-income families. In this \ntime of wealth and prosperity, why can't we offer tools that will \nassist in asset building for the families who need them the most--the \nworking poor and moderate-income families who make up the backbone of \nour economic system.\n  Benjamin Franklin once said, ``The wealth of an individual is \nmeasured not by what a person earns but by what he saves.''\n  Take the example of Oseola McCarty of Mississippi. Oseola toiled in \nobscurity for most of her life, taking in other people's laundry for $2 \na bundle and amassing a small fortune by socking away every extra cent \nin a savings account. At the age of 87, she donated $150,000 of her \nlife savings to the University of Southern Mississippi, establishing a \nscholarship fund to give African-American youths a chance for the \neducation she never received.\n  What Oseola accomplished is a great example of the power of savings. \nSavings, investing and assets--not necessarily income--determine \nwealth. Just think what Oseola could have accomplished, not only for \nherself but for others, with the benefit of a program like IDAs to add \nmatching funds and additional interest to her hard-earned savings.\n  IDAs are partnerships between the government, the community and the \nindividual to build stronger families and a stronger economy. For not \nonly do Americans improve their economic security through the building \nof assets, this also stimulates the development of capital for the \nentire nation. As our nation continues to build on our recent economic \nsuccesses, we in Congress must continue to look for innovative ways to \ngive working families the tools they need to plan for the future. \nPassage of the Savings Accounts are Valuable for Everyone Act is one \nway we can do this.\n  Mr. President, to summarize my comments, I will share a story about \nwhat this act, if passed and adopted, will do. There is a family in \nWashington, the Darden family. Selena and Dwayne Darden thought they \nwere doing the best they could do. They were both working, earning \nabout 150 percent of the poverty rate. They had four children and were \ndoing a very good job of raising their children, but basically living \npaycheck to paycheck. They never thought they could save for the future \nor, for that matter, own a home. There just wasn't anything extra.\n  Then just about 2 years ago, according to this article, Selena, who \nis a beautician, heard about something called Individual Development \nAccounts, a program that was offered here in Washington with the \nCapital Area Asset Building Corporation. They inquired and were told \nbasically that this was a pilot program that Congress had established a \nfew years earlier that would allow her and her husband to put up some \nsavings, which would be matched by the Federal Government through an \nappropriate financial institution and a community agency that would \nprovide some education and support for the effort. If she was a \nconsistent and good saver, she and her husband could save enough for a \ndownpayment. The end of the story is that they did; they saved enough. \nThey are now proud homeowners right here in Marshall Heights.\n  I share that story because that is exactly what this bill does. In my \nState, in the last few years, I have come to learn about these pilot \nprograms that we initiated through the work of Senator Coats, and \nSenator Santorum has been on this issue for some time, and Senator \nLieberman has been advocating this proposal. I want to add my voice by \nintroducing this bill to say how much I support this effort, and to \ntake these pilot programs that have been successful and expand them \nnationwide.\n  In Louisiana, I have come across many families from New Orleans to \nShreveport, and elsewhere, who are coming into partnership with the \nHibernia Bank and community action organizations, such as the \nProvidence House in Louisiana, that help families get back on their \nfeet when they go through a crisis. The idea is to help create these \naccounts. People can begin saving money.\n  The bill allows for them to either use the funds for home ownership, \nbecause we know how important that is, or building a person's \nconfidence and self-esteem--how important it is for children to live in \na home that actually belongs to them, as opposed to renting and perhaps \nhaving to move, and to be able to put down roots. We know how important \nthat is.\n  This bill will allow people to save to start up a business. We spend \na lot of time in Washington talking about business. Sometimes I think \nwe focus on businesses that are actually quite large, which is \nwonderful; but we need to focus on the great strength of America, which \nis small business--that entrepreneur out there who takes a risk to \nstart a business. He employs himself and one, two, or three other \npeople. That is the backbone of the American economy and the great \nsystem we have enjoyed. We are really the envy of the world. This bill \nwill allow for people to save a few thousand dollars to start a \nsuccessful business and employ members of their family, or friends, or \nother workers in their area.\n  I am hoping we can potentially consider, as this bill moves through \nthe process, that it may allow savings for a transportation vehicle. If \nyou can get a good job, sometimes the jobs are not necessarily where \npeople live. Mass transit is not as dependable as it should be. Perhaps \nwe should consider this matched savings plan to give people the ability \nto get a vehicle and to be able to drive to work. Some of these pilots \nallow that.\n  This bill will allow for these savings accounts. It is limited to \nhouseholds of 80 percent of the median income, based on regions, and \n150 percent of the national poverty rate. While that might work for \nLouisiana, it doesn't work very well for poor families in Connecticut \nor California, where the standard of living is high.\n  We have designed this bill to reach to the low-income working poor. \nBut we are sensitive to the different regions in this Nation. We \nbelieve if we can help people accumulate assets and encourage them to \nsave, that not only is it good for individual families but it is good \nfor our Nation to encourage savings rates.\n  Let me share a few statistics about this which are of very great \nconcern to me and of which I would like my colleagues to be more aware.\n  According to a recent report by the Corporation for Enterprise \nDevelopment in Washington, DC, one-half of all American households have \nless than $1,000 in financial assets; one-third of all American \nhouseholds and 60 percent of African American households have zero, or \nnegative financial assets; 40 percent of all white children and 73 \npercent of all African American children grow up in households with \nzero or negative financial assets; by some estimates, 13 to 20 percent \nof all American households do not have a checking or a savings account; \nand 10 percent of all American households control currently two-thirds \nof the wealth.\n  If we want to address an income gap, if we want to try to increase \nprosperity, if we want to try to eliminate poverty, I suggest that our \nefforts have to be more than just income, more than just about full \nemployment or a job. It is about income, frugal spending, and \naggressive savings. And we\n\n[[Page S5267]]\n\nshould be partnering with the American people to do just that, to \nencourage wealth and assets creation and development.\n  Not everyone wants to be a millionaire. Some people are better at \nthat than others. But I don't know of a family that doesn't want to \nhave financial security--not one. Whether they work at a relatively \nmodest job from 9 to 5, or whether they work two jobs, or three, or \nwhether they are quite aggressive and well educated enough to make \nlarge sums of money, in every case I think it is about security. It is \nabout choices. But I don't know any family that doesn't want to be \nsecure. We can be better partners in this Government by encouraging \npolicies such as this that enable people to be part of that American \ndream, to widen the winners circle, because we have the greatest \neconomic expansion underway and there is a cost-effective way to do it.\n  Let me just make a couple of other points as I close.\n  According to some documents that are supporting this policy, let me \nread for the Record a couple of things:\n  No. 1, assets matter and have largely been ignored in poverty policy \ndebates.\n  No. 2, individual development accounts address the wealth gap and \nbring people into the financial mainstream.\n  No. 3, public policy plays a large role in determining levels of \nhousehold wealth.\n  People say, We can't afford to do this. They ask, Why would we want \nto do this for a certain group of people, low- and moderate-income \npeople? One reason is we already do it to the tune of $300 billion for \nmiddle-income and wealthy individuals and businesses. It is called tax \nincentives. All throughout our Tax Code and public policy, we are \nalready putting up $300 billion to help create and maintain assets for \nthe wealthy and for businesses. Let's do the same for the working poor \nand lower and middle class so they can be more able to join this \nextraordinary economic expansion. We do that through IRAs and 401(k)s \nand IDAs, which are good national investments and they improve the \nnational savings rate.\n  In conclusion, let me say that this SAVE Act will expand IDA. It also \nraises the income limits for IRAs for all families in America to \nencourage them to save. By expanding the opportunities for IRAs, which \nmany of us have supported in a bipartisan way, and by implementing IDAs \nfrom pilots to a national model, I believe we could go a long way in \neliminating poverty, expanding the middle class, and expanding and \nwidening the winners circle in this great economic expansion.\n  I share this with my colleagues. I thank again Senator Lieberman for \nhis great work. Senator Santorum has also been leading this effort. \nSenator Dan Coats, who is no longer serving with us, I understand was \none of the original sponsors of this pilot program. It is now time. We \nknow it works to take it national. That is what we do with this bill.\n  I yield whatever time I may have.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert additional material \ninto the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          IDAs: Federal Policy\n\n       The benefits and rationale for enacting federal IDA policy \n     can be summarized in five parts:\n       1. Assets matter, and have been largely ignored in poverty \n     policy. Assets provide an economic cushion and enable people \n     to make investments in their futures in a way that income \n     alone cannot provide. IDAs address a big piece of the poverty \n     puzzle--the savings and asset base of the poor--that has \n     never been addressed before.\n       2. IDAs address the wealth gap and bring people into the \n     financial mainstream. Despite the growing trend of average \n     Americans investing in stocks and mutual funds, many are \n     being left behind. One-third of all American households have \n     zero or negative net financial assets, and up to 20 percent \n     of all households do not even have a checking or savings \n     account.\n       3. Public policy plays a large role in determining levels \n     of household wealth.--Nearly $300 billion in federal tax \n     expenditures are dedicated to asset building for middle- and \n     upper-income people (for home ownership, retirement, and \n     investing). But public policies often penalize low-income \n     people or put tax-based asset incentives out of their reach.\n       4. Individual asset accounts (like IDAs) are the future of \n     asset building. Increasingly, asset accounts such as IRA's, \n     401(k)s, medical savings accounts, individual training \n     accounts and other individual savings incentives are the \n     emerging tools for wealth-building policy in the new global, \n     flexible economy. IDAs are an inclusive extension of this \n     policy trend.\n       5. IDAs are a good national investment and improve the \n     national savings rate. Economic analyses of the impact of a \n     national IDA investment show that for every dollar invested, \n     a five dollar return to the national economy would result in \n     the form of new businesses, new jobs, increased earnings, \n     higher tax receipts, and reduced welfare expenditures. At the \n     same time, IDAs will increase core deposits at a time when \n     many Americans are moving to other investment vehicles. And, \n     importantly, IDAs help address the growing problem of the \n     declining national personal savings rate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dorgan, \n        Mr. Roberts, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. \n        Craig):\n  S. 2741. A bill to amend the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 to \nextend the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to provide grants \nfor State mediation programs dealing with agricultural issues, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n               mediation program legislation introduction\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr President, I rise on the floor of the Senate today to \nintroduce bipartisan legislation to extend a popular program which \nprovides mediation services between agricultural producers and the \nvarious credit and United States Department of Agriculture agencies who \nfamily farmers and ranchers work with to maintain their operations.\n  During the 1980's farm crisis, Congress authorized federal \nparticipation in a state farm mediation program. Originally authorized \nin the Agriculture Credit Act of 1987, mediation programs help \nagricultural producers and their creditors to resolve credit disputes \n(and other types of disputes) in a confidential and non-adversarial \nsetting which is outside the traditional process of litigation, \nappeals, bankruptcy, and foreclosure.\n  The mediators are neutral facilitators and they do not make decisions \nfor the disputing parties.\n  Federal legislation has encouraged state involvement by providing \nmatching grant funds to the states that participate in the mediation \nprogram. Currently, 24 states participate, including Alabama, Arkansas, \nArizona, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, \nMinnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, \nOklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and \nWyoming.\n  Beyond the scope of agricultural credit-related mediation, the \nprogram aims to resolve disputes such as wetland determinations, \ngrazing issues, and USDA program compliance, and other issues the \nSecretary of Agriculture deems appropriate.\n  Each year, Congress seeks to provide funding for the mediation \nprogram through the Agriculture Appropriations process. This year $3 \nmillion has been appropriated for this program in both the House and \nSenate Agriculture Appropriation bills. This legislation will not \nchange the fact that Congress must go through the Appropriations \nprocess each year to secure funding for this program.\n  The legislation my colleagues and I are introducing today \nreauthorizes the mediation program by eliminating the sunset clause \n(set to expire in FY 2000), clarifies that funds appropriated by \nCongress to the mediation program must be used for farm credit cases \n(including USDA direct and guaranteed loans and loans from commercial \nentities) and may be used for other USDA program disputes, and \nclarifies that mediation services can include counseling services to \nprepare parties to a dispute prior to mediation.\n  In a time when family farmers and ranchers continue to deal with low \nprices and suffer under more and more vertical integration, I believe \nwe must begin to reflect on what we can do to maintain the independent \nfamily farms and ranches that our country depends on for our food \nsupply. We live in a day and age where nearly every farm and ranch \noperation must secure credit in order to pay production expenditures \nnecessary to stay in business. This mediation program is supported by \nboth\n\n[[Page S5268]]\n\nsides of the aisle and allows farmers and ranchers to settle their \ncredit and farm program disputes in a fair way without digging \nthemselves into legal debt.\n  I have worked with the lone Congressman from my home state of South \nDakota in drafting this legislation and the same bill will be \nintroduced in the House of Representatives today as well.\n  I urge my colleagues of the Senate to join me in supporting this bi-\npartisan legislation with the goal of moving it through the legislative \nprocess quickly in order to continue to provide these services to our \nAmerican farmers and ranchers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself, Mr Abraham, Mr. Ashcroft, \n        Mr. Burns, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Gorton, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Allard, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        Thomas, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Mack, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n        Lott, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 2742. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease disclosure for certain political organizations exempt from tax \nunder section 527 and section 501(c), and for other purposes; read the \nfirst time.\n\n\n            tax-exempt political disclosure act introduction\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation, co-sponsored by 20 of my Senate colleagues, to bring \nsunshine to our campaign finance laws, to provide for full disclosure \nof contributions and expenditures of groups which have heretofore not \nbeen held accountable, yet have been subsidized by the American people \nthrough their tax-exempt status.\n  Joining me in this effort are Senators Abraham, Ashcroft, Burns, \nSantorum, Gorton, Hutchison, Allard, Bennett, Coverdell, Gregg, Helms, \nThomas, Inhofe, Mack, Warner, Bunning, Lott, McConnell, Crapo, and \nRoberts.\n  I have long been a proponent of full disclosure, to the extent it is \nconsistent with the First Amendment, of campaign contributions and \nexpenditures.\n  If we are to rekindle the trust of the American people, not only must \nthe political parties be held accountable, so, too, must those tax-\nexempt groups which engage in political activities, yet heretofore have \noperated outside the realm of disclosure. The public has the right to \nknow the identity of those trying to influence our elections, and \nCongress must do whatever it can to make sure that organizations do not \nwrongly benefit from the public subsidy of tax exemption.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the Tax-Exempt Political \nDisclosure Act, expands upon the McCain-Lieberman amendment of last \nweek which targeted a narrow list of tax-exempt organizations \nestablished under section 527 of the tax code. The so-called 527 groups \ncovered in this bill do not make contributions to candidates or engage \nin express advocacy, and thus are not required to publicly disclose \ncontributors or expenditures. Our bill contains in its entirety the \nprovisions of the McCain-Lieberman amendment, but goes beyond the 527 \ngroups to require tax-exempt labor and business organizations, as well, \nto disclose their contributors and expenditures.\n\n  Specifically, in Title I of our bill, which is identical to the \nMcCain-Lieberman amendment, we require the subset of 527 organizations \nthat are not already subject to the Federal Election Campaign Act to:\n  1. Disclose their existence to the IRS;\n  2. File publicly available tax returns;\n  3. Publicly report expenditures of over $500; and\n  4. Identify those who contribute more than $200 annually to the \norganization.\n  Title II of our bill applies to business or labor organizations that \nare tax-exempt under sections 501(c)(5) or 501(c)(6) of the Internal \nRevenue Code and that spend $25,000 or more on the very same kinds of \npolitical activities engaged in by section 527 organizations covered by \nTitle I of our bill. As we do with the 527 organizations, we require \ntax-exempt business and labor organizations to report expenditures for \npolitical activity of $500 or more and identify those who contribute \nmore than $200 annually.\n  Importantly, this legislation will not result in disclosure of any \nlabor or business organization's membership lists because annual dues \nto these tax-exempt groups are excluded from the definition of \n``contribution.'' The bill requires disclosure only of those members \nwho choose to contribute more than $200 annually for political \npurposes.\n  If the Senate is for disclosure of the few tax-exempt 527 \norganizations that may spend a couple of million dollars on issue ads, \nthen surely we should advocate disclosure of the tax-exempt labor and \nbusiness organizations that will spend twenty or forty times that \namount of money on issue ads and other political activity. Our \nlegislation will require these organizations receiving tax exempt \nstatus to emerge from the shadows and make some minimal disclosure \nabout themselves and the source of their money.\n  Tax exemption is not an entitlement, and any organization wanting to \navoid the ramifications of claiming such status simply may choose not \nto seek that status. Our bill merely says that if a group engaging in \npolitical activity wants tax exempt status, the public has a right to \nexpect certain things in return.\n  Let me make clear that we are sincere in this effort, and we welcome \nand invite Senators McCain and Feingold to work with us. We are open to \ndiscussions with business and labor groups, as well, on the mechanics \nof the bill. We want to be flexible and will consider changes where \nappropriate.\n  The bottom line, however, is that in the end there must be meaningful \ndisclosure if we are to have the confidence of the American people and \nbring integrity to the process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2743. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to develop an \ninfrastructure for creating a national voluntary reporting system to \ncontinually reduce medical errors and improve patient safety to ensure \nthat individuals receive high quality health care; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n  THE VOLUNTARY ERROR REDUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT IN PATIENT SAFETY ACT\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, between 44,000 and 98,000 patients \ndie each year from medical errors, making it the eighth leading cause \nof death in the United States. Each day, more than 250 people die \nbecause of medical errors--the equivalent of a major airplane crash \nevery day. Estimates of the annual financial cost of preventable errors \nrun as high as $29 billion a year. We can do better for our citizens. \nWe must do better.\n  The Voluntary Error Reduction and Improvement in Patient Safety Act \nof 2000, which Senator Dodd and I are introducing today, will provide \nthe federal investment and framework necessary to take the first steps \nto effectively treat this continuing epidemic of medical errors. Today, \nthere errors are a stealth plague hidden deep within the world's best \nhealth care system. This legislation will support needed research in \nthis area, and identify and reduce common mistakes.\n  Reducing medical errors can save lives and health care dollars, and \navoid countless family tragedies. The field of anesthesia had the \nforesight to undertake such an effort almost 20 years ago, and today, \nthe number of fatalities from errors in administering anesthesia has \ndropped by 98 percent. Our goal should be to achieve equal or even \ngreater success in reducing other types of medical mistakes. This \nlegislation lays the foundation to achieve this goal.\n  The 1999 Institute of Medicine report, To Err is Human, documented \nthe compelling need for aggressive national action on the issue. The \nIOM report recommended the creation of two reporting systems, each with \ndifferent goals. The first is a voluntary confidential reporting system \nto learn about medical errors and help researchers develop solutions \nfor future error prevention and reduction. The second is a mandatory \npublic reporting system for certain serious errors and deaths in order \nto inform the public and hold health care facilities responsible for \ntheir mistakes.\n  Our legislation today deals with the first issue, but the second \nissue is also critical. I believe that the public has a right-to-know \nabout certain serious events, and public disclosure is an important \ntool to assure that institutions\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\nput safety on the front burner, not the back burner.\n  I commend the Administration for recognizing the value of mandatory \nreporting by recently establishing such programs in the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and Department of Defense health care systems. The \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality is also in the process of \nevaluating existing mandatory reporting systems, and the Health Care \nFinancing Administration is planning to sponsor a mandatory reporting \ndemonstration project for selected private hospitals. I believe our \nnext step should be to move ahead with mandatory reporting, and the \nresults of these studies will shed needed light on the effectiveness of \ndifferent options.\n\n  The bill we introduce today would take a significant first step \ntoward implementing and providing support for the recommendations in \nthe IOM report.\n  The overwhelming majority of errors are caused by flaws in the health \ncare system, not the outright negligence of individual doctors and \nnurses. Our hospitals, doctors, nurses, and other health care providers \nwant to do the right thing. Our proposal gives the health care \ncommunity the tools to identify the causes of medical errors, the \nresources to develop strategies to prevent them, and the encouragement \nto implement those solutions.\n  First, the Act creates a new patient safety center in the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality. The Center for Quality Improvement and \nPatient Safety will improve and promote patient safety by conducting \nand supporting research on medical errors, administering the national \nmedical error reporting systems created under this bill, and \ndisseminating evidence-based practices and other error reduction and \nprevention strategies to health care providers, purchasers and the \npublic.\n  Second, the legislation would establish national voluntary reporting \nand surveillance systems under AHRQ to identify, track, prevent and \nreduce medical errors. The National Patient Safety Reporting System \nwill allow health care professionals, health care facilities, and \npatients to voluntarily report adverse events and close calls. The \nNational Patient Safety Surveillance System would establish a \nsurveillance system, which is modeled on a successful CDC initiative \nthat tracks hospital-acquired infections, for health care facilities \nthat choose to participate. Participating facilities will include a \nrepresentative sample of various institutions, which will monitor, \nanalyze, and report selected adverse events and close calls. \nResearchers will provide feedback to the participating facilities.\n  Reports submitted to both programs will be analyzed to identify \nsystemic faults that led to the errors, and recommend solutions to \nprevent similar errors in the future.\n  In order to encourage participation, reports and analyses from both \nprograms will be protected from discovery, and health care workers who \nsubmit reports to the programs will be protected against workplace \nretaliation based on their participation in the reporting systems.\n  In exchange for establishing this reporting system, health care \nfacilities and professionals would be expected to voluntarily implement \nappropriate patient safety solutions as they are developed. In \naddition, in recognition of the significant federal investments in \nerror reduction strategies and the provision of health services, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services will be required to develop a \nprocess for determining which evidence-based practices should be \napplied to programs under the Secretary's authority. The Secretary will \ntake appropriate, reasonable steps to assure implementation of these \npractices.\n  Our proposal also requires the Director of the Office of Personnel \nManagement to develop a similar process for determining which evidence-\nbased practices should be used as purchasing standards for the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program. Plans will also be rated on how well \nthey met these standards, and compliance ratings will be provided to \nfederal employees and retirees during the annual enrollment period.\n  The bill authorizes $50,000,000 for the Agency for Healthcare \nResearch and Quality for FY 2001, increasing to $200,000,000 in FY \n2005, to fund error-related research and the reporting systems.\n  Systemic errors in the health care system put every patient at risk \nof injury. The measure we propose today is designed to reduce that risk \nas much as possible. Americans deserve the highest quality health care. \nThis bill will raise patient safety to a high national priority, and \nensure that patient safety becomes part of every citizen's expectation \nof high quality health care. This is essential legislation, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to expedite its passage and to \ndevelop companion legislation that establishes a mandatory reporting \nsystem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following summary, fact sheet, and \nletters of support be inserted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Voluntary Error Reduction and Improvement in Patient Safety Act of \n                             2000: Summary\n\n       According to the November 1999 Institute of Medicine \n     report, ``To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System,'' \n     between 44,000 and 98,000 patients die each year as a result \n     of mistakes. Estimates of total annual national costs for \n     preventable errors range from $17 to $29 billion. This \n     legislation amends the Public Health Service Act to establish \n     a national non-punitive system to prevent and reduce medical \n     errors. Provisions are designed to: (1) identify and \n     investigate certain medical errors; (2) develop and \n     disseminate best practices to prevent and reduce medical \n     errors; and (3) assure implementation of evidence-based error \n     reduction strategies.\n\n\n                       CENTER FOR PATIENT SAFETY\n\n       Authorizes the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \n     (AHRQ) to: (1) create a Center for Quality Improvement and \n     Patient Safety to promote patient safety; (2) serve as a \n     central publicly accessible clearinghouse for information \n     concerning patient safety; (3) administer the reporting \n     systems created under this legislation; (4) conduct and fund \n     research on the causes of and best practices to reduce \n     medical errors; and (5) disseminate evidence-based \n     information to guide in the development and continuous \n     improvement of best practices.\n\n\n                           REPORTING SYSTEMS\n\n       Creates two national voluntary, and confidential reporting \n     systems under AHRQ: (1) a reporting system of adverse events \n     and close calls that uses uniform reporting standards and \n     forms; and (2) a surveillance system in which participating \n     health care facilities agree to monitor, analyze, and report \n     specified adverse events and close calls that occur in their \n     institutions. Reports submitted to both programs will be \n     protected from discovery, and analyzed to identify errors \n     that result from faults in the health care system. Neither \n     program will preempt existing nor preclude the later \n     development of new reporting systems.\n       Health care professionals who submit reports to the \n     reporting systems, their employer, or an appropriate \n     regulatory agency or private accrediting body may not be \n     discriminated against in their employment for reporting.\n\n\n                          AUTHORIZATION LEVELS\n\n       Authorizes $50,000,000 for AHRQ for fiscal year 2001, with \n     gradual increases to $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, to \n     fund error-related research and the reporting systems.\n\n\n                    APPLICATION TO FEDERAL PROGRAMS\n\n       Requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services to: (1) develop a process for determining \n     which evidence-based best practices disseminated by AHRQ \n     should be applied to programs under the Secretary's \n     authority; and (2) take reasonable steps as may be \n     appropriate to bring about the implementation of such \n     practices. Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management to develop a process for determining which \n     evidence-based best practices disseminated by AHRQ should be \n     used as purchasing standards for the Federal Employees Health \n     Benefits Program.\n                                  ____\n\n\nFact Sheet: The Need for the Voluntary Error Reduction and Improvement \n                    of Patient Safety Act (VERIPSA)\n\n       In December, 1999, the Institute of Medicine issued a \n     report, To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health Care System, \n     that documents the compelling need for national action to \n     reduce errors and improve patient safety:\n       Between 44,000 and 98,000 patients die each year as a \n     result of medical errors, making medical errors the eighth \n     leading cause of death.\n       Errors in the health care system result in more deaths each \n     year than highway accidents, breast cancer or AIDS. Errors \n     that seriously injure or otherwise harm patients are even \n     more prevalent.\n       In 1993, medication errors alone are estimated to have \n     accounted for 7,000 deaths. Two percent of patients admitted \n     to hospitals experience an adverse event caused by medication \n     errors, resulting in $2 billion in\n\n[[Page S5270]]\n\n     national spending for additional hospital costs related to \n     preventable medication errors for inpatients.\n       Total annual national costs (e.g., health care, lost wages/\n     productivity, disability) resulting from medical errors are \n     estimated to be between $38 and $50 billion, including $17-29 \n     billion for preventable events.\n\n\n          VERIPSA Can Save Lives and Reduce Health Care Costs\n\n       The report found that most medical errors are the result of \n     flaws in the health care system, rather than carelessness by \n     health professionals, including, for example, errors that \n     arise from misreading a physician's handwritten prescription. \n     Many of these problems can be minimized through better \n     systems and computerization.\n       Over the last two decades, a systematic effort to reduce \n     deaths from errors in administering anesthesia has resulted \n     in a decline from two deaths per 10,000 patients in the early \n     1980s to one death per 300,000 patients today.\n       One study found that 60 percent of preventable adverse drug \n     events could be avoided by physician computer-entry order \n     systems.\n       The experience on other industries has shown the \n     effectiveness of concerted efforts to reduce errors. Since \n     1976, the death rate from airline accidents has declined \n     400%. Since the creation of the Occupational Safey and Health \n     Administration in 1970, the workplace death rate has been cut \n     in half.\n       The Institute of Medicine report concludes that a reduction \n     in medical errors of 50% over the next five years is \n     achievable and should be a minimum target for national \n     action.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   American Health\n\n\n                                          Quality Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2000.\n\nStatement on the ``Voluntary Error Reduction and Improvement in Patient \n                              Safety Act''\n\n       The American Health Quality Association (AHQA) represents \n     the national network of Quality Improvement Organizations \n     (QIOs), which are known as the Peer Review Organizations \n     (PROs), for their Medicare quality improvement work. The QIOs \n     have vast clinical and analytic expertise, work daily with \n     providers across the country, and know how to affect systemic \n     change and bring about measurable improvement in care. They \n     are experts at translating the literature and research \n     regarding best practices from ``bookshelf to bedside'' and \n     teaching providers how to perform ongoing measurement of \n     their progress.\n       Senator Kennedy and Senator Dodd have done a commendable \n     job of addressing all of the various aspects of what is \n     necessary for a national system for improving patient safety. \n     In their ``Voluntary Error Reduction and Improvement in \n     Patient Safety Act,'' they direct AHRQ to establish a Center \n     for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety to conduct \n     research of medical errors and disseminate information on the \n     best practices for reducing them. The bill also proposes two \n     reporting systems that are voluntary, non-punitive, and \n     confidential. One system asks providers to report adverse \n     events and close calls to AHRQ using uniformed standards and \n     forms. The other asks providers to agree to monitor specific \n     types of adverse events as directed by AHRQ.\n       AHQA is pleased that AHRQ is given the authority to \n     contract with experts in the field to work with health care \n     providers and practitioners to identify adverse events and \n     determine what systemic changes are necessary to prevent them \n     for recurring. AHQA's goal in the patient safety debate is to \n     make sure that true quality improvement is achieved. We do \n     not support error reporting for the sake of reporting. \n     Organizations, such as the QIOs, should be encouraged to work \n     side by side with providers and practitioners to improve \n     their health care delivery systems.\n       ``The Voluntary Error Reduction and Improvement in Patient \n     Safety Act'' then goes beyond reporting and research by \n     directing the Secretary of HHS to take the best practices \n     disseminated by AHRQ and apply them, as may be appropriate, \n     to programs under the Secretary's authority. The bill \n     specifically directs the Secretary to enter into agreements \n     with the QIOs (through their PRO work) to provide, upon \n     request, technical assistance regarding best practices and \n     root-cause analysis to health care providers participating in \n     HHS funded health programs.\n       AHQA believes it is the appropriate next step to regime HHS \n     to apply the most up-to-date methods for assuring patient \n     safety to its health care programs. The QIOs stand ready to \n     assist the Director of AHRQ and the Secretary of HHS in their \n     efforts to help the medical community find the root cause of \n     adverse events that are occurring and help develop strategies \n     for preventing them in the future.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Massachusetts Hospital Association,\n\n                                    Burlington, MA, June 15, 2000.\n     Hon.

Among \n     its scientists are human factors researchers whose work is \n     devoted to understanding and reducing the adverse effects of \n     medical errors. I write to endorse the ``Voluntary Error \n     Reduction and Improvement in Patient Safety Act.''\n       This bill recognizes that human error in healthcare \n     settings has reached epidemic proportions and will provide an \n     infrastructure for centralized error reporting systems. \n     Important provisions of the bill will allow healthcare \n     providers to learn from such reporting systems by creating \n     interdisciplinary partnerships to conduct root cause analyses \n     across a wide range of health care settings.\n       Such analyses will help detect error trends and inform new \n     lines of directed inquiry and hypothesis-driven research to \n     reduce errors. The bill highlights the pivotal role of human \n     factors research in understanding human error in any context \n     and would draw upon the success of human factors as it has \n     been applied in many other industries such as aviation, \n     maritime shipping, and nuclear power to improve safety.\n       As in these other industries, particularly as evidenced in \n     aviation, the real value of error reporting lies in the \n     development of useful applications of the reported data to \n     improve safety. The ``Voluntary Error Reduction and \n     Improvement in Patient Safety Act'' clearly lays out the \n     infrastructure to promote the development of evidence-based \n     interventions to improve safety. Further, unique features of \n     this learning system include basic behavioral principles of \n     positive reinforcement to stimulate voluntary reporting. Such \n     a positive feedback loop will surely strengthen the quality \n     of the database this bill will structure. The database will \n     form the foundation for a bold new way of thinking about \n     patient safety. The data and the research, in turn, will make \n     attainable the goal we all strive for, the dramatic reduction \n     of adverse events in health care settings.\n       We believe the Kennedy-Dodd bill is a very strong plan for \n     reducing adverse events due to medical error. We also find \n     much to praise in the Jeffords bill. So we take the unusual \n     step of endorsing both and encourage work to meld the unique \n     features of these two extraordinary bills into a coherent \n     whole that will then surely receive the overwhelming support \n     of the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Johnson,\n                                       Executive Director.\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague, the distinguished chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee (HELP), Senator Jeffords, in introducing today a \ncritical piece of legislation that will take needed steps to improve \nthe quality of health care delivered in this country. The goal of our \nlegislation today is to improve patient safety by reducing medical \nerrors throughout the health care system.\n  The Institute of Medicine Report (IOM), released last November, \nsparked a national debate about how safe our hospitals and health care \nsettings actually are for patients. The scope of the problem identified \nin the findings were shocking. The IOM found that each year an \nestimated 44,000 to 98,000 hospital deaths occur as a result of \npreventable adverse events. This makes medical errors the 8th leading \ncause of death, with more deaths than vehicle accidents, breast cancer \nor AIDS. These errors cost our Nation $37.6 billion to $50 billion per \nyear, representing 4 percent of national health expenditures.\n  Despite the recent IOM findings, this is not a new debate. Many \nexperts have told us that the health care industry is a decade or more \nbehind in utilizing new technologies to reduce medical errors. Just \nlast year, the HELP Committee took initial steps last year to reduce \nmedical errors through the reauthorization of the Agency for Healthcare \nResearch and Quality (AHRQ), revitalizing this agency as the\n\n[[Page S5271]]\n\nfederal agency focused on improving the quality of health care in this \ncountry. Part of the core mission of AHRQ is to further our \nunderstanding of the causes of medical errors and the best strategies \nwe can employ to reduce these errors. The legislation authorized the \nDirector of AHRQ to conduct and support research; to build private-\npublic partnerships to identify the causes of preventable health care \nerrors and patient injury in health care delivery; to develop, \ndemonstrate, and evaluate strategies for reducing errors and improving \npatient safety; and to disseminate such effective strategies throughout \nthe health care industry.\n  The legislation we introduce today builds upon the further \nrecommendations of the IOM report and reflects the culmination of \ntestimony received throughout the past several months in a series of \nhearings held by the HELP Committee.\n  The central goal of this legislation is quality improvement \nthroughout the health care system. We heard over and over throughout \nour hearings that we need to develop our knowledge base about the best \nmechanisms to reduce medical errors. This can only be achieved if we \nbuild a system where errors can be reported and understood to improve \ncare, not to punish individuals. We need to create a ``culture of \nsafety'' in which errors can be reported, and analyzed, and then change \ncan be implemented.\n  I will not go into the details of this legislation, which Senator \nJeffords has already outlined, I would simply outline the three main \ngoals of this legislation, the creation of a national center for \nquality improvement and patient safety at the AHRQ, the creation of a \nvoluntary reporting system to collect and analyze medical errors, and \nthe establishment of strong confidentiality provisions for the \ninformation submitted under quality improvement and medical error \nreporting systems.\n  I am very supportive of the goals of this legislation and will \ncontinue to examine the best ways to reduce medical errors in our \nhealth care system. It is essential that we pass medical errors \nlegislation this year. We will continue to seek input from patients and \nprovider groups as we work to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy in \nsponsoring the ``Error Reduction and Improvement in Patient Safety \nAct,'' legislation which will establish a national system to identify, \ntrack and prevent medical errors.\n  Last November, the Institute of Medicine reported that between 44,000 \nand 98,000 deaths per year are attributable to medical errors, ranging \nfrom illegible prescriptions to amputations of the wrong limb. In other \nwords, patients are being harmed not because of a failure of science or \nmedical knowledge, but because of the inability of our health care \nsystem to mitigate common human mistakes.\n  Most Americans feel confident that the health care they receive will \nmake them better--or at the very least, not make them feel worse. And \nin the vast majority of circumstances, that confidence is deserved. The \ndedication, knowledge and training of our doctors, nurses, surgeons and \npharmacists in this country are unparalleled. But, as the IOM report \nstarkly notes, the quality of our health care system is showing some \ncracks. If we are to maintain public confidence, we must respond \nquickly and thoroughly to this crisis.\n  One thing is certain: the paradigm of individual blame that we've \nbeen operating under discourages providers from reporting mistakes--and \nthwarts efforts to learn from those mistakes. We have to move beyond \nfinger-pointing and encourage the reporting and analysis of medical \nerrors if we want to make real progress towards improving patient \nsafety.\n  This legislation will do just that. It authorizes the creation of a \nnational Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety to set and \ntrack national patient safety goals and conduct and fund safety \nresearch. The bill also sets up national non-punitive, voluntary, and \nconfidential reporting systems for medical errors. By analyzing and \nlearning from mistakes, we will be better able to determine what \nsystems and procedures are most effective in preventing errors in the \nfuture.\n  Identification and analysis of errors is critical to improving the \nquality of health care. But we must also develop measures of \naccountability that ensure that the information that is generated by a \nnational error reporting system is actually used to improve patient \nsafety. Our bill takes those practices shown to be most effective in \npreventing errors and creates a mechanism for integrating those \npractices into federally-funded health care programs. These evidence-\nbased ``best practices'' will also be used as standards for health care \norganizations seeking to participate in the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program.\n  Mr. President, the ``Error Reduction and Improvement in Patient \nSafety Act'' addresses the complex problem of medical errors in the \nmost comprehensive manner possible--from the identification of errors, \nto the analysis of the errors, to the application of best practices to \nprevent those errors from ever occurring again. Simply put, this \nlegislation will save lives. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact this legislation expeditiously, because frankly, \none medical error is one too many.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 2744.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the concerns of \nMissouri farmers and ranchers about concentration in the agriculture \nsector and about individual farmers' ability to compete and to get fair \nprices for their commodities.\n  Missouri is a ``farm state'', so ensuring fair competition in markets \nis an important issue to me. The state of Missouri is ranked second in \nthe list of states with the most number of farms--only Texas has more. \nMissouri's varying topography and climate makes for a very \nagriculturally diverse state. Farmers and ranchers produce over 40 \ncommodities, 22 of which are ranked in the top ten among the states. \nMissouri is a leader in such crops as beef, soybeans, hay, and rice, as \nwell as watermelon and concord grapes. Having diversity and the ability \nto change has allowed Missouri farmers to maintain their livelihood for \ngenerations. More than 88 percent of the farms in Missouri are family \nor individually owned, and 8 percent are partnerships. It is easy to \nsee that Missouri is a state that values small and family farms--which \nare the bedrock of Missouri's rural communities.\n  As I have traveled around Missouri--visiting every county in the \nstate--Missouri farmers and ranchers have repeatedly told me that \nincreasing concentration of the processing and packing industry has \nresulted--and will continue to result--in a less competitive market \nenvironment and lower prices for producers.\n  I have been responding to these concerns, and I am taking further \naction today. Last year, I asked the Department of Justice to create a \nhigh-level post within the Antitrust Division to specialize in \nagriculture-related mergers and transactions. The Administration \nresponded by appointing a representative for agriculture in the \nDepartment of Justice. This appointment is a step in the right \ndirection, but producers still have multiple concerns that need to be \naddressed.\n  Today, I am introducing three bills to address Missouri and American \nfarmers' concerns about agriculture concentration and market \ncompetition. In addition to listening to Missouri farmers on this \nissue, I have reviewed a resolution that was considered in the Missouri \nState Legislature about competition in the agricultural economy.\n  The Ninetieth General Assembly of Missouri called upon the 106th \nCongress to take an initiative on federal\n\n[[Page S5272]]\n\nlaw governing agriculture concentration. Missouri State Concurrent \nResolution 27 (S. Con. Res. 27) is a bipartisan resolution outlining \nwhat the Missouri legislature recommends the federal government should \ndo to address the issue of concentration. The resolution passed the \nMissouri State Senate and was reported out of the House Agriculture \nCommittee to the full House. In drafting the package of bills I am \nintroducing today, I studied the recommendations and objectives in \nState Senator Maxwell's Missouri resolution as well as including \nimportant provisions of my own.\n  Mr. President, the bill I'm introducing today--the Fair Play of \nFamily Farms Act--does the following things:\n  First, this legislation adds ``sunshine'' to the merger process. It \nwill give the Department of Agriculture more authority when it comes to \nmergers and acquisitions. This will heighten USDA's role in review of \nall proposed agriculture mergers so that the impact on farmers will be \ngiven more consideration, and will make these reviews public. The \npublic will be given an opportunity to comment on the proposed merger, \nand the USDA will be required to do an impact analysis on producers on \na regional basis. I want to ensure that if two agri-businesses merge, \nthe impact on farmers are completely evaluated.\n\n  Second, my bill creates a permanent position for an Assistant \nAttorney General for Agricultural Competition. This position will not \nsimply be appointed by the President or by the Attorney General, but \nthe position will require Senate review and confirmation. Also, my bill \nprovides additional staffing for this new position.\n  In addition, this bill provides additional funds and requires the \nGrain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard Administration (GIPSA) to hire \nmore litigation attorneys, economists, and investigators to enforce the \nPackers and Stockyard Act. An important element of this provision is \nthat it requires GIPSA to put more investigators out ``in the field'' \nfor oversight and investigations. I want to make sure that there are \nnot just more attorneys and economists in Washington, D.C., but that \nthere are more people out doing investigations and oversight.\n  Because there has been some concerns that the Packers and Stockyards \nAct does not cover the entire poultry industry, this legislation also \nrequires an analysis of why the poultry industry is not covered, and \nrequires GAO to offer suggestions for how the disparity between poultry \nand livestock can be remedied.\n  This bill addresses another problem I was informed about when I was \nout visiting Missouri farmers--and that is the issue of confidentiality \nclauses in contracts signed by farmers. Several farmers were concerned \nabout confidentiality clauses in the contracts with agri-business that \nthey were told make it illegal for farmers to share the contract with \nothers, even their lawyers and bankers. I want to ensure that farmers \nare able to get the legal and financial advice they need, so this bill \nensures that such confidentiality clauses do not apply to farmers' \ncontacts with their lawyers or bankers.\n  The bill also creates a statutory trust for the protection of \nranchers who sell on a cash basis to livestock dealers. Right now, if \nranchers deliver their cattle to a dealer and then the dealer goes \nbankrupt, the rancher is not protected. My bill would set up a trust \nfor the rancher, so that if the dealer goes bankrupt, the rancher would \nbe at the front of the line to get paid. There are similar trusts \nalready set up for when a rancher sells livestock to a packer, and this \nlegislation extends the same protections to ranchers when they sell \ntheir livestock to dealers.\n  One of the recommendations from the Missouri legislature that I \nincluded in the bill allows GIPSA to seek reparations for producers \nwhen a packer is found to be engaged in predatory or unfair practices. \nThis section specifies that when money is collected from those that are \ndamaging producers, the money should go to the farmers, not to the \nfederal government.\n  This bill will lead to a more fair playing field for Missouri farmers \nand ranchers. It address concerns of Missourians that I have visited \nwith and incorporates the outline of the Missouri State Resolution.\n  Finally, I am pleased to be the Senate sponsor of two bills that have \nalready been introduced in the other Chamber by the distinguished \nRepresentative from Missouri, Congressman Jim Talent. I would like to \ncommend Congressman Talent for the work he has done to help the \nMissouri agriculture community. Representative Talent's bills on value \nadded agriculture are a positive step for Missouri and U.S. producers. \nTherefore, I would like to introduce these two bills in the Senate to \n``help put farmers back in the driver's seat.''\n  The Value-Added Development Act for American Agriculture provides \ntechnical assistance for producers to start value-added ventures. This \nbill helps family farmers compete by giving farmers the opportunity to \ntake a greater share of the profit from the processing industry. The \nlegislation will provide technical assistance to producers for value-\nadded ventures, including engineering, legal services, applied \nresearch, scale production, business planning, marketing, and market \ndevelopment.\n  The funds would be provided to farmers through grants requests, which \nwill be evaluated on the State level. It has long been my opinion that \nfarmers know how best to farm their land, meet market demands, and make \na profit. If the ideas of farmers are cultivated on a local and state \nlevel, farmers will likely have more flexibility to make wise decisions \nfor markets in their home states and regions.\n  States would have the opportunity to apply for $10 million grants to \nstart up an Agriculture Innovation Center. The state boards will \nconsist of the State Department of Agriculture, the largest two general \nfarm organizations, and the four highest grossing commodity groups. The \nAgriculture Innovation Center will then use the funds to help farmers \nfinance the start-up of value added ventures.\n  Once it is determined that the farmers' ideas for a value added \nventure could be beneficial, the State Agriculture Innovation Center \ncan give the farmers assistance with plans, engineering, and design. \nWhen the farmer is actually ready to begin implementation of the value \nadded project, the third bill I am introducing will help out.\n  The Farmers' Value-Added Agricultural Investment Tax Credit Act would \ncreate a tax credit for farmers who invest in producer owned value-\nadded endeavors--even ventures that are not farmer-owned co-ops. This \nwould provide a 50% tax credit for the producers of up to $30,000 per \nyear, for six years.\n  The three bills I am introducing today are important to the \ncontinuation of the American farmer over the next century. I know that \nthese bills will benefit the producers of Missouri, and in turn benefit \nall of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/15/senate-section/article/S5272-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5272-S5274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 514\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cochran, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. L.

Con. Res. 123\n\n       Whereas almost all of the large printing plants, publishing \n     houses, and newspaper distribution companies, several leading \n     news agencies, and almost all of the nationwide television \n     frequencies and broadcasting facilities in the Russian \n     Federation remain under government control, despite the \n     extensive privatization of state-owned enterprises in other \n     sectors of the Russian economy;\n       Whereas the ``Press Freedom Survey 2000'' reported by \n     ``Freedom House'' of Washington, DC, stated that the \n     approximately 2,500 regional and rural newspapers in Russia \n     outside of Moscow are almost completely owned by local or \n     provincial governments;\n       Whereas the Government of Russia is able to suspend or \n     revoke broadcast and publishing licenses and apply exorbitant \n     taxes and fees on the independent media;\n       Whereas, in 1999, a major television network controlled by \n     the Russian Government canceled the program ``Top Secret'' \n     after it reported on alleged corruption at high levels of the \n     government;\n       Whereas, in July 1999, the Government of Russia created a \n     new Ministry for Press, Television and Radio Broadcasting, \n     and Mass Communications;\n       Whereas, in August 1999, the editors of fourteen of \n     Russia's leading news publications sent an open letter to \n     then Russian President Boris Yeltsin stating that high-\n     ranking officials of the government were putting pressure on \n     the mass media, particularly through unwarranted raids by tax \n     police;\n       Whereas Mikhail Lesin, Minister for Press, Television and \n     Radio Broadcasting, and Mass Communications, stated in \n     October 1999 that the Russian Government would change its \n     policies towards the mass media so as to address \n     ``aggression'' by the Russian press;\n       Whereas the Russian Federal Security Service or ``FSB'' is \n     reportedly implementing a technical regulation known as \n     ``SORM-2'' by which it could reroute, in real time, all \n     electronic transmissions over the Internet through FSB \n     offices for purposes of surveillance, a likely violation of \n     the Russian constitution's provisions concerning the right to \n     privacy of private communications, according to Aleksei \n     Simonov, President of the Russian ``Glasnost Defense \n     Foundation,'' a nongovernmental human rights organization;\n       Whereas such surveillance under SORM-2 would allow the \n     Russian Federal Security Service access to passwords, \n     financial transactions, and confidential company information, \n     among other transmissions;\n       Whereas it is reported that over one hundred Russian \n     journalists have been killed over the past decade, with few \n     if any of the government investigations into those murders \n     resulting in arrests, prosecutions, or convictions;\n       Whereas numerous observers of Russian politics have noted \n     the blatant misuse of the leading Russian television \n     channels, controlled by the Russian Government, to undermine \n     popular support for political rivals of those supporting the \n     government in the run-up to parliamentary elections held in \n     December 1999;\n       Whereas it has been reported that Russian television \n     stations controlled by the Russian Government were used to \n     disparage opponents of Vladimir Putin during the campaign for \n     the presidency in the beginning of this year, and whereas it \n     has been reported that political advertisements by those \n     candidates were routinely relegated by those stations to \n     slots outside of prime time coverage;\n       Whereas manipulation of the media by the Russian Government \n     appeared intent on portraying the Russian military attack on \n     the separatist Republic of Chechnya to the maximum political \n     advantage of the Russian Government;\n       Whereas in December 1999 two correspondents for ``Reuters \n     News Agency'' and the ``Associated Press'' were reportedly \n     accused of being foreign spies after reporting high Russian \n     casualty figures in the war in Chechnya;\n       Whereas the arrest in January 2000, subsequent treatment by \n     the Russian military, and prosecution by the Russian \n     Government of Andrei Babitsky, a correspondent for Radio Free \n     Europe/Radio Liberty covering the war in Chechnya, have \n     constituted a violation of commitments made by the Russian \n     Government to foster freedom of speech and of the press, and \n     have reportedly constituted a violation of the Criminal Code \n     of the Russian Federation;\n       Whereas in January 2000 Aleksandr Khinshtein, a reporter \n     for the newspaper ``Moskovsky Komosomlets'', was ordered by \n     the Russian Federal Security Service to enter a clinic over \n     100 miles from his home for a psychiatric examination after \n     he accused top Russian officials of illegal activities, and \n     such detainment in psychiatric wards was previously employed \n     by the former Soviet regime to stifle dissent;\n       Whereas the Russian newspaper ``Novaya Gazeta'' was \n     officially warned by the Russian Ministry of the Press for \n     its printing of an interview with Aslan Maskhadov, the \n     elected President of the Republic of Chechnya; an entire \n     issue of ``Novaya Gazeta'', including several articles \n     alleging massive campaign finance violations by the \n     presidential campaign of Vladimir Putin, was lost to \n     unidentified computer ``hackers''; and a journalist for \n     ``Novaya Gazeta'' was savagely beaten in May of this year;\n       Whereas President Thomas Dine of Radio Free Europe/Radio \n     Liberty on March 14th, 2000, condemned the Russian \n     Government's expanding efforts to intimidate the mass media, \n     stating that those actions threaten the chances for democracy \n     and rule of law in Russia;\n       Whereas ``NTV'', the only national independent television \n     station, which reaches half of Russia and is credited with \n     professional and balanced news programs, has frequently \n     broadcast news stories critical of Russian Government \n     policies;\n       Whereas on May 11, 2000, masked officers of the Russian \n     Federal Security Service carrying assault weapons raided the \n     offices of ``Media-Most'', the corporate owner of NTV and \n     other independent media;\n       Whereas the May 11th raid on Media-Most represented a \n     failure of recourse to normal\n\n[[Page S5275]]\n\n     legal mechanisms and conveyed the appearance of a \n     politically-motivated attack on Russian independent media;\n       Whereas the raid on Media-Most was carried out under the \n     authority of President Putin and Russian Government ministers \n     who have not criticized or repudiated that action;\n       Whereas on June 12, 2000, Vladimir Gusinsky, owner of NTV \n     and other leading independent media was suddenly arrested;\n       Whereas President Putin claimed not to have known of the \n     planned arrest of Vladimir Gusinsky;\n       Whereas the continued functioning of an independent media \n     is a vital attribute of Russian democracy and an important \n     obstacle to the return of authoritarian or totalitarian \n     dictatorship in Russia; and\n       Whereas a free news media can exist only in an environment \n     that is free of state control of the news media, that is free \n     of any form of state censorship or official coercion of any \n     kind, and that is protected and guaranteed by the rule of \n     law: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n       (1) expresses its continuing, strong support for freedom of \n     speech and the independent media in the Russian Federation;\n       (2) expresses its strong concern over the failure of the \n     government of the Russian Federation to privatize major \n     segments of the Russian media, thus retaining the ability of \n     Russian officials to manipulate the media for political or \n     corrupt ends;\n       (3) expresses its strong concern over the pattern of \n     Russian officials' surveillance and physical, economic, \n     legal, and political intimidation of Russian citizens and of \n     the Russian media that has now become apparent in Russia;\n       (4) expresses its strong concern over the pattern of \n     manipulation of the Russian media by Russian Government \n     officials for political and possibly corrupt purposes that \n     has now become apparent;\n       (5) expresses profound regret and dismay at the detention \n     and continued prosecution of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty \n     journalist Andrei Babitsky and condemns those breaches of \n     Russian legal procedure and of Russian Government commitments \n     to the rights of Russian citizens that have reportedly \n     occurred in his detention and prosecution;\n       (6) expresses strong concern over the breaches of Russian \n     legal procedure that have reportedly occurred in the course \n     of the May 11th raid by the Russian Federal Security Service \n     on Media-Most and the June 12th arrest of Vladimir Gusinsky; \n     and\n       (7) calls on the President of the United States to express \n     to the President of the Russian Federation his strong concern \n     for freedom of speech and the independent media in the \n     Russian Federation and to emphasize the concern of the United \n     States that official pressures against the independent media \n     and the political manipulation of the state-owned media in \n     Russia are incompatible with democratic norms.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRANSMITTAL TO SECRETARY OF STATE.\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this \n     concurrent resolution to the Secretary of State with the \n     request that it be forwarded to the President of the Russian \n     Federation.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \non an important human rights issue in the Russian Federation: freedom \nof the press. This resolution was introduced in the House yesterday by \nCongressmen Gilman and Lantos and Helsinki Commission Chairman Chris \nSmith, who share my concern for human rights around the globe.\n  This resolution expresses the concern of the Congress over the \ntreatment of the Russian media by the government of Russia. This \ntreatment has included increased intimidation, manipulation, and scare \ntactics. Most recently, Vladimir Gusinsky, owner of the principal \nindependent television station in Russia, was arrested and the offices \nof Media Most were searched without due process.\n  The media in Russia, even today, is still mostly state-owned. Of the \nlarge printing and publishing houses, newspaper distribution companies, \nnationwide television frequencies, and the broadcasting facilities that \nhave been privatized at all, the government still maintains an interest \nand some measure of control over many of them. Such control has \nreportedly been used for political ends in recent parliamentary and \npresidential elections in Russia.\n  It is imperative for the future of democracy in Russia to maintain a \nfree and independent media. A free press is essential to achieving \nstability in Russia and a government that is accountable to the rule of \nlaw. Such manipulation and intimidation tactics that have been employed \nby the Russian Government in recent weeks contradict the democratic \nvalues that we hope Russia will embrace.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this \nresolution to express our support for press freedom in Russia and our \nconcern over its infringement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/15/senate-section/article/S5275-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5275-S5279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        WYDEN AMENDMENT NO. 3433\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. WYDEN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (H.R. 4475) making appropriations for the Department of \nTransportation and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2001, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 45, line 23, before the period at the end insert \n     the following: ``: Provided, That the funds made available \n     under this heading shall be used by the Inspector General (1) \n     to continue to review airline customer service practices with \n     respect to providing consumers access to the lowest available \n     airfare, information regarding overbooking, and all other \n     matters with respect to which airlines have entered into \n     voluntary customer service commitments; (2) to undertake an \n     inquiry into whether mergers in the airline industry have \n     caused or may cause customer service to deteriorate and \n     whether legislation should be enacted to require that \n     customer service be a factor in the merger review process for \n     airlines; (3) to review the reasons for increases in flight \n     delays, with specific reference to whether infrastructure \n     issues or procedures utilized by the airline industry and the \n     Federal Aviation Administration are contributing to the \n     delays; (4) to review the airline ticket distribution system, \n     and changes in the system, including the proposed Internet \n     joint venture known as ``Orbitz'' and the impact such changes \n     may have on airline competition and consumers; (5) to review \n     whether ``Orbitz'' would be, or should be, subject to \n     Department of Transportation regulations on airline ticket \n     computer reservation systems; and (6) to report findings and \n     recommendations for reform resulting from these reviews and \n     inquiries to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science and Transportation of the Senate, and the Committee \n     on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of \n     Representatives by December 31, 2000, and again thereafter \n     when the Inspector General determines it appropriate to \n     reflect the emergence of significant additional findings and \n     recommendations''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               VOINOVICH (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3434\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Roth, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \nLautenberg, and Mr. Jeffords) proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. \n4475, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3____.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 saved \n     approximately 3,800 lives in providing the essential service \n     of maritime safety.\n       (2) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 prevented 111,689 \n     pounds of cocaine and 28,872 pounds of marijuana from \n     entering the United States in providing the essential service \n     of maritime security.\n       (3) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 boarded more than \n     14,000 fishing vessels to check for compliance with safety \n     and environmental laws in providing the essential service of \n     the protection of natural resources.\n       (4) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 ensured the safe \n     passage of nearly 1,000,000 commercial vessel transits \n     through congested harbors with vessel traffic services in \n     providing the essential service of maritime mobility.\n       (5) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 sent \n     international training teams to help more than 50 countries \n     develop their maritime services in providing the essential \n     service national defense.\n       (6) Each year, the United States Coast Guard ensures the \n     safe passage of more than 200,000,000 tons of cargo cross the \n     Great Lakes including iron ore, coal, and limestone. Shipping \n     on the Great Lakes faces a unique challenge because the \n     shipping season begins and ends in ice anywhere from 3 to 15 \n     feet thick. The ice-breaking vessel MACKINAW has allowed \n     commerce to continue under these conditions. However, the \n     productive life of the MACKINAW is nearing an end. The Coast \n     Guard has committed to keeping the vessel in service until \n     2006 when a replacement vessel is projected to be in service, \n     but to meet that deadline, funds must be provided for the \n     Coast Guard in fiscal year 2001 to provide for the \n     procurement of a multipurpose-design heavy icebreaker.\n       (7) Without adequate funding, the United States Coast Guard \n     would have to radically reduce the level of service it \n     provides to the American public.\n       (8) The allocation to the Committee on Appropriations of \n     the Senate of funds available for the Department of \n     Transportation and related agencies for fiscal year 2001 was \n     $1,600,000,000 less than the allocation to the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives of funds \n     available for that purpose for that fiscal year. The lower \n     allocation compelled the Subcommittee on Transportation of \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate to impose \n     reductions on funds available for the Coast Guard, \n     particularly amounts available for acquisitions, that may not \n     have been imposed had a larger allocation been made. The \n     difference between the amount of funds requested by the Coast \n     Guard for the acquisition of the Great Lakes icebreaker and \n     buoy tender and the amount made available by the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate for those acquisitions fails to \n     reflect the high priority afforded by the Senate to those \n     acquisitions, which are of critical national importance to \n     commerce, navigation, and safety.\n       (9) Due to shortfalls in funds available for fiscal year \n     2000 and unexpected increases in fuel costs, the Commandant \n     of the Coast Guard has announced reductions in critical \n     operations of the Coast Guard by as much as 30 percent in \n     some areas of the United States. If left unaddressed, these \n     shortfalls may compromise the service provided by the Coast \n     Guard to the public in all areas, including drug interdiction \n     and migrant interdiction, aid to navigation, and fisheries \n     management.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the committee of conference on the bill H.R. 4425 of \n     the 106th Congress, making appropriations for military \n     construction, family housing, and base realignment and \n     closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2001, or any other appropriate committee \n     of conference of the second session of the 106th Congress, \n     should approve supplemental funding for the Coast Guard for \n     fiscal year 2000 as soon as is practicable; and\n       (2) upon adoption of this bill by the Senate, the conferees \n     of the Senate to the committee of conference on the bill H.R. \n     4475 of the 106th Congress, making appropriations for the \n     Department of Transportation and related agencies for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, should--\n       (A) recede from their disagreement to the proposal of the \n     conferees of the House of Representatives to the committee of \n     conference on the bill H.R. 4475 with respect to funding for \n     the Great Lakes icebreaker and buoy tender replacement \n     program;\n       (B) provide adequate funds for operations of the Coast \n     Guard in fiscal year 2001, including activities relating to \n     drug and migrant interdiction and fisheries enforcement; and\n       (C) provide sufficient funds for the Coast Guard in fiscal \n     year 2001 to correct the 30 percent reduction in funds for \n     operations of the Coast Guard in fiscal year 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                COLLINS (AND SCHUMER) AMENDMENT NO. 3439\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Abraham) proposed an \namendment to the bill, H.R. 4475, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING USE OF THE \n                   STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) since 1999, gasoline prices have risen from an average \n     of 99 cents per gallon to $1.63 per gallon (with prices \n     exceeding $2.00 per gallon in some areas), causing financial \n     hardship to Americans across the country;\n       (2) the Secretary of Energy has authority under existing \n     law to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through time \n     exchanges (``swaps''), by releasing oil from the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve in times of supply shortage in exchange for \n     the infusion of more oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     at a later date;\n       (3) the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n     (``OPEC'') has created a worldwide supply shortage by choking \n     off petroleum production through anticompetitive means;\n       (4) at its meetings beginning on March 27, 2000, OPEC \n     failed to increase petroleum production to a level sufficient \n     to rebuild depleted inventories; and\n       (5) the Secretary of Energy should implement a swap plan at \n     times, such as the present, when prices of fuel have risen \n     because of cutbacks in the production of crude oil.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that if the President determines that a release of oil from \n     the Strategic Petroleum Reserve under swapping arrangements \n     would not jeopardize national security, the Secretary of \n     Energy should, as soon as is practicable, use the authority \n     under existing law to release oil from the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve in an economically feasible way by means of \n     swapping arrangements providing for future increases in \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve reserves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    McCAIN AMENDMENT NOS. 3440-3441\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. McCAIN submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, H.R. 4475, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 3440\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 saved \n     approximately 3,800 lives in providing the essential service \n     of maritime safety.\n       (2) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 prevented 111,689 \n     pounds of cocaine and 28,872 pounds of marijuana from \n     entering the United States in providing the essential service \n     of maritime security.\n       (3) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 boarded more than \n     14,000 fishing vessels to check for compliance with safety \n     and environmental laws in providing the essential\n\n[[Page S5278]]\n\n     service of the protection of natural resources.\n       (4) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 ensured the safe \n     passage of nearly 1,000,000 commercial vessel transits \n     through congested harbors with vessel traffic services in \n     providing the essential service of maritime mobility.\n       (5) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 sent \n     international training teams to help more than 50 countries \n     develop their maritime services in providing the essential \n     service national defense.\n       (6) Each year, the United States Coast Guard ensures the \n     safe passage of more than 200,000,000 tons of cargo cross the \n     Great Lakes including iron ore, coal, and limestone. Shipping \n     on the Great Lakes faces a unique challenge because the \n     shipping season begins and ends in ice anywhere from 3 to 15 \n     feet thick. The ice-breaking vessel MACKINAW has allowed \n     commerce to continue under these conditions. However, the \n     productive life of the MACKINAW is nearing an end. The Coast \n     Guard has committed to keeping the vessel in service until \n     2006 when a replacement vessel is projected to be in service, \n     but to meet that deadline, funds must be provided for the \n     Coast Guard in fiscal year 2001 to provide for the \n     procurement of a multipurpose-design heavy icebreaker.\n       (7) Without adequate funding, the United States Coast Guard \n     would have to radically reduce the level of service it \n     provides to the American public.\n       (8) The allocation to the Committee on Appropriations of \n     the Senate of funds available for the Department of \n     Transportation and related agencies for fiscal year 2001 was \n     $1,600,000,000 less than the allocation to the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives of funds \n     available for that purpose for that fiscal year. The lower \n     allocation compelled the Subcommittee on Transportation of \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate to impose \n     reductions on funds available for the Coast Guard, \n     particularly amounts available for acquisitions, that may not \n     have been imposed had a larger allocation been made. The \n     difference between the amount of funds requested by the Coast \n     Guard for the acquisition of the Great Lakes icebreaker and \n     buoy tender and the amount made available by the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate for those acquisitions fails to \n     reflect the high priority afforded by the Senate to those \n     acquisitions, which are of critical national importance to \n     commerce, navigation, and safety.\n       (9) Due to shortfalls in funds available for fiscal year \n     2000 and unexpected increases in fuel costs, the Commandant \n     of the Coast Guard has announced reductions in critical \n     operations of the Coast Guard by as much as 30 percent in \n     some areas of the United States. If left unaddressed, these \n     shortfalls may compromise the service provided by the Coast \n     Guard to the public in all areas, including drug interdiction \n     and migrant interdiction, aid to navigation, and fisheries \n     management.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the committee of conference on the bill H.R. 4425 of \n     the 106th Congress, making appropriations for military \n     construction, family housing, and base realignment and \n     closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2001, or any other appropriate committee \n     of conference of the second session of the 106th Congress, \n     should approve supplemental funding for the Coast Guard for \n     fiscal year 2000 as soon as is practicable; and\n       (2) upon adoption of this bill by the Senate, the conferees \n     of the Senate to the committee of conference on the bill H.R. \n     4475 of the 106th Congress, making appropriations for the \n     Department of Transportation and related agencies for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, should--\n       (A) recede from their disagreement to the proposal of the \n     conferees of the House of Representatives to the committee of \n     conference on the bill H.R. 4475 with respect to funding for \n     the Great Lakes icebreaker and buoy tender replacement \n     program;\n       (B) provide adequate funds for operations of the Coast \n     Guard in fiscal year 2001, including activities relating to \n     drug and migrant interdiction and fisheries enforcement; and\n       (C) provide sufficient funds for the Coast Guard in fiscal \n     year 2001 to correct the 30 percent reduction in funds for \n     operations of the Coast Guard in fiscal year 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    LEVIN AMENDMENTS NOS. 3449-3450\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LEVIN submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, H.R. 4475, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 3449\n\n       On page 79 of the substituted original text, between lines \n     22 and 23, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____.
